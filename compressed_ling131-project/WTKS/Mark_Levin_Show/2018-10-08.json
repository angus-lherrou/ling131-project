I'm confused there was a kid who was the last conservative president Utah I I don't remember one of those George Bush Republican\nWell well ... listen I ... I I appreciate your opening and I promise I'll give you the chance to respond to try to be a jerk but\nI don't know if it's that you're a liberal and you don't or you aren't really reading on conservatism I Love George W. Bush I worked for the man I Would have literally given my life for him I was a secret service said I'm not being hyperbolic I mean that was my job he was a good and decent human being\nGeorge W. Bush was not exactly a conservative president okay the spending levels of the government spending was out of control we had Medicare part D I like George W. Bush there were some great things that happened the tax cuts package but I think\nInsisting he was a conservative president is a little bit of a stretch so let let me just stop you right he was more of a moderate Republican establishment type I think that's more fair analysis that's like saying that's like me coming out and say and do you\nHave Iraq Obama was a moderate he wasn't he wasn't moderate on any issue at all and I think you know that um so so go back to your your point is that the economy went south under George W Bush because of conservatism now\nLet me ask you a question if you don't mind\nWhat conservative ideal whether it be limited government limited government spending limited government intervention the economy caused that recession\nOne word deregulation\nOf how how exactly do you figure that when deregulation or the repeal of Glass Steagall happened under Bill Clinton\nThe bank where all deregulated ... Iraqi right 'cause I I ...\nI Know I'm right but but the reason I'm right to focus number one the deregulation you're mentioning happened under Bill Clinton number one and number two\nOh tell me the commercial banks that went under because liberal site this talking point often they said was deregulation and it was the splitting of investment banks from commercial banks so I always say to them okay well explained to me what commercial banks want under as a result of a recession\nNobody here will now all the problems with the stock market and the mortgage industry and allowing\nCall no no I I we can't get past the first meeting you have a back and forth you can't just bypass uncomfortable questions\nYou said that it was a conservative president that had the last recession I disputed that it was a Republican president now what I'm trying to suggest he was the recession was not caused by what you said it was caused by and I'd like you to with knowledge that the deregulation happened under Clinton that's just the fact\nThat well the last now in the coughing you are right was under Bill Clinton and how it happened for many years before that because what happens is when you have regulations right what\nHappens is the the ensuing administrations left and right who were bought and paid for by special interests over the decades years in\nDebt yeah but but the coral your point you're making isn't even true I'm asking you if the deregulation\nThat commercial back to the the scare some of the commercial and the midnight joining of the commercial investment banks was the cause of the recession than what commercial banks there should be some evidence that a number of commercial banks went under the answer is you you can't answer because there there there's no answer to it\nSo I listen I Can't go on it's all day because it's it's a wonky topic for the audience to that I'm just trying to make the point I appreciate your call though don't hang up and I I think you're a reasonable guy\nI just wish that whereas I can criticize some of the the policies by George W. Bush I thought were wrong I Wish you'd open your eyes to you can't just throw out something like oh deregulation that Bush was terrible and then not follow up at all and present any facts and data that's totally irresponsible that's not what happens\nIf you see what what happened is under Bush right at the very end of it a year in power when everything fell apart just prior to Obama being elected All right\nCarl listen I gotta run we're up against the break I'm Sorry but listen thanks for the call but sorry folks that's not what happened I could go on about this all day we we lost because we had we had a cheap\nMoney problem we had a bunch of GS these government sponsored enterprises in Fannie and Freddie that incentivize people to buy homes they simply could not afford that was the genesis of the housing crisis that ripple through the economy\nMaturity mismatch is it was it's a very simple problem to observe looking at it in retrospect and claiming it was a massive\nDeregulatory after that happened other Clinton therefore the Republicans caused a recession I'm Sorry\nIs just completely utterly absurd All right up there but you know when from work within

liberal see the world again I was never a liberal I'm up I was an independent most of my life but what really opened me up to conservatism was that they're saying a moment\n\nAnd then they say in a moment for me it was when I was a police officer in New York City\nAnd I saw how again I'm not suggesting every single time a cop access to you know there are a listener unfortunately are bad cop

policing and he is a word in that case\n\nBut when I was a cop and I was an independent you know again sometimes sometimes even kind of see it the liberal way from being surrounded all the time by Democrats\nI remember how some cops in use of force incidents who I Know did nothing wrong they acted according to how they were almost viciously and immediately attacked by the media activists out there without even giving them a fair shake\nI'm telling you that was my that in a moment\nWhy said something's wrong here this is this isn't right I mean if you can just attack someone a police officer without even hearing your story\nIn an unquestionably tragic incident that will use of force incidents are no one goes out in the street with the desire to get to use of force incidents sorry

learn from this chaos doesn't sell chaos creates a bunch of ... moments and that ain't us moments our parents and kids sit on their couches and look at the chaos on the TV and say to their kids that a U.S\nWe don't do that Johnny we don't attack people's cars like your store and Oregon today by antifa we don't do that\nChaos doesn't sell the Democrats are destroying whatever brand they have left because they are marrying themselves the chaos chaos doesn't sell chaos is for chops\nOr let me take a call here I miss this woman I haven't spoken to her in forever\nDonna in my old stomping grounds

right [laughter]\nOh man I Can't wait and I just want to say one of the big takeaway for me was you know I think a lot of people were not really\nAs aware of how dangerous the radical left has become and\nThe last went off so we got to see it in real time\nDonna I Love can I just stop you for it because I Love love love the point you just made you send me on Fox or a couple of times I shouldn't I made this point on Fox repeatedly that the gift of Donald Trump the greatest gift he's given us as conservative\nHas been his ability to make the left show their butts to everyone else you just nailed it you when I ... I've been talking to you for everyone I used to host than a male and I know who you are you are read into this program six different ways from Sunday\nDonald from Frederick ... am I right you always knew who the left was and we did too yeah but people who worked for a living up to talk radio content all day like what I Do not my job\nThey have jobs they don't have time to pay attention to people Donald Trump has out at these people\nThat is a great guy just tell you to one more thing as a great piece of the American thinker tape\nForgive me I Can't remember the author ... but it hits on your exact point and it's the Democrats and Kaiser so say and it makes the point that the greatest trick or the Democrats ever falls\nWas making people believe that the evil embedded in their radical left agenda didn't exist just like Kaiser says it's a great the sun I gotta run always great to talk to you sorry I got to take a break up there but you know from our something\n\nEvery time you go on line

three one two three a one one [noise] yes yes\nWelcome back to the market then show Dan bunch you know as the bonds you know on Twitter in for the great one so we're talking about the lessons learned from the cabinet when dropping the big at all on the left or you just had as a\nFormal swearing in ceremony although he's already been sworn in at the White House came into thunderous applause gosh winning feels good\nAnd I've been given you the lessons learned from this we're up to ...\nWell number are are lesson learned I should say keep say in rural less because I'm so used to say an old rules new rules that's kinda my thing for those you know me from my show\n[laughter] but this is lesson to learn a lesson learned number six\nDemocrats are now trashing you a judicial supremacy again had to Dan Horowitz has a great piece on this a conservative review today\nFolks this is not a bad thing\nNow all of a sudden the Democrats that they have lost their bid to take over the majority on the Supreme Court\nThey thought they'd have a six three majority where the president Hillary Clinton right now as a marine in quite work out\nThat way now than it is a five for conservative majority and the swing vote is now John Roberts rather than an Anthony\nKennedy who is a I Believe more reliable conservative vote I Hope in the future\nThe liberals are now attacking the courts now listen attacking an institution in the United states because you lost is not a good thing but her which makes a really good point here folks liberals for years have had a really hard time doing one thing\nThey can't seem to get a national mandate for any of their hard left proposals to pass through think about it\nNow I'm not saying they haven't had big wins they had they had the stimulus Obamacare let's not put her head in the sand to pretend that didn't happen but the big ticket items that liberals on abortion on demand\nA yeah a basic income Medicare for all these are big ticket big monstrous platinum and gold winning items for the liberals they have no national mandate for\nThey wanted a national mandate for gay marriage wherever you stand on it they couldn't get it states were knocking it down they were putting it on referendum they were losing\n\nLiberals as a backstop have always relied on the courts and legislators in black robes who pretend to be judges to pass those items why it's very simple when you think about it\nIt is a very simple mathematical equation do you want to have to convince a hundred million Americans in a presidential election to vote for your candidate along with your house of representative members and your Senate members or do you want to convince one or two judges and a black robe consider themselves swing voters to do it for\nYou the answer is obvious they have always relied on the courts because the ACC you're just get a\nBunch of liberals pretending to be judges on the court you choose to legislate from the bench and you don't have to do the hard work of knocking on doors getting elected and telling people why you think government controlling their health care when they can't even run the damn the Ovie at a DMV excuse me or whatever the deal for years they can't run that either\nThey convincing them that that's good\nFor them you can't there is no popular mandate for it so now that that avenue to the Supreme Court has been cut off for them\nThey're starting to now I Want you to screen shot all of their tweets when you're out there on Twitter them saying the Supreme Court it's not legitimate screen shot all\nOf this because there may unfortunately become a time when they take\nBack a majority on the Supreme Court and I want you to fire all those screen shots back\nAt them on Twitter hey look at this remember when you said judicial supremacy and the Supreme Court didn't matter\nNow it's not going to matter you're not going to change your mind these people don't stand for anything there's actual principles principles power they worship the golden calf of government that is what they do their national pastime is Jenny afflicting before the author of big government at whatever means they have to use the get there doesn't matter\nBut another lesson learned from this is if the Democrats are going to attack judicial supremacy we as Republicans should say is don't need to make this personal the courts do have a constitutional role but you know what labs you don't think the court should be deciding things [noise] [noise]\nYes welcome to the party piles Bruce Willis and die hard\nCubs fan PY obey\nBrain yet\nYou're welcome\nWe don't believe that either we believe\nIn a constitutional republic to do the hard work of legislating you have to elect representatives and a representative democracy that are going to go vote for our values the fact that you can't do that live sounds a whole lot like your\nProblem not ours we haven't had any problem getting tax cuts passed through because we believe in economic liberty fat a lot of problems slowing down the growth of government but we've had some victories not a lot but some and it's been hard work and people have to take votes\nYour binary choice is this a party of police state tyrants right now what Palmdale I'm Talking about the health Democrats I'm not talking about the rank and file voters out there I'm Talking about the hill Democrats you're talking about a bunch of police state pirates\nWho did this Spygate disaster who spied on the president who tried to take down cabinet or were trying to take your money take your business take your health care take your kids' education your choice right now is between that\nAnd Republicans who\nMay be sixty percent of the time it with you that choice to me is an obvious one but having said that\nYou find a good independent libertarian out there who we think can win hey man let's get behind them let's keep these people honest in a primary I have I wrote entire pieces about this who knows maybe there will be part time for a third party in the future if they don't get their act together I'm just saying gym the options here are between\nBad and absolutely cataclysmic ally constantly horrific with a Democrat [laughter] does that make sense and that's why it is so important for us to go out there\nAnd vote we cannot be other option is terrible it's like someone saint gave us a man I'm you're going to die in a heart attack of eighty years I'm going to cut your head off with a chainsaw right now you're going to die either way so what do you think the answer is obvious that Democrats are terrible they are awful\nThey did after what they pulled in Spygate non cabin on the answer\nHere as obvious\nAs high as we get there and you don't have to sell it to me you don't have to sell it to me one hundred percent\nI'm going to be out there anybody I speak so I'm going to be out out there with the ten minutes and that you stay on your podcast the problem is I don't think it's going to be out there to try and get the independent vote and turn some of the Democrats\nAnd one more thing to a gym 'cause I got to take a break ... ten ten ten folks who is you don't know what I mean email tend to your friends called ten of your friends Facebook and and tweet to tell your friends and make sure they get the heck out there and they vote that's the that's your job you have to go out and do that but Jim just remember this\nThe more Republicans we can get elected again I Know they're not the answer to all our problems but I Know our problem is the Democrats right\nIf the more we get elected we can afford to lose a few rhinos and still hold the conservative majority the problem with this slim lead we have now in the Senate is we have to collectively kiss kiss the butts of unreliable people\nAnd we can't do that in the Senate we have to be able to let a few rhinos go and still hold onto it considers\nA great call ... unfortunately going to take a break 'em run up against time but folks as important as a pivotal election get out and vote bring ten friends again it's not always a choice between good and bad sometimes it's a choice between ... and really bad and\nThis is one of those times get out and vote 'em they're bunch you know when for Marco then we'll be right back [noise] one\n...\nI've had my share mechanics calling me saying well they found
