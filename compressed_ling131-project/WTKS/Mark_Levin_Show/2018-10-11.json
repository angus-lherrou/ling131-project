national TV at a fundraiser instead George Bush hates black people no one said that he was not reading then\nThere wasn't a black Democrat in America when he said that that would have said this afterwards tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read I\nThink about that\nKanye West is what happens when negroes don't read I Would argue that is an incredibly racist statement I Would argue that's a perfect example of modern day slavery from bakari sellers\nNow in ... west says this after Hurricane Katrina listen to it\nThe most tragic loss of all George Bush doesn't care about black people\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people did you hear the car sellers say this is what happens when they grow don't read snow you didn't hear it you want to know why because that was okay to be said on the liberal plantation of owning African Americans like modern day slaves\nYou look at what modern day slavery is in this country what is it\nIt is a party that controls the thoughts and the minds of African Americans it is a party that demands that African Americans don't succeed but fail so they're dependent on their government aid and they keep them in those poverty at high poverty high crime failing schools\nAnd when you bring up that you want these kids to be out of failing schools what do they say\nThey say no\nBecause we've got employees that are black working in those schools and where unions teachers and you can't destroy public edge ... education I Would agree with that you can you've already done it impossible for me as a white Republican destroyed public education you guys have already taken care of that on the left\nI Would argue that the left doesn't mind that young African American kids are in failing schools\nBecause\nThat keeps them on their plantation that keeps them in modern day slavery and so what happened was as you have a\nI I I'm referring to the car sellers and what he said you're a negro who went from living on the plantation miss producer once you play that audio again this is Kanye West while living on the plantation talking about George Bush after Hurricane Katrina\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people\nHe said and I quote George Bush hates black people and everybody clapped\nEverybody said Kanye West is a great black man who's calling out an evil white president and it was okay to say that on that on that day because that was words that were okay to say on the\nDemocratic plantation than the ... comes out in ... and start singing for himself and starts realizing hey this this world I live in slavery is not very good\nI I'm seeing massive crime rates in my hometown of Chicago which apparently is moving back to I'm seeing poverty I'm seeing a kids that are getting a good education I'm seeing all of these things and he starts questioning the plantation owners which is the Democratic party he starts questioning the rich black guys\nWho are running the Democratic party who are telling them that no no no you need to stay in poverty because well take care of you there don't you don't need to think for yourself no no you can't even have an id to vote we're going to make sure you can vote without id because we don't even expect you to have an id outrageous has that mentality\nAnd then ... says you know what\nI'm going to be independent I ought to be independent thinker I'm going to come out and say that I like black unemployment rate in all the time what I like a president that wants to talk about creating jobs African American community instead of offering up welfare checks and food stamps\nAnd he does it and then\nThey reprimand this man who got off the Democratic plantation tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read\nHow is that not the most racist statement\n\nIs it not racist because the Democrat says it not racist because the black person said is it not racist because\nIt's supported by all Democrats\nThe same Democratic Party that says Donald Trump's treats or or or ... horrible\nThe same Democrats say that Donald Trump bullies people and it's terrible that same Democrats today they're sending out tweets about this being national coming out day for the gay and lesbian transgender bisexual community and we should love every one if you get off their plantation they'll say this to you\nTell you what is what happens when negroes don't read\nThere it is don't tell me that the Democratic party cares about black people\n\nDon't tell me that this isn't racism don't tell me that this is not slavery modern day slavery\nYou shut up you sit down in the back of our black bus and our block party in our Democratic Party and you're saying what we tell you to say and what you're going to say is George Bush hates black people and you're brilliant but if you ever get out of that lane\nIf you ever get off our plantation and try to make a name for yourself or have independent thoughts we will go out on national TV and we will bully you and we will tell people that you're mentally unfit\nYou're mentally insane you are mentally incompetent you've been to a hospital before for mental health issues clearly the white man's taking advantage of you all and by the way you're an ignorant black person\nIt this is this is the public shaming and the assault which is exactly what he's explain what explains so well\nI mean you you look at the last week you've had two celebrities that have gotten into politics right you had you had Taylor Swift who comes out for a Democrat and says she's terrified of Congress woman running for Senate\nIn Tennessee Marsha Blackburn and it terrifies her what would she what she would do if she got elected to the U.S Senate and Democrats came out and said this is a brave\nIndependent woman they threw down the woman card right this is what does that brave independent woman she's brave she's a role model every woman should've should've should look at her and teach your children and your little ... daughters and your and your grandkids to be like Taylor Swift because this is what a strong\nBrave role model of a woman looks like Ben Kanye West comes out for Donald Trump and now he's a token negro that doesn't read he's mentally ill he's an Uncle Tom\nTerrible and and and the things that these guys they shave out and it's it's really really I mean it's on believable lakes like they want to put in a they want to institutionalize the guy now right\nNow they they want to kidnap him and they want to bring it back to the to the plantation of the Democratic party and then lock him up in solitary confinement\nAnd their mental ward so they can control the black man because right now they can't control and then when they can't control a black man who's who's speaking truth to the

seven three eight one thirty eight eleven once you get to your phone calls on this one Madeline you are on the marquee event show ... hello\nAnd thank you so much and like you're doing an excellent job throwing in for mark thank you I appreciate that\nThank you um have two comments one I Want to let you know first of all that I suffer from depression and I had a suicide attempt the number of years ago I Am doing somewhat better but I'm a couple of years ago I realized that I was probably living a little bit ahead of my time and that society was dying in this direction as a whole\nUm even though I had depression I didn't have any kind of psychosis or thoughts disturbances but when I started winning and mental health housing and they spoke out\nAbout from the abuses that were going on\nAnd some ... you know quake nut rolls and what have you all of the sudden I seem to have like thoughts disturbances although no one could that explain to me what it was prior to that no one ever thought it had anything but you know mental illness from depression\nAnd then they made up story that I was violent and I got kicked out at two places even though some of the age of forty four years old I never had any kind of history of anything on a new homeless twice I've lived in my car but it's also suicide prevention month\nAnd I think by making it sound as though Congress has some kind of mental illness whether he guys left I think it's not even the issue because as you said they had nothing to say that about him the four of them spoke out about Bush\nAnd make it very difficult I think for young men in particular\nWas and it was that day was it yesterday if I'm not mistaken mental health awareness day\nIt's a whole month you know how it is unfortunately a lot of there's a month to everything now they must be honest you know but it's supposed to be\nHis technically we're just and just so people know that we were when we make it clear what it yesterday was world mental health day two thousand Eighteen\nWorld Health a world mental health day uh it's it's on October the tent that's the reason I say this is where's the compassion and and I say this first of all thank you for\nYour sharing your story and I'm I'm so thankful that you were unsuccessful in your attempt to take your wife or I ... my best friend in college um took his own life and it is something that sticks with a man in all of our close friend group ever since and I have great compassion for\nThose who suffer with mental health and it's something that we shouldn't make fun of but to to score political points with Kanye West as the left is doing saying you know we're clearly and again they say that the president's taking advantage of a man who clearly has mental health issues as a token\nA black man uh and and there and he's taking advantage abusing him by putting them out there today no one said any of that\nWhen Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was a narrative they wanted to be out there it was the narrative that they want it they they they were OK with that narrative Dan you are on the Marco venture open for some reason I go ahead\nStole my thunder but the uh uh President Bush hates black people man I was like I was all part of the hit that um they check this out so now Russia walkers going to be the next soaking negro because he says that Don Lemon ...\nUm I think it's horrible what is left these are doing but that's the whole ... thing let's talk about or colder Eric Holder\nNot only here my will first he's the
