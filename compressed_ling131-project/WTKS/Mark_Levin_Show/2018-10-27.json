associate themselves with these developers\nIt's just typical sleaze typical sleep and I watch this debate\nThe other night he couldn't have been more nasty couldn't have been a more outrageous Gillum and of course when you cues him\nOr even raise these issues with him which are quite clear he says you're bringing this stuff up because he's African American [noise]\n\nLook at John James in Michigan there's a stand up guy a combat veteran as successful small businessman running as a conservative to be senator from Michigan [noise] this man is a is a magnificent candidate [noise] Gillum is a disaster\nFor hurricanes brought down tones of trees but you know what else came out of the woodwork soldier crooks not knowing who to trust has become a lot more difficult\nWe'll look no further than southern treat experts license and bought it their local you can always count on a great price on the job done right so the tree expert special as an old residential and commercial tree removal and mostly commercial southern pretty expert or equipped to take on the largest the most complex trees with over Twenty years experience no job too big for southern pretty expert\nThere was no federal government there was no national government when the declaration of independence was adopted\n\nUnalienable rights natural rights aggressive as them reject saw this he knows that he's ... he knows where Woodrow Wilson stood and Franklin Roosevelt stood he knows all about John ...\nAnd Henry crawly and all the rest that I've written about at some length\nHe knows mark swelling angles well and Hagel well\nAnd he knows that in order to create this utopia which is really hell on earth you have to destroy these institutions\nYou have to destroy the institutions on the island about rights has nothing to do with the progressive agenda pro union anti union minimum wage no minimum wage health care no health has nothing to do with that\nIt is a recognition that we are human beings that we're individuals and we have the right to be free\n\nAnd we're supposed to be treated equally under the law nothing to do with economic outcomes are minimum wage or the laundry list of or the left wing agenda\nAnd Obama in this just so you understand modern history Obama in this is a regurgitate in things that have been said by Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd his new nationalism speech\nWoodrow Wilson and multiple speeches that he gave and all of them attack the declaration of independence or turn it inside out as Obama did what he's doing here isn't particularly smart you just stealing the propaganda the past hundred years old more\nThey wrap themselves in the declaration of independence\nBy rewriting by rewriting\nI don't have enough time to get into this again if you read or rediscovering Americanism and the tyranny of progressive ism you'll know exactly what's going on here as I said when I wrote it over a year old I'm not talking and I'm just saying if you want to understand that the tribes there he wasn't done cuts Seventeen go\nI don't know what that means first of all let's use English to keep what they got you mean to keep what they have the powerful and the privileged fight hard to keep what they they got\nWhat does that mean\nWho are the powerful corporate executives or senators and congressmen professors who indoctrinate their students\nMedia personalities who who are the powerful exactly\nGeorge Soros style hair they want to keep what they got\nWhat does that mean they want to keep what they got\nIf you weren't something legitimately by your smarts by your hard work whatever of course you want to be what you got why shouldn't\nThe most powerful people in this country or the people who run government because they have something that you do not have in the private sector you know what that is Mr producer\nThe law the law they control the law\nThey can punish people they can find people that can penalize people they can put people in prison\nThat's why the communist socialist the fascist they want to control the government they don't want to control this company or that company or this building that building they want the government they want to control the government you aren't constitution which he claims to support and does not\nDoesn't control the individual it doesn't control business it doesn't control the private sector doesn't control private property it's intended they controlled government\nBecause governments where the power is governments where the power it go ahead\nIs is to visit rhetoric\nIf somebody really believes what Obama said that this is what's going on that these people are privileged\nThey're powerful they've taken they get to keep what they've got or if they believe what ... says and the others saying compared Trump the Hitler and everything doesn't that incite people\nGo ahead\nHeat waves who does that here we have that demagogue pointing fingers at others and that's what demagogues do go ahead\nOh say see this is real\nFollowing the anti police remarks that President Obama and Eric Holder and tragically he didn't even remember that collect\nHold it up and looking at most or you just said something and not even allowed to say\nWell Trump is blamed and I told you two days ago you could see it coming they're starting to aim at Trump trying to turn the story and the Trump um that's perfectly fine things say whatever they want about Trump it's just a easy just just far away but if you bring up the fact\nThat Obama was truly trashing cops and law enforcement and holder was too and they're nationalizing these uh these local police departments and some of the really reckless things that they said whether it was purchased center Baltimore both\nTowns by the way ... which has not recovered from what took place up\nYou're not allowed to say that stuff you're\nNot allowed to say that stuff and yet the fact\nIs their rhetoric was outrageous again I don't consider it being the reason that these are these cops were murdered the guy was an absolute not and so forth and so on but the media will never be consistent because the media are of Obama's ilk they are progressive ... their status that's who they are and they and they reject\nElection of Donald Trump that's why they hate him so much All right Greg thanks for your call Hamilton New Jersey I Know where it is it's a
