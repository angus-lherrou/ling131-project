Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nDueling activists converged on Capitol Hill supporters urging senators to stand with red white\nNow during the confirmation process I met with sixty five senators and explain my approach to the law I participated in more than thirty hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary committee and I submitted written answers to nearly Thirteen hundred additional questions I was grateful for the opportunity\nAfter all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations my time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted my wife and daughters have faced vile and violent threats\nAgainst that backdrop I testified before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday to defend my family my good name in my lifetime of public service\nMy hearing testimony was forceful and passionate\nThat is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegation against me at times might testimony both of my opening statement a response to questions reflected my overwhelming frustration at being wrongly accused without corroboration of horrible conduct completely contrary to my record in character\nMy statement and the answer is also reflected my deep distress at the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled\n[noise] I was very emotional last Thursday more so than I've ever been I might have been too emotional at times I'd rather my tongue was sharp and I said a few things I should not have said I Hope everyone can

declared support for the constitution they do not support it they do not support the constitution except both take the free press part because they think it protects them\n[noise] but when it comes to the constitution a trash constitutional originalists and textural is worth throw backs don't you know unless we embrace the progressive agenda and in trying it\nAs a constitutional matter there by rewriting the constitution with nearly five justices\nThan we dressed as Kavanaugh must be destroyed it is the constitution that gets in the way of the progressive agenda don't you say\nIt's the constitution that they despise\nThey make no sense whatsoever when they talk about the constitution when they talked about precedent when they talk about precedent we know I suppose that they must embrace Dred Scott ... plus it and it must embrace Korematsu that's precedent\nIt's precedent that was rejected as precedent the case that Dred Scott it took a civil war to undo it the case of plus it took fifty eight years to undo it\nCase Korematsu it still hasn't been done\nThose were activists judges who did not follow the constitution of the United states\nThat's why this is an important debate\nThey insist on abortion it's not in the constitution so they demand precedent they insist on their entire social agenda there environmental agenda it's not in the constitution but they demand they insisted on all powerful centralized government to advance their agenda\nThat's not in the constitution either and they insist that the individual in states\nWell that they accept this new rewritten constitution despite the fact that you and I have never participated in amending it\nIt's a big cause judge Kavanaugh rivers that constitution not just the name but an action as he declares that he is despise and he is hated because that's a threat to the progressive agenda\nSo the more he talks about reverence for the constitution the more he talks about following the constitution the

to David Limbaugh David\nI said before the break that look\nI think a healthy vibrant Christian a face of people have Christian faith like healthy vibrant people of Judaism is a good thing for this country and a good thing for the world what do you say\nIt can be better stated I mean we as I mentioned injury to reiterate what I said before\nWe we stand then would fight to the death to protect the rights of liberty for everyone not just ourselves that's not a self interest thing it is\nIs that we're going from the bottom our hearts that everyone ought to be free everyone is banned in God's image everyone has an alien I'm All right in this country to liberty\nAnd we do Dale Jews and Christians have such a healthy attitude toward a morality and toward God\nAnd we we share the same absolute values and these values guide us and govern our society and our hire a constitutional framework is based on those values and no other country in the history of the world even comes close to the principles that under gr this\nA constitutional republic there were some great empires but they were empires America's not even an empire and that it's the most powerful nation and the history of the world it could have dominated taken over the world but it has been benign is down south\nWest and it or not sell for his work is looked at its own self interest but it is not sought to conquer other nations and exploit other nations contrary to the to the left\nA history revision as in uh in every respect most both domestically and or a our religious principle or what\nBehind the things that make this country\nGreat [noise] tell you something ah and I've been reading through your book and it is fascinating to me as a non Christian [noise] um you write beautifully you write in a way that's totally understand well these are very complicated subjects you know you can get really way\nDown [noise] or you can get caught in the weeds and you don't do any of that\nUh and uh and and you can see the uh the decency in your writing the earnest this in your writing\nAnd uh and you raised a point earlier when we were talking a and the first segment and that is and just mentioned it again the founding of this nation people need to understand or is that the men who founded this nation not all of them but almost all of them were Christians\nWho met at the uh who met and I'm On July Fourth with the declaration of independence and men in Philadelphia again in the constitution and look at what they did even look at the first amendment what they did they didn't us tablets your religion even though they could have potentially\nAnd yet they allow freedom of religion so in other words these are Judeo Christian attitudes and principals the reformation all these things that affected these faiths and so while people may say well I'm an atheist well I\nI you know I'm I'm this religion I'm of that and I ... and I don't agree with you\nThey can say that as you point out and they're free to do whatever they want but what they cannot say is that the founders of the country the frame or is that the constitution were not a religious men they were religious in their own way and to different degrees but these were men of face were they not\nYes and and that's been documented in and\nA lot of people want it to block that because it has been the interests of the secularists to uh say to rewrite history to revise history and say that the framers were not religious man that they were secularists and that\nUh they they say that as a result of that we should get back to our secular values and when they they want a radically transform fundamentally transform our nation\nOr back to secularism and those kind of values that but because they distort what really it really was but we know for a fact what they want to transform us back to something that's anathema to our founding principles and we watched the totalitarian tendency to the left\nThe American people are the opposite they old to make sure that they go and do the job that we sent them to do it's a long way from when I was president of the N. double ACP twenty seven years ago\nTo where I Am now and that

to come on the show real so what that plantation was real I grew up during that same Jim Crow era it's very real but many of us have run away from it\nAnd we encourage many more at this point in time in America and the president is giving us all the cupboard that's necessary to run away from that type of sleep but that this nation that following up on ...\nYou know to add to that and the beauty of what President Trump is jarred is that\nBecause he lack fear\nHe's put country first he's not afraid to really deal with people he's not afraid to use social media to put the truth out there and just credit is encouraging a lot of men and women if those are good to stand up and speak a fight for their country fight for what is right and what they saw this attack on judge\nKavanaugh his wife\nHis

whole thing has to now we've got to get through the vote tomorrow and I am cautiously optimistic that judge Kavanaugh gets to be on the court that he deserves to be on\nWhat if we don't deal with the

I'm not saying she is and possibly a sexual assault victims let me ask you\nIf you have someone who is a legitimate victim of sexual assault and they go out in the murder somebody down the line are they not accountable for that murder because they were a victim of sexual assault somewhere in their life\nThey absolutely are held accountable for murder right the one where she tried to do the right cab and I am one hundred percent certain\nHe was Brett Kavanaugh machine not trying to effectively ruin that man's life his family's life\nHow evil do you have to be to do that so I don't care if she was a sexual assault victims somewhere along the way does not give her the right to do what she did\nAnd it's important once again and we don't just wide off because break out I was going to make it through this thing and ignore people who are perpetrators like Christine bored because there will be others we ended up a thorn in the\nBiggest issue we could have had in this country which is due process just going the way of uh I don't know Chuck Schumer's credibility or the Chicago Cubs season I'm not trying to rub it in by the way I'm just pointing out that if I were a leftist in Chicago I wouldn't show up to vote because I mean just\nWhy you know not and things aren't going you're way right now and ... what's the point but\nThat's where we are that's where we are we're on aid ... razor thin edge and if you are someone who believes in right and wrong if you are someone who believes in the constitution if you are someone who believes in the premise\nThen we all need to acknowledge what happened here and who the perpetrator was\nRecognized in our own lives should those people come about the bay as well will be called out he made accountable for who and what they are now a couple of things as we were just getting warmed up Happy Friday by the way\nIt really has been that kind of a wake has meant that kind of a couple of weeks to kind of three months I mean shoot pretty much only Clarence Thomas and and understand when Kavanaugh has been through an emotionally doesn't know it was kind of feel like we were through another election here this whole cabinet thing is a pretty emotional deal because there was so much on the line\nBy the way I mentioned on ... ah yourself for the friends\nI don't want to show a my home station W.

mean this is my ... and must if you've never done boom goes a dynamite if this is mandatory viewing for your entertainment purposes is go to YouTube\nAt Jerry or next available opportunity and check out boom goes to data mine are the only other one that's even in competition with that one would be a flea market Montgomery\nAnd are you what you were rich you with me yes no okay okay good good just making sure just me because I Know a little bit of a a generational thing here I mean we're talking there are probably like Thirteen Years old but uh yeah flea market Montgomery ... mini mall living rooms bedrooms dine that's\nOh yeah and you can find that the market and the saddest thing about flea market Montgomery is that it uh it went down during the recession was that was maybe one of the saddest moments\nDuring the entire great recession anyway are now in this great economy we can have new flea market Montgomery and do the or there'll be bigger there'll be beautiful or they will have doors in the in the walls I just\nOh by the way I Am Brian mud and for the great one more to live in and uh get to some of your calls here and just a moment by the way the the phone lines are not to be confused with the uh\nThe Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation line which also has been known to have the exact same phone number so just to please do not share your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations on the Marco then show just take those straight to the FBI place\nNow um right before the break\nMentioned persuading people how to persuade somebody politically or over the course of my career is the single most common question I have receipt and the easiest way to tell you how to persuade someone is to tell you who you shouldn't be attempting to persuade\nPeople are closed minded if somebody is genuinely not open to information odds are not going to get anywhere\nAnd that's the problem they most people and this is true conservatives to by the way it's not like this is unique to liberal is there a lot of close minded conservatives too but you got to be open a new information and you need to identify who those people are in your life\nYou know I mentioned the Kavanaugh polling firm Gallup that start to finish everything that's happened over the past three months everything public sentiment I'm Brett Kavanaugh only shifted by seven points the entire time puts it\nIn other words at most seven percent of this country was even persuadable I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what does that tell you just go to the average person and that opposes your thought process and expect to get some way somewhere now you needed all you're doing is banging your head against the wall and you're going to make yourself on happy so if you want to be persuasive the first thing\nI find the right people people are open to information not the loudest people who will fight with you politically and the next thing is credibility\nOne of the biggest mistakes that people make just by lacking it because once you give up your credibility why is anybody going to listen to you\nSo for that reason operate with facts operate with information if you just operate with opinions independent of the facts and the information somebody who is otherwise open to that information\nThey're just going to view you as someone who is highly political trying to can communicate or your your emotion rather than principal a because typically what you'll find for those that are truly persuadable uh is that they are analytical\nAnd that they genuinely are inquisitive looking for more information and by the way\nThis surprises a lot of people but I find that common link there the millennials are a number of reasons and it starts with the economy\nA lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest millennials are I closing in on being illegal to drink the youngest one's right the oldest one's like thirty five thirty six now\nAnd I have not blame them ride along because when was it that they came of age they came of age and the great recession right so here they went through the education establishment they were fed a bill of whatever the education establishment feeds them\nAnd then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah and you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change you know Obama probably made sense because hey that was what our teachers told us in here we are and things are working\nThey had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it right now is one of the most important window of time\nWe have two really good opportunities speech people\nEspecially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right there is getting the wage growth the bonuses it's all happening and it's important to tell them how we got here\nWell there are ... they're manufactured right here in America and ships free within twenty four hours and you can sign up for instance corruption [noise] so you never have to think about air filters armor again\nYou don't want to mess with the IRS you have the power to garnish your paycheck about your bank accounts and even take your home or business that's all true but thankfully they're offering a way out a

it is and I have ... from articles and\nHappy Friday and I hope you have had a a wonderful day and are getting set for an amazing weekend it certainly has been an emotional time and no doubt or we're gonna have must see a TV going on about five o'clock eastern time tomorrow as the final vote or should take place approximately around that period of time but at this point\nGiven that Susan Collins made her speech made it clear that she is going to be voting\nAgainst foreign Brett Kavanaugh and then shortly after that Joe Manchin Democrat West Virginia who is a Republican and waiting at this point I mean it's a ... it seems like it's inevitable at at this point the mansion is going to go and make the move maybe I after the election of but he is a he said that he is also an board so uh it it absolutely\nIt appears that there are the boats and in fact something interesting that developed out of Alaska\nLisa Murkowski voted no Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no she didn't want to end debate and again if debate did not end today basically Kavanaugh would have been dead though to bring it right there at the procedural vote today absolutely critical so with her voting no uh you know she has come under heat\nFrom her constituents on the right\nAnd what's interesting I when you take a look at that in context is the way they've been going about not screaming not protesting not people that are chasing her down in elevators but there have been a lot of folks that had been to lighten up her office or with phone calls I didn't know how can certainly are\nThere have been some pretty good pieces put out including one by the wall Street Journal that was amazing pointing out that hey you know if Lisa Murkowski or to have her way here the ninth\nCircuit court of appeals\nWould be kind of the final say if you end up having basically this split court and you had significant decisions that would impact Alaskans the Ninth Circuit rulings ultimately if there weren't a decisive decision at the Supreme Court that would stand for all Africans seems like Lisa might now actually be reconsidering\nHas taken a look at the most likely outcome here or it looks like it might be in that fifty to vote range and I we might end up there even though we were fifty one forty nine today now something that I have tried to lean on from a point of optimism throughout this process\nIs the positives that can be gained from all this\nHow many people knew how many folks were on the Senate Judiciary committee until the last couple of weeks\nI haven't known many I I mean even you and the student listener somebody who cares and is engaged in you know that they were Twenty one members well I mean okay so twenty and Spartacus but didn't you know how many members of the Senate Judiciary committee there were\nWe learn that right I mean it's one small detail but for many folks because we don't teach civics in school this has been an opportunity and cabin on the ...\nOr ... that man what he has been through and having a backbone of steel to see this thing through holy cow incredible person definitely a role model a role model that we could all point to\nThat's ultimately what I think Brett Kavanaugh's role is two fold one\nI think he taught history by what he went through during this process and having a whole new generation of people engaged in paying attention\nSecond thing is I think we have a new role model that we can point to one of the big concerns of course has been well you know Trump's kind of Trump Donald Trump has been an incredibly effective president the United states not necessarily the best role model right\nBut if you want to introduce your kids to somebody that seems to have all the ripe for priorities in the right place this is the right way doesn't back down when he's faced with adversity you absolutely can point to Brett Kavanaugh now\nHow many folks necessarily knew how many Supreme Court justices their war before all this I'm sure you did but a lot of folks have learned that\nA lot of folks have learned about how the Senate actually works and that's important from the point of civic says well how deliver it is the process is by design all these procedural votes and everything that's happening now including the thirty our window that we're in as we wait until\nApproximately five o'clock tomorrow afternoon for the final vote\nYeah there are a lot of things about our government we complained about a lot of things we don't like a lot of things that we should be frustrated by but they're always opportunities and we're in one of those moments one of those historical moment\n[noise] then we can look back on and this could be an opportunity for generations to learn what they never would have learned and I have an opportunity and the time of adversity with leadership to point to somebody who does the right way doesn't back down [noise]\nI'm Brian my we'll be right back I'm In for the gray one Marshall

definitely a must listen and watch it so I take it in for sure uh she really ended up a lane the down\nAnd uh want to get some of your thoughts that let's go to many in Anchorage, Alaska and and then they understand that uh you're a you're a little higher on Lindsey than non Susan at this point\nWell just from the standpoint Brian of hey senatorial moment because I think quite Lindsey there last week it was on the for the Senate then have all the trappings but Lindsay lame those other members on that Judiciary Committee eighty eight there spinach\nOkay exactly what they need to hear I don't think they pay no attention to it but he took a stand in the heat of battle he didn't wait to see which way the wind was blowing\nThat's kind of way I look at it and I think and I'm going to say that

too um and so I just I I think Collins for her speech today but\nI really wanted to say how much I admire Lindsey Graham for really having them party can there to\nReally say what needed to be sent to those members of that and Judiciary Committee they were acting\nUh well they are they all have their Spartacus moment I think [laughter]\nBut but actually something you can be proud of [laughter]\nBut you know I Would agree with you as a probably Lindsey Graham's find this moment as well are you talking about the the five o'clock hour five o'clock ... eastern time tomorrow we're going to have this vote and it was ... eastern time they'll Lindsey Graham a week ago yesterday ended up by having that particular moment where he sped up now\nRespectfully disagree with you just in terms of him influencing in this particular case Susan Collins she was so principled and detailed as she laid out I don't think there was anything that she was going to be swayed by by virtue of simply be\nPragmatic yet emotional plenty of Lindsey Graham ah but ah but ultimately I'm not going to take anything away from him it really was a pretty incredible moment but speaking of Lisa Murkowski I'm interested to get your take a given that you are in Alaska\nSo she voted no today the heat is being put on her ultimately what are the implications in Alaska does she have a chance to uh to win her next election if she ends up going down this path\nWell I I Wish I ... and that Brian judging from the very popular radio show in the afternoon for three to six up here I had lost every day and believe me the people I Can't remember very many call for a new one hand for foreign Lisa\nAll the other calls have been I'm\nI'm way how should vote for a ... a cabinet\nOkay it's going to be interesting to see what happens there I actually think there is an outside chance that she ends up becoming a boat in the affirmative tomorrow or I Know that the earlier today a in addition to her voting no to end debate she also indicated that he wasn't the right person at the right time for this country\nBut then she walked back those comments later in the afternoon after she started getting some of the response in so\nUh she'll be an interesting one to watch tomorrow although we should the likely be a formality which gives recovered by the way because you can go ahead and you're Lisa Murkowski in and vote in the affirmative because it's like an alter the outcome almost certainly tomorrow All right let's go to Dan Dan is in Clearwater, Florida Dan welcome to the show\nHey thank you
