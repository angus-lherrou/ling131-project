American how 'bout that\nBoston Globe her hometown newspaper quote Warren reveals test confirming ancestry NBC News nobody but Clinton network NBC News quote Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results indicating she is Native American heritage when you break down the numbers\nThe testing that this person did involve samples from Columbia in Peru not from America\nAnd that she is something less than

President Trump and you it came across over the phone that he respects you quite a bit it was a great interview\nIn regard to this or a Saturday a journalist from the ground impose I hear constantly on the media is portrayed as a journalist\nOr from Washington Post inferring that he's at a Merck American citizen and this is just trying to prove that Trump doesn't care about journalists and uh he he kisses up to the Saudis it's these are people that have been helping us fight terrorists\nFor years under Obama he had written lines\nAnd ISIS was a a JV team took a Trump a one year to get rid of ISIS you don't hear about that in the news anymore\nBecause you know I don't know because it doesn't fit how long did Obama deal with ISIS eight years now and Trump got rid of them in one year how big of a story was that\nA just a blip on the radar for one day\nThey'll let me ask you this was ambassador Christopher Stevens\nAnd American\nAh you know guys who I Know the credit you know all the time

both sides of the ... what are the guys who is in charge of buying the ads for the Republican Washington DC says it over the last two weeks they see a essentially\nA five point bump across the board for Republicans and they're basing that that they attributed to Kavanaugh be attributed to taxes and they attributed to immigration\nAnd so given the fact that the enthusiasm level is higher boats

the calls\nThese illegal immigrants from coming across into this country that will cause the southern border to protect our nation's interests\nAnd and it it would be ... by All right because this is what a normal president does know what a normal\nMother or father would do to protect their house or a normal person would do to protect their business I mean this is no different than putting a lock on your door having a fence around your house having a ... system if you know that people are coming for you what do you do you give up\nIf I Know that someone's coming to break into my house I Am going to get ready and I'm going to warn them that if they break into my house I Will shoot them I'm going to I'm going to gear up to protect my property which is exactly what the president's doing he's protecting the United states of America our property as citizens\n\nNow all of this I said to go back to a core point here I don't hate people that come to this country illegally I've said this coming in from work before or many of you know me I I play tennis in college I was ... almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\n\nMy best friend is from another nation one of my other best friend just from a another nation they both came to this country is a student\nWith a student visa legally they didn't break in and they didn't come into care of and they didn't chant they didn't yell and they love America and the both of them are still here and both of them love this country and respect our laws and make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way\nI have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you do it the appropriate and the right way and you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem with people that just say I'm going to break in your house because I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\n\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate\nFor a civilized nation sets\nYou you know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing with an evil nation in Saudi Arabia\nAgain he hasn't stood with them he said we're investigating we're taking the time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter going to a campaign rally ... it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out\nThere will be a very strong response from this country to Saudi Arabia more than words remember don't trust some interactions not words when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most irritating things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as a compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media is treating him with this caravan of of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and is an outrage enough done this one story but then they say this president being outraged over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's ... he's a terrible person they should calm down it should be loving\nWhich one is it to the media which one is if you want a president that defends his country and fights this country's interests like he's doing with these illegal immigrants care of adding to the United states and then when he does that you criticize him for doing it saying he's ... he's crazy any meaning evil and he's so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts\nLike journalists are somehow more important than average people\nI'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr should make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing a normal hard day's work in something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come and defend and they all freaked out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrageous have you not been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually and pure but they just allow women to drive and the only reason why they limited drive in Saudi Arabia is because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they're like All right screw it let's give them a license that will shut up the world\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia I didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal\nYou still in Saudi Arabia they ... they were literally take off a limb they will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they will cut off legs they will cut off ... ... feet\nAs part of punishment\nThey will give lashing to old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or do criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth\nAnd I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify with Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations with Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't riding these articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with human rights\nMy point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines and has taken a life his own because it was a member of the media and it's horrific what happened to him\nBut his ... but the media who is acting like this is something we must were I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because of what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia for as long as they've been alive who are writing these articles it's fake outrage\n\nDon't like how Saudi Arabia does things I also know why we are an ally with them because they are extremely tough on terrorism in that part of the world and they do things that we don't do\nWe also need a place that we can land we also need a place that we can fire we also have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that a relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\nThey've agreed that it's important they've all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump and Trump agrees Obama and Obama agrees with Bush in both strays with Clinton thing\nReal healthy natural energy caught eight six six to zero five for nine zero seven I've got a super beats dot com backslash Levin L.

come into a country legally migrants I Would argue or people that actually break or don't break the law there are people that advocate for doing it the right way people that say screw all that I'm going to break into your country and ... ... migrants are breaking into Mexico in Mexico the reason why Mexico hasn't freaked out over this\nIs because they're not staying in Mexico and they know it they know they're just passing on through to America so if you want to know why\nMexico's not freaked out by this unit wimax does stopping this a caravan of illegal immigrant law breakers\nIs because they know they're just passing\nOn through that's what they're doing they're just passing through\n\nThe president's tweets today were measured his comments were measured\nNot unhinged not crazy measured they were very measured\nYou're telling a country that we're supposed to be doing trade with that is supposed to uh respect this country and clearly they don't you need to stop these people and if you don't our relationship where you would you will also be in jeopardy\nOur relationship with you our trade with you and all these other things could very much be in jeopardy so you need to check yourself because if you allow this to happen to us there is going to be a issue\nMexico is supposed to be an ally of ours allies don't let illegal immigrants break into your country when they know about it weeks in advance\n\nThis is exactly why I voted for Donald Trump because I knew he was going to stand up for us I knew it was going to stand up and be a law and order president which

reason why I say that is based on facts and the way that she tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh with no facts\nWhere she did everything in her power to destroy a good man and his family name all because in the name of politics\n\nShe has now come out with an idea that many Democrats are very excited about\n\nShe says that American families that are making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year should be eligible for a monthly tax credit a five hundred dollars that six thousand a year\nUnder new legislation they announce today by the Democratic party this democratic US Senator Kamala Harris of California she then went on to say that individuals making lesson\nFifty thousand dollars a year should be eligible for up to two hundred and fifty dollars a month that would be three thousand a year now she said quote Americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages mean they can't keep up with the cost of living increases that is a lie\nAmericans are working harder than ever before right now because the jobs are good and the and the economy's good and many people went from part time employment the full time employment and wages are increasing\nEverything she just said that sense is is is nothing but a ... is a lie and for all the people that I ever are obsessed with the fact checking every Republican and everything that Donald Trump says why aren't you fact checking her on that because that statement in our own words is why\nI'm not going to focus on that for for that it's almost like a technicality like compared to what I'm about to tell you Harris's office as she rolled out this plan today cited a two thousand Seventeen\nSurvey from the website bank rate dot com that found that more than half of Americans\nCannot afford a five hundred dollar\nUnexpected expense such as it rent increase a medical bill or childcare\nNow bank rates survey came out and it said their headline of this phone survey went and found the article says just four and ten Americans have savings savings they rely on in an emergency\nSo\nWhat you have is you have come out here is to say OK Obama phones aren't enough anymore to get somebody to vote for me because people can actually pay for their own darn phone bill now\nFood stamps or not enough because people are walking away from food stamps where we are seeing record numbers of people fall off of food stamps because they're actually getting good jobs where they're being employed in a great economy and they're providing for themselves government aid to keep people in poverty is not enough so now I gotta do something new I got to tell you that you still need more help from the government\nAnd I'm going to do it because of a website called bank rate dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar unexpected expense\nLet me just explain to you how worked this logic is this idea is\nI'll go back to her first part of her proposal she said American families making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine dollars a year\nCould be eligible for a monthly tax credit of up to five hundred dollars or six thousand dollars a year\nAnd the reason why she wants to give you that money every month this because she says you don't have you haven't saved a five hundred dollars for an unexpected bill that could come in with a rent increase of medical bill or childcare\nSo she wants to give you government subsidized money so that you making nine hundred nine thousand dollars a year have an extra five hundred dollars so that she can pay for your unexpected expense\nNow my my quick question for you is this what makes you think that if you give somebody who's making\nNine hundred or Ninety nine thousand let me just say this summer correctly because I said it wrong a moment ago so people on the left will freak out so that said it wrong so I'll correct it right now are calm down\nYou're making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred dollars a year\nAnd you can't save for five hundred dollar unexpected expense you're an idiot\n\nWhat makes you think that idiot who's making that much money\nIs going to take your government money and then go Oh thank you you just said me for my unexpected next expense of five hundred dollars I'm going to save that money because at the same dumb a hasn't saved five hundred dollars of is Ninety nine thousand dollar a year job\n\nMemory when we had the tax credit that came out the Bush tax credit member that what happened everybody took their tax money and they were they deal with it they went out and bought a ton of crap and boost the economy and George Bush and those economists around them are right people to save that money they got extra money and they went out and spin it right away don't look at the stats\nAirs she knows that they're not going to say this money for five hundred dollar unexpected expense they're going to take this money immediately just spend every dime of every single month on average\nThe idea that someone making fifty thousand dollars a year if you give them an extra two hundred and fifty dollars a month of the government's money which is our taxpayers' dollars subsidizing people to make under a hundred thousand dollars a year but there are now going to say that money every month for an unexpected medical bill or child care you're an idiot\nTwo hundred and fifty dollars a month is not going to save someone's life it means that they don't know how to budget this is nothing more than buying votes this is not about\n... and the fact that you're doing this under the under a survey from bank great dot com is the reason why we need legislation in this country which she announced today\nThat is going to save America's middle class by giving them extra money among subsides from the government that now they're going to save that money and not spend it on whatever the crap they're spending their money on now that they're going to become more responsible with that money compared to the other a hundred thousand or making year she is just liberal and competency at its\nBiggest form you can make\nBring this to a ... a family level if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year and I called my dad and said dad I man I had a flat tire this morning can you can you let me borrow two hundred bucks\nI don't have it my dad would tell me to drive on the orange fair and get my house in order in my life and order and stop being a screw up\nHe would not loaned me the money because if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year he would say you're an idiot for not saving any of that I Am thousand dollars a year if I was making fifty thousand dollars a year to use her other example and I had\nTire and I call my dad or my mom and I said hey mom look I'm only making fifty grand\nI just had a flat tire I have no extra savings I Can't deal with this unexpected tire expense can you please send over five hundred dollars or two hundred and fifty dollars to use their math\n... I I Would hope my mom would hang up the phone on me in fact I Hope she would\nSay I'm embarrassed by you you're an embarrassment to the family get your life together you moron and then hang up on me\nThis is nothing more than buying votes\nThis is nothing more than welfare on a higher level than the welfare that we're currently\nIn that they've been offering instead of food stamps you're offering people cash because they're not getting the food stamps anymore so you still got to keep them addicted to you\n\nYou still got to get them addicted to you that's what you got to do just get
