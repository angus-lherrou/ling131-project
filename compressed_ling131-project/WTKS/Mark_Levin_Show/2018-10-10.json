would have been up to me I still would have had cruising there but my eyes were opened and here's what miles rope into that God is in control not me and he knows what he's doing and I think\nNow that I've seen it happen that my faith is behind Trump\nAs a president or not because he's the most godly man but because I I Believe that this is the ... because I don't think it could have pulled off\nWhat and I loved it but I don't think you get pulled off things away Donald you know and nobody I've got a plan and so we need to take comfort in that opposite fake and just do what we need to do individually to help\nThis kind of get back to where it needs to be\nImagine if Hillary was in the White House who would be on the Supreme Court would you have Gorsuch would you have Kevin ... you'd

section pulling out white people beating on their car and using using racial epithets against them and you can't have this\nHard to prove this a hate crime they wouldn't be hard to prove they hate us\nIt's not going to happen in Oregon I guess but what about the U.S department of justice doing it what about Jeff Sessions in the FBI and all the rest of what about that\n[noise] I agree that's where it should come from the top because you know in Charlottesville ... went out one white\nSkinhead ran into a crowd and killed some woman he was charged with murder in\nVirginia then he was charged with a hate crime now I don't know why it's a hate crime if a white person kills a white person but nonetheless I went back to spend the rest of his life in jail because he killed innocent woman who was protesting I'm with them\nAnd when and when when white supremacists march or on Charlottesville yelling about Jews you're talking to a guy this practice law would choose most of my professional life I'm disgusted by that\nAh ... running around Charlottesville at night with tiki torches talking about the N word and about Jews that's bad stuff it happens but ten times that stuff\nHappens on the left all the time and it's never confronted in reality for what it is which is ... from the left\nThere's much more hate from the left and from the right there's many more hate crimes on the left and on the right but they're never prosecuted that why are they\nNow know they're not\nWell shame we gotta go thanks for your call this move on to John and California John and California Welcome to the ... show John please go ahead\nOn our ship grain legal mind a question from the school to get out to vote over they're controlling the streets in Oregon\nAnd the mayor's ordering them to the police to stand down so that people can be assaulted their property can be destroyed the mayor be charged for aiding and abetting I'm also against\nYou know forty two usa Nineteen forty eight is a statute that deals with\nOne state authorities act or under act on their color is state law to violate someone civil rights\nThe mayor of Portland, Oregon is part of an unspoken conspiracy the object to which is to violate someone civil rights you have the right to travel and when these individuals confronted Ted Cruz in a restaurant in a private restaurant on private property\nAnd then when authorities did not arrest those individuals this happen in Washington DC\nThis was under color a state law or city ordinances\nCity or state officials acted in such a way so as to deny the human rights\nOf Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi and so the answer is yes if we had a functional department of justice\nUnder Jeff Sessions these things would be prosecuted for what they are which are hate crimes under color of state law and the fact is not ... not and the other thing that drives me crazy John\nIs that the national media doesn't cover this do they as a hate crime why don't they cover it can you imagine large numbers of radical individuals taking over as intersections and a great American city like Portland, Oregon allowing only the people of color to go through and attacking white citizens'\nHow is it possible the mayor wheeler does arise and say not in my city there's tape on Fox tonight of Portland police watching it going on and doing nothing about it because the mayor wheeler doesn't want anything to happen this is despicable this is wrong it can happen in America\nIs lying is political gender to go for it or even expect the governor to step up and say I'm going to bring in the national guard I'm gonna take my state back I'm gonna take my city back I'm not going to tolerate this maybe somebody above it needs to step in the federal government but we can't have America like that they have to do all this violence\nWhat what I think the mere Portland believes what he's doing is politically popular he's doing what the citizens of Portland want him to do and elected them to do it\nAnd so how is it possible that a great American city not in the south but Portland, Oregon\nAllows in ... to take over city streets\nBlock intersections line in front of federal buildings making an impossible for federal agents to do their job and the mayor of Portland a clown effect was full name wheeler does absolutely nothing to stop it because politically it's popular to do that in Portland, Oregon\nYou know John how is that possible how do we get ourselves in this situation the incivility on the left his unspeakable\nLeft the state says this movement is saying and thank you for your a great job covering it for the great when\nJohn thank you and when I watched what happened on the Supreme Court on Thursday Friday Saturday and even today on Brett Kavanaugh as first day on the job large numbers of individuals in violation of federal law committed criminal trespass on federal property\nAnd I'll watch them climbing on top of an statues and scratching it the doors of the United States Supreme court how\nHow do they do this in public committed ... literally thousands of crimes in public a few are arrested there find like fifty dollars on the first violation and then the second time they might be a night in jail and the guy paying and his George Soros\nHow is it possible this massive lawlessness and it's occurring without recompense

dollars from us we don't benefit from then their products flow into America our products can flown in China\nThe Chinese would love to buy Cadillacs in several ways and forwards but they can't do it

one thing I Want you to keep uh keep the faith\n[noise] this is history repeating itself\nYou may recall the Democratic party circuit sixty five sixty six sixty seven sixty eight\nEncouraged violins protest cities were burned under democratic mayor so it would be there would be a hundreds killed millions of dollars or property destroyed all hell breaks loose\nAnd average Americans looked at that and said we don't want Humphrey and sixty eight or take next a new promises law and order four years later the chaos continued cities continue to burn administration buildings taken over in college campuses murder was rampant and what happened in Nineteen Seventy two Nixon\nOne forty nine out of fifty states\nBecause the average Americans live in Iowa Wisconsin Michigan Ohio Kentucky Indiana Texas Florida couldn't look at it didn't like what they were seeing on TV\nAnd you had a candidate promising law and order and uh working on behalf of the moral majority in the silent majority and that current candidate is the president Donald Trump he's doing what Nixon did in sixty eight in Seventy two\nSo and Hillary Clinton playing the part of you are a chump free says the rules of civility are suspended because Republicans control the Congress and\nOnce the Democrats take over then the rules of civility we'll be imposed once again\nIt is it blatantly stupid comment\nTwenty eight per by a margin of twenty eight percentage points\nIndependent voters believe the Democrats acted like fools or the Kevin all committee hearings by a margin of twenty eight percent a great number see Hillary's doing this now she's Seventy Seventy one years old and she wants to appear hip and radical\nBut at say ... it's not true it doesn't work she used to say during the campaign I'm with you\nKnow Hillary as saying I'm with them the ... demonstrators that black lives matter protesters who demand the murder of cops what are we went dead cops one we want them now that black lives matter protesters that say pigs in a blanket from like bacon\nFat is what is encouraged men of the Democratic party and the last couple of years of the Obama administration as black radicals and white apologist all over the country scream for the murder of cops and it happened in Dallas in Baton Rouge and all over the country\nYou might recall that Brock Hussein Obama into the White House took the founders and representatives del Rey ma cats in and others a black lives matter\nIs if they had a point to make the cops are racist murderers systemically which is not the case every now and then you have all the corn McDonald situation in Chicago were top should not have shot that boys sixteen times\nEvery now and then you have something bad happened the one point one one percent out of Ninety nine point nine percent when cops to what a right\nBut the argument is not that the occasional cop occasionally does something wrong the argument for the Democratic party is the cops are an occupying force there\nNot worthy of being protected and loved you not worthy of our support not worthy of law and order and so when a candidate like Trump promises law and order\nThe silent majority will arise and stop at the Democratic party once again to overplay its hand with Kevin ...\nAnd I don't know if the fire can be maintained another twenty eight days twenty eight days from tonight\nWe're going to have the results of most of the most of the elections by a by midnight tonight we're going to know twenty eight days from now and I'm willing to strongly predict that the United States Senate will stay within the grasp of the Republican Party because of the behavior of Democrats\nPlay overplay their hand and it's way too much so it's continuous morals go to Craig little falls Minnesota Craig in Minnesota Welcome to the ... show bill accounting em hair incorrect please go ahead\nYeah good to hear you on ... on Sunday night I'm I'm a concern that if there is a red wave which I think there's gonna be I'm concerned that these antifa types are going to just go absolutely bonkers everywhere\nMaybe start shooting more Republicans\nWell see that's the problem somebody comes up to my car with a mask on tries to drag me out of it I've got a glock forty three that I'm licensed to carry in about forty four states and I think somebody at a mask is going to meet up with that and and and they're actually putting me in jeopardy\nAnd they're putting a lot of other people in jeopardy I don't know how to I don't know how how we deal with that especially these places where there's Democrats in charge and they're going to encourage it just like they're doing in Portland\nWhat Craig I Would imagine Portland, Oregon I also have a concealed carry permit I Would imagine Oregon doesn't have reciprocity with hardly anybody and you can imagine if you're in Minnesota in Ohio and Kentucky and Alabama and Texas and Florida\nThere aren't too many mobs pulling people out of pickup trucks because that ain't gonna work maybe in Portland it works and what is so despicable the video tonight on Fox there's a Portland police officer in uniform on a motorcycle watching these individuals shutdown intersections in\nDowntown Portland and doing nothing about it\nCrazy that's crazy and I don't know how the cops feel about it I suppose there are um beat up and they want to keep their jobs so they do with the boss tells them or or maybe they are complicit with it I don't know\nHopefully uh everybody does the right thing in places saved and got out there I was saved by the reason I called actually is because I wanted to tell you that I I was a a never Trump or back in two thousand six Jean and I'm completely changed my whole point of view on that\nI didn't think he was electable and I didn't think was conservative back then and I was wrong in fact I lost a hundred dollar bet with a fellow employees from mine over it paid him up the next day\nPretty much since day one I've been defending his actions are the president's done a fantastic job here to help my family myself so much I remember three things in my entire life\nThat I've noticed that the federal government actually do for me first was the Bush tax cuts and\nNow this fabulous cut from the European Trump this time around as because so much money in my pocket you know the other thing that affected me\nWas when my Cadillac plan was cancelled because of the sea and Obamacare and costs me nine thousand dollars out of pocket since my company dumped are Cadillac plan well thank you now grounds for that and thank you Republicans for more money in my pocket\nYou know I'm Glad you said all of that because there are a lot of people out there that are still the never Trump or land and they won't recognize it look I can understand that they don't like the president's style\nOr it may be that they're it's at odds with how they would manage things but you cannot argue that he's governing as a strong conservative that gets results and I'll take results over rhetoric any day\nAnd ah I Wish some of the other people that were in your camp would would be as electrically honest\nOr as you are and I

the mob from taking power because make no mistake this is all about political power\nWe heard from Hillary Clinton yesterday in her interview with Chris you and I'm a poor where she said we can only regained civility if the Democrats win the house and the Senate she's basically saying no justice no peace no victory in November no peace nice little town you got there\nBe a shame if anything happened to it you had better vote for the Democrats or we're going to burn this thing down\nSo what are you willing to do\nTo stop the mob from taking power eight seven seven three one three I wasn't one because we have an incredibly important election coming up in twenty seven days for weeks from today for weeks from right now this moment when you tune in to hear the great one mark living on the

just President Trump probably justice Kavanaugh\nOr if a mark living might be talking about the remarkable his door Rick victory of the Republican Party\nIn maintaining majorities in the house and the Senate\nWhich story what we hear for weeks from tonight\nIt really depends on you and it depends on what you were willing to do because right now I have seen Republican voters\nIn my town of Washington DC and yes there are Republicans in Washington and then the greater Washington area but all across this country I assume Republicans motivated an energized and ready to walk across broken glass to get to the ballot box and that's important but it's not everything\nThe only way that Hillary Clinton lost the election and twenty sixteen\nIs because people not just voted but they told their friends to vote they told their family members to vote they made sure that they became part of the message and they said we can't let her when\nWe can't let her pick Supreme Court justices we can't let her be the commander in chief look at who she is look at what she thinks of us look at her history\nThat's what happened two years ago next month\nThat's how you win elections when you're up against the mainstream media when you're up against Hollywood when you're up against television and music and the universities and the news media that's how you when you have to tell your friends and your family we can't let this happen so are you ready now\nYou ready because they just showed you over the weekend and over the past\nTwo weeks how they're going to govern\nThe Democrats want all of those people who were screaming in the streets and screaming disrupting the operations of the United States Senate\nThey want to take them from the streets they want to take them from the gallery screaming at vice president Pence trying to conduct a vote in the United States Senate and they want to put them down on the floor of the Senate down on the floor of the house they want to hand the gavel to them and let them be in charge for the next two years\nWhat are you willing to do to stop it eight seven seven three one\nThree eight one one it started yesterday on CNN well actually forgive me it started\nEarly in the morning yesterday in the Washington Post the these things happen and they're all coordinated have you noticed that\nThe Washington Post writes an op ed talking about how Trump is using coded language when he refers to Democrats as\nThe mob talking about how this is a dog whistle how the mob isn't really a mob\nAnd then Matt Lewis a writer at the Daily Beast and never Trump consider that Republicans aboutcom Republican but he actually I think is no longer identify as Republican but he has to be a Republican he used to read at the Daily Caller now he switched to the Daily Beast I think that's what happens\nWhen you go from being a Republican to a non Republican you switch daily call her the Daily Beast and ... the good guy and I've known that for a while he's on with Brooke Baldwin Mary Catherine ... a friend of mine also and never Trump Republican she has not renounced the Republican\nName she writes the federalist she's also um they're both paid CNN contributors and they're talking about the instability that we're seeing in this country and we're talking about the violent protests that we saw in the streets after the Capitol hearing but frankly the violence we've seen for the last two years since the middle of the twenty sixteen election\nThe things that we saw\nAgainst Trump voters at Trump rallies there were instigated by the left the things that we saw remember the antifa people following the Trump motorcade into a hotel in happen over the freeway barricades to get into the hotel where he was having a fundraiser\nYou remember the mobs on the campuses have UC Berkeley and other places across this country when Ben Shapiro of all people shows up to give a speech you know little mild mannered Ben Shapiro is causing a bonfire\nAnd the bonfire bunch of parents ever been around involve marshmallows in smaller ers\n... in the moral words of Billy Joel we didn't start this fire\nLeft has been doing this for the last two years and

Phil basic function every roles in the United states government and the executive branch politics because they still think Hillary should have won\nAnd they're trying to make life a living and health for this president they want dysfunction in the federal government so they can run in twenty twenty saying well he couldn't even run the government right\nThat's what they're trying to do\nPresident Trump nominated Jeffrey ... Clarke says the wall Street Journal editorial to run the environment and natural resources division in June twenty Seventeen\nDitto Erica dry banned for civil rights the third is an assistant Pentagon secretary who would oversee manpower and reserve affairs Democrats vow cloture on every nominee which kicks off thirty hours of debate even if no senator as opposed to understand\nThis but Democrats care about the environment so Trump dominates Jeffrey bus or clerk to run the environment and natural resources division of the Justice Department in June of last year of last year\nAnd they haven't allowed it to come to the floor for a vote\nThey say that every single one of the nominees the Trump has put through remember Richard Grinnell the ambassador to Germany right now who people are saying should be the best with you and I would love that by the way wreck when I was a great guy\nHe was the ambassador of Germany he languish without a vote for over a year we had no ... in Germany and once he got there\nBoy he is is ... and then into shape not just Germany he has been the the tip of the spear for the Trump Administration in on doing the uh the the free for all that happened with regard to Iran\nAnd Germany and all these other businesses and banks and industry suddenly doing business with the terrorists ... Iran because they were functioning without Trump's man in Berlin\nThey finally get rid of Grinnell as the ambassador after languishing for a year without a floor vote he gets there and within two months all these businesses are divested from Iran oh we have no idea that that's what America wanted we had no idea that is what Trump one way that it's because they didn't have as an acid or there\nThat's just one example\nSo Democrats filed closer this was a Senate rule that can be changed in should be changed I don't know why McConnell's allowing it to go on as far as he had he should have just said okay we're done with us\nWhenever a senator files cloture it means that automatically a requires thirty hours of debate and I think about this there's something like I think two hundred a ... roughly two hundred nominations right now there languishing\nFor each one of them they would require thirty hours of debate they won't get anything else done\nThey won't do anything and so so McConnell wanting to get stuff done\nHis sort of just said okay we're not going to put those nominations through the floor votes because we can't just hold progress\nBecause of the thirty hours a foot and by the way the thirty hours of debate that is triggered with every single cloture that the Democrat forces\nThey might not even have a rational opposition they might not even have a reason why they oppose the person they just want to mock up the works they just want to slow everything to a grinding halt\n\nGoing back to the editorial here at the wall Street Journal which is brilliant they figure if they can't defeat nominees they can delay and consume valuable time Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes\nVersus twelve in Iraq Obama's first two years and four in George W Bush's\nSo here we are in the first two years of the Trump presidency and Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes on his nominations what are the Republicans do during Obama's first few years ... wells\n\nYou don't hear about this in the media you don't hear about this on Jimmy Kimmel\nThe question this month is whether Senate Democrats will accept a deal to confirm more judges and nominees which allow vulnerable members to return home to campaign see see now McConnell starting to instead of just saying screw it we're done with this rule which he could do\nInstead he is now saying hey it's a nice mid term election coming up in twenty seven days be a shame if you couldn't go back to your state to campaign\n\nHey Joe mansion I Know it's it's not a long drive to West Virginia from DC but it'd be a real shame if I force you to sit here for all these cloture votes in the next four weeks\nAt quarter McCaskill hey you're not looking good in the polls there in Missouri I bet you like to go there and press the flesh and hand out some walking around money to the voters in St Louis not going to be able to do it if you're forced here to vote on all these nominees so McConnell's playing hardball now and he said you guys want to go back we got to make a deal on these things\n[noise]\nUh let's hope Republicans extract the high price for that privilege some one day I hear it is seared as I was looking for the number earlier I was right outside it was close to two hundred\nOne hundred and Ninety eight nominations are backed up right now I'm awaiting confirmation there's no wonder can you imagine this is the defense department we're talking about this is the Pentagon there are positions and the Pentagon right now\nThat have been left unfilled nearly two years into this president's administration key positions at the Pentagon that involve national security that involve the functioning of our military\nAnd\nThe Democrats don't care\nOne hundred and Ninety nominations backup awaiting confirmation according to the partnership for public service tracking the nominations range from State Department under secretary the Labor Department spots Charles Stimson was nominated in June twenty Seventeen to be general counsel of the navy\n... pausing for a moment I Know ... he's a great guy I haven't really talked to him about this we trade attacks now and again I just say how you doing how you do and you still don't have a vote right now is the number vote don't have a vote I don't know what's going on June is twenty Seventeen college Simpson was nominated to be the uh counsel for the department of the navy\nGeneral counsel that means the top lawyer for the for the navy\nThis is a guy who is eminently qualified he has not only cleared committee once he's clerk committee twice he had to go back to committee a second time\nA for something I Can't remember I think they changed the makeup of the committee he still they won't give this man the dignity of a vote on the floor he's that got did sitting there treading water right now am I going to be working at the Pentagon and might not going to be working at the Pentagon\nAnd and the navy at Wall Street journal points out they are an urgent need for legal direction they've got to deal with the fallout from recent ship accidents as well as lawsuits against the
