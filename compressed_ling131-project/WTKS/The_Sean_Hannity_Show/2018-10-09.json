Georgia governor Nathan Deal is this your state of emergency from ... two\nCounties in Georgia ahead of hurricane Michael that includes the entire coastal empire\nNow just to let you know state of emergency means that state resources are now available to local agencies and also prohibits any type of price gouging it does not I repeat does not mean that there is any type of evacuation\nEverything you get is predictable Democratic Party one oh one smears slander ... blood joining whoever they don't like and don't agree with it nothing new it is there one and only play book\nAnd we have chronicled this now for years on this program but the stakes couldn't be higher\nFor weeks from tonight I'm you might hear the words Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house\nAnd committee chairman Maxine Waters and committee chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York I've worn you over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better\nOr they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare\nShort of that what else do they stand for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot or new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago\nIs America stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago is the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation east kept his promise on building the wall he hasn't fully been able to do it because it hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced a bolt built today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall we now have record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years the last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series that's how far back that goes\nHispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for\nAsian Americans also record low for our veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nPresidents kept his promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea\nThe sanctions in Iran are now paying off we see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he was select from any selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd then twenty eight days or weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nNancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts of working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a head of the investigation and the next hour\nIn a while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation there's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Katherine Harris you've all been breaking story\nBut you know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally ... do\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit\nRemember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice once she deleted subpoenaed emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company\nAnd told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in May of twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview heard Peter ... one of the interviewers\nA man that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was that if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James Cole me\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney or by the company ... that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait\nWhich is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group\nThat went out and hire the former ... six agent or the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and an inter August tore and Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling\nThe number two the the lead counsel for the FBI now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the DEA OJ or either resigned or fired or\nOr stepped aside\nAnd anyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's stunning in terms of what it reveals since it directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI officials sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath and Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election in\nOther words he was a cut out he was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in effect you know its application then for the size of warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that\nEven the guy that put it together doesn't stand by but anyway the fights application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd by the way it seems now that it was done at the direction of Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton from the get go\nMuch by the way it would be entirely illegal for both the FBI and for Clinton what appears that they've done here how many times if I said this is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history\nNow you've got numerous officials after the OJ and the FBI have told us under oath that nobody at the FBI ideal Jay knew anything about the Democratic party\nBeing behind all this Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes is he was on with Maria ... I think on Sunday said well now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats in the Clinton campaign\nFeeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nSo it appears that the FBI and department of justice we're doing the Clinton campaign's bidding in applying for the price of warrant to snoop on Trump's campaign communications\nAnd they did so by getting the size of warrant to spy on Carter Page which means that with Hillary's without a Hillary's involvement here\nThey wouldn't have been a ... an application to spy on the Trump campaign that wouldn't be fusion GPS or a dusty a on Trump\nIn terms of financial sort of hold me today is not one to ... that's not one to ... my\n... Miller [noise]\nDo the bigger bombshell to come out of again we were busy last week with the capital issue but the bigger bomb\nThat come out of the testimony of James Baker memories the top legal counsel at the FBI\nHas to do with the issue that we discussed three weeks ago which was Rod Rosenstein saying that he wanted a surreptitiously record\nDonald Trump and maybe we can get some cabinet officials in both the twenty\nFifth Amendment anyway it turns out that\nNot long after that twenty Seventeen meeting where Rod Rosenstein reportedly discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with President Trump remember this was this was chronicle by both\nThe deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe in and his lawyer Lisa Page That's Peter strokes boy friend\nThey went into the office of a third FBI official a girlfriend rather sorry Lisa Page was\nIt was she was his boy\nHe was her she was his girlfriend alright enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third FBI official general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump after Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through\nIntermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it\nThe thing that struck me the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source\nClose to the investigation of of bakers house interview he was saying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but as he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one\nStatement says they got along you know fine but\nYou know Rod Rosenstein is up to his eyeballs and everything involving this thing [noise]\n[noise]\nOn average Denison US ambassador to the United nations Nikki Haley is resigning from the Trump Administration meeting with President Trump at the White House so they said it was an honor to serve our maverick's\nFighting for our pay that\nRelease expected to leave her post before the end of the year hurricane Michael continues to strengthen as it approaches the Gulf Coast a FEMA official says the region can expect damaging winds heavy rain deadly storm surge and power outages\nIt's time to prepare is now a please we want to re emphasize or to eat those local warnings as they know best for our citizens that are visitors uh Florida Gulf Coast storms\nExpected to make landfall tomorrow along the Florida Panhandle the number of people killed in Haiti from a magnitude ... earthquake has risen to Seventeen more than three hundred others have\nBeen injured this is Fox News [noise]\nYou know critters are more than annoying and they can do damage maybe you've noticed a mole hole or an ant hill next two or ... in an under your driveway likely\nYou now have substantial air pockets under your driveway if you suspect voids underneath your external concrete don't put off having it inspected\nWeaken stabilizing support I'm supporting concrete Colo country basements systems to get back on solid ground for free evaluation ... pound to fifty and use the key word foundation [noise] summer\nJoined in Savannah bananas as we give you a banana beach bash October thirtieth\nYou a one day be official an original Jimmy Buffett tribute\nMuch more I don't miss out on all the crazy non stop entertainment we have for ya so make sure you get those tickets right now I'd W. W. W. dot ... dot com bust [noise]\nJob and they see why [noise]\n\nTraining swab ... at a time this is Sean Hannity show\nI twenty five 'til the top of the hour scary hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit land at a category three\nA and there's a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined Fort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of started the official weatherman other Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I say I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City\nOr that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage it there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf but\nA week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area\nNow the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins and mobile I don't think this is a big deal immobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain\nBut once you start moving east southeast went down the coast and especially at that Panama City area this is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area the weather pattern you remember Florence was off its peak\nHit the north Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a at least that strong category three perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean to look to the average person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much why does the angle of the storm matter\nIt's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming into powder in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency it's maps came out and said look out October fifth\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic face it you notice all the typhoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely and he said well what is it has to do with us well when the action stops there like a good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to camp I\nOwe or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and once we got so last Thursday and friday you know I'd been shown knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto\nWe hit it off to the east over there with sports this is going right in between and instead of coming western North West setting it's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nA lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain\nComing Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between K Patterson Norfolk go right out to sea to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it\nBut it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas or because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force along the outer banks and forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia\nUh Augusta places like that as it moves so but it's going to accelerate through there where we are looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City that is ground zero for the worst part of this storm\nAnd you know people are going to do they're going to make it there and use the California health system now remember California already has a state income tax of Thirteen and a half percent\nYou know add that to a federal income tax and the fact that you can no longer the duck after the tax cut plan passed you can no longer caught or duct rather your state income taxes on your tax return means that if you do make money in California you're paying that much more in taxes\nSo the people of California are hit harder than any other state in the United states and New York is where I Am is right behind them\nJust ridiculous the amount of the burdens that they're putting on the people of California and Dianne Feinstein is up for reelection it's going to be interesting to see if ah Gavin Newsom will pull her down in terms of the polls but anyway we'll we'll have to watch that race a little more closely and see what happens all the way we do have\nAn attempt by the ... Democrats now threatening to impeach and continue the investigations into judge Kavanaugh and um they want to now begin the process of teaching them to the house Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler\nWill just strongly implied impeachment would be on the table of Democrats take over the lower chamber in the midterms\nIs there anybody in the Democratic party that's running on any agenda item that would make\nMake America great for the people in the country or they offering anything to make for better America for anybody\nMorgan Stanley said the belief in American exceptionalism among global investors has never been higher\nOrgans daily guy by the name of Mr ... Sharma was on CNBC said this year has been the story about how well America has done all any of the example of an American exceptionalism\nQuote we may or may not believe in American exceptionalism but the financial markets have never believed it it's just such an extent and then he went on to add as the head of emerging markets and the chief global strategist Morgan Stanley investment management\nIs global from is four hundred and Seventy four billion in assets under management as of June thirtieth twenty Eighteen\nAnd the strong accountant economy has been touted by people like Larry Kudlow called it the hottest economy in the world but there's no doubt it's for the proof is in the ... um you know it was an interesting piece by my buddy Hugh Hewitt Trump may be outside of our norms but he is the feeding for all of us\nAnd I I just read a little bit of the article I didn't finish it yet but I think what he's saying there was a point that I've been making as well except in a different way and that is that if you look at any criticism of Donald Trump it's all stylistic stuff\nSo I'm Out of style they don't like that is combative they don't like that he breaks dishes they don't like that he fights they don't like that he is at times not polite\nUm they don't like that he is a disruptor ... class they've got their image of how a president needs to behave in an act in what they should say and that they shouldn't be tweeting and this and that\nThe problem with that has to be get rid of that side of Donald Trump you get rid of what we elected\nThe disruption is good breaking dishes in a swamp like DC is ending up being a good thing for the American people that's why the jobs that are being created the millions of them the manufacturing that's coming back to the business environment has never been better\nThe security that we are now obtaining the better trade deals that we are now\nLocking down it's all good for the American people\nI don't know why

Fox one by Sarah quarter won by John Solomon\nSolomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell for her FBI general council member James Baker\nHe was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss then acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ...\nAnd Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president using the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCabe had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the\nUn quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed that the source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI or member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel this was just in the timeframe around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements throw spokes person is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress\nAnswer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates and already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there now we've got to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ in their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCain\n\nBooze I'm rich Dennison President Trump today announcing he's accepted the resignation of Nikki Haley from her

corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to seek ... secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the hoped she'd say something that they could use and then and vote the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker said it Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWe use ... pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department and the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but\nJames Baker also telling Congress last week member of

right I mean you cannot use double triple quadruple here say from anonymous sources to launch an account or intelligence investigation that is strictly prohibited yet shown that is exactly what the FBI and the de OJ did and what John\n... exactly right there you know there was a guy that testified a few weeks ago that they can get a lot of attention on script guy but his name is bill priest that\nHe was ... strokes boss she was the chief of counter intelligence that the FBI he told\nHe told the congressional uh a committee that at the time they were submitting pricing using that

right\nRight um you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for long term care insurance just for the big thing and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last you know really it's ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled more we need to do is ensure less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility at Seventy in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches and emergency you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about and a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this modern last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nAnd what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck ah docks where a patient care foundation\nSo now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation is a physician or on health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in back of the table to have conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice of health are pushing me was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create a ... tour you know and we're ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWas ... medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about health insurance we're using it for all and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for service because they just are helping shots\nWondering ensuring if using insurance drives up the cost of the product so ... cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using her your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized\nAnd your co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so you know I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversation from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care I think that you're real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on this topic\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars per year or a month a month so\nAnd the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician their heads and California is to send him an originality\nThis throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it the what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get much cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you actually looking at ways that are fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care is you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well mama care made that illegal\nOr so something mental stretching just brought blocked or expanded access to these major medical plan called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses for Seventy five dollars a month or\nTwo but what it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas MD and they have a preexisting condition or ... or do you deny them service\nThat everybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson over and not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\nBoy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership\nWe do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those because they're going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nWell they're gonna have to move to New York because they don't make it easy but they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the a few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that would be an amazing model it it would cut down there\nRight let's take your New York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills a blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I can and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than what\nAbout Lindsey Graham is saying that why don't we block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've given your money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that because we've wage you down with regulatory burden so we're going to cut those strings and just give you the money and say go forth and do the best job that you can\nMake a quick break we'll come back more Dr Josh amber outlets MD and Dr Lee as grows president ah docks for a patient care foundation\nThe we're fresh leadership ... past events coming up on Wednesday October the twenty fourth write it down hosted by our friends at expressed pros dot com or they're celebrating their

were shocked\nBut the wholesale\nCost of that medicine is six dollars\nSo we're waiting the whole system with paperwork and and ... you need to streamline in in ... and innovate just like Silicon
