[laughter] yeah [noise] hey my point is ah today a\nWith Hillary's comments at a base of liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote I came across years ago and maybe even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving towards civility for barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism again just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism\nOr civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of either trending toward civility or barbarism off the clocks and the oh it's a constant blocks and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their\nA character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh the ante a violent shooting\nThere's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democrat Party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all good and fine and dandy one more thing then\nI think it was a before the Nineteen forties\nAnd don't know what why are they what not when what were they what were they light when the Democrats were the Democrat Party of your dad or your grandpa what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time their basic um issue was a labor laws and um when\nYou have what purpose\nMy point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in anti capitalism\nHas been rooted in pro socialism in big government they've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in on militant and violent socialism to achieve their means my boys they're not\nThat different there just masking less today\nYou know read about it in the paper tomorrow Raj Shah Mickey I be met for\nCyber criminals cyber bad guy is going to attack your laptop your tablet your smartphone without you even knowing or they can steal your identity and you may not realize it until it's too late\nThat's why don't lifelike identity theft protection now includes the power of Norton Security to help protect your identity and your devices\nLifelike uses proprietary technology to help detect a range of threats to your identity and Norton Security protects against online threats like ransomware or malware and if there is a problem lifelike with Norton has agents\nWho will work to fix it now no one can prevent all identity theft\nOr cyber crime or monitor transactions that all businesses but new life like with Norton Security provides more detection and more protection against cyber threats gotta lifelike dot com recall eight hundred and four forty forty eight thirty three years the ... rush\nFor an additional ten percent off your first year plus a twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with and you will that Roman terms apply\nThese next three and now more rush on news radio Ninety seven point seven at twelve Ninety am UT K as [noise] okay folks\nAnd that's the way we operate and if this wrong sometimes it is if you find out is anything incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nMr Rosenstein decided we couldn't get it until your report came out he sat on it for a month of\nSometime I Can't speak to how they were not the first\nTime Mr Rosenstein has kept us from getting the information needed information from the project in all kinds of important conversation between struck compete you redacted them from its way to go with the Justice Department find it so this would be the first time he has given us information frankly I think we're in ... I'm going to real well we've got thirty seconds in our time to get into another subject carrier\nMr I'm which I'm I'm proceed down but I Do think it's interesting that you had you discovered it and we couldn't get it right away my call the other text messages we had to wait until the final report\nRight now we're to Sean Hannity show toll free number is eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program what we played their Rod Rosenstein you know for people that did wrong in the D. O. J. face consequences\nRegarding fights that well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nSolomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell for FBI general council member James Baker\nHe was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe\nRemember McCain and Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president using the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCabe had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote\nAs far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed that a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI I remember that you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel as soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements throw spokes person is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress\nAnswer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates an already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays Baron extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease ... an investigative reporter is what the hell rag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe've got a first start with the ... the timeline is may twenty Seventeen well that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein\nJust before that we had people like ... Lisa Page and and Peter Struck talking about uh media leaks strategy that had to do with the ...\nWell it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes\nAnd again ... all it was was the dot CA recycled in different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah ... taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nIf there's one other event that occurs and that may timeframe that really I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director of it all out all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from Margaret in may and they don't have anywhere from a proving any form of collusion with Russia for nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe led to agents who have an anti Trump fires read that investigation he get fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that the roses are McKay and a stroke page\nIt's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove confident in what will record him and uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment this is not what the FBI with ... through I'm sure I could talk about history his book\nLays out a real possibility that this was a softer right look at this ... they're not investigating a crime here that in\nFact they can't find a crime by a pay as\nWell at least the pages testimony just to be clear she said they ... they had found nothing in nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ... it says that job for the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nPeace by John Solomon last week and investors business daily also laying out all the evidence\nA chilling indictment of how this political criminal not only managed to escape indictment but was somehow able to weaponize the FBI and the deal Jay all to destroy your duly elected president President Trump and last week the ... of course we have the FBI general counsel Baker reporting\nDirectly to former FBI Director called me telling congressional investigators that an attorney from ... law firm gave him materials member that's the law firm that she funneled money to\nAbout Russian election interference during the twenty six team presidential campaign so stunning revelation since it directly contradicts the Justice Department and the FBI officials sworn testimony I Will take a break we'll come back more Greg Jarrett John Solomon this is\nThe biggest abuse of power in history got to get this and understand how deep this goes will continue on the other side and you're listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show we'll have more of your favorite gas topics and memorable moments that's all coming up\n[noise]\nSo with your back against the wall and her birthday or anniversaries just days away who do you trust one eight hundred flowers dot com right now when you order a dozen red or multi colored roses twenty nine Ninety nine\nOne eight hundred flowers dot com we'll give you another doesn't end up vase absolutely free the choice between gorgeous red or multi colored roses is absolutely yours one eight hundred flowers dot com click on the radio icon but in my last name Hannity one eight hundred flowers dot com promo code Hannity this offer ends on friday\nHigh ... one of the biggest outrageous I've reported on the trial of abortion doctor Kermit costs now how the woman goes into a clinic comes down and there's no police report I helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions\nNatural course of the movie is amazing Cormac God's smell is perhaps the most ...

part of the program\nTo big breaking developments as it relates to the biggest abuse of power a scandal in American history one\nHas to do with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein member he recommended the firing of combing number two we was the one that that recommended the special counsel Robert Mueller number three is also the guy that signed the fourth financial advisor warrant\nOther words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associate\nOn that we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI ideal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation\nAll corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to ... secretly recorded conversations with President Trump\nAnd the ... say something that they could use and then vote the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker's set it Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWe as a pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but James Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firms Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS and research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... same dossier that was never corroborated a verified but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associates\nAnd it gets worse than that it was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used when our understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a ... coup either lawyers who've guy by the name of Michael ... directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael suspend handy to Baker documents\nAbout Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenties sixteen election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton the FBI knew he was a go between and this particular instance\nNow the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it why did they lie about it and affect the application for the Pfizer warrant\nWiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI ... weren't under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants\nAnd permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and Greg Jarrett continue with us or anything I'm saying here that is wrong\nJared you've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian collusion two people\nAre on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who composers it totally fabricated phony document\nBased on supposed Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data\nAs well as documents to the FBI and so this\nThe first one of the center I Ron well\nI saw the home for Sean Hannity and so bad news radio that is going to\n\nHard as we continue John Solomon of the hill investigative reporter Greg Jarrett number one New York times best selling author of the Russian hoax of Tony Russia investigation was based on her own verified on corroborated bought and paid for dot CA all of the all the media elite strategy to destroy Trump before the election\nOh hookers in a bad urinating and the and the rich and Moscow\nAnd then literally leaking it strategically to get the special counsel may you know using the same source of information but making it appear like there are numerous sources here so they're all saying the same thing so creating enough smoke so that there would be right fire\n'em and all the FBI guys they all knew it wasn't true from the beginning Lisa Page even testify to that fact\nThat's right I mean you cannot use double triple quadruple here say from anonymous sources to launch an account or intelligence investigation that is strictly prohibited yet shown that is exactly what the FBI and the de OJ did and what John\n... exactly right there there's a there's a guy that if I had a few weeks ago that they can get a lot of attention on script guy but his name is bill priest that\nHe was ... strokes boss she was the chief of counter and travel to accept the FBI he told\nHe told the congressional uh a committee that at the time they were submitting defy using that information from Christopher ... they had just gotten vetting it hadn't been and yet the standard for the five is it must be substantiated before you can submit it to the court records it exactly right\nThey they ... process and yet they're using it presenting it as a statue to verify the court when you look at this\nPoint they willingly lied before a buys a port and light it as an advisor court application and they also purposely withheld key information like have you back that Hillary pay for it or how much of these are crimes here\nOh you know just the fights alone is deprivation of rights under color of law known as abusive power so-so perjury because they signed off on it or under penalties for perjury it's obstruction of justice\nIs also a conspiracy to defraud the government to fight the court\nIs in existence because when we\nGet all these fires applications John that the president said he wanted the class or non redacted\nWhen are we going to get the war and so what are we going to get the thrill to those we don't we know that Bruce or was working with Christopher Steele Christopher Steele is trying to pass on information about is phony lying ... even Robert Mueller for crying out loud\nThat's right but the president and I was listening for the Justice Department I mean the guy who said hey there might be some problems here we don't really watch that you that he should keep in mind this is the Justice Department that hit from the American public and the court for more than Eighteen months the fact that Hillary Clinton paid

America radio Saturday point to any of that fire took time out to\nHow vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics\nWith the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where Democrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox show you a racist besides you this you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics can easily Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time Sean in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then we're going to back you up and we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it\nBut based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a\nWe may have a a decent uh election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy that Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans could bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing was anathema to fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation a ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and uh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness stay just care about their own political agenda\nHowever misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cut in history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin or case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed split the and you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic guy I mean it it's a host\nAt a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have she end up this rage or not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me to think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapists Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime and literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he'd been he's been called trees as they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this that this American patriot and cabinet you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's space and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on\nOn a regular basis for Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that the toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned especially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to run the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than Brock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity\n'em and add money to their wallets into private or from government officials who loved just squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I didn't like what Kevin McCarthy introduced which was a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments that is a massive issue at this point it is it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age and the health of some of the justices that there is no doubt that will be vacancies in the in years to come in the near future\n... and don't forget showing that the circuits and the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut as Greg can tell you most of these cases that are ... importance to American businesses American individuals\nMoms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump already has\nWas uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to have to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat a you know they could come open if Trump wins reelection bid may come open I ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually\nWorried what will happen to the country if that seat if it gets very decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed would cabinet can you imagine what's going to happen if that seat comes open as a potential\nSix three conservative majority on the court\nI mean it is genuinely frightens me at it and again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen\nOf the United states in the hopes of getting something on tape but that might invoked the twenty Fifth Amendment those are the same Rod Rosenstein that is up to his eyeballs and conflict\nHaving written a letter and recommended the firing a James called me the same guy the signed the fourth and final buys a warrant that we should have on redacted I'm released the American

jeopardy too what Rosenstein really watches oh you know Mr good lot let's just you and I sit down and have a cup of coffee and we'll chat a little bit too if Rosenstein or July as as I suspect he might\nUm he doesn't he's not looking at a fashion misleading statement to Congress he's not looking at perjury because he can always deny the conversations that good ... remembers the ... which is why this is so critically important\nOr they've got they've got a subpoena him and they've got a demand to show up and they've got to put them under oath and these answers had given but\nUh I got to
