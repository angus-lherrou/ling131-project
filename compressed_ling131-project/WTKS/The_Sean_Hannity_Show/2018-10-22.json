chief meteorologist day Turley W\n\nW TK yes\nAnd I feel ... you know Fox News radio covers the world\nNews radio that he's seven points out of that\nIn numbers how many ... that appears to be part of the strategy for a caravan of migrants that started in Central America now an estimated seven thousand heading for the U.S border where they are willing to take their chances despite us efforts to stem the flow\nAnd then you've got a case an allegation made about Cory Booker now over the weekend on top of statements that his own words that he had made some years ago when he was Fifteen apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's\nHusband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this if you want to predict it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida it through a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida as important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got ... whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know run to set this up out of the great debate last night and he's now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax Gillum would support\nGillum is use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views he's trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected\nBy being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe in what they really want to fight for we saw that with Brett is said and the project ... tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason Brett is it is out there trying to convince the people of Tennessee that he is something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position I'm Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in\nMissouri with Claire McCaskill you know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony she goes on a an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets looks so Harvey tour with\nWith wings unbelievable but some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice costs\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody is against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have\nThat we have sovereignty and we're borders and they deserve to be respected and what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront\nAt the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry I mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone\nVictims of crimes some very serious including murder\nI mean it gets downright scary that we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing them throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare\nTheir fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less\nMillions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for inferior coverage we have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled or Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year a and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or a evaporating before his eyes even his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate\nHave faded in the final weeks of the twenty Eighteen electorate with the party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half hour we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house in the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away it looks like it's going to be Republican pickup Martha ... going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo that we have top Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations new Fox a poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about quote the blue wave\nSweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions amid fresh signs of the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom for as it was still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Iran dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black ... Marshall mixed Martha McSally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller hold this seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly a problem for the Republican Braun in the state of Indiana is well in his particular case she's got a libertarian in the race\nAnd that means that the libertarian is siphoning votes away from the Republican wrong Mike Braun is now claiming that\nYou know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now has him leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this an app to all of this this was an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is at an all time high but you know crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost\nDemocratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nI mean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and and we had four thousand people around there a moment at a huge crowd in Houston as well\nWe're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie Sanders is warning his party that there's no blue wave coming and he also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right\nAnd you've got to force the hypocrisy so we got the cabin on your shoe you got the caravan coming you've got more mobs over the weekend confronting and and showing nothing but mean spirited hostility to people that are trying to serve their country\nYou've got now two years of magnificent success record breaking jobs and opportunities for Americans it's where you have more safety and security are stronger president versus eight years of failure so we have a choice in this election\nAre slim to none Jeff ... also Fox News is\n\n\nThat\nWe ever afford out that the caravan has now grown according to the Washington Times fourteen thousand illegal immigrants marching towards our southern border the president\nJust spoke out about it let it play some of what he said at the bottom of this half hour out if those reports are all accurate it's a whole lot bigger than previously reported and growing\nAnd what you have is members of the caravan chanting guess we could as they're making their way through Mexico all day to day I've been defied the will of one country vowing to test the spine of another\nMexican police who failed to stop them at the country's border with Guatemala now service that sports that appears for the care of on as they know battling north\nAs members clear that they have no intention of staying in Mexico Leah buys for the U.S new estimates cited by L. universal which is a Mexican newspapers say the Caribbean now has fourteen thousand people many of them are already in Mexico while others still wait\nOh that would put them in the category of illegal immigrants not an asylum seekers because you're seeking asylum you have to seek it in the country that you first appearance they appear confident that\nThis confrontation is going to come down to this is this is extraordinarily dangerous for the country here but I Am telling you\nPolitically the American people fundamental is white Kavanaugh mattered they believe in the in the core values that this country was built on a due process and presumption of innocence they also believe that we are a nation of laws otherwise why have the\nAnd Americans think that really don't like the idea that people think they can march right across the border into our country we don't know who they are we don't know where they came from in some cases most cases we don't know what their intentions are\nNow the president has already said we're going to begin cutting off substantially or substantially reducing foreign aid or Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nAnd he says every time you see people illegally coming are attempting to come into the country blamed the Democrats for not giving us the boats to change our pathetic laws and that would mean building the wall that he wanted to build that we can get done\nOr the president just spoke out about this will play it when we come back with a lot to get to more than ... much more straight ahead\n[noise]\nNews

this border what twelve Thirteen so why why ever many times I have seen it it's wide open\nWhat are we gonna what's gonna happen if we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports is even helping the caravan or as make their way to our southern border\nResident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally that is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give to them\nBut the president's also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty\nThey're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies that allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally\nWe have one case this was a out there around you know it just I mean the ... it's basically a national emergency if you look at it\nYou have a Spanish language reporter who spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan and the

Bangladeshis were detained and an immigration facility though it's not clear what happened to them after their detention the borders in Central America not as strong as the U.S which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nOr said Anna on Univision\nThey cross from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country and yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nCan you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly [noise] um so you've got the care of and continuing their march now a couple of other things that you've got to understand here and there is a political thing\nHaving been to the border everywhere from the Rio Grande the San Diego\nHelicopter horseback boats all terrain vehicles you foot I've been out there I've seen even gang members arrested right in front of me while I was there saw an entire family from El Salvador arrested right in front of me\nUh I've been to the drug warehouses which I played it many times I've seen

dreams in this great nation\nThat's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happen and the and the possible political implications\nAnd motivations behind these things that's what bothers me the most and I think it is common sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing

congressional district can in the state of Pennsylvania and on November the sixty three term incumbent isn't a fight to keep that dream alive is going head to head with a liberal Democrat\nGeorge Scott for this newly drawn district and\nPerry won the last three terms in Congress by no fewer than twenty five percentage points but now because of uh Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision\nThey decided read do draw that state's congressional map it's a district that has a chance of flipping and as Perry has said he knows the people the fourth district I grew up with them so when the district was we redrawing it was heartbreaking\nBut that's the hand you're dealt and ah anyway a congressman Scott Perry is with us She's also a Freedom Caucus member and I wanted to give you an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting then they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have out this week that they wanted to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it a to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you've kind of highlighted some of the things that are doing of course the big thing they're doing which they're not just doing it to me you know in talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nUh it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it\nAnd that's this this whole thing about preexisting conditions and healthcare a show on you know they're the ones that screwed up our health care system and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a\nTwenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan and keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right and now they're blaming us for medicine it up um we try to repeal it of course you know what happened with John McCain put what thumbs down but\nYou know Sean when we fought the original Freedom Caucus in particular fought that original bill out of a you know the ... the replacement bill for Obamacare 'cause if you remember we're going to vote to repeal Obamacare\nAnd immediately repay replace it the original bill that deal with preexisting conditions among other things\nThe Mark Meadows Jim Jordan the whole crew\nYou know went and talked to the president talked or leadership it said you know we can't support this you can't have insurance companies denying people with preexisting conditions that we we got that right in the bill that we finally passed yet they're running this play book all across the country because they don't have anything else that we broke healthcare\nWell let's all hardly they tried to fix it\nWell millions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie is will Republicans didn't support preexisting conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific battle\nAnd in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill that was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate has gone I mean it all all Obamacare was was one huge redistribution scheme where are you going to have the young and healthy literally buying plans

Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he's at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any better than your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look what you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration in America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that\nCan do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is that you cannot system ties\nThrough a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders in her kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she's do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat\nTelling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after in uh Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor in distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here but there's no moderation left\nEither ... and the Democratic party ... used to I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nIf you're losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society or even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they meet contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people which happened to me it's happened to me on\nCollege campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it but the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf east professor Sean or liberal but about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the ...\nYeah All right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is whether Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs are and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs in eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps and so dramatic turn around and they're back happily working\nAnd some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back\nAnd listen we're all big supporters

class [laughter]\nMan for the state house in the Senate\nI left and your son is in the spring\nMartha McSally and I approve this message\nAre we have a big race going on in the great state of Arizona Fifteen days from now glad you're with us twenty five to the top of the hour that was put out by Martha mix Sally a war hero and her background or experience was pretty unbelievable here also watching an Arizona this caravan\nAre headed right towards our southern border has become well a big big issue\nWe have a couple of things that have literally taking the people of Arizona back\nFirst instead of a once calling Arizona the meth lab of democracy and the people of Arizona crazy a inviting Arizona State university the radical attorney for the blind shake you know that blind shake involved in the what the bombings in America\nUm she had no problem with Americans joining the Palo bond\nMartha McSally confronted her in the recent debate and said well you apologize you would not apologize and accusing troops of torture and that's only part of it and then on top of that we have the latest development cinema once attacked BS stay at home moms ... off their husbands\nThese women who lack like staying at home ... their husbands or boyfriends and just cashing checks to some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life is fairly judgmental you would think\nMartha ... with us ah Martha how are you\nHey John I'm doing great thanks for having me on\nWell I think I'm happy with the last two polls one had you up by seven want to do it by two ah but ah I frankly after these latest revelations in the last two weeks about Christ and send them I Would imagine that your polls are going to go higher\nAnd Sean well it it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed in her mocking Arizona an air extremism on so many issues as being an earth but\nThe Arizona local media is protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are us turning it into a TV ad\nAh the fact that she's still hanging in there is really ridiculous so out of step with Arizona values and American values are you rattled off a number of\nUh a number of things that would have a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nAh the here we are way down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past\nThis qualifying statement you know compared to nice to have been twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms that are way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know well you served abroad post nine eleven correct\nYes sir I was a a ten pilot I was just fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly a fighter jet in combat uh and then the first to command a fighter squadron in combat I've had six deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan\nA hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was an absolute honor of my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear ... cinemas say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the Taliban nearly died\nA son when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harbored al ... who can and killed three thousand Americans sense then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include you know truthful I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them in our eight ten but often times uh you know the the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there is no this is silence there and everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show",
