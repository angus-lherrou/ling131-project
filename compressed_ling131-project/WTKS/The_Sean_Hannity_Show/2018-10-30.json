hundred and thirty five so they're all important\nEvery ... every one of you listening to my vote I don't care if you think your congressmen a safe or not you better get out and vote\nBecause otherwise if you don't vote that's pretty much a vote for Nancy Pelosi and if you have a Senate race going on in your state that's a vote for Chuck Schumer\nThe second potential outcome is a split decision\nSplit decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate gain a couple seats and Nancy Pelosi them become speaker\nAnd Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam Schiff is a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... chairman analyze your Cummings the chairman and it's endless investigations into one of the most\nUnbelievable things that we're watching unfold here\nIs what we got this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think even want to warn you of what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides you know just seeing a phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children throw granny over the cliff\nJust when you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country is pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because it's every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats and if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend\nAnd not even tell the people there viewers that well the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel and the same people you\nKnow St Trump cause this promise responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show a desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate you know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about polls a little bit\nIn the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking on both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the word speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan Wisconsin anyone both of them\nAnd the media nobody they weren't candy\nBecause they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else I remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate and he goes why do you believe that and then I told them the story about two thousand and four\nWhere the median again the polls came back and George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back in you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty four team you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seat difference but because Republicans have the majority\nOf ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend his like thirty seats that they call toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself and the only thing that can make a\nDifference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're going to feel a week from tonight I mean when the if you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting well it's pretty clear Hillary I think it's going to bring on our presidents Frank Luntz who's reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen\nAnd I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true it turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data I had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election remember Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival\nBecause in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the get government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more the expert says a short us a hundred percent certainty and twenty forty Republicans are going to\nAnd I just know when we're in the fight and I just you know I have a natural gut instinct to always want to play like I'm behind play hard\nAnd the way you play hard in this case is you make a decision now\nThat you're going to vote for the Republican congressmen in your district\nCheck out my website the if you're in one of those key pivotal tip the balance of power districts they're the most important but every seat is important\nAnd when you vote no that if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for ... if you vote for a Republican and if you're you're voting to keep the status quo of economic growth and prosperity and a strong national defense and build a border wall\nYou know if you both for any democratic senator you just voting for Schumer it'd be a vote for reticence McCaskill Nelson\n... Joe Donnelly cinema you vote for any of the pastor you're voting for Schumer [noise]\n\nNews I'm rich Dennison seem to Boston mobster James Whitey Bulger's dead found unresponsive this morning in West Virginia federal prison Fox is colonel Scott Bolger was\nConvicted in Massachusetts in twenty Thirteen after being on the run for sixteen years and sentenced to life for racketeering money laundering and gun possession among other charges\nThe eighty one year old Bolger I've just been moved to the west Virginia facility in the past day is cause of death not yet made public with the mid term elections just a week away President Trump creating some controversy over ... plans to issue an executive order ending citizenship for some immigrant children born in the country which has a right given under the fourteenth amendment\nSuch an executive literally almost certainly be challenged in the federal courts which would then decide whether the fourteenth amendment applies to undocumented immigrants Fox's John decker at the White House\nThis is Fox News [noise]\nOh hey boss hey what'd you do in their sunshine well look at this took that plug and play along system from that house we broke into last night's okay when you do that for those things away much\nCivil do installs simple for us to buy that simply temple yeah too bad they touch admit to\nTell me about it that would make my life less ... no joint communique to know forty five second unless response time\nNew video monitoring those seats\nTouch ab every time I turn around St touch it happened again rude that campaign staying why can't everything and like beating him grill if that was the case we would never cooked from us model stay away from the say touch how's your\nWife have saved a child in my I'm Lester Jackson president said security system you know when these are technology more off rice costs they touch to Haiti Seventy three eighty six eighty two more good if they got that guy\nSaid touch a license number L B.

an Eighteen year high was Bloomberg spending all this money\nThrowing him at at democratic candidates so the Democrats can take back the house because we haven't had this kind of economic prosperity growth for all these years now we've got four million new jobs eight million fewer Americans on food stamps and in poverty\nWe've got more opportunity than we've had it over a decade for crying out loud things are growing by leaps and bounds why would we want to stop that's what the mid term elections should be about\nBloomberg owns eighty eight percent of Bloomberg go that was a pretty quick thing I'm here's an interesting article so the president and millennia go to Pittsburgh today after the terrible\nShooting in the synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday and no one in the media and all the people in the media there actually blaming Donald Trump for this it's outrageous it is\nUgly it is twisted it is sick it is the family story and frankly there there's there's gotta be some legal standard at some point that you ought to be able to sue for such slander and\nLibel as comments like this anyway Jeffrey Myers the pits Pittsburgh rabbi who watched eleven of his congregants gun down during their Saturday services saying he's now become the political targeted and he's receiving hate mail\nFor saying he would welcome the president to his place of prayer it's unbelievable anyway you had all these wonderful people they're going to praise God and a temple and their gun down\nAnyway the organization told reporters they now have received three phone calls today a loan from a non identified man swearing and angry at them they wouldn't elaborate exactly what the caller said they did tell reporters that it was anti Semitic and pro Trump\nWell the guy powers that was responsible for this murder and terror in the synagogue\nWas anti Trump and his run Gerber has said the ambassador to Israel as a Bebe Netanyahu has said you know they've never heard any one president ever say stand up that if you destroy\nOur friends our allies in Israel we will destroy you which by the way is the way it should be you don't get to kill innocent men women and children in a synagogue\nIt's unbelievable the ... the race the rushed to politicize pretty much anything and everything\nThat is Donald Trump\nYou know the rabbi set on CNN Trump is my president he's always welcome to visit\nYou know ever since yesterday morning of the fake news fraud media's been circulating what is just the nation's why that somehow Pittsburgh's rabbis didn't want the president to visit and pay his respects after the massacre rose\nTenant friend of this program she was on with those yesterday you know she exposed this is their hateful garbage a broad that it is and saying those comments come from you know some fringe group but not from that not representative of anybody the mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community\nThe Jerusalem Post today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever they're not it's not mainstream it's a political group and they want to give them any attention\nAnd then anyway anyway so they invited a I guess and interviewed rabbi Jeffrey Myers he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful\nI mean how pastors in ... and you know people the cloth are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know\nIt takes a very special anointed person to be that kind of person Donald Trump's my president the president of the United states is always welcome to visit\nSupporters hailed as fast as an equally hateful ideology\nAnd CNN and it's unbelievable she says well my comments or ... that's all we've heard all weekend\nAnd then you get fake news\nPresident Jeff Zucker lecturing the president on rhetoric in the village this is his network every second minute hour of every day it's anti Trump\nThen that idiot hump the dumped the you know who is basically the\nSpokesmen for soccer ... over the weekend as a guest we played some of those yesterday said oh Hannity's responsible for the violent actions deranged individual when in fact we have on this program we have for the last\nMonth and warning people the rhetoric too hot and they need to calm down because you could see this coming with you know we can't be civil kick them out running women at a restaurant Sarah Sanders Pam Bondi Christ the Nielsen and Mitch McConnell Ted Cruz and his wife\nYou know in uh Boulder thrown through Kevin McCarthy store\nYou know you could see the hostility about all things conservative Republican\nYou know I call for security and peace and people do take out their differences at the ballot box\nBut that doesn't stop them they're so desperate to get noticed\nSo desperate to help their democratic allies and friends when one week from today it's\nPathetic frankly it's slander and then all of its self now we've got to get\nTo the point in this country if you get slander you ought to be able to sue and have a chance to win to prove the absence of malice well how about an absence of research because if they ever listen to watch they see a very different Sean Hannity than the caricature that they paid\nWhen do you notice it was ... to us in the news media I could not believe\nI was on the front cover of the national Enquirer it's on stands all over the country and they were fair to me they actually quoted me a hundred percent accurately which never happens\nDid you notice that I did notice that it's pretty remarkable what can you put that up on a manatee dot com and hopefully be you go to a local grocery store the national Enquirer was fair to me totally fair colder me a hundred percent accurately\nSo okay and then at different points that I Want to make sure I

investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's going to happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that arranged that New York junk get paid for a for a night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAndrew didn't pay a dime of that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under wrote a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaign nine twenty sixteen I was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you have reported that after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks CYA so it'll be interesting to report\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and in in a response to those subpoenas uh one of the lobbyist attorneys release that said the public so\nForty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation but Sean you tell me what other reads and what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it snow out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew Gillum pick this guy knowing\nThat he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum\nHe is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders\nWhich is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement targeting Israel they actually say Israel's a genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of Andrew strongest supporters\nAndrew to this day opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nAnd when a Israel fought back against the Moffett fats and may ah Gillum blamed Israel he said oh they just use those attacks as a pre tax to be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is in a relief endurance organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida ah they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice\nAnd that the police needs to be funded they paid they said to us as the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor or replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their words with socialists principles that are so radical make Nicolas Maduro flush so\nHe signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifesto so that's just who he is he believes in what they're doing is endorsed them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June saying that he's pleased I'm proud to sneak food to dream defender activists during\nA thirty day sleeping protested the Florida State Capitol referring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical groups\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement they're anti free enterprise they're anti military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point now\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized healthcare\nHe is the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment plan it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them out of government single plan so it really a fan the arrangements have millions and millions of Floridian that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people are burned and to force them to be on the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to what's the impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business says and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works in high tax states\nThey're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that when I'm governor buddy of Andrew has his way he'll stop the flow of investment coming in to Florida because people are going to invest if you have the highest tax rate and the southeast\nAnd actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and he also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish meant a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on while biting Floridians a duty to retreat so somebody for criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back\nYou also support legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does\nWell I mean it you're just looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids down there I mean I've got to believe would this controversial background like it looks like a almost a phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him\nAnd his record I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media is ignoring who he really is\nOh without question I mean the day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they've tried to elevate him and try to make him into this great candidate um they do not like the scrutinize his record uh the fact that those documents dad release after he lied and the debate last Sunday\nOr the media kind of had to cover that buy at the end of the day he\nHas been given very kid glove treatment so really falls to me and other folks to go out and make the case and let people know and the good news is just one Floridians figure that out uh they definitely don't want him as their governor and so we're going to keep making the case for the next week\nI'm worried about our friends not only the recovery of thoughts and prayers go to all our friends in the panhandle\nUm uh but the panhandle to so many people whose lives have been up ended and disrupted and some people losing pretty much everything they own and they now moved out the panhandle happens to be one of the most conservative areas of Florida are you concerned that people\nFrom the panhandle of going to be able to get their hands on a ballad maps and tea or otherwise would maybe be part of early voting is Florida doing anything to assist in and help those people that have been displaced would want to vote in this election because Florida is their home\nThey're doing a lot of everything from mobile voting sites to accommodations for absentee ballot\nYou know the bad news is that you said it was a terrific stormed the good news is I think all but about Fifteen thousand homes are going to have power by the weekend\nA which we weren't sure if that happened that quickly um and I know the rest of

he's been in office by the way since ... twenty Fifteen\nRunning against the Democratic challenger Katie Hill and a ton of money now we see millions and millions of dollars coming from former New York city Mayor Bloomberg\nWho is supporting all of the Democratic candidates in California\nAnd why not I mean Governor Brown is doing such a bang up job with the people that state anyway he joins us now congressman how are you\nShone I'm doing well thanks for having me on\nI have identified myself about six seven races especially in Southern California Darryl ISIS old seat Dana Rohrabacher seat\nA Duncan Hunter see that really are seeing a fortune in your seat thrown at them in terms of\nThese are really being targeted as tipping point races at in terms of the balance of power in Washington one week from today uh how much money is being thrown at against you and towards your opponent\nWell I think I'd go back to that old the old commercial for a kind of hot sauce and say New York city because that's what's happening in my district a New Yorkers are throwing a ton of money out here I think we're now number one in California for most money being spent in a congressional district\nOr that's not something I Want it but uh that's what I got and ah but we're running well we're uh we're doing what we do\nYou know what do you think the ... what was in the bottom line is they're throwing money and they're running negative ads because negative ads work and money helps get out the vote you know they'll use that for you know people knocking on doors they'll use it to tax people they use it to reach out a hundred different ways\nAnd I put you at a decided disadvantage now I kind of believe in freedom of speech and spending ones money the way they want is freedom of speech but why Michael Bloomberg former New York city mayor is so obsessed with California's congressional races are obviously he doesn't like Donald Trump\nI think that's probably the reason but he's also look at it districts that he thinks he can he can do something there uh this is\nThis has been a held by Republicans for very long time and we're going to win the seat but uh yeah there's a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's coming in here it's it's got to a saturation point now where people are just so upset\nI think people get wet up with it and they tune it out like I Do I mean they they're not going to listen to it any more\nThey go from their mailbox to the trash can and then they bring their at their bills and there are other male um and it's it's just so much out here right

get free health care a great job Gavin Newsom watch this implode on Californians it's got to be ugly and the mass exodus out of California will even continue\nAt a greater clip and a greater pace you know so now what's happened is somehow we forgot that what eight years of Obamacare Americans slowly beginning to forget that their premiums are have gone up three four hundred percent in some cases\nForgetting that they only have one choice of a health care provider forgetting that they lost their doctor from long ago that they really liked and wanted\nAnd they forget that\nPeople with a pre existing conditions well with Obamacare you pay more higher premiums than any other plant\nRate hikes that nobody ever expected and they lie to you about people losing their doctors that was a lie you like it Dr keep your doctor people losing their plans with no choice anymore and\nThis has now become and the final week of the election this is their talking points all across the country they're saying well we're we're going to where we support healthcare preexisting conditions\nWell the Republicans repeal replace planned supported preexisting conditions and they're trying to basically go with the narrow lie that Republicans want you to die\nRepublicans want dirty or water dirty air\nThey want to kill children they want to throw granny over the cliff of course they're racist sexist massage sticking Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic oh and by the way Donald Trump's responsible for the horrible shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh and Donald Trump so even though the guy that shot up the synagogue he's hated Donald Trump\nFor being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts\nGet in a way of a good propaganda lie in an election year well anyway Republicans now\nWe're beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also direct primary care or what I call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining
