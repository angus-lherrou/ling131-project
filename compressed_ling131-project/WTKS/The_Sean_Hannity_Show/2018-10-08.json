remember because she's not sure she remembers\nA in the case of Julie sweat neck who who made the you know changed her story well Brett Kavanaugh gave out red solo cups and he was near the punch bowl and I saw him in a whole maybe not lined up in a hall\nUm which is very different from the these sworn affidavit that they had originally laid out a week before I mean you ... if you look at that but in the prosecutor's office what are they going to say\nWell are they going to say a these are all frivolous accusations but uh as far as we know regarding doctor for that one nine or ten witnesses interviewed and people are going to say well there were so many more who didn't weren't interview it's not the number of interviews\nIt's the what they have to say and if it's all cumulative you don't if you don't count the witnesses and but I think some of those other people as I say now I'm going to want to have their twenty four hours in the sun\nOr you know in the in the same and they're going to want to go to the national Enquirer or something like that but there are no criminal there no criminal cases are no civil cases a good man was confirmed is now a justice and we need to move on\nLet's talk about the news that we are pretty confident as coming out this week um let me just say this very up to sleep I can\nThat if a top ranking FBI official war to confirm that there was an

this was all a hoax the Russia hopes and it wasn't Trump Russia collusion\nAnd that would mean Greg Garrett was right from the get go but yeah I\n... and and yes and the latest information only corroborate the thesis of the book\nThere there wasn't Trump Russia collusion but there was Hillary Clinton Russia collusion she had on her payroll British spy a who is using Russian sources and now we've learned through the interview behind closed doors if James Baker the top\nUh FBI lawyer\nThey documents were being passed to him from Hillary Clinton lawyer and the ... lawyer\nA shoe you know this is astonishing information uh and in fact we've also learned that you know this was part of the vice a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign none of it\nWas corroborated a federal regulations are very clear you may not have met the Fisk\nInformation and evidence that is on corroborated and yet that is precisely what they did and so I agree with you when these documents are classified and the inspector general has it has had enough time to look at them and decide I think they will be explosive\nIs there any way that Rod Rosenstein who signed the fourth buys a warrant you know the basis of bulk of the information in the ... the application John was the\nUnverified are uncorroborated\nDot CA the political document that Hillary paid for I mean how is it possible that they passed for those that I mean that was and he has to be held accountable for that\nWell let's wait and see when the documents of declassified but the answer to your question does of course\nUh we talk about the president does not above the law and he's not but certainly knew there was the deputy attorney general but ah I see one thing a little bit differently and maybe we're going to segue into this and that is everything you're talking about should be thoroughly investigated\nBut I think it's separate from what the more people are doing and I think that the Mueller investigation can conclude by showing

O. J. what are known as real twos\nAnd those are the conversations between Bruce Oren Christopher Steele and we now know Christopher Steele was bundling information trying to get it to the special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann and Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker himself anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some doctors we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents for the department of justice from\nBut some key key documents including the so called McCabe memos which could very directly bear upon this question of a war with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the point when Robert Mueller as special counsel\nA and are these allegations that are in the New York times actually true ah I think that can be a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we'd been requesting\nFor quite some time are made public so as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or to say this week uh we are going to issue a subpoena\nOr to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos and some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page a tax ah\nThe ah the the Bruce or three of one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that's in the middle of all of\nThis and I said you know what the news is tomorrow you're getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened\nThere ... there we have people that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan in a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president I'm hearing a lot of ...\nThe ... coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is can be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work\nBrought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with I'm correct absolutely Sean yup yeah and then by intelligence I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other into community people for decades yes\nFor decades and I assume they like you and trust that you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments similar to any international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted you to spy on your country that you love no but I\nAgain I'm happy to share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah but what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hostile regime at and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that food does have a network of\nOf their own deep stayed operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you're talking about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead\nAt the DNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington who we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter at ... I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nEndless of first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I I first started getting phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ...\nThat they had the spies a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report or I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't ... I think\nMy first ran with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there is a ... a warrant on the Trump campaign or were you aware of our reporting at the time\n... it's funny Sean right interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know and these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox would they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but they again because it's all about you know media perception what are they asking\nYou at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing you win simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged\nRight absolutely well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right at the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to the ... about that did they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source\nFor the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there\nIs a an indictment of or or you know if someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back\nI Know media organizations have pulled lies about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some records for you\nWell I'd definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roadblock that has created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMy the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that you should write a book\nWhat it's like to be spied on by your government you know something to that if I'm Serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well\nBut I mean what does it feel like because I guess maybe there are some people because they took out the Warren on you do you have you ... do you know what they did they ask you about everything that you were saying and doing it this time basically yeah and I'm going back many years again at\nAnd we had talked about how many hours total do you think you've spoken to intel community FBI Muller all these people how many hours do you think you spent total\nOver the last two years out of the last two decades two years last two years well I mean in terms of actual in person meetings you know forty eight hours or something like that but you know when you add in the hundreds and hundreds of hours I had to do in terms of documents production etcetera right now that's a whole different level\nWhen you went before a mall or what was that like you know I don't I don't like\nTo talk about that ... just because in general they have been a less leaky in terms of getting the you know mentioning that fact but it was reported in December of twenty Seventeen December last year that I had a recently been in front of the grand jury and I won't I don't\nRemember that night but I Will I keep an eye back at all absolutely not and you haven't\nYou know and as the is it now they now stopped asking you questions one of the last time he got a call from anybody\n[noise] I haven't I haven't talked to anyone in twenty Eighteen oh\nAt all the whole year and it's like a year's worth of freedom\nRatio another way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nIt's in writing where he said in comparison to get a record Rachel approval only Val I'm thirty three year project transactions corporate confirmation conditions equal housing lender licensing office he said and I'm watching for thirty thirty additional conditions or exclusion may apply\nAmerican market live and he's lived tonight starting it\nThan it used to have a way I Am you just chaos\n\n\nCause you do have the elections are about one thing and as you showing up you have the power and this election is the most important in decades that's right just twenty nine days away that means your tax savings or on the ballot the economy's on the ballot are comeback is on the ballot\nYour jobs that's on the ballot your kids' future that's on the ballot wages for one case business owners your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest political issue at least one of them\nYou know these

you deserve\nTax cuts work dot com do your part don't get out work this November tax cuts work dot com go there now to continue with Carter Page who is with us in Studio today\nUm so tell me what the future lies you know for you and and I think this was all going to end soon as my gas and I don't think the I don't think the president was involved in any collusion he never was I think the big story here is the abuse of power I'm\nPutting the fiction for Hillary what happened to you with the ... the application mourns\nA I think the abuse of intelligence to weaponize of our intelligence is another big issue and I think there's a lot more to come I think when you hear the News Tomorrow I think you're going to be pretty shocked again that these things really did happen and I don't I in the end I don't want this to hurt law enforcement I Love law enforcement\nI Love oriental community but you can't turn the tools of intelligence as powerful as they are on the American people\nI I fully agree Sean and one of the big ... problems as you're alluding to is secrecy right so much is just undercover and\nYou know and even as funny over those ten plus hours of lab in last March when I was talking with the FBI agents you know eventually they were asking me a lot of questions and then as as we went further and further into the interviews towards the end of the er the long conversations they started saying\nWell our bosses and want to [laughter] you know they I think they saw through it but they knew you know that was back during the ... era\nAs maybe one of the lessons never go visit Russia ever [laughter] don't go to a lot of ... Russia stay out well President Trump has done a lot\nTo fix that situation I think you know those are his his courage I I'm inspired by that and I think there's even that is going to be fixed over time I'm confident Carter Page\nThanks for being with us we always appreciate you being here eight hundred ... a number of thank you sir\n[noise]\n\nBooze I'm rich Dennison\nPresident Trump urging Florida residents to takes all precautions necessary as hurricane Michael approaches was landfall expected on the state's panhandle Wednesday and we urge all residents to be prepared add to heed local officials and the president in Orlando speaking to members of the international cheap so Police Association saying\nFEMA is already planning storm response\nPresident Trump says he had a great talk was deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein aboard air force one on the trip to Florida the president saying he has no plans to fire Rosenstein who oversees the special counsel's investigation into Russian election meddling in stock sending the day and mix [noise]\nI'll closing thirty nine points higher the only index with a game yes in ... down one to NASDAQ sliding fifty two as both mark their third consecutive days of\nDecline so this is Fox News [noise]\nBreaking news when it happened with news radio Ninety seven ... seven and twelve Ninety am I what you\nMean Uncle Sam accountable to you every day ... is on\nAt twenty five now till the top of the hour eight hundred ... all one Sean if you want to be a part of the program\nOh All right let's get to our phones I Know a lot of ... one of the way in a lot of news happening today twenty nine days till election day there is a lot at stake and I think the biggest case to be made is are you better off\nThan you are two years ago have things in America change for the better do you want this party of slander\nThe party of blood shunning people's characters do you want them rewarded because this is who they are this is what defines up the ... the not the party of due process than not the party\nOf the presumption of innocence they're the party a bludgeon\nFirst and win at all costs that's what that's what the steak I Know it's hard to get people motivated for mid term elections well I Hope this wakes you up I Hope this motivates you I Hope you know the stakes are high I Hope you know there's a lot in play here\nWe know Harry yet another indication am broke and and the ... the ...

J. last Thursday indicted a seven Russian hackers for hacking or any doping agencies and Westinghouse here in the United states as well as much places in Europe and I was wondering if you had any take on that because\nThree of those guys were named Mueller's indictment so I'm Wondering how it is they could have been doing I don't think there's any doubt that there's no\nDoubt at all that the ...\nAnd in the hospital regime of Russia being him being a hostile act or that he is that they are constantly trying to\nYou know create chaos in the United states and they're constantly sly cyberwarfare now has been going on for many many years but I'm going to tell you something that very few people will tell you and that is at some point\nWe've got to take responsibility for the fact that this is happening not only by the Russians by the Chinese and North Korea and the Iranians even some of our so called allies are hacking into stuff\nAnd how much intellectual property is stolen that's billions and billions of dollars from America's same ... you know if you look And Julian Assange whose name is probably I guess the most known\nWell Julian Assange is wanted his mid forties somewhere in there okay but he was sixteen years old and the guy hacked into NASA and the D O D\nThat's how long this has been going on\nNow the the fact allegedly by the way\nThe fact that we have not created cyber defenses to prevent all hackers and we have and hire the best people to design the best systems to protect our intellectual property\nYou know at some point we can't blame others at some point we got to look inward and say ah maybe we're the ones responsible that's what I'm thinking what do you think\nRight I I think you're right about that one one question that I come up with with with this uh give\nJay indictment is they were very specific these Russians were targeting things very very specifically I Want to know how come it is to follow her can't find anything that specifically points to exactly what they were trying to do\nYou know the the the OJ has very detailed information um I Hope somebody will get you the indictment if you if you have time to look at over it's pretty it's pretty\nIn depth it's damning and you're right you know understand another thing is that not one of these people the mother ever indicted from Russia especially the equivalent of their CIA agents are ever going to be brought to the United states and never pays the trial\nI I don't doubt this is happening as a matter of fact it was Devon newness warned everybody would have happened in twenty sixteen\nNow every other studies have shown that it has an impact the election in any way but that's not the point the fact that we continue to have this vulnerability\nIs at some point it becomes our problem in our fault the fact that Hillary you know we don't have any doubt that foreign services hacked into her email system that was parked in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet nobody doubts any of that we'd better take it seriously", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Savannah", "day": "08"}
