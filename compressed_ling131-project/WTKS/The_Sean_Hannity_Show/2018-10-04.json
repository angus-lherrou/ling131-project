Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one\nNumber two or own words that she was a ... D quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before\nAnd that this Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yelled classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story\nAnd her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial drug gr and rapists the teenage girls so give me the evidence and cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from you Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not ... I and I'm not the one who was investigating this right and we talked about this last week wait a minute but everybody's talking it\nWas a full and fair investigation getting married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I think now and the FBI did\nNot use I mean why every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of miss for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself\nAnd then we all watched Julie sweat Nick alter shift\nAnd backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so you have any cooperation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not saying that I don't expect that you would expect that I did\nI mean all you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of ... people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that happen that way at all\nSo the judge is our culture and that thing on at the last twenty four hours at camp out at the judges drinking oughta honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy it's I'm\nNot answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible ... predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do show they sound like it or something\nOf course I Believe and the and the and the presumption of innocence but I also have to leave that the FBI should have been allowed to do a full and fair and ... and that is why you're going to see on the left a huge out for a while and I understand that this is energizing itchy out hey\nI Know it's a talking point what was on a second once you interview looking in the\nCase of professor Ford before people she identified were at the party\nAnd none of the four have any recollection of the abandoned the one eye witness says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do because we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there got home from their what else is the FBI to do that already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... at the FBI just\nTo see what else can they certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when we don't know huh\nOK okay she thinks the fact that she doesn't run into where I where and when exactly it's not necessarily\nDon't you know you're you're trying to watch your training ... look follow the bouncing ball about ...\nIf there's four people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how she got there we don't know how she got home we don't even know the house but you mentioned four people were there for people under penalty of felony all said that didn't happen the way she said one\nWitness or didn't happen and my question is what the FBI\nDo if they don't know the location that can't be looking parenthetically for anything quick break we'll come back more with Jonathan Gillum and Daniel McLaughlin here on the Sean Hannity show\nHey I Want to talk about your whole security protecting your

people that are emotionally involved with this if you take the emotion out of it I Know that's difficult because people are very passionate but if you take the emotion out of it and you look at the investigative facts there are none\nAnd there is not going to be any because it doesn't matter who you question the very people that are the the the alleged victim claims were the closest to the to the electric crime don't\nKnow anything and so as you go out in a perimeter away from the people who the victim says was was there and you interview other people that may have heard somebody say something or hurt here say it becomes here say you know that for being in court that\nWhen you have a just eight minutes with no corroborating evidence\nThat case quickly falls to the side\nAnd I certainly agree with Jonathan totally and the problem is that and then also the fact that the FBI is being used outside of their authority for\nA political matter and that scares me as a former FBI agent that scares me because that is the\nThe thing that totalitarian I'm a governments do\nLook I agree I think that one thing that's important you got to they said it was a standard here this is not a criminal investigation out this is an investigation into combat\nThat may or may not have beer in a way that somebody get a lifetime appointment and and I understand and I agree that this is the kind of extreme like political and extremely emotional and I think that's partly because\nAnd yelled ... question do you have any corroborating witness or any corroborating evidence at all you can say right now\nThat isn't on the question that have been on\nThe really I got an unfair question Jonathan I don't think it's unfair to them\n... well I think when we say fair or unfair I think what it is I Want you to make question I'll tell you why didn't you know because\nPeople are so again angry and people are saying I Believe her I Believe him but in this case there's just no other witnesses there's no other evidence and so when you're asked if you feel this passionate about something if somebody says\nWhat other information do you have that courage intimate question because there is not and the FBI who was secrete it into this investigation has come up with non either and I can guarantee you if anybody would have earned ... it would be them\nRight and our inside there is no robbery
