crimes the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions not from a commercial because no movie opens October twelfth it's amazing Cormac God's mill is perhaps the most prolific serial killer in American history bring friends and family you do not want to pass up the unique opportunity to change hearts\nAnd minds about abortion drugs though really PG Thirteen\nYour brain is an amazing thing that as you get older naturally begins to change causing a lack\nOf sharp or even trouble with recalls thankfully the breakthrough in private and helps your brain and actually improve memory the secret is an ingredient originally discovered in jellyfish in clinical trials ... has been shown to improve short term memory coverage and healthier brain better life is now available in stores everywhere\nStatements have not been evaluated by the FDA this product is not intended to treat shore or prevent anything\nDouble duty chaos so that\nAnd by heart fuel station now Fox News radio covers the world\nThat's done so much in so little time two years no administration is coming from\nWhat we went through a lot of that success earlier in the program and a lot of it bears repeating by the way I mean these are ... for a million jobs created since the election more Americans now employed\nThan ever recorded in our history unemployment the lowest in Nineteen sixty nine four hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs those are the jobs Obama set a never coming back\nBy the way things are only going to get better with the explosion in the energy sector once they can get up and online and in an Warren and continue coal mining the president's saving the coal mining industry in West Virginia singlehandedly\nAnd once we continue to extract more natural gas in the world would ever needed in three hundred years\nWe have all of those ... resources and I have fourteen states record low unemployment ... record low unemployment for Hispanic Americans African Americans Asian Americans youth unemployment fifty five year low median household income\nIts highest record ever recorded\nYou know we have the lowest unemployment rate\nEver recorded for Americans without even a high school diploma and veterans' unemployment is now reached its lowest rate in Twenty years and four million people off of food stamps and I can just keep on going and promises about the types of judges he put on the court and gutting endless\nBureaucratic regulation that that literally hamstrings all businesses in America\nPromoting buying and hiring America actively promoting and asking\nPeople to come and build their factories in manufacturing centers here in creating the economic conditions\nAnd the regulatory conditions where it's possible I mean that's why all these manufacturing jobs are coming back\nOr reducing illegal immigration courts defeating ISIS you know of course pulling out of that idiotic Iranian deal and little rocket man is not firing a missile over Japan every other day I say that's pretty good\nBut with thirty two days out of the electorate a lot can happen between now and then John McLaughlin as pollster founder of McLaughlin associates shown is with us also a pollster author political analyst for Fox News\nOr thank you both for being with us\nOr we can see I don't know if you want to call the cabin on balance or the\nCabinet awakening there's every single state now Claire McCaskill is down significantly in the latest poll in Missouri\nJoe Donnelly is in trouble and Indiana Heidi Heitkamp is down in eleven in her state of North Dakota or I say that Rick Scott will be the next senator from Florida and then of course Martha ... has been surging lately uh where do you think it stands at this moment John McLaughlin\n... I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's to re engage with the Trump voters a short you know your dog and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited millions a new voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote and twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing last Thursday or those voters were staying home or a good portion portion and weren't engaged and I think\nMaybe I got to see that the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think the Democrats could look ... Chuck Schumer is a really smart\nStrategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at that map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours entering states that that Donald Trump won what can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabinet or that the Republicans pull him it would suppress the Trump voters so that's a good number of those sixty three million would stay home because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made they hit the Republicans stuck from the president's stuck with him\nAnd the Democrats were exposed\nThese voters and now outrage that the Democrats would put such a late hit on and try to mirror good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother and said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it and they're trying to destroy this man and this family\nAnd the Republicans ... ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was appalled that we did for a super back she's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day it's it's not a big explosion but what it is is ... is coming back in\nAnd get along really well ... ... that Trump voters worked on what what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago but less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process a party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they're being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nAll shot I mean I don't quite know how to fly but I'll give you a ...\nAnd you can just say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have is that I'm going to leave the house which I did it lead to pick up the house and I think from what I see looking at the Senate races there are all very very close within the margin of her\nAnd I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after capital is as I think we all expect narrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job and then you\nAre talking about Iran is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats are from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately\nA benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York D.C San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with her I think of America I think it's going to play very differently\nI think the the real challenge is the one John raises I think it starts right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs going to have it inside twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... and sixteen days\n[noise] let's let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where\nThey don't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did and said this man\nFor support and disgusting and everybody who like poor experimenting Arlen than things that\nDo you what they did to this man and how they bludgeoned this man and his family as as vicious as they ban with no due process\nAnd for once you know how critical am of Republicans they took it with the seriousness the topic deserved they handled their properly\nThey looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration now do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not you probably have the Democrats handle this\n... ... ... if if I can voiced support for you perhaps he'll give me a chance to do that I went up I said this is somebody who has my own a judicial legal philosophical differences with\nThe judge Kavanaugh I Would not be voted for him but I Do think showing that you are correct\nThat the way this process has played out depresses me as an American first and a Democrat second\nUm I think the process is destroying\nA the independence of archer to Sherry destroying the presumption of innocence and basically what is destroying what makes our country great so we may disagree philosophically but I'd like to think we stand for the same enduring values\nWasn't Lindsey Graham who in many ways showed such a profile in courage in this\nUm and even and I think the deliberate seriousness of Susan Collins\nYou know the Republican Party is made up of a varying factions that I don't see these factions really existing in the Democratic party John I mean you got the extreme left and then you've got the super duper extreme left and there's no room for a scoop Jackson they even through Joe Lieberman of all people out of the party how do you throw a Joe Lieberman out of your party\nUm I mean that's insanity to me\nOh absolutely and and I tell you what\nDoug don't make the point you have over four weeks ago\nAnd that's a lifetime in politics I mean I mean remember twenty sixteen the Derrick has put the late hit on Bush or not Bush part of it they did it to push for the drunk driving\nBut they did it with to Donald Trump with a tape of that women are people people weren't right Jordan realize it was a choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and they voted for Donald Trump\nYes we'll be tells them you know all the political to accomplish commercials are depending on your health and human company in other factors not available in all states\nIn Nineteen fifty Richie Ashburn follow the mall in that camera fake you know a few minutes later\nFouled off another ball in his name spectator while she was being carried off at a stretcher sometimes just not your day\nWhen it comes to pest control every day in the winter when you call ... ... celebrating Ninety years of customer satisfaction so called national termite control at six by nine pounds [laughter]\nHi advantage Martin live in not only a talk show host I'm also a lawyer in the conversation\nGetting knocked me out of the night in a news radio WCBS\nRight as we wrap up with our pollsters we'll be checking in with them often now thirty two days out of election day and I think the most important midterms are a lifetime of John McLaughlin Doug Shona with us All right Doug productions what's gonna happen\nAre covered or is going to be confirmed you will have the Republicans\nHolding the feminine a narrow way and the Democrats winning the house but was thirty thirty five seats [noise]\nWow that's a huge production for the Democrats um I don't think there's any scenario that I can discount thirty two days out of this election I think anything can happen and I hope the American people see what they were electing and Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters and Chuck Schumer that's my of my biggest Pope John McLaughlin\n[noise] I think you're right and uh uh in terms of its just four weeks out over four weeks ago I can happen but I Will tell you that the key thing is Donald Trump is putting the Republicans on his shoulders and bringing them across the finish line in that he's bringing his votes to bear\nBut it is voters are coming back out but the key thing is just too real opponents right now or Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer she needs to take them on they are going to be a nightmare if they get control either house\nA for next year so we've got to do is look left that she'll certainly had a fifty five percent unfavorable rating I mean fifty five percent will be a landslide for the Republicans and they could they could hold the house so right now we're headed to gain seats in the Senate but it's too early on the house and and\nPrior to cabinet looked like we were going to lose the house but uh uh with that kind of a negative on policy\nFor her to be the leader to oppose Donald Trump every back to the elites where the swap runs the country again\nSo uh if he does that over the next four weeks the Republicans could hold the house and they'll definitely pick up senator each\nAll right thank you both John McLaughlin and dug shown eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number will continue we'll have our Florida Georgia Line background
