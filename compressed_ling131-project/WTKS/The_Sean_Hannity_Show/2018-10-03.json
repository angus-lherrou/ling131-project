I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people\nThat's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official a teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug in kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nHe's police documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way disqualify for someone within a Supreme Court [noise]\nWhy we need and has the ins and because there\nA lot of allegations and I mean for really are about how he behaves finance job\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration released late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel and ex boyfriend of\nProfessor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the Ford\nNeither mentioned Kavanaugh ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believe was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman I had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office\nIn further claimed afford never voiced any fear of flying even all aboard a propeller plane that they were on seemingly Avon no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment and services that look\nThese are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the day she said they were for people\nThat could corroborate her story none of them can corroborate her story\nMost don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault said it didn't happen so at that point\nYou've got to presume somebody's innocent you don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the poor people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to ask the same questions\nAnd if they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there is no indication up to now\nBased on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor Ford but I mean professor Ford is now told their story multiple times and I've got to believe and assume that\nThey're they're thinking that well her story hasn't changed you just said it last week before the Senate Judiciary committee [noise]\nUm oh it's just I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means because what it means matters\nYou know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that matter Lindsey Graham is saying Clintons sects accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor for it and I I think the the Republicans held the actually did something well\nI think they handled it

have one party that in every single case even though there's no core operation\nEven though facts on the ground continue to shift didn't change where we don't know a data location people that are supposedly eyewitnesses to alleged\nActs of violence say it didn't happen and the stories change about well they're putting drugs in the in the punch and boys are lining up almost on a weekly weekend basis\nTo rape girls are lining up in the halls while he was around the punch bowl when he gave out some red solo cups that's what that evolved into\nYou know at what point is there no shame here at

former speaker of the house with thirty four days away from an election best selling book Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback while I guess that's on the ballot and thirty four days how are you\nI'm doing well and I think you know\nYou can't have shame if you're only interest is raw power and that's where we've seen a Dianne Feinstein deliberately holding the letter was about raw power of the fact that you have a democratic senator who says if you're for Kevin all your complicit with evil\nThat Rob how are the kinds of smearing dishonest questions and accusations that we've seen that raw power and that is what this election is about the selection will decide what kind of country we are\nTo Iraq how how many Americans are really comfortable with this kind of character assassination dishonesty and all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's going to be in it that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've\nSeen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really two of the Democrats that would consider voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh will only do it I Believe of impact is enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and Senator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England as we get most of the week\nAnd his media tour which is second to none so how does this end up\nWell I mean I think in the short run that I I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency\nA judge Kevin all of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been a smear treated with a vicious personal in fact\nAll those things I think I mean that the Susan Collins the world is going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday and he'll be on the court but to deeper\nUnderlying lesson that all of us should learn about who these people are how they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope that that stage for very long time\nLet me ask you a thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president for the first time in forty years you ran on something and you've got the entire caucus of Republicans house and Senate\nAgree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America and that you would you promised you would vote on ten specific items in the first hundred days of what you did accomplish that pass and Republican for the most part with a few bumped pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi opium Minnesota he's laying out the case that if you want results you have a team called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats and he's been laying up and and you see it in the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening I think the president has set the stage now to pit\nAnd spent the last five weeks telling us what's coming next we got this much damage you know\n... I loved the vice President Pence and like you said America's coming back he didn't say we're back yet because we're not\nPush of a lot of work to them but we're coming back and now you have a chance for the president's leadership\nAnd I think this will actually be about which kind of America if you want us to be\nYou want us to keep coming back keep creating jobs do you want us to control the

can hold the same no matter but I think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power there\nSome course that is

out and pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared of\nAbout lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference and the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what the appropriate

all that takes up the Democrats you're exactly right it then it gets on a week ago if we would have had\nLike ... or calcium or San I think he can hear that we might not ... ... and I think that not

there are lapdog but they might do it out of their own political self interest\nGroup Beckley right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and Manchin but I think I don't think they go that way a less Collins\nAnd Murkowski or a combination of of Collins an end flake or or Murkowski inflate once the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri\nBecause if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah it I mean [laughter]\nDon't get real does wrong principle is a man that stands on values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater's conscious of the conservative and it you know if he is now a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first to tell Jeff

sure what happened\nThen you've got the whole well they were putting drugs and they were ... girls\nAlmost on a weekend basis I went to Penn of these parties myself\nAnd and he's one of them and and boys were lined up in the halls and after these girls were drug they were gang rape train raped as they were lying in the hall and the NATO balls into while I saw him near the punch bowl\nAnd and I saw him give red solo cups to people and well he wasn't standing in line but I saw him he was in a whole um that is so over the top\nAnd the fact the media would run that interview with so many inconsistencies in all cases no corroboration not the case of professor Ford not the case of Mr Ramirez and not in the case with Julie sweating it know co-op corroboration\nJoe diGenova Victoria Toensing a with us\nThe gentleman Toensing welcome both of you back to the program I'm Victoria will start with you get your take on all those\nWell the new media standard is very very interesting at least for Republicans it's it's you can say John Smith rape somebody oh we can't prove that we don't have anybody else you don't have any witnesses so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story but nevertheless\nJohn Smith rape somebody named that's that's what the media is going with Johnny I it's really important that your listeners know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's or the CIA director bill Casey\nAnd it was all over the papers out you know how soon we all forget about these things but\nIt I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a\nWild and that happens all the time and these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general was California's she's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chain do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh of committing some lurid sex acts is there no decorum left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating neck in particular that if in fact she you know she made the statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations\nUm you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know that is I Know that we have now examined every single case\nIn every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview\nBut they are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two\nAnd now the last minute because they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidence in high school\nWell I think um what has happened with Julie sweat Nick is that the Senate\nCommittee after the confirmation vote occurs needs to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitted false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee and the confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that this ...\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate issue for her story there is most of the education permits Ramirez story and I just wanted to say something that I Know\nUh probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied liked her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is alive for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember in that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to maybe Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I there was genuine surprise I remembered Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a radical left wing activist resistor as a lawyer this is Deborah cats\nNever catch by the way who said well Paula Jones only spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the case of Al Franken but I I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes\nWell but I didn't know that but that was very nice do you if you offered that I didn't know we should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional world\nI I may I may very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that I can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases\nHere's here's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety now why is her story not include her going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get\nWhat they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know 'cause we're talking about the we all know that there are real evil predators there are people that do murder\nAnd rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think to the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously they handled it professionally they afford it every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats they just they just now have pushed this so far into a ... into any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever\nAnd we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning I I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act to react I Would assume was probably people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believes everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborated and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is nonexistent shot us in happen that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and picking them apart are supporting them\nThere's another problem with her story listen she said that they they're rich music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned that music up so nobody could hear her and then she likes to south in the bathroom\nAnd she can hear them talking going downstairs what you think these guys just turn the music ups and no one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down I mean there are so many flaws in what she said\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into\nThat whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back more with Victoria Toensing Joe diGenova next and then your calls coming up final half hour we'll just do all calls eight hundred nine four one Sean\nHey
