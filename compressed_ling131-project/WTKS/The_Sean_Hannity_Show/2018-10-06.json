I'm sure they were it was easy to find people because they already had that interview\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee let the the\nThe goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that could believe that any of these people um it it could take themselves seriously they said\nIt's going to be four days a week and now they're going to hire an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial there you know she works at that every Democrat that that now they're going up\nThe Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI are actually gonna be it's horrible part is an organization you know it it it\nIs and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's lifelong reputation here on the line [noise]\nTake your mind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets back in many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on that if someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to get simply use that as their skin is counted the name of this couch them because they disagree with them anyway\nAn atheist someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective\nOn the bench judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit at a lower court catch the Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they fought to fourteen different times they found out they vindicate his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I\nDon't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people at\n... but I like it\nOr if the parents to do on a reputation now\nYou read James ... New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's pack in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself\nPrior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people in quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example\nBut he remembers if it rained on their wedding day uh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them that there is what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just to my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer\nEver and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass under\nKhomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the FBI people I Know the fault of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them\nAnd you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that says hey look he he told me coming and low right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but the Iranian the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to cheat lie the FBI is the one that gets a crime to lie to the Senate and they're with their debts get it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nRaised in a great point if they cared about the issue they would be demanding FBI investigations\nWe can go back now to Juanita ... and we can certainly go back to keep that was where there's Dr reports and text messages and audiotape maybe even a videotape of him you know being ... emotionally abusive physically abusive towards his ex girlfriend so yeah I think that would be a consistent\nOpposition for them to take but they never ever going to do that are they\nIn less it promotes the Democrat John ...\nWell that's it I mean that's what it all comes down to politics alright Christian good call we appreciate it All right let's go to Don is an Iowa Don how're you we got about a minute it's all yours sir\nHi Sean thank you for taking my call and thank you for a\nContinually bringing out the true for everybody\nI'm Glad to be here every day thank you for giving me this microphone\n[laughter] I'm basically all I Want it to say is is the obvious\nThis of this whole case is that um Ford\nIs perfectly willing to do to judge Kavanaugh what she has accused him of doing it to her assaulting a him on a daily basis is false statements diverse and and just so much fake uh evidence everywhere\nListen she she identified and there's a there's a part of me that really sympathizes with this is such a serious issue in and I don't think we give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled this including the president they handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves\nShe gave the names of four people and none of the fork in corroborate her story including the guy that was supposed to be an eye witness to it at that point\nThey were really you can't go any further with it and he adamantly denies so it's um it's a matter of just simple okay if somebody corroborated it we'd be in a very different position today I got to take a quick break final half hour\nFree for all our Sean Hannity show and we

thing is now the press finally get said now they'll finally treat me fairly they got worse and worse than\nTheir logo but that's okay I put up with it the interesting thing is though nobody asked them about what's happened in the last twenty five thirty years during his professional career because I don't know bad reports I mean there are bad reports on everybody in here\nMost of the people sitting down there ... except for my pets by the way [noise]\nAnd now for you Democrats and I guess I'm including you to the media right I consider you part of the Democrat Party but for you for the Democrats

ship a fool's how selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution\nUm are we really getting to the brink of a revolution in this sense I mean look it's only happened three times in the last hundred years where a party wins the White House power in the White House and they don't have losses in the next midterm election year the last time was right after nine eleven two thousand and one George Bush was president\nUm but I got to imagine people are pretty pissed off at the\nAt what's you know it was two weeks ago yesterday and nobody had heard one bad thing about Brecht capital\nUntil two weeks ago yesterday and look where we are getting Tucker will go to the show\nThanks Sean well yeah I mean look\nCap now is being destroyed not because if anything he did or didn't do that because he's in the way\nOf the Democrats retaining power I mean it's not personal it's just the party wants what he's about to get and so they're crushing him and his family in order to get it\nAre we moving to a revolution while I don't know look at the people in charge look at the Congress look at our media they're pushing conflict in division on us they're pushing racial division endlessly they're pushing gender division they're claiming that the cap not\nSoccer and that women should hate men and vice versa yeah I mean they're pushing this unity because this unified country it's easier for them to control that divide and conquer it's my oldest strategy there it\nWell you don't look I I've I've chronicled this historically over the course of my career and that is it's pretty predictable every two and four years every election cycle Republicans racist sexist I won't get the whole list but exactly they want to throw granting over the cliff and now with Supreme Court justices\nOr if they have an opening ... there seems to be no\nThere there there's nothing they will say or do now I mean you have friends of the attorney for professor cats you know Dianne Feinstein recommended who herself as pretty radical left\nNow soliciting people from the Georgetown Prep community whatever that is and asking if if they have information or they want to come forward their soliciting people\nAnd the FBI now is being told by Democrats well it's got to be white and scope and it's got to go on for as long as need be which is the opposite of the so called agreement between a senator Coons in the center of ... like last week\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they fall for this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to debate

I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement or with our colleague\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like Chris but he was never part of the third grade meant what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not and he's been honest about it as drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and mystery Maris and the fall and incredibly incredible lead within a week I think the FBI's about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee\nWith the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopeful and get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is an expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator her own out now is saying she wants in an F. FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we're our so my dad owns a bar and so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so uh the bottom line is that solve a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff lakes going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I Am but to me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\n... pose to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize the way he was treated\nAt the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused are not given up on hand less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states or were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yeah most Democrats will know no matter who Donald\nTrump ... they've already against score sick\nYeah All right so now what's gonna happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well I'm a smart question\nMartha ... is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... Ford's planes are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate\nIf we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh so you mean you're you're communicating Hannah though I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers it'd be I don't I doubt\nIf they're listening [laughter] I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary the states couldn't be higher this about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know\nIt's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook\nThat if we had to as a last resort where one vote short list the hypothetical we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days thirty five we can I find that extra vote\nThat way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here\nI think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nAll it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me\nIf we follow vote short a less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserve\nCan't show starts tonight it's now more of the best of Sean Hannity on Fox News radio Ninety seven forty seven and twelve Ninety am W.

Hi die I saw him given rent solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch I won't say malls or the bunch container is\nI don't know why he did but I saw him by them

yeah there are people that how about that part of\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of ... she says when to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall ... sweating it another of the French she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nBy twenty five now until the top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing at all this was was absolute how does this past for a news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago\nYou would think she can stay consistent in a week and the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a ... a systemic\nParty culture where almost every weekend\nThat women girls young girls were being drugged with ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then line up outside the room waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement\nAnd she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote corroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that then we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here to put this on the air\nByron York is a joining us he's been running as a lotta columns about there's not the least of which is how high the bar\nHas risen in the gold posed we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote now you see that a Camille Harris she is now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron hey Sean listen on this on his NBC thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds\nA war on on the basis of the lack of evidence and ah there's no way the story should ever recorded publicly just shouldn't have bought it was given in part a due to the news networks I'm praying about Michael I have an ... her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has recorded this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think it was a parent to a lot of people\nAre ... there was nothing to the story [noise] um and when she offered a witnesses to corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was another was deceased and if you didn't answer the phone so I'm\nThe story is already out there and has already gotten the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case\nWas mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nBut they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um nobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said to somebody I blacked out\nCorrect so this is a fishing expedition this is now a destroy cabin on expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him\nSo here you know objects question I go ahead where we're out of\nThe things that he claims yeah I'm from an emphasis on me at the sex misconduct allegations to once he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact that there really isn't any evidence to support the sex\nOr allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth\nAbout drinking although he mentioned many times in his testimony that he did um in fact\nDrink today rocks published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking tricare mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr as I got to let it go there thank you so much

I think it was a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her her country with incredible honor and distinction and\nAnd Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but\nThese numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a raspy is simple that says well the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nLet it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive the enthusiasm gap is as close to almost two dead even hold and you see Republicans and important Senate races down a dead heat\nIn all of the states that are red states where we're Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to do stage further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice capping off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they meet your it everything you can imagine and they lost\nAnd I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he and the process he may well have crippled his party for a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things\nThey're called Republicans and there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats and he said to me I just don't think people are Americans are going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we're living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict this\nCertainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know as rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever the vista nature of politics they could bring up comes up every election year but they have now son to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case of professor Ford there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nIt took to look for anything for ... that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talked to the poor people professor Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened\nAnd she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eyewitness said that did not happen and the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just got a jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular\nYesterday and he goes well there's enough allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe it and they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look let's be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of the Cade I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he just kind of decayed into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks with any of Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance has a history teacher I found it painful um\nHe he makes comments like that I mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you a pin the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that you know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nCertainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment of fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created for a million fewer people on on food stamps\nOr you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the the new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation\nYou shouldn't we can now drilling and war and the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high and we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that is the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe you don't even know their name is\nWhat is your finger on the key question of this election as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and one of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I I don't care about the polls\nShow me the precincts I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote because that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back to the special in one um\nAnd is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience\nWho this is going to come down to isn't holding\nIt isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote and if our side does show up in both I think this could be one of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections\nI have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would rush to oil behind\nThe scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before\nYou became speaker the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and and you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that them and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be in a dismal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again\nAnd it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they're either going to seek kiddy happy liberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nChuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will be the chairman of this committee or that committee and that the impeachment of Trump will go forward taxes go up open borders will remain\nAn Obamacare stays all this or they're going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and be in the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I look I mean I think what what I Would say to everybody who's listening to us everybody cares what's country's future make sure you vote makes sure your friends vote make sure everybody you know who favors\nA solid productive work oriented results oriented system make sure they go out and vote if that happens my I'm not I'm not quite ready yet to predict what am I going to tell you that\nBecause of the intensity of anger about the way the liberal smear Kavanaugh the characterization the dishonesty I Believe we have seen and I've been looking at data for three days I Believe that we've seen a substantial shift\nTowards Republicans I think that they were almost certainly now going to keep the Senate and probably going to increase our or the total number of senators by significant margins\nHeidi Heitkamp of North Dakota who's down eleven is no on Kavanaugh to me what a fork in that race it's over\n[noise] yeah well again I think Kramer who was a great great guy and I've known for twenty four years now he's got to get out there and keep campaigning want one of the lessons you know I I had very close races including a couple of recounts and I had very big raise my experiences\nAnd I said it's every candidate do not quit to the polls closed and do not relax until the recount is a this is a business where big things can happen\nOr I missed the
