apparatus had the audacity to make all these charges and slander and and destroy a cabin off and his family\nAnd had the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand that independence up\nAnd that his dealings with passion indicates that he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court\n... hair his righteous indignation is is to our rant which was totally justifiable than necessary in fact to preserve his position\nRight to they compare that to the twelve years on the bench when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nAbsurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand judicial never I Would hate to have that kind of instrument\nTire how was somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act\nIf they're accused of being a serial gang rapist who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response you supposed to go there and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah ... ...\nWho were falsely accused react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did\nAh when you're greed you sleep wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question that ah\nChristine Blasey Ford was it some time and it someplace sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what is essentially doing is saying she is mistaken for a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nUh individuals' or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused and to condemn him for being angry is to ignore human emotion\nWell let's say you got\nA ... and contrast that with his response on the mark on the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was a very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them and by ... somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially legal she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified and he totally indicated itself it was a match or because I think it was thought that it\n... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up to Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said when Dianne Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process\nAnd then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions you know I to me there's only one answer and the answers thirty five days from now and that's when\nThe American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida I'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned this family has been bludgeoned and there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give a valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of Kavanaugh but I find it\nTo me or that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in high school and college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard in some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement saying that uh we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit\nOr in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nDo you think of the interview which again the statement only

with\nNothing after all this was was absolute ... how does this passport news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statements you release just a

weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then lined up outside the room waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago and nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names\nJust like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote corroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that then we've got this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where

cases that the the Democrats now want or expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford

any any timetable idea\n... I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like risk but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about his drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and Mr ... and the fall and incredibly any credible lead within a\nWeek I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalposts Jeff voted yes in committee when the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee\nThe great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants to men by the way to sit down and shut up yeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway as senator her own out now is saying she wants in an F. FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we're our so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that solve bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy and twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow them and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you have some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but we're supposed to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but\nIf you fall one vote short you up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delete legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of these states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused are not given up on hand less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats or rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact that most Democrats will know no matter who Donald Trump s\nRide they've already against Gorsuch\nYeah All right so now what's going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... towards claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party\nThat we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter]\nSo you mean you're you're communicating hand I don't I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're listening [laughter] I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest men and I know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box and about thirty something days\nThirty five we can find yeah find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have the lights salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight the people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nOh it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to be in a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a bad business I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh as highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves\nA damn ... [noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but\nShe identified in and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made I don't mind you've made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about cabinet\nThem is that this was the environment we live in senator and I warn those arguments on radio and TV every two and four\nYears if you're a Republican or a conservative and you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist appoint a massage it is the home of ...
