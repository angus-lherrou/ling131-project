and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know when you're a scientist your scientist to know and I have noticed that disagree with that you know I I was thinking\nMight have said now I've seen the hurricane situations\nI changed my mind than merely as climate change and I thought wow what an impact\nOne and I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about that in the news they said that we had hurricane that was far worse than what we just had was Michael Ellis says that they say they say that and I wonder if I'm a scientist who say it's worse than ever\nA show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda mostly cancelling them just also have a political agenda\nWhere was it angle of the the altered climate change data it's science was as the Al Gore and others would tell you if it was so surely perfect is no disagreement than the scientific humidity it's just not sure why would they have to alter the data back at that time\nAlthough a job of started listening and he heard that he's about to lose his mind uh I I why do I know and the president was down visiting the devastation left by Michael ... hurricane you call that a thousand percent right I think up to now we've lost Nineteen people is the latest number I heard but\nYou know thankfully most people listen and got out\nA job of stories with weather bell dot com that that annoyed you I Know right off of all of my white or interviews the place you went to debate the president she didn't want to interview the president she wanted to debate them\nFirst of all agree inland folks the last two years Greenland has had\nNear record snowfall and the reason why the north Atlantic is changing it's getting colder again we're going back to the cold periods of the Atlantic multi decadal oscillation like we were in the eighties\nAnd nineties early nineties and that's a natural cyclical process for the past two years if you look at the charts you can see Greenland has had well above normal snow fall and near record snowfall so Greenland she apparently she's on aware of this because two or three years ago of course Greenland wasn't that way so right about Antarctica\nSo so Antarctica is up near normal they will record breaking record breaking\nHigh about five six years ago and they came down below and they're back you know normal now let me let me say this\nThe president answer the question perfectly here's why up until now climate change first of all everyone believes the climate changes so that her washed is based on a false premise that he doesn't believe the climate change\nThe climate is always change naturally I feel now people are saying that now it's man that's doing it\nHow it is not questioning it make any sense in other words if you were just apply only accept something after ten million years every single time it was natural now\nYou know whether they ever anybody else better than anyone else I mean okay when you look back at the earth temperature as it go out and cooler and then warmer in the warmer in the cooler\nIt has so questioning it questioning authority is what he's doing and that's his background that's why now let me let me get Leslie for\nIf if she lets thing if you're unless they will give you for example the kinds of five more rapidly that Michael right off the top of my head Nineteen thirty five hurricane went from a tropical storm to a category five and thirty six hours hurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine came a lemon days across the Atlantic

in the ...\nTwenty four hours coming into Corpus Christi Nineteen Seventy ... in Nineteen sixty nine went over there in the pocket like shift for the hundred and twenty five mile an hour winds thirty\nSix hours before fifty mile an hour a tropical storm and that's way up in the north Atlantic they're countless examples of rapid feedback development it was a textbook case for it and it's amazing watching this go on in front of my eyes\nOf people say how did this happen how to ... its way out of my classes at Penn State Nineteen Seventy in the Nineteen seventies remembered wind legacy\nI honestly can't tell you what's going to happen in twenty six states like a twenty ... twenty two days I Can't tell you\nBut I Will tell you got to personalize this election I mean Nancy Pelosi look at her is that who you're voting for voting for a Democrat\nThat say if you vote for senator that's a Democrat you're voting for Chuck Schumer and there are radical left agenda\nYou know if you if you want to know what it's between lower taxes less government intervention you know there's a fascinating piece on the Drudge Report\nWhat do you think just in the top of your mind the top one what is it one thousand if I can find a four hundred and nine taxpayers the richest one thousand four hundred and nine taxpayers and America\nWell guess what that the one thousand four hundred nine taxpayers\nPay more taxes than the bottom Seventy million Americans the top three this according latest in information coming from a Bloomberg and it's a year twenty sixteen but individual taxes\nAre paid by thinking about this the top three percent pay the majority of everything the top one percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes and literally than the bottom Ninety percent about one percent pays more than Ninety percent\nThe top fifty percent pay all the taxes Ninety seven percent we have redistribution\nThe bottom fifty percent of Americans only pay three percent of the bill that's it\nThe individual income tax system is designed to be progress if it is it is redistribution of wealth we already have the system and then when you get a little bit of your problems back because the ... the only ones that are getting problems back or people that pay\nYou know but for the middle class that's a lot of\nMoney one and two thousand dollars and they'll say you want the crumbs back is ridiculous\nSo there's a lot going on this election and twenty two days\nNow I Would argue that what your tax savings is on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot are great comeback is on the ballot jobs are on the ballot your kids jobs in future is on the ballot your wages and for one case that's on the ballot your business owner your tax cuts are on the

because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it\nYou've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think about scene and you said peanuts and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it they say that I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be the classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nAh Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some pages but let me just say this 'cause this is really important\nAll the names that you heard Michael fuss Mr Elias Simpson or all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom\nBetween the Congress hasn't and clear issue a subpoena is who we now know that the FBI or\nAm I fix and that you see a cue\nTo conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information was in fact conversations George Papadopoulos were intercepted and in the course of intercepting those compensation\nThey found out that Papadopoulos was not interested in Hillary's emails or anything else and they never gave information to the fight the court\nKnow it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand\nWhat the insurance policy was Lisa Page testifying that in the the nine months of the investigation leading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there is no there there and then all of a sudden we find the media league strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again\n[noise] well it it just depends on the ... where you where you filed the case or their it's this loud jacket or rocket rocket jacket but none of this Shawn without ... puts it the cooperation of the media without those journalistic with David Corn and Mike is it cost\nCutting out the information just regurgitate the information that they receive from uh the people who were doing this behind the scenes\nI I Can't believe that there's not enough outraged to realize what is actually going on here\nIs you have a dicey a series of reports put together known as the dossier by Christopher Steele\nThat's Hillary Clinton DNC funneled money through a law firm Perkins coy hiring fusion GPS and research firm then they hire Christopher Steele and they put together unverified uncorroborated in mostly now what turns out to be debunked information Joe diGenova\nFirst they use it to hurt Donald Trump in the general election you know the stories about you know Russian hookers\nUrinating in the bed and the un a mosque out rich Carlton for example that's all being leaked even by high members within our intelligence community for the purposes of influence in the election with a with a series of lies and propaganda then the same information is used again to create a special counsel\nAnd to really deal legitimize and hopefully dismantled the presidency of Donald Trump that's when it came down to\nWell there's no doubt about it a shot on that but as Victorian I have been saying now for Eighteen months there was a brace a lot\nOf brazen plot to exonerate Hillary Clinton illegally that if she lost the election to frame Donald Trump and that is exactly what they did these people were motivated by an Anna this court Donald Trump which led them to fabricate evidence to use foreign intelligence service fabricate evidence\nTo wiretap Americans overseas and and when they found exculpatory evidence for example that would have favorite George Papadopoulos they hit it by the court there is no doubt\nThat number people John granted James Clapper on down all the way into the White House committed crimes and Jeff Sessions and lied roses I cannot figure out a way to do this and by the way John Huber Utah at the head fate\nIs doing nothing six months without report I've let the Brady Bunch of indictments tomorrow use what if there's an outrage with that she has been voted by tolerated\nI Do the president's waited till after the election to get rid of them and I say to hell with both of them All right\nThank you what's gonna happen Jason ... you see a new attorney general down their own\nNot soon enough I just put up a piece that I wrote about sessions can't go soon enough worthless sees their name only the really should be as a second special counsel to look into Brandon and all these cast of characters we've been talking about over the last few minutes they did the president needs that in place\nWell their hair president making that decision himself\n[noise] yeah you could push that or a ... and and releasing the documents to Congress absolutely\nYeah I think all that needs to happen uh or twenty two days before the election we'll see what goes on from here a thank you all
