because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states that they're going to have to step in here somehow turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know\nBut the reality is either by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do what we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to ... you know create a crowd and rush the border\nAnd my fear is if they get to the border that would could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people if we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for them if we had the wall we would have that would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nBut remember in the near future the next few weeks\nOur policy should be to hope for the best plan for the worst I think the worst case is pretty simple the Mexicans end up with their own political reasons doing nothing\nThey decide that they expect Donald Trump to cave and so there is going to let you know as many thousand people just want to enter the United states\nWhat they haven't thought through is what if he doesn't cave what if he does call out to the military what if we do in fact create or an effect on human wall and block people from entering the United states\nNow and the Mexicans are going to have what what could be but it down as much as ten or Fifteen thousand people 'cause they ask keep growing\nWell there was one report yesterday from a newspaper in Mexico that said it's already ballooned up to fourteen thousand\nRight so so part of what I'm saying is at this at that point we we have a real decision to make and this is this is what Lincoln saying over and over again yeah uh you know if you're going to preserve the union you're going to do whatever it takes to preserve the union\nAnd he didn't say it happily he didn't say that excited Lee ... many of his key early speeches or this nostalgic sadness to\nThat we are bound together by the common core of mystique memory and that we have no reason to fight each other a and he's almost pleading\nYou don't need silver didn't have a very good year in twenty sixteen but he had predicted both of Obama's victories I'm Scott Rasmussen was the closest pollster John McLaughlin was the other coast poster in twenty uh sixteen and he says there's an eighty six percent chance the Democrats take over the house\nEighty two percent chance that Republicans picked up seats in the Senate I don't have a spiel on the house but I Do believe\nRepublicans could actually win Florida Tennessee\nMissouri Nevada Arizona for shore North Dakota for sure maybe Montana and if they didn't have a libertarian in Indiana they win that race for sure but they got a good shot beating Joe Donnelly in Indiana if people don't vote libertarian I'm On the house side it's very hard to get a feel forty retirements doesn't make it an easier\nOne of the best right but I think it eighty percent way too high\nAnd a little surprised the silver or for the second cycle rose going ... um you know the most recent survey indicates\nThat in fact you have 'em in the very closely contested districts and this was an NBC survey um that they actually are were within about two points on the generic ballot\nWell if if the contest districts now we're losing the Democratic districts very badly we're also not so much money and I'm we're not campaigning and I'm we're not making our case a but but in the swing seats that matter a we actually are basically tied the generic ballot\nIn and all I can tell you is\nI I looked at the issues that are going to matter ... things happening you see this a little bit was Stacey Abrams or in in Georgia the candidate for governor who explained today that she's opposed to free enterprise and health care because she she hates making a profit and you never do any good if you make a profit um\nAnd and she is just very left wing cinema the Democrat in in Arizona for US Senate\nRefuses to apologize for urging Americans to saying it's okay\nFor Americans to join the Taliban or what's happened in Minnesota now where I think Keith Ellison\nMay drag down the entire chicken except for any closure they may lose a Senate seat house seats the governorship a because she thought it was just so totally left wing and unacceptable and so I keep looking around\nAt these patterns and I think what you're seeing is a remarkable moment where the whole what do you know for example\nWhen we were talking about ten days ago you and I work but this was a race between jobs and marched well if you look at the pictures coming out of Mexico right now you couldn't get a better picture of a mob and you watch the Democrats\nTo ask you can you know they had to stay for another five minutes I Want to really get into this more deeply out of there because it's the two important wherever fourteen days out of an election two weeks from today you'll be voting and two weeks from tonight you'll be turning on your television sets and you're either\nGoing to have raped news all the way around maybe it's going to be split decision or you got a horrible news\nAnd you get to decide ultimately what that news is going to be this is where your vote actually matters this election counts and you can shock the world again and I'm confident that that can happen that can be the outcome I quit break more Newt Gingrich on the other side and later pastor Darrell Scott David Limbaugh much more [noise]\n[noise]\n... have a lot of people coming up can't let that happen we have a border we don't we need a wall President Trump meeting with the governor of California Alaska\nAnd Hawaii with that massive migrant caravan on his mind now the\nGroup is in southern Mexico as many Kevin counting people are walking President Trump has said there are likely middle Easterners mixed in with the group though there haven't been clear evidence that he also said that there are and if they're in gang members and other criminals next in as well one of the migrants mocking told Fox News chair there aren't probably criminals among them\nBut it's not that many I mean this is a good people hear\nFox's Jessica Rosenthal reporting the caravan now making its way north to the California border six children dead twelve other sticking at a long term care facility and New Jersey\nAnd I'll break up an ad no virus there they did talk to you [noise]\nJust

[noise]\n\n[noise]\nOld inspires illusions forum merry go this is Sean Hannity show\nI twenty five fill the top of the hour we've asked to Newt Gingrich to stay with us I Want you to really go into a longer explanation us said Kavanaugh caravan are going to be the defining issues in the next fourteen days people will vote fourteen days from now\nI Would add to that caravan Kavanaugh\nThe mobs we now you saw what happened to Kevin McCarthy is house it through a Boulder through the window I'm at so they did the Henry Kissinger you saw what they did the Mitch McConnell this is just in the last two days and it's happening everywhere and I would also add that if Americans like\nWhat has happened over the last two years in spite of Obama laughing leak claiming credit for it yesterday if they want the successor to continue the economic growth to continue the prosperity to continue I think this becomes a classical choice election but I I think all of those things hopefully will factor into people's decisions\n[noise] well I think that's right um and I think that that in a sense\nOf the whole question of what kind of country do you want to become clear on the left that you now have\nSort of a brown sugar Nineteen thirties to a total of cherry an attitude a that they are willing to use force\nOr they openly said they're willing to use force the former attorney general saying when Republicans go low kick them or you have various democratic leaders saying it's OK to harass people uh and drive them out of public life\nAh you know and remember that Maxine Waters is not a trivial person she would share\nFinance banking and financial services committee if they get control of the house show of the significant people are saying these things are building on on a sense of a rage in a sense of\nThe illegitimacy of of the modern of American government which the left passionately believes uh I I think that you're right that that's a factor the reason I I pick Kavanaugh caravans as the as the central moment is\nThese are historical events them into Kavanaugh fight wasn't just politics\nIt was historic we're we're going to get\nA solid conservative on the Supreme Court or what are we going to be smeared and parents were assassinated and lied and manipulated and browbeat and into backing down so that was that was a historic moment so we'll have an effect clinics forty or fifty years\nA similarly this caravan whether it's seven thousand people or the Mexican newspapers rightness or do you have to fourteen thousand\nIf this caravan can get into the United states\nHow big is the next caravan and the camera then after that I mean it's not like it's a one time event here the entire world is watching to see whether or not we have the guts to protect the United states of America from an invasion or and if we don't trust me it will be a lot of people willing to come\nWell I think I Know exactly where they're going to head to straight to California the sanctuary stayed and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom is is offering to provide for them that's where I'd go\nWell and remember because we we we shouldn't have to have a showdown but this there's no such thing as a ...\nTo ... you have to decide to your state can in fact imposed on the federal government activities which it cannot possibly imposed and at some point we're gonna have a big collusion with ... century stage there's are a fundamental violation of the constitution\nWell I think that this is I I Do agree with you um I have a pretty good feeling about the Senate I think that\nThe way events in our in the debate has moved I think there's been a dramatic shift for certainly the cabinet in case you know it's amazing to watch how the you know the other news channels are covering the president's speech last night\nOr the ... they're actually fake news CNN actually says president wise tries to gin up division\nAnd they've never covered what Maxine Waters has been saying\nThey've never covered a single thing of her saying you know create a crowd followed them in a grocery stores follow them into department stores gas stations and you tell them they're not want to hear anywhere anymore or what's happened to Pam Bondi or secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders a Ted Cruz now Mitch McConnell and Henry Kissinger and\nYou know obviously this is the the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker nor can I say or\nOr elaborate on any one issue or program they're offering\nThat will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what they're running on\nNow I look I I well they do run on a government run health care for everybody which they can't defend which which when you examine it collapses\nHey what was the last time you and

when people say that to me and I know you mean you're a good guy\nAnd and David has written these books she started with persecution his first book on faith and religion and um I think now the best book yet it's called Jesus has risen poll in the early church\nAnd David is that a pretty profound impact on me making me realize I'm not that religious and then I I Believe everything um I I Would be one of those people that sort of shows up at Christmas and Easter at your church\nUh and I don't go to church that much but uh but I Believe all of us ... and ah and both of you have encouraged me to to want to be better does that make sense\nIt makes a lot of sense to you know are often times feeds is contagious and faith one can rub off one another phase breathe\nBasically you guys getting my

everywhere we see we're not going to kick our ... I Would I ran into\nUm what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator and when I was in Washington went during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass\nDuring those hearings is coming out of where I was going in and I said ... Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over I might just because I disagreed vehemently with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get the subtle out at the ballot box I have\nHave a fear and when I say fear with um regarding myself but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response would go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself how would I have always said that has a man of the ... that's why I say I have a fear I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that only me the old me would come out with my wife told me would come out and then it would go by what my response would go by what but I think they pick and choose the targets that's exactly\nWell may be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this well it's a it's not going to stop crazy people\nBut I got to tell you something I Will walk I Will do everything I can do to walk away I Do part of martial arts all the arch that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves\nThey're going to react like past not then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and past and what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American values that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigations and Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for a better job they can see the orchestra now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the other the say listen I'm tired of this because out of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they\nPretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am the lady so do you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign\nBut you say they have it to another level and you'll you'll propagating you're out of Cleveland, Ohio\nOkay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixty one was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million Moran poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama said we're never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button I there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message\nThis recurring tell him as a message to the movies in the black community I come\nFrom a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked\nIt in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really up for what we're doing with the conservative movement or they're going to vote with\nUs because just starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey\nWhat's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular thought he's going to get on the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this day but if if we all\nBelieve in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes ... the word or\nEducation from the Latin is in ... to bring forth from within that tells you that God put their our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people\nAnd that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's the great story of the two years at Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that but I think the leftist\nAuthoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics\nDividing people on the basis of race and gender\nIs every four to four years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white a write up a racist sexist massage in this Tacoma ...
