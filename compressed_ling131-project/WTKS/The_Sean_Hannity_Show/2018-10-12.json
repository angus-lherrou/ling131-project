James O'Keefe is going to join us\nAnd the Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit they're\nEmitted his campaign of his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people of tendency\nBut the very purpose of getting elected and they say it's not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't play view later in the program today but I mean it is in his mind numbing\nThat people have hero\nTruth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe\nAnd the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them all oh wait do we get to the tape on cinema today or you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester is they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington but go when they get their here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that's the first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering solutions and answers and solving problems\nAnd the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're gonna get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes\nWell that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever\nTo never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on Monday\n... ... jobs of post jobs are never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump's brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what do we what can we do to help facilitate you working here in building here in grading factories manufacturing centers ear and\nWell they tell them well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... that because of that regulation or the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America\nAnd then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America and then on top of that he challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years\nAnd he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico\nHave you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody has been all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what country it was saying and I'm like well I Do think we need some prison reform I'll give you an example\nWhen the president ... commuted the sentence so ballots marine Johnson remember the woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug a fence a grandmother apparently should run in a horrible economic difficulties as like ... there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system\nAnyway spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or\nAbsolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her right into the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen and then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nI Want to find all the hours Murray Johnson's in prison that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that would that may be a bit given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York well I've been here under Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred\nThree or four hundred Bernie ... was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed where the shots being fired wherever it happens to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night\nAnd not worry the bullets they're going to be flying through their windows and the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to fix Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary ... our our human our human family in talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice it's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better\nAnd then he's talking about bringing jobs making things in America and creating jobs in America you know the is they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed\nAnd we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing as white as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that his downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be African American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness\nIt's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious vile thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when they grow don't read flat folks aren't that since he's praying tiny west in the ... now the sudden ... because he put on a ... hats and he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that the the model spokes person he's he's the token negro of the of the Trump administration's this\nWas an embarrassment ... mother is rolling over in her grave\nI think you had there man has clearly not okay to president who's willing to point that was a combination of stream of consciousness I felt like I sit in on a psychiatric ...\nAnd a commercial for Donald Trump on the question of of of mental health on the question of other cleaning ham I felt very good point and to me that was something very fragile valid and sad about tiny pulling on the phone and France like Titanic as colorfully outside I think that for their own somewhere picture of a ...

think it's just something that I learned this in part from from ... great coverage oh John F.

of innocence\nHas now definitely hurt the Democratic party I think these tapes of bread a sin and in Tennessee and cinema in Arizona are gonna hurt those candidacies\nAnd when you have thirty two house seats really you know going to tip the balance one way or the other which way does it go John McLaughlin\nWhile I ... I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you got a notice this week you noticed the market went down its ... up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations of businesses with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again and that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened\nWith the backlash of about the whole having a hearing and how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this week where I'm McCaskill is losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down right and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls\nUm you know people want chops and what's scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nDo you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your poetry to raise taxes take what you've got and take away the jobs take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had holes in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfair will among all voters she has a she has a fifty three percent unfavorable among independent women\nThat the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country\nSo these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically just stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's ah ah agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to have been looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort but those as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations an impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice they won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average is gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively in the direction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the values of New York I have noticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that\nI Know but if I got\nI got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat that problem is not me and eloquent us stem cells or are they stream and so those are like\n... where it is that there are because they are they the extreme conservative stations so knows that it's not because\nIt's simple no one is Hans within a size life oh no me hang\nA um right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm so but there's no place for me in the state of New York and he said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor and everything you love and vote for one's me out of town\nI speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York\nOr to promote Hannity whenever office would like to run for I think my friend John and I can\n... the ... well you disabuse our friend Doug the very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I say look you're still the kid from Franklin square you're still you're still have with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way Doug fold than out on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\nRent I heard it oh yeah yes I don't I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid or because he's moving so far left\nTed it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash\nBut but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back where the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world\nAre we we we're basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be garden governed have control of their own healthcare\nBut but if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next feature she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just friday is a frightening Republican Doug shown does not want this do you do oh\nI Want democratic candidates at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal races absolutely on she should go period style\nAbsolutely and and does point about in previous times or have been on the radio as you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again what's the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time what should be on the ... the better stop Nancy Pelosi from getting\nI think it's got to do that or not I I think look if you if you like the success of the last two years if you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you if you believe in secure borders if you believe in energy independence ...\nNews I'm rich Dennison American pastor Andrew Brunson has left turkey following record ruling that convicted him on terror charges but also southern pre after two years in custody Brunson suspected apply for a certain American base in Germany venture Andrews Air force base where he should land tomorrow back in positive territory [noise]\nAfter two days of big losses stock index is closing higher today the Dow up two hundred and eighty seven but still postings biggest weekly lost in six months\nThe U.S and be gaining thirty eight the NASDAQ up one sixty seven Facebook says hackers access data from twenty nine million users as part of the security breach affecting fifty million accounts disclose two weeks ago\nHackers were able to get names email addresses and phone numbers from those twenty nine million there were also able to get home towns birthdays and recent searches of fourteen million of those accounts [noise]\nThis is Fox News\nShow beer weather alerts and the information\nI got\nThe show ... seven downloaded to your I bought me I Am the insider at ... dot com I twenty five now so the\nTop of the hour eight hundred nine one one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program want to send a shot at we saw the pictures the devastation down in the panhandle in Florida wonderful people that live down there and thank God most of you got out you were eating the warnings\nYou know we were seen entire neighborhoods it looked like a tornado wipe them out I mean that's that's the only comparison I can use\n'em and I'm very glad to see a lot of the coverage today and and a lot of the help that has been on the way and a lot of the capital raise arrived in I even see them putting up you know all the\nAlthough electric power the Saudis all the different power companies from throughout the south east Texas and all neighboring states they all hands on deck and they're all help everybody out then\nI just hang in there and I know this or any needs for some people that uh the American people will be there for you were just that's it we're family and a lot of people lost\nA lot this hurricane and our thoughts and prayers go out to you all have lifted it's friday and a twenty five days now ... time to put a little bit of your party light on and it's our friday Florida Georgia Line background\nConcerts series ...\n\n...\n...\n... dollar bottom bottom block powerboat\nI'm reading or really the\nMatter of fact we\nAround\nSinai where the parties and\nHang in Miami you\nFound in my\nAll in town we know and I\n... last year\n...
