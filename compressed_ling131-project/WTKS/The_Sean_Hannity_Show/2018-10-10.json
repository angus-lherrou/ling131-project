south of Atlanta Atlanta is not going to get the brunt of this at some point tomorrow but Gus the is going to be hit really really hard so draw a line from Panama City Beach Florida straight to Augusta, Georgia\nAnd if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael and it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast\nThrough Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect at that point is probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline cap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge these destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher\n... over a million power outages we expect to occurring and not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nRainfall flooding is going to be a significant threat into the Carolinas so everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina you know you can make your preparations now and I would listen to local authorities of the telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you pack the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers are with everybody in harm's way today this was this was the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's going to be this is one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's gonna be the worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida\nThat's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends in Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein oh this is really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim told me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew all the fourth ...\nThe application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now or the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony rushing dusty aid that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legal expense\nNow he was now are supposed to testify because three people now Lisa Page Andrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week\nJames Baker now the third person are all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office taping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional task force interview\nAnd insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aide said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and have him testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying Diddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talked about why signs of the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he sign off on a document himself talked about well with regards to ... warns that as an affidavit and career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nIf there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it\nThey knew the DNC paid for it they knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the the us da was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents and when questioned in in in Iraq a tour and Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true it's just raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit ... the law especially Pfizer application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton\nBought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hate it Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said\nWell first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Wal Mart but also said that Hillary should win them a hundred million is zero and then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made\nAnd what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... of what the insurance policy was\nInsurance policy is that you have people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation Lisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tech confirmed that there's no there are there\nBut anyway then they started ... media elite strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA they get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA\nAnd it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen and then they appoint\nRod a Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those sailing too is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate\nOr judiciary committee's outside of the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why Whitey especially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath you know and people worry about that just ask Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power and twenty seven days we have in Arizona Mick Sally thankfully has taken the lead in that close Senate race out there she is really an American war hero\nAnd ah anyway I think we're seeing a lot of moving in Missouri in favor of the Republican candidates a lot of movement Heidi Heitkamp is in trouble in North Dakota Joe Donnelly is in trouble in Indiana\nStay safe stay sheltered as a very dangerous situation\nThat the White House President Trump says federal resources already everybody that's got to be hit we have covered Michael's pushing a storm surge of up to fourteen feet and could

House office of security and the FBI security division\nRate was questioned about the investigation\nToday during a Senate committee hearing\nThis is a Fox News alerts\n\n\n\nHolding them accountable show and the answer is no one else does America deserves the truth about Congress\nRule of law is indispensable to a thriving and vibrant society [noise] she\nThe citizens from government over reaching an arbitrary ... pursuing truth means always yelling the facts [noise] even if they run counter to our whole [noise] in a courtroom truth about credible evidence [noise] strong opinions\nAbout there's a lot of talk about five ... applications and many people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize what five ... five ... actually a warrant just like a search warrant\nIn order to get a ... a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears\nThat the information the affidavit as true incorrect to the best of his knowledge and belief\nAnd that's the way we operate and if this wrong sometimes it is if you find out as an incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in there that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know it was signed up for David they get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out what the third renewal buys an application in the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for ... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course\nHe's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey he's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd uh now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse\nOver the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional task force interviews\nAnd those closed Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and\nCongressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nInterview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that\nWe now know that Lisa Page Andrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation leaves the page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein\nSaid that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein or not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in\nHad Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes\nA to effectively have a deal Jake two on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think you're saying is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nI think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measure I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nUh you you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he's the number two at the oj I could tell you got to people on the phone today Jim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions under oath\nAnd want to talk about your whole security protecting your family that simply ... security the best\nHome security system on the market even said by the net PC Magazine the wire cutter is their top pick for home security and there's a good reason when they started on this program they're only five

need to give out the numbers are Trey Gowdy is office\nAnd chairman Goodlatte solvers in say call these men and demand that they subpoenaed under oath Rod Rosenstein ... well I don't know why they would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWill uh hopefully I I Want I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number and you're great at holding people accountable but here's what I Would say\nIs the fact that you're covering it you're listening interest and the people that the truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or trying to work today uh to\nTo stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general must caught me at\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that uh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final Pfizer warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular buys her application\nI had not shown we need to see that we need to see it and don't take an after every time\nOr goes in and talks with yeah yeah I remember Mr or told us that after each conversation he had with\nGlenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact person at the FBI and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know there are at least twelve of those\nSo the so called real too is when you see those and remember when the president first talked about declassify what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe page all those documents as well\nThat would include ... numbers so we we need all that information\nAnd again if you're ... find that reading your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see it more important the American people need to see\nOr do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero people I please do oh two two to five six oh three oh a chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five\nFifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but\nThink with all that's going on they should\nDemand that he testify under oath thank you so much congressman Mark Meadows thank you congressman Jim Jordan and we appreciate your push for the truth we need to get to the bottom of the [noise]\nAll right we've got to take a break when we come back we got a lot more to come down ... more on this also the latest on this hurricane that is pounding the Florida Panhandle as we speak hurricane Michael I'm much

bad\nAnd the high hard field station now Fox News radio covers the world\nNews radio seven points out\nOne of the biggest storms and one of the biggest sell off ever only ... the Dow dropped more than eight hundred points mainly fueled by rising interest rates the NASDAQ plunging more than four percent it's biggest point drop in Eighteen years\nHow vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist massage units you know the the phobic sober folks kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time Sean in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back down we're going to back you up and we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it\nBut based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spiced up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen to them and looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a massive amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that abduction some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation a ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnish state just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nShow you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is ... ...\nThe credits have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal so all of this isn't that jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed split the and you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American have a better life\nRight and showing the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host\nAt a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have she end up this rage ... not all of them but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me to think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime and literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he's been he's been called trees is they've jammed up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this American patriot and Kavanaugh you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base follow\nHim into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and then teach men of Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how in a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible uh for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that the toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people are are not\nAh in positions of power and will not be able to run the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than Brock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity 'em and add money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWhile I did like Kevin McCarthy introduced which was a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\nThat is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age in the health of some of the justices that there is no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the near future\n... and don't forget shown that the circuits in the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell you most of these cases that over importance to American businesses American individuals moms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court\nAnd tropical ready has was uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to have to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat or you know that that could come open if Trump wins reelection they may come open I ... and I say that Sean\nI'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually worried what will happen to the country if that seat if it gets very decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed would cabinet can you imagine what's going to happen if that seat comes open as a potential six three conservative majority on the courts\nI mean it is genuinely frightens me at a at a again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen\nBring friends and family you do not want to sneak up and you need to change hearts and minds about abortion drugs though maybe PG Thirteen\nHoly gentle giants dog food

while we're anticipating is a lot of down trees are impacting the power in and uh you know here again we're going to see a lot of damage devastation along the coast structurally [laughter] and then as it moves and you're going to see power outages throughout the state\nOr those Brock Long FEMA administrator I was saying that hurricane Michael is a Gulf Coast hurricane of the worst kind Michael striking the Florida Panhandle uh ... dad to hit\nAnd wins now gusting up to a hundred and Seventy five miles per hour or the damages severe it is hitting back some of them strength now as we speak or we welcome back to the program a good friend Joe ... is the official meteorologist or the Sean Hannity show with weather bell dot com\nWell everything you predict that as we talked earlier in the program today has come true this is a bad bad storm it's they're now in the middle of it\nAnd uh it's more devastating than we even thought of could be\nWell we had it going to as a category for my company from Sunday and as a matter of fact I Know my dad used to always say I mean if you have to tell somebody said something you must not set it loud enough but not everybody hears things a few days away so it was actually is that we put it out publicly with the Patriot post\nWhich is a conservative blog I Do a Monday morning\nFound people that it's going to be but look here's the thing with this storm folks\nThe first thing is this is not climate change or any evidence of it okay so you could see this coming you could see the whole pattern come in fact I talked to Shaun ... on the sixteenth of September I said I'll I'll be seen you get an October probably because of the Gulf\nRight now you said it right on the show I Know\nYeah right right on the show and you could see the pattern setting up\nEverything got together and that's why you and you see that every once in a while but let me put it in perspective this is the worst storm ever to hit between ... camp I that I can find on records okay now you know when the ten thousand years ago something hit worse so we're not in my car sugar coat that\nBut on the other hand it's not because of your SUV All right this is what nature is capable of doing and you could see this pattern setting up\nPretty far in advance it's also one of only a handful of storms the last twenty five years\nIncluding Harvey by the way that hit at its peak Andrew did that ... that I was in at its peak when it came into Florida was weakening off its peak most of these hurricanes and we've been blessed and not like the thirties forties and fifties that hit on their peak now as far as the storm it's as if it made landfall\nAs a borderline category five I'm ... and when it's all done they may call it a category five I'm not sure they're going to go in and look at the damage but there's a lot more left with this storm folks\nBecause even though it's weakening hurricane force winds are going to go all the way in the central Georgia I've got to be ... to one Seventy five but they're going to be ... to eighty Ninety a hundred miles an hour Atlanta you will escaped the worst of it\nBut I guess it's probably going to come right over Augusta very close to Columbia South Carolina just north of Fayetteville by this time tomorrow when we're talking and then it will move off the mid Atlantic Coast between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk, Virginia very late Thursday night\nOn out to sea to the south of New England just be a glancing blowing the I Ninety five quarter in the meantime for you folks in the Carolinas All right you you're not going to have the kind of a kind of cold long siege bought in as six to twelve hour period\nFor much of the interior Caroline is they're going to be wind gust into forty fifty sixty miles an hour
