what they do every day you know the sad thing about all of this ... you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explained that the minute but you\nDon't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve Scully so the fact that he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through the time was far worse than was reported\nAnd people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders says you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nOut I I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie Sanders was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him\nAnd I said that and just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House when Obama was president\nAnd as it did they came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but protecting our elected president is is job one for all of us\nAs Americans is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said Mr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door but he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms or the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error you've got to protect our president that that represents the free world\nSo they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\n\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because um there's this idiot\nOn fake news CNN his name I ... what's his name John Avalon\nBut he was taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years and I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to the near wrote to me let's just played that part but when he but basically blaming me listen to this\nWhat their politics are managed that we keep America safe\nYou know when I when I go out there and say I'm not going to go ... into the silly ridiculous road of saying well because that guy like Bernie Sanders and he shot up Republicans on a ball field the Bernie must support that I said just the opposite is true\nYou know it is beyond reckless and irresponsible for CNN and all of them to ignore the rhetoric of De Niro and Madonna I think an awful lot about blowing up the White House they call the president twenty four seven on that network a liar\nThey've gone deep into the conspiracy theory of Trump Russia collusion with no evidence but ignore such collusion when we do have evidence as relates to Hillary\nThey fall into the all the Kavanaugh standard but only because he's a Republican or appointed by Republican but they're in love with the Clintons there nobody that's Keith Ellison

found\nYou've really got just over a week\nTo try to stop pull a few of the Democrats from winning and the Republicans really need to have a laser focused on that and run a very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent there's a story I think Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amounts it's by big amounts so you have a congressional race where the Democrats are spending a other Republican two million to one million in Virginia ten were barber concepts running for reelection people were saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point it had\nAll the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks versus are two million between the Republican or groups in a center account I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats is below sea become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by I guess any measure right\nIt's a split decision except that the Democrats will have a focused they will control the house I think of the committees that are going to change to think of think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the\nWith the with all these investigations et cetera guess what's going to happen with the judiciary\nCommittee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go they'll go check his taxes the leak all this stuff and it'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us\nPollsters we get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election well you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same area you said is getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see it between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time could jak thing they\nDon't want it or they are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nI Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare\nAnd I think he is right to say that the Democrats are mobilized and focus on the um on the house exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one with the dirty secret\nIt's not so much Donald Trump is at risk if the Republicans in the house and Senate much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt one of the weaknesses as it relates also to the Republican\nHouse is there's so many retirements what are their forty five separate retirements are incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people in a lot of these races is negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical seats that the Republicans really need to win and and the dog is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to them but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to him as former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC as putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really\nDug understands it they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and had to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered\nDelivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped pay for Nineteen Ninety four and September that had we had the generic Republicans up seven and that was to the house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michael I was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care\nWell Haley Barbour far ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some they have the
