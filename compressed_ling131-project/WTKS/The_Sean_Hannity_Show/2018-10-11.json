{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "Okay Comey will tell you\nIt's a I think yeah October twenty two two thousand sixteen in London the battle of Ideas Festival\nNow it's linked on drudge today it's very timely because Camille has a new book and it's a collection of essays over the years\nShe is a legitimate feminist she's not a militant new wage in fact she regrets and very much abhors\nSecond wave feminism which is what she calls the modern era I trace it back to the late sixties early seventies second wave feminism she thinks is\nHas been horrible for everybody and I just have a couple of soundbites here she speaks like a machine gun so make sure you listened fast\nIn the Nineteen twenties Nineteen thirties that's neat is my favorite period in feminist them because these women admired what men\nHad done and there was no male bashing and became the next second wave feminism ... point spread worldwide\nFeminism based on denigrating men ... might have done a defining men as as a practice and tyrants their history okay in an absolute lie there hadn't been crimes against women where they have occurred we must condemn them\nBy men throughout history have given their lives and their land or for the support of women and children and this is an element in second wave feminism and to me it's an extra Appalachian I'm neurotic system and the ...\nUh we have a tough race by the way it's going to be a tough race for Scott Walker in Wisconsin who I think it's done a phenomenal job or as it relates to you know the state of Wisconsin\nI Hope the people of Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close a we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican Kemp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well what fifty one percent and rats musician and so we'll watch\nThat but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota I Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana that can take back that state which is a red state then you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana I think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing\nAnd I think Marsha Blackburn\nIs going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee should have been a longtime friend of this program in recent polls now have her up as well and then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are gonna make\nA difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives I mean because of gerrymandering above big portion and percentage of seats\nI ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats so we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody in these tight races in an attempt to help them all out now I Am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent\nIf they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do the alternative health care solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts on health care cooperatives et cetera were\nJust going to have a better country and and the more prosperous country you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the pure force of personality\nI mean Donald Trump is a force of nature\nAnd I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor but if he's not fighting them we're not winning\nAnd when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again while you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that made I was trying to do which is prevent a hostile regime from ever having the power to turn off the picket and turn off the light blood of western Europe's economy is a simple basic things\nNobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury\nApparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\nThe guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula\nYou look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there a nuclear armed North Korea is not something that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great would that be for the world you know they got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nAnd on the on the tarmac for mullahs in Iran that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either you know I Want to get and Michelle Obama\nWas on the today show earlier today and an interview with savannah Guthrie asking about recent comments from Eric Holder about kicking Republicans let's go to holders comments and Hillary Clinton's comments you can't be several with anybody that disagrees with us listen\nAll over [laughter] my wife went really scares me [laughter] you know when they go low we go [laughter] go low we read\n[noise] different priorities about\nNot the federal with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and or the ... he can start again [noise] but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and respect strength [noise] and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nThe president really demeaned the confirmation process\nAnd we we can't be several of we disagree with them now give us power and then we'll be civil or you've got to be kidding when you when they go low you just kick them on Michelle Obama\nSaid fears is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you'd think about how you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think about life and their opportunities do you want them to be afraid of their neighbors and you want them angry the one dimensional\nWondering Michelle Obama say anything when Sarah Sanders was run out of a restaurant or Pam Bondi was run out of a restaurant or secretary Nielsen was run out of a restaurant by these angry liberal\nLeftist mobs and they are moms and this this is Rand Paul pointed out somebody's gonna get hurt\nSomebody might get killed and all of this if they allow this to continue but the rhetoric is coming from the quote so cold leadership and by the way Brock Obama himself was not exactly a faint when it came to the issue of being a well civil\nGo on to your friends your neighbors to the doctor whether they're independent or whether they're Republican or you're with them in the face a pretty good I'm not going to miss a furnace on Fox News also suffered itself against the Sean Hannity\nWhen someone is cooler acts like a bully you don't just sit there and let them know our motto is\nWhen they go low we go high you\nKnow they're going lower than they've ever been and that's what we witnessed with judge Kavanaugh would know due process known presumption of innocence the most outrageous allegations that were thrown against this man and people still I Believe I Believe people when there's no corroborating evidence\nThat is what party that doesn't believe in fundamental basic fairness constitutional due process and the presumption of innocence that is insane\nAnd we saw what happened to him but we see it every two and four years don't we and we're seeing it now and it's happening and you got people like let's see Maxine Waters Cory Booker Eric Holder yeah getting their face kick them when they're down you know follow them in the gas\nDay the focus is search and rescue we prayed that's already in states say\nFlorida governor Rick Scott at least seven deaths are blamed on the storm Michael now a tropical storm is dumping heavy rain in the Carolinas North Carolina governor Roy Cooper urging residents to prepare\nUm storm surge on the coast to strong winds in the eastern and central parts of North Carolina to rein in the Piedmont and the

savannah [noise]\nShaun Hannity show thermonuclear ... layers solved on fake news Saturday is on right now\nI twenty five now till the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program a media I had a piece out it's it's not generally well known I never knew this but the son of Obama national security adviser Susan Rice or her son happens to be a conservative\nIn fact his name is John rice camera and he's the president of the Stanford University college Republicans and is now saying that he was assaulted by one of these violent democratic a Democrat protesters during the pro Kavanaugh rally that they had last week and the Stanford Daily reports that\nCameron who is the president of the Stanford college Republicans claims that a classmate Belinda Hernandez quote shoved him in the chest with their hand during a verbal disagreement\nAs a student news outlet citing a Stamford department of public safety spokesperson said Hernandez was placed under private person arrest at rice Cameron's request and issued a citation for battery\nOther Stamford daily quoted a law enforcement source saying there's no obvious physical injury to either party involved and rice camera refused evaluation by paramedics Hernandez along with multiple other witnesses dispute that characterization and claim Hernandez merely touched him after he refused to stop\nVideo recording a her without her consent\nI don't know if you saw the recent video my friend and colleague Brian kill me to the Fox news channel\nRyan's walking the streets of New York and these guys that they just would not let up Bryan goes on the subway there in the summer they go\nIf you want to say something somebody that's best friends with Donald Trump saying now\nI mean it's unbelievable\nAnd what are you supposed to do with that you can't react he can't say anything but if they're creating you talk about what are we what ... what a liberal is always a hostile environment\nThey're creating a pretty hostile mop like environment in some cases we showed the video what went on in Portland where literally people driving their cars are being stopped their cars are being kicked\nGod Forbid if you had to make America great bumper sticker on your car or or wearing a make America great hat God help you\nIn that particular case it's an all of this was being encouraged\nBy the so called leaders of the Democratic party and that's what that's what we've got to understand here this is the modern left the Democratic party there is no vision there's no there's there are no solutions being offered\nThere's a lot of hate being pedaled around a lot of innuendo now we know they're not the party of the constitution and due process and for some sort of innocence you know these values have served as well as a country for a long time\nAnd now with a very pathetic and sad and frankly now alarming state and I honestly think that Rand Paul is not off base when he says that this rhetoric is going to lead to somebody getting killed at some point\nWhen Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize if there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence they might even live next door to you don't know where these people are [noise] uh when we shouldn't do is incite people to violate the problem is is rational people my back down what's gonna\nHappen when the guy comes with a gun to a rally or comes with a knife to a rally there is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down and I think the other side needs to really calling the rhetoric down\nYeah they need to calm the rhetoric town but it's not like what are they going to do they're going to go out there and say well we're running on raising your taxes were running on open borders and eliminating ice\nWe're running because we want to impeach the president we've tried for two years to undermine this man we've had the power of the deep state at levels that\nWell nobody ever thought could be so corrupt\nYou know talking about putting a wire on the president and invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment on the president just because they lost\nYou know in the end the whole Russia investigation was created by phony smoke and mirrors even lease the page that ... just prior to the appointment of Mahler\nYeah there was no there there they had nothing on Trump and Russia and any collusion so what did they do well they went to their their strategy which was their plan B which was oh let's let's let's leaked to the media everything in the Clinton bought and paid for di da\nAnd when I look like it's coming from all these individuals' sources and all look like it's real\nDo you want this success to continue\nOr do you want to go back to the Obama years you want endless some frivolous investigation impeachment higher taxes open borders eliminate ice you want to keep Obamacare [noise]
