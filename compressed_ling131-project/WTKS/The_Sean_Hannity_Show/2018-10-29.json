guards at school or I've been advocating for a long\nTime now retired police retired military\nOn the perimeter in the property on every in every hall of every school\nAnd that's one way to protect our children and I always ask a simple question\nAnd it's not to me about a gun debate if you find yourself in a building with an active shooter would you prefer that there are that you know that there are trained professionals\nIn that building with firearms as a first line of defense especially knowing that most of these shootings are over ... seconds\nAnd even when you get the best response times from the greatest police departments it's usually by the time they get there it's ... it's they're just counting the casualties and and trying to protect in in an orderly fashion those who either or injured or weren't injured\nSo it's a thought um it's been used before but that's not a big story of the day the saddest thing I watched\nAll we got to watch very closely and even hearing my name brought up a number of times and you know I'm just shaking my head because people obviously know nothing about me they know nothing about\nYou know they don't take the time the either bother to watch or listen to this program if you've been listening to the program you know we have been decrying going back to Kavanaugh the angry mobs in\nWashington confronting bidding at senators not letting them closed doors there we've been talking about how dangerous the left wing mob mentality is cotton we've talked about the incidences of Sarah Sanders and her family or kids trying to get something to eat secretary Nielsen trying to get something to eat\nYou know we've talked about Pam Bondi trying to go see a movie Mitch McConnell walk into an airplane numerous times and Mitch McConnell have been his his table slammed on food ripped off his table just last weekend Kevin McCarthy's office having a Boulder sent through it\nYou know and I've been saying it it's we've got these everybody's gotta stop\nNow we've been talking about the rhetoric we heard Hillary you can't be civil kick them Eric Holder and talking about Maxine Waters a lot\nYou know if you see these cabinet members you get a crowd well what does she thinks going to happen when the crowd is formed and you follow the inter restaurants and the department stores and gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted any anywhere anymore\n... how is that going to end well\nTold the story when I met senator what's that guy's name from\nConnecticut again ... looming fall when I was coming out there who was in the middle of the capital hearings you know I don't I don't understand being rude to somebody just because you have a political disagreement\nWe had a very pleasant conversation I invited him on my show I don't know what came of it but nothing obviously but I don't know if we're thinking about it what is the point of being rude to people are getting in people's faces says Cory Booker Spartacus says\nWhy is there this anger out there that we have\nKnow all these bombs that are sent out the first one went to George Soros and I said that day I said this this has got to stop\nAnd George Soros is no fan of Sean Hannity's funds groups that wants me to be silenced and go away but that's not what we do in this country we protect people you're allowed to have political views and spend your money the way you you see fit in life\nAnd even if it's being spent a silence made you know what I still believe in freedom\nOr the ... you know I don't want to see any politician hurt and I have consistent consistently over the years said that when President Obama and people you know threatening him and people race how do we let how does somebody get into the White House says that happened\nWe've got to protect our elected officials we have one president at the time we got it that represents the United states and that represents all of us\nAnd at the end of the day the powers in the ballot box\nBut you know you watch something like what happened this weekend and you watch\nThe Democratic party their lap dogs in the media wasted no time\nYou know trying to politicize this terrible shooting over the weekend pin blame the massacre on President Trump look if the president says fake news is not serving the people of this country you can chronicle it\nYou can watch it they don't see it which is sad their abuse and their bias and they're abusive a platform\nBut the reality is they live and they have an agenda and it's constantly on display at is not in any way shape or form of calls for violence\nSocial media Pittsburgh shooter guy Rodney ... hours by the way\nAnd if President Trump which is barely getting any play they're making you assume that he was must have been a Trump supporter\nNot only attacking people of the Jewish faith but President Trump for his closeness he hid this shooter hated the fact that President Trump and I think he can make an argument after so many presidents had promised to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel\nThat this president has has a line with Israel more than any other president in modern times it'll Trump's surrounded by a slur for Jewish people and then that heat the this killer lamenting there's there's no ... as long as there's a you know\nBad word of a quote infants to infestation\nBut despite those facts you have people you know pretty close to blaming the president and conservatives for the shooting Joe Biden widely expected to run for the presidency seemed to do so when he tweeted that the president's words matter silences complicity what is he talking about\nPaul Krugman New York times suggesting that Trump was to blame at least in part\nSpeaking sarcastically Krugman tweeting a link to the story with the caption but no but none of the white supremacist terrorism has anything to do with Trump oh no\nIt's unbelievable how they now have you know believe their own lives Alan Dershowitz had a powerful column in the Daily Caller today and he's been a a passionate defender over the years a staunch defender and rightly so of\nIsrael and Jewish civil rights anyway drew a link this morning and pointed out something the very few are willing to say and he said\nA day after a man killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue he criticized presidents Obama and Clinton as well as Keith Ellison this is Alan Dershowitz\nAnd went on Fox and friends this morning there can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism we have to have zero tolerance President Obama meets with Eric ... they hid the picture for eight years\nShame on him now we have the picture President Clinton sits on the same platform with Farrakhan shame on him\nKeith Ellison joins with ferrets ... Khan one of the greatest purveyor of anti some medicate just because he's black doesn't give him a pass on anti Semitism and any liberal who has any positive association with Farrakhan as part of the problem not the solution\nThe Pittsburgh massacre comes just two weeks after ... you know called Jewish Americans termites and that's mild compared to the the anti Semitism anti Semitism in the past\nAnd is that racism as well you know there's there's rarely bashing Trump painter Linder SARS sore after the ... massacre in Pittsburgh we're hearing renewed calls to have a national conversation well as long as we don't overlook some of the obvious suspect\nYou know if you look at some of the the the history now with the Democratic party that don't seem to be the supporters of Israel they once were and it's not limited just to Farrakhan you know yeah Palestinian activists lender source shore well known that\nYou know she was a a lead organizer of the anti Trump women's march where Madonna's said she dreamed of an awful lot about blowing up the White House was not so well known as the association that many prominent elected Democrats have what's our store\nYou know and and just the last year she's been campaigning alongside some of the Democratic party's most celebrated a rising star alec Alexandria Ocasio Cortez no wonder\nCortez has adopted many of our shores well radical positions and it was ... brand herself introduced at a rally by source or and last week Ted Lieu reiterated his support for Linda is our store\nAnd she's been campaigning for Michigan house a candidate\nRashida ... vows to vote to slash aid to Israel when she gets in Congress in August Bernie Sanders was campaigning weather and we're beginning to see something here is democratic candidates increasingly\nYou know they're they're being team with the most radical types of it if it was if it was Trump I can assure you there'd be a lot of people speaking out\nOr we have a lot more to talk about we'll talk about how you know Fox is under fire I'm under fire house never Trump or is it just so bitter and angry that they can't stand how wrong they were they they want to do everything possible to align with the most radical elements in the Democratic party\n... support I'm supporting concrete Colo country basement systems to get back on solid ground for free evaluation ... pound to fifty and use the key word foundation\n[noise]\nSo this\nGuy is a fanatical racist anti Semite hates Trump and um\nYou know it just as sad and now we've lost eleven people six still fighting for their lives we can't forget them and in our thoughts and prayers it on your watch some of these people out there pulling out all the stops all weekend long to tie Saturday Saturdays anti Semitic master gr to Trump\nIs too big facts getting in the way while the Republican Party reject anti Semitism out of hand it's it's the Democratic party leaders I never get in a rural what Louis Farrakhan unless I was going to get into the grill and drill him about is anti Semitism\nHis racism the shooter this guy Bowers despised President Trump because he thought Trump was quote controlled by Jews and not only that part of Trump's family is Jewish\nAnd and so on and so forth you know apparently it you know as Ron ... rightfully said oh this weekend on Fox News that you know these very ill an anti Semite can come from any side of the political spectrum\nAnd if you look at the persecution that has taken place and this was something that the president raised the Jews have endured terrible persecution over the years we've read it we've studied it they've gone through it all\nAnd we still see so much of it it is growing by leaps and bounds sadly all across Europe it's getting scary\nAll these countries that seek Israel's destruction radical Islam is Iranian mullahs chanting death to Israel our president said we will seek their destruction which is standing holy behind in the right way Israel or as so many people\n\nHave been you know victims of anti Semitism you\nKnow Sarah Sanders pointing out is there any tragedy the Washington Post won't exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump but there's the president is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nWe haven't had a president in modern history that has stood by our closest friends and allies Israel in the middle east ever\nAnd what an act of courage was apparently but there's other presidents have promised that never did it\nAnd making Jerusalem the rifle capital of Israel [noise]\nAnyway we're going to get to all of that Fox News similarly under attack I've got all the latest numbers on the election um I'm also going to tell you if right now I Would say the Republicans in eight days my prediction is today I'll give you one every day there's any updates they pick up seats in the Senate\nBut I think we're

Kavanaugh hearings I didn't hear many people on the left to cry the angry mobs that were going on in the halls of Congress I I got to the point where I said probably it's better if we cleared the halls of the public\nOr you would think in the people's house that the people will be allowed to go where they are elected officials are but it was obviously becoming\nUnsafe for people senators being spit at you saw the treatment of you know we've had in recent weeks what do we have rice and sent or what was supposed to be rice and sudden to Susan Collins home during the cabinet Harry's Law coat hanger sent to her office et cetera\nWe've watched than in recent weeks rice in or what they said ... rice and being sent to the president and General Mattis and our FBI Director\nRight and our CIA director Gina Haspel we watched the last few weeks what we watch these mobs and if people being run out of restaurants\nYou know Sarah Sanders and our kids and family secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi\nTed Cruz Mitch McConnell airports and having his table slammed in his food thrown out the restaurant door I've been telling everybody that the rhetoric is too hot and too heated and people need to come down\nBut nobody on the Democratic side ever decided to stand up and say this this has gotta stop\nOn this program I set it when Obama was president it's got to stop we got to protect our elected officials\nThe day that they mailed this the first device was sent to George Soros his house first thing I sat on the radio I said we've got the ... this can happen in this country\nI Know he's not a fan of mine in any of the people that were threatened by these bombs but the rush to politicize this and turn this into well this is who conservatives are is just one big lie\nWhat you're watching unfold before you're very eyes is you know the race to politicize tragedies thank God those twelve or Thirteen\nPVC bombs didn't go off and nobody lost their life thank God\nBut that wasn't Donald Trump's fault\nThen you can you know look at this terrible tragedy and they're shooting in the synagogue by this\nRabid anti Semite racist and also a Trump ... not that it should even be relevant it's getting scary\nWe had real bullets used over the weekend also to shoot up a Republican Party headquarters in Florida\nYou know and that could have killed people\nSouth Daytona police investigating after they said that someone shot out the window of the local county Republican headquarters police set of workers arrived Monday morning saw the damage called authorities we have another threat of a man has accused the guy who's been arrested\nBy threatening to kill Florida congressman Carlos Curbelo\nThat story came out this week it he's been threatened\nAbout a call for violence unbelievable the times that we're living in\nNow here is um where we are the Senate is interesting 'cause there's two races you can add maybe to the let's watch called\nAnd I would say that would be West Virginia where Joe Manchin is down by two in the latest poll and Menendez is barely hanging on to a lead in New Jersey by three now do I think both of those races are going to be won by Republicans\nAh maybe West Virginia New Jersey it's hard for possible\nPeople in New Jersey clearly fed up with an end us\nThen I think it's too close to call on either the gubernatorial race I have no idea why\nFloridians are flirting with Gil almost got a radical agenda in Florida Rick Scott's done a fantastic job as governor and\nIt'd be a perfect complement for the Republican majority in the Senate I think Marsha Blackburn hangs on we got Josh Hawley now in the lead in Missouri we got Dean Heller holding on to his lot hopefully that's an important race in Nevada\nI don't know why Christ in ... cinema\nWe've got new tape on cinema tonight that will blow that case wide open\nI don't see how somebody who supported Americans joining the Taliban could win in Arizona and calling her own state crazy and the

the people of Indiana don't vote for the libertarian and split the ticket\nThe Republican their Braun should be able to win that race and that would be a pickup for Republicans I think Montana's a little bit and play but I'd say favoring pastor at this moment but tester can be beaten there\nAnd I think the biggest thing is I'm looking at real clear politics and the battle for the house race they have two hundred and five likely Democrats and Republicans two hundred\nAnd the rest you have some thirty toss up seat that have gone to define or tipped the balance of power\nJohn James by the way is now only within six against Avon out he was one soundbite twenty\n... he's a totally great rising star in the Republican Party\nAnd I think it'd be great we'll see what happens but you know I think the house can slip so there are three possible scenarios\nA week from this Wednesday the day after one is Republicans rock the world and shocked the world again and they ... hold on to the house pick up Senate seats that's the ideal\nFor eight days and there's a split decision they hold on to the Senate pick up seats but it's speaker elect below sea that split decision and the worst case scenario speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Chuck Schumer all these important\nRace as we have on Hannity dot com thank you Linda for reminded me hey listen you've got to keep your

lot more about Robert Bowers and who he is he was a very ill an anti Semite he was a huge critic of Donald Trump\nOr in a lot of ways um and the president you know took heat for saying what that means maybe and we've talked about this after school shootings in after other church shootings where the president said well maybe we need to have retired police and military it's a sad state of affairs\nBut um as a line of defense but that doesn't take away from the horror and the vicious evil\nThat took place here you look at the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dorm or the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um we'll get into all those as we continue rose cannon I'm the host of Clinton rows and rows um plugged in Pittsburgh, PA ugh long front of the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nUh you know how much I Love but friends in Pittsburgh rose him very very sorry or thoughts and prayers go to everybody on the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIt is shining you or so left in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story the news Saturday morning\nI mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear the list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular Pittsburgh neighborhood I go there to shop and to dying and done in fact my son told me just about a month ago that's one of the neighborhood is considering moving too so we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very involved though in so many aspects\nAnd not just their community but the out if the surrounding communities and as it turned out you know of course that grew up with a girl who's cuts and with the two brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community and the Pittsburgh area and it just it's heartbreaking it really is to see that this happened but\nAs soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I got sick thinking that this is going to become political\nAnd it said you can count the seconds ... there's an interesting side note that there is no throw this to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turned against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know at a pretty powerful column that he put out linking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan\nI'd never ever get in a room with a vicious racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged to with Farrakhan and Obama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we have had since the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nAny person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump as an anti Semitic bone in his body does that have their mind look in his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out ... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a President Clinton sitting in a room\nWith Mr fabric on their pictures of President Clinton President Obama Cory Booker shaking hands and smiling with Farrah Khan members of Congress doing the same Linda source or another hater\nI'll get an

I'm Sorry I just you draw the line\nAnd trying to find may here too and there's something I like your listeners to know because\nI I noticed a couple of headlines today on Sunday there was a letter that was published and written by eleven members of a group called bend the ark and they have a Pittsburgh affiliate right here and they sent a letter to the president is blaming hat and they said that you yourself called the\nMurder evil that yesterday's violence is that direct combination if you were influence and they said you're in the past three years you're working your policies have\nInviting that's involved in this\nAnd that you know what Sean what's interesting is I had so many messages and phone calls\nFrom listeners today they they pretty much agree first of all of that than they are just that your listeners now is not representative of the Pittsburgh Jewish community they did not speak for that and that is what many of my listeners said these people are are there and obscure left wing group\nI'm a very progressive chase and and they don't speak to the Jewish community here in Pittsburgh I've been told by many this morning\nYou don't have everyone David go

Sean our number you want to be a part of the program Ralph Reed is back with us a\nHe is the founder of the chairman of the faith and freedom\nCoalition and CEO of of century strategies and look he was part of the Christian Coalition back in the day when they paid played such a powerful force in American politics in many ways he has rebuilt the Christian Coalition in terms of\nGetting out mailers and and making contacts with voters all around the country key races now in the Senate will watch in Florida it's a dead heat and that is both a Senate with Rick Scott and that's for governor\nAnd Ron dissenters has a couple of points behind and that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle and people showing up in the panhandle you got a very tight race for governor and the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back towards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill Brett is it and we have British ... team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin on that he's going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really is taking people back also on tape staffers progressing calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall hold but people have got to get out to vote 'em we see Josh Hawley is doing very well and he's up by a couple of percentage points in Missouri against that pony Claire McCaskill\nAnd she's bragging about how she really politically it's just like Obama but she too like bread as soon as hiding who she really is\nHeidi Heitkamp in North Dakota is down by double digits she also was exposed by project Vera ... uh we now have in a Braun in Indiana he's up by a couple of points against incumbent Joe Donnelly a Democrat the only the only factor\nThere that I really see is there's a libertarian that's drawing vote so away from the Republican so if you're in Indiana don't vote libertarian or else that's like a half a vote for Donnelly\nWe've got a hold the seat held her seat in Nevada right now he's currently up in the polls but it's always tightened Nevada and then Arizona I have no idea why poll came out this weekend showing Christian send them other Democrat up on war hero twenty eight year veteran\nSix tours of duty Iraq and Afghanistan Martha mix Sally especially with cinema calling the people of Arizona crazy and saying Arizona's the\nMeth lab of democracy and inviting the attorney for the blind shake to Arizona State university and saying right after nine eleven was perfectly fine of Americans want to join the enemy and joined the Taliban I don't have a problem with anyway he believes that he can help get out the vote Ralph Reed is with us\nThat's the Senate do you agree with my assessment\nIdeas Sean we're uh we're currently are contacting twenty six million\nEvangelical and pro life than pro family Catholic voters and Nineteen states we knocked on a million nine hundred and seven thousand three hundred and twenty eight doors a through this weekend Sean not that we're counting and as of this weekend five point\nEight million of the voters that we've contacted have already voted we expect that number to exceed ten million by election day\nWe think we're going to have the biggest turnout of Christian voters we've ever had a better term election\nWell I Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house uh I look at ras muses number the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing\nThe president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide here\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats and two oh five Republicans at two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and ... are it by the people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature through our organization is ignore the polls ignored the press ignore the pundits do your job get the ...\nOr everybody but me you know I make a living for people not ignoring\nYour except it okay but I think you're right though because the polls\nAre so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman in Georgia where we elected the first Republican governor and that stayed in a hundred and thirty four years\nAnd think about the timing may your business to track to that time what was your off track employing more boys one is normal day standing desk solution would be reading them when they were\nHere healthier and more productive married

lot of flooring products have been affected by the tariffs put on China recently affected by literally going up ten percent price the solution of course this American Made products but now I Want to talk to you about what's coming January first we're\nLooking at another price increase in some manufacturers are talking about a possible twenty five percent increase\nTwenty five percent is a big

I heard radiolab just open the up\nAnd have a guy\nOn how to\nMy life\nThe radio voice\nBreed founder chairman of the faith and Freedom Coalition\nUm and I think that the ... look there are many factors I think Kavanaugh is playing a part in this I think the Democrats none of them have spoken at all about the care of their sales has been definite you know and then they'll say is well Republicans talking about it means that they're they're racist and seen a ... you know it just means we believe in the rule of law\nAnd we're not going to wait the four weeks till\nYou know seven fourteen thousand people make it here\nSo I think that's playing a part I think all the incidence of the mob on the Democratic party side we have some real bullets used over the weekend shooting up\nA Republican headquarters in Florida um we saw the terrible shooting in the Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend you have a Florida Man arrested for threatening to kill a Republican congressmen have an angry leftist mob disrupting Marsha Blackburn campaign rally would Lindsey Graham um we've seen two Republicans punched\nIn Minnesota uh there's a lot of anger and a lot of violence out there on the left\nYou see Republicans being run out of restaurants\nUh Pam Bondi run out of a movie theater secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell Kevin McCarthy's office it with a Boulder busting his office window so there's a lot of left wing violence out there and it's a pretty dangerous time\nYeah and I think anytime you're dealing with uh this kind of pervasive dark the most important thing that you can do is light a candle and I think what people have got to do is they've got to resist that hate with a love for their country\nA love for their fellow man and hope for a better future for all of our citizens staying positive stay prayer fall and work hard you know I when I was coming up Sean and me in the eighties I had a friend of mine who was running for Congress had a sign in the campaign headquarters I never forgot\nIt said work like it all depends on you and pray like it all depends on God that's not a bad way to live then it's not a bad way to live

been out there or what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border or a significant display of solidarity for our sauce\nTwenty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that let people got to the border knock down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do it the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nYou know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed the the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nHonduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries\nAre from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having been a pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column yet but what if my read of it is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question but on the mark I mean there's actually there's actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this are folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of\nOf the president ... uh basically tried to overthrow the constitution and making ... president for life there and that with the Venezuelan and the lay out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet that our world and organizing that are posted videos and pictures from the marks\nSo again no great great mystery this is\nThe work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment look bad and our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people that the and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or is he in a phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws\nAre constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check you out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with us with a necessity does not seem to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws humble and according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply to walk across the border I have always wondered by the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border\nWhy is it that only people who can walk here should be allowed to getting the status if that's the principal\nWell what I'm I'm married and lives I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and if people rush across our border be it at a port of entry or along the border that is not fence and that our military is on the border\nThe military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nUh coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with the sun shine we don't want to hurt and also it is undoubtedly true but most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff probably been lied to get them I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nOn so they are being caught in the in the middle of this I'm simply used hub of really as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built\nUm I I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall and fencing and I can look across the fence and on the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty I saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding what looked like what we would describe as a junk yard even\nAnd then on the other side of the fence or you know million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there as things looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people\nBut we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nThere without question of what you just described is most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who control the ... that we are supposed to allow three to four billion people move here\nBecause that is what you were actually talking about if you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion and we obviously cannot do that we have to maintain control of horrible\nAll right we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank you

conservatism\nOur taxes your borders\nI'm already know Simon I approve this message\nGlad you're with us twenty five now till the top of the hour\nA there are about thirty races now we have identified actually if you look at real clear politics they have they have narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point is actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey ... they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words if we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when you want to go for the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think will have pick ups\nAnd the whole Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians to send them out can be beaten as well how she was up at three in the latest poll is beyond any imagination I have\nA poll has a dead heat exactly even tie forty six all Nelson versus Rick Scott who's been a phenomenal governor for the great state of Florida\nRhonda Santas is coming back interesting John James Michigan is cut his the leaders stabbing now in half\nAnd it's only a six point race in Michigan where it was one twenty and so he's doing very well a lot of eyes are paying attention to the latest poll of West Virginia where mentioned is down by two\nIn New Jersey Menendez is only up by three and seeing is very weak and could be the big surprise of the night\nBoth West Virginia and New Jersey to states to watch for potential surprise is not likely but potential uh one of the house races that are on our top thirty is Marty a no Stein is a gold medalist currently serves as the chairman of the board of commissioners for Lehigh County Pennsylvania you're running for\nCongress there in the Pennsylvania seventh district to fill Charlie dense empty seat\nAnd a big Trump supporter but it it's a tight race where you are you're one of the thirty that will tip the balance of power how's it going there\nAnd I'll say this shot first of all thank you for having me on the show you know out campaigning hard every single day eating every corner of this district\nAnd I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue to me are simple what we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it\nOpen borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all and make it sound wonderful just like you know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight\nWe've got Brett ascent in Tennessee we've got Claire McCaskill we got Heidi Heitkamp\nWill unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns saying that they purposely running as moderates but they plan to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing in the case of Tennessee got reticent staff calling the people Tennessee ignorant so is your opponent out there saying what they're really going to run on what they believe in\nGod I absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day are Democrats think everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely out of touch they can't see past are angry at least Sean and let's not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixty and what the media had two snares out there\nOne of the best the best case of Hillary won in the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors have come out contrast that to two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten can midterms think about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change give the crumbs back\nIncrease to regulate watched jobs go back overseas see now that's that's a difference my opponent goes to talk about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some people in November six", "year":
