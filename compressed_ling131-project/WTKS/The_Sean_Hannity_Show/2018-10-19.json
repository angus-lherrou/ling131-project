come up on me and when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a ... so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate look like they're going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nNow West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nWas really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people in New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with the chili and I've seen guy\nUh that has now become an absolute verbal war between ... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up in the polls\nAre dug shown where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell hey where America's fans and John and you are right on fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think that New Jersey will go all the way because it is a\nOperationally democratic state but the other states you cite Sean I think are moving in what I think are the wrong direction I still have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those have deteriorated above it from my perspective and the last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look I yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a\nNationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh uh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen so if you can get\nThe sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did\nAnd it appears to have backfired particular Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThe Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that that and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular a\nFoil let me tell you what I'm saying I'm ready on TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and there were four hundred and thirty five\nCongressional districts in this country in any of those districts\nIf you vote for any Democrat you're voting for a pillow see if you stay home it's half of ... and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for tester and McCaskill and send them on against Dean Heller and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know breath and it was just a phony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape being it uh and\nAnd not put more Marsha Blackburn in you know you'll get the government you deserve it but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're gonna they're gonna tow the line with below sea in the house into the line with Schumer in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually paying that they're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it any more John Podesta Center for American Progress and saying all Democrats should not talk about immigration for for this one open borders sanctuary cities\nSanctuary states that elimination of ice and they want to keep Obamacare that's not that that didn't work for eight years dug and\nWhy why do we we're told me a bit of a leading Indiana is say keep ice you say go to wall and he's saying oh impeachment which\nWhen he was the only reason he surviving and not down by five or six now is because you got a libertarian in that race that is polling at nine percent you take a libertarian out Donnelly is history in Indiana\nWell I wouldn't be so sure on but he is running where Democrats need to be in the center and if we were a centrist party rather than a leftist party with new leadership from top to bottom I think we could go in a lot better I think you'd probably agree with that Sean\nHow is it possible the Democrats hold on to below sea and Schumer how was it ... it is a phenomenon to me ...\nAll one word answer on that one is money raising enough money yeah ... that's what it's all about ... and and and he's absolutely\nRight for showing that when we asked in September and a national poll that there were ... when we ask voters if the Democrats took over Congress do you want and she pulls you speaker didn't only twenty three percent of all voters said yes fifty six percent said now\nBut then when we asked them about the fact that you know if you know the chapter that these candidates are accepting millions of dollars to raise them for their campaigns from Nancy Pelosi or a woman\nTo do the things we need to do and one of the things we do get Congress to rule the way our\nSecretary of state my palm pale Mexico is appealing to the UN to help\nThat's that's asylum seekers and make a million jackpot is
