that\nIf they don't ask let them think that that's what the rule is now for the Democratic party even the center for American Progress sending out don't talk about immigration Maxine Waters admitting that she's being told don't talk about impeachment gesture shop about it we we know we know we're going to do but we're not going to\nWhen I can help people the truth before an election that's Claire McCaskill and and people on her staff people just can't know that she wants a semi automatic rifle ban and that\nThat of course you would vote yes on gun bans of course she supports the semi automatic rifle ban\nYou know she's quiet on guns because she has a bunch of Republican voters but secretly shoes as she supports say hey gun control group you know what our staffers saying well we'll wait till after the election to bring up Trump impeachment to voters get over it we can't do it now we got a line now\nWith you know three weeks Twenty one days collection they why would we ever tell people the truth people just can't know McCaskill\nAn Obama essentially the same views on everything wow now the people in Missouri I Hope you're paying close attention but it's bigger than that a project Vera tosses got this undercover video they got the undercover video the week before about former governor of Tennessee Bredesen Marsha Blackburn is now up by fourteen points\nBecause on that tape it's the same line he'll he'll do the right thing when he gets there of course we don't agree with everything Trump says no not at all do what ... what we're saying we vote for cabinet of course he wouldn't vote for Kavanaugh\nI mean this is all part of a light campaign propaganda campaign and it's all about power\nAnd it's being exposed at a very high level I mean this is really you know seeing people how they really are is should be so enlightening to the people a tendency in Missouri a James O'Keefe is with us She's the founder of project Vera toss\nExposing these senators I you know I watch this and I'm just like what a bunch of liars that's all I think when I see those great job\nYeah Sean this is a pattern you know we release the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate rather than you know responded by from Lincoln and bumbling his words caught red handed these are all the staff or Sean inside Claire McCaskill's office they're all saying essentially the same thing when it comes to Obama\nGun control impeachment they're all saying that we have to do one thing before the election and do another thing afterwards some of that audio is a little hard to hear but\nOne of those powerful pieces which when the sky Glenn Winfrey wanna McCaskill staffers explains to our journalist when we asked so what do we tell the moderates ... after we did the impeachment because we're going to happen mislead them\nAnd the guy goes will tell them get over it\nAnd that's the that's the ... it's that this is the other guy next arose field organizer tells us he says a quote people just can't know unquote than the cast on Obama had the same views no I confronted neck on the street yesterday with a microphone ethnic why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this is true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee is true in North Dakota\nOh how are these red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected it it's a necessary condition so all we're doing is exposed\nAnd you don't want you know what I disagree with that point they don't have the lie they have to lie if they want to win and ... it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of decency honor honesty\nAnd embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you know I think everybody on this showing on TV\nIf you look the houses and play the senators and play if you vote for any Democrat in the house you're voting for polo see\nIt'd be a boat for Claire McCaskill or British in or a high camp or cinema or Donnelly or Bill Nelson you're voting for Schumer because that's who's going to own them in control them that's what they're going to vote to be their leader\nWell you know and and Sean and some of these states like Missouri in particular the pro life Democrats and pro gun Democrats used to be a thing decades ago misery with the stalwart when it came to those things but that's a shrinking\nGroup of people and and people like Claire McCaskill half they in order to when they have to or they think they have to mislead\nAnd again this is a Greek chorus of staffer the staffers are not necessarily villainous I suppose there is honest because they're going along with it but just telling the truth so it's very very interesting to see British and after we played those tapes on your radio last week British and talk to local media this is kind of the Senate candidate he told all the local media stations\nWell al these ... these young guys were caught and kind of misled staffers who while they don't work for me when in fact they did he apologized so it's going to be\nVery uh by the way that was a lie to the first thing he said well they're they're just college kids no they weren't they actually work for him\nAnd the guy I Apologize this guy brown who is the Democratic spokesperson for the British in campaign he actually apologize to the media can you believe that Sean apologized\nFor misleading people without our videos so it's very interesting to see how McCaskill's going to respond now this guy Josh Hawley the Senate candidate that's running against a McCaskill has responded he's tweeted out this video um he's jumping all over it so the question is the really interesting thing is because\nWe're going to get him on the program and later this week I mean we're basically following the work you're doing you know the one of the question is going to ask but go ahead finish your thought\nWell I was going to say that McCaskill has in the video it's he says of course I'd vote on a ban some type of gun ban we asked her staff or what type of banning that he'd sit semi automatic rifles now this is an issue that nobody wants to talk about Missouri particularly Claire McCaskill so\nWe're hoping that she gives a clear unequivocal answer about what her positions are on the gun issue and that's going to be very interesting if we can somehow get her to speak on the record publicly about this now that we've caught her red handed well\nI again I think that you're rocking the world the big state Senate candidates\nAnd exposing them for who they really are look I've been saying in explaining for a long time now what the agenda is what they want endless investigations although they'll stop the investigations that help them the ... they'll they'll protect their deep state buddies\nThat conspired

his problem is simple math\nAnd sort of like New York city although it's happened in New York City is even happened in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman um and and then all the other occasions Tom Kaine is another example where Republicans were elected after Democrats make a mess\nI guarantee you that Cox could wind now that the sanctuary state of California wants to put up a sign

that people can use\nAnd you also see it Christian cinema is imploding out in Arizona\nProject very tossed with the tape that they release the Claire McCaskill is devastating that she's hiding what she's running on to that same happened a governor governor Bredesen and Tennessee have Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble\nAre we now see Heller was very important state of Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest polls\nAnd we said I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and and the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response and that's to hurricanes and I remember that that have hit there in the last year where we're Scott has really shown if you remember Shawn the two thousand twelve election\nRight here in Jersey uh that's where Hurricane Sandy hit and then President Obama had the advantage of acting like a commander in chief and going\nTo the devastation while Mitt Romney has basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama because member Romney at all the momentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager\nA for Mr Obama at that time and he said yesterday I said why did Senator Warren have to do her announcement with her DNA now he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think this Elizabeth Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right\nI'll give you literally the the headlines\nAround her and she's Ninety six percent European I mean at at that one one thousand twenty fourth she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type\nI mean but it is it but her she literally personally change herself who minority status when you ban and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority\nFemale professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nDry and that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then we're going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or does it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday Associated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage\nA CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relief reveals proof\nOf Native American ancestry again what\nProof at this so backfired on her ... nation got involved and and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies and twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty four just written and that's it because now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where\nYou can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah very interesting to see who the Democrats settle on right away and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party is taking over and that's not the way you be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and it was a girl born by none other than John Podesta but\nThey're running their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five so they're hiding their agenda we learn that in this project ... with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks pack up punch says the four page memorandum I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times or obtained a copy of it and Democrats in strategies to prepare the memos said\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo a more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very typical to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their part Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they're governed\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be I mean all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses\nOn the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP above four percent unemployment below four percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that ... that was reported by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible\nWe have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missiles over Japan threatening Guam and the United states these are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the pillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments\nTrump is winning right now he won with capital as well even that CNN did a\nSegment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member that ...\nWas the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into the selection because to your point\nThey have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think that I Can't remember what\nHis platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive hey that's easy to remember and it's a it was good enough right who was it will make\nAmerica great again or keep America great again the Trump could run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have\nA it it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump's in trouble like you did in two thousand sixteen but again a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate that can have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nNot sure if the poll is accurate but it has him down and that surprises me but I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball\nI always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day in Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona I see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at the other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help the feed her or if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be Joe mansion in the Senate yeah\nAnd and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state taxes red state Tennessee read stand\nBy the way up I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with them this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember ... better or got more money than any cat on my God they're eight million dollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think we'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because Republicans and Eighteen but yeah that would've been a very big symbolic victory of ... somehow could've unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so the Senate you gotta think they're probably going to pick up three or four seats\nAnd now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how Democrats don't win twenty three seats to win back the house and given the history Eighteen or the last twenty mid terms I have got against the party in power by an average that something like thirty three seats bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nSo I was thinking you know I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up at fifty fifty that Republicans keep the house and if that happens\nAfter all this negative press that President Trump is receive the Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nAnd that is something bay county officials want to discourage the
