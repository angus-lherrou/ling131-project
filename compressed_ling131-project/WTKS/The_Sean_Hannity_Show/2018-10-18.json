I don't mean any of it\nMy job is to bamboozled the people of Missouri lie to them they can go to Washington and I'm going to govern just like Iraq Obama\nThey can't win it they define who they really are\nThey can't win if they give us their true agenda they can't win if they say yeah we really want to impeach Trump impeach forty five and Pete forty five impeached forty five are claiming my timer claiming my time they tell Maxine Waters don't say\nWell I I don't want to talk about\nIt just don't say it they tell her and she says they told me not to say it but I'm going to keep saying in any way\nSo their agenda is impeachment and lists never ending investigations\nOpen borders eliminate ice sanctuary cities now we have a sanctuary state California\nThey want oh why did they want to open borders they calculated that's gonna benefit them at the ballot box helping them retain power notice every decision and every agenda item is about them wanting to hold on to power period\nIt doesn't matter the output uh the the what the end result is doesn't matter Obama wrecked the economy I won't give you the statistics again if you listen to this program regularly I Know you can recite them by rote as well\nThe only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can't say they didn't know\nBut that's what they want to take us back to that but they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven by a borderline psychotic hatred of this president\nThey want to go back to what back to Obamacare they want open borders so that they think that their their party will remain in power forever if they get enough people crossing the border caravans of people\nAre going to talk about what the president's planning and it's like that's what they stand for\nThis is what the Democratic Party take back the crumbs he pulled by my care open borders impeach Trump endless investigation what name one thing they're that they're doing to make your life better\nBut goes

the Senate dining rooms their house dining rooms or they treat themselves well they're not they're not on Obamacare they got to separate house system just for them very different\nSo that's what's at stake you know I'm going to tell you something about this border as I watch this care of it you\nGot to understand this is the about national security this is personal security\nI think I'm the only person in the media that actually took the time over the years and I've been down reporting from the border Thirteen times science Hannity you've told us that before\nYeah I bet on horseback yeah Ben and helicopters yeah been out on boats yeah I've been on foot yeah I've been all terrain vehicles I've been on the border all the way from the Rio Grande straight on through San Diego in many stops in between\nI've seen gang members arrested drug warehouse the biggest warehouse I've ever seen in my life\nFloor to ceiling drugs confiscated guess where they were headed to Yorktown your city to your kids that they ingest them and now it's worse than ever\nBecause now a lot of the heroin that we have we have an opioid crisis in this country is is one the one issue is oh kids go into grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet they try a bike and then a Percocet and knocks econ and then\nThey go back they got another one next thing you know they're addicted next thing you know they're buying them on the streets God Knows what those pills really aren't the drug dealers don't give a rip that these kids die\nThen when they find out that can't afford eighty bucks the pill well then some genius idiot friend or deal or friend quote of there's this is why you try heroin does much better high and the only ten dollars a bag\nAnd they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon as they call it and they light up in smoke it and then eventually they're going to remain lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave\nAnd a life of a living hell\nAnd that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the border where it's human trafficking happening right over the border what's happening all across the border there's a new thing it's called fat and all\nYou know talk to my buddy Eric Bowley his Nineteen year old son bought on than that\nWhich is you know to relieve anxiety\nAnd and and it was laced if you have three grains of fat and all the size of three grain of salt\nIt will kill you and we have nearly a hundred thousand kids dying every single day one death every seven point five minutes\nYou know almost a hundred thousand deaths a year and we keep talking about opioid crisis left and right opioid we can stop it if we secure the border\nCaravans now so I think it's right I think Kavanaugh what do we see

almost on a weekend basis they wind up in the hall first they spike the punch bowl and after they fight the punch bowl the boys would line up in the hall every weekend and then they rape the girls in the room they take turns and it happened almost every weekend\nAnd then the story evolved into well I didn't see him spike the punch bowl but I saw a mirror punch bowl and I see I saw him give out a red solo cup\nThat's what that became\nSo and then Dianne Feinstein wants to bring that up again after eight FBI investigations\nWhat\nAre they offering for you because since Trump spent president you got for a million new jobs since Trump's been president four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs jobs that Obama said would never coming back\nSince he's been president we've gotten rid of more regulations than the last five presidents a combined\nUh he's opened up the entire energy industry of which we have a flawed\nLiterally of natural resources those are going to be career paying jobs high paying jobs for so many millions of Americans\nAre then we've got oh the president the grading ISIS nobody thought little rocket man would stop shooting is rockets nobody thought that you know

the criminal elements and drugs pouring in as far more important to me is president then trade\nAnd the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their

reduce the risk of another heart attack or stroke if you've already had one but new research finds it does not reduce the risk of a first heart attack or stroke\nIn fact there's a chance of bleeding because aspirin is a blood thinner\nEarlier studies suggested that smokers and others who have some risk of heart disease would benefit from daily low dose aspirin but one of the new studies which was co sponsored by bear found increased risk of mild bleeding ingestion and reflects researchers also look for evidence that aspirin reduces the risk of cancer and diabetes\nThey found no evidence that

them we don't want to know where the un now where any point anytime I mean is that the New America because I didn't I don't remember that\nWell that certainly the America will desperate left because they're losing the more they lose the more desperate they get and it's good I think it will get worse before it gets better because I think we're going to keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new electric violence a which in the end I think\nTurns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because ... proved when he was shot um you know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is it's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watch the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of videotapes\nAbout running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves with the conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taking over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg and that is a I ... everything he is doing in terms of governance\nIs conservative even even threaten trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as a pension his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think look I I think he is the four\nO cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments uh and that that's just a huge advantage and they're all grows out of what is now\nIf you go back to Goldwater of fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulated each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and in the end I think are just further isolates come\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they won in ... they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration they want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an

describing what he understood some place in that meeting between Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosenstein where Mr Rosenstein talked about actually recording the president of the United states so he needs to come in and answer questions and like I said if it's because the ... that's exactly what should be a shoo\nSo you you were in a deposition with with James Baker the first one and you're going to aim

possible punishment for Saudi Arabia and the suspected killing of a journalist to constantly in Turkey boxes Jared ... live at the White House\nJust like the same information was used to obtain the price of warrants against Carter Page you can't make any of this up for people now saying Rod Rosenstein yeah he wanted to wear a wire on the president I'm James Baker is back on the hill today remember he was one of the four people\nThat was very clear about Rod Rosenstein and we're still awaiting the de classification of let's see three oh twos gang of eight information Pfizer warrants\nA

Weissmann yeah that Andrew Weissmann they went after Paul Manafort that Andrew Weissmann that of course was responsible for tens of thousands of Americans losing their jobs as it relates to Anderson accounting\nWhen you go back years in the Enron investigation\nThe same guy that was overturned nine zero in the U.S Supreme Court\nThe same guy the center for Merrill executives to jail for a year and that got turned over by the Fifth Circuit court of appeals it sounds complicated it really isn't it is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in the history of the country and I haven't even mentioned\nThe abuse of the powerful tools of intelligence that we give these people supposedly\nTo protect us I joining us now a civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney David shown and Carter Page was banned at the center of all of this for the last year and a quarter I Know that you're moving forward with investigations lawsuits and I don't blame you one bit I mean\nFrom everything you've told me is that our FBI our CIA our intelligence community knew well because as your work took you to foreign lands when you come back from places like Russia or you would willingly fit the deep briefed at and and tell them everything you know to help your country out so\nUh I guess if you were really the bad guy that needed to be surveilled than\nThey needed to Hillary Clinton's unverified phony Russian ... to do it\nAs the presentation to commit fraud on the rise of course I Would think you'd be indicted right now you were as bad as they say\nShot it just it just kept getting crazier and crazier every day I uh I think it just uh just this week we have the Saudis that are um owning up to various things that may have happened there and you know starting investigation\nAbout things that may have happened a couple of days or or he was\nWithin the last few weeks I mean this is something that is you know people have been covering up here in the United states for over two years so I think as a a you know a symbol of democracy a symbol of\nGood government and hopefully uh hopefully the uh the cards are starting to fall here and people will start phoning up to all the uh all the wrong doing that was done and I I think we're getting into that as you've been a\nA all over in terms of your reporting so\nBring David and David as an attorney in a in a really good attorney you know Congress has a constitutional roads called oversight their job they or their check we have a system of separation of powers and checks and balances part of their oversight is when they are investigating the investigators\nThey have been obstructed every step of the way\nRequest document requests we have found instance after instance where they fight national security is a reason for not turning something over only to be turning out to be having nothing to do with national security only an embarrassment to them now we see in in just the last two weeks\nOh Rod Rosenstein who gives an extensive interview to the wall Street Journal here's enough time to testify under oath\nGlenn Simpson has pleading the fifth Nelly or doesn't want to appear and testify

states or if you are representing our friend Carter Page here I mean I Would think you'd have a multitude of lawsuits and the Carter page ought to be a pretty rich man by the end of all of us\nYeah quarter page has a strong basis for sticking not only information but also damages and relief and he is now by the way a course\nConducting some litigation going after that doesn't Carter Page is very important to St example of how very wrong things have gone with the ... the court and otherwise and government you hit the probably the most important thing going on here\nCongress's role in providing oversight um you know God willing congressman Munoz is going to return after this election\nHis work and ... as the vital Congress can no longer bluff though anymore they've got to compel the testimony of these folks\nI think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver from the public statements that these folks make the American public demands transparency and they deserve nothing less than transparency and by the way these aren't simple in the states that have gone on you know we've talked about this ... page report\nOn Pfizer court a abuses that a ... director Rogers was talking about um these aren't just mistakes these are conscious efforts an agenda by law enforcement officers to invade the law\nThere is by the way one author or as a new that no one really has exploited yet\nAnd that's a fight a quarter of review\nThere is a court that just above the five to ...\nIt will also under their rule for consider procedural motions there three judges to chief justice appointed right now that that just cabana sent telling talent in different circuits maybe maybe that court should be the subject of the uh the ... the foreign promotion to review what's going on in the ... the court also just remembering you have in the ... the court efforts\nBy the ... where are these buys a court judges\nA fraud was committed on every one of them they were that run verified uncorroborated information to spy on the guy you're also talking to on this on this wind quarter page why haven't we heard from them yet\nYou're right they should do outreach collie or the judge and the fifth corps and these judges other quarter review it violates their own rules rules Thirteen and\nIt violates the constitution and as you pointed out many times the most sensitive area of our government probably because it's an ex part they application for the most intrusive kind of eavesdropping that there is in the world\nYou know you know there was an article by John Solomon I Want to just read a little bit of it to both of you and carnival salt would do to get your reaction considering you\nAs of now you appear to be the victim and all of this unless something changes ...
