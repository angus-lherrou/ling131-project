A.\nAnd then when they can't be Trump even by disseminating those lies to you we the people well then they go the next step their insurance policy which is even though Lisa Page said there was no evidence of Trump Russia collusion and struck said that\nThere is no there there well then they start immediately strategy leaking again the same Clinton Russian dot CA and that becomes the basis of the appointment of Robert Mueller\nAnd then we go off investigating people's loans happily applications good grief\nIt just as pathetic but they only cared about Trump Russia collusion media ignored that\nThen the media when it comes to judge Kavanaugh and the new Kavanaugh standard which is guilt by accusation all that to only is applied towards Republicans\nBecause I haven't heard Camilla Harris Spartacus or Dickey Durban or you know a Senator Feinstein or any of them ever demand an investigation and FBI investigation into Keith Ellison\nThat's fairly recent and we're real evidence real text messages a real tape real doctors' reports none of them have said we need an FBI investigation into him thank goodness the people of Minnesota are paying attention because that matters\nYou know again it's it's it's there's just hypocrites they only care about Republican Russia collusion that doesn't exist not Hillary collusion they only care about stopping Kavanaugh but not stopping\nYou know Allison are not stopping the recent allegations based on the cabinet standard we'd be calling for FBI investigations into Corey Spartacus Booker\nOr Bill Clinton himself up we're going to go back forty years\nAnd the rape allegation with Juanita Broderick it others\nAnd then we take it a step further you know they only care they don't care about violence the threatening

All right if\nWe're all along Sean Hannity show eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program this is really have to be the week that the New York times has five novelists imagining Trump's next chapter\nAnd one of the novels actually goes into oh let's see murder and the other one goes into a fake Russia again\nYou know the Russian waited until they were a few steps passed any drew the gun he slighted on the center of the president's back and squeeze the trigger\nBut it missed fired the secret service agent at the president's shoulder heard the clinics bonnet or crowd she registered the scene instantly drawing his own weapon with razor edge reflexes\nThe Russian taster taser failure closed his eyes waited to pay the cost the opened his eyes the secret service agents it'd be for him presenting his clock but first hear the agent said politely use\nMine really that's what they want to in these times that's the New York times what they are putting out there\nOr Andrew Cuomo was forced to retract that claim that he was targeted by a pipe bomb that didn't happen but it doesn't surprise me that you've got multiple reports you know of course we had fake news you know some of these people do need lawsuits\nAnd there is there is a line that it is being cross here\nThat deserves a real court challenge as it relates to slander\nAs it relates to smearing people's characters you know but yet the NBC reporter suggesting the purple person responsible for the mail bomb scare a you know you know when Robert de probably reads the conservative news website the Drudge Report\nIt's outrageous that's on fake news MSNBC again a segment with this guy highlighting the image of the device sent to a John Brennan nobody wants this to happen\nI didn't like it when I've had threats really serious ones in in my life and career to my family or powder scent to where I work and said that it's one that it's a poisonous material\nYou know and it just goes on from there you know well\nYou know these guys on TALK radio they've been very critical meanwhile they're the same people that have ... the last four weeks and big nor the mob never\nEnding of salt

[noise]\n\nNews I'm Kathleen Maloney the president is ready to take action as a caravan make its way through Mexico headed for the U.S\nCalling the caravan of Central American migrants a national emergency the president tweeted this morning he'll bring out in the military this topic and Fox News's learns that hundreds of us troops will be headed to the southern border\nSauces Rachel Sutherland bud defense secretary Mattis still must sign off on that plan to send troops the FBI investigating three more suspicious packages similar to those recovered earlier this week\nIn New York City this morning at the finish a package and got the actor Robert De Niro that was found in the mail room of his production company and two more package as I got the foreign vice president Joe Biden\nFox's Catherine Harris both of those packages were sent to locations in Delaware none reached the former vice president who no longer has Secret Service protection\nFox News [noise]\nHe was radio Ninety seven point seven and twelve Ninety am telling you the chaos\nYou'll hear why everyone really things in DC is is the Sean Hannity show [noise]\nI twenty five 'til the top of the hour let's tune in James O'Neill is the New York police department commissioner giving an update on the bomb investigation here's what he's saying\nHe's suspicious package investigations are conducting here in New York City\nFirst and foremost my message today is that New Yorkers are safe\nThere are no current credible threats twenty individuals organizations or locations here in New York City\nNew Yorkers are safe but everyone all eight point six million residents and the millions of visitors who come here every year should always remain vigilant\nAnd aware of their surroundings as always I urge people to alert us to anything that might seem strange route a place or anything that makes them feel uncomfortable that conflict got a cop call nine one one or call our toll free kind of terrorism number which is one eight eight eight New York city safe\nAnd that's where anything new or someone as information about any of the instruments this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make towards our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday as I Do anytime we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature or any other kind that nothing we do in law enforcement we'd do alone\nFor a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision that can say with certainty that we will identifying arrest a person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\n[noise] New York city's intelligence and counterterrorism kind of terrorism capabilities are second it on every day they are not just this week or detectives and analysts are constantly poring over the threat stream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're seeing that today too out of an abundance of caution hotel you that when we look at the events of yesterday and today I have a match pride incredible work the men and women are the NYPD to each and every day especially when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today\nAll concluded by reminding everyone that law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about is keeping the public research safe that's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe\nAnd through the fall and willing partnership of everyone who lives and works in and visit New York city who make the safest large city in the United states even safer Mr Mayor or\nAnything of any substance comes out the only thing they have said is the bombs had a powder meaning some type of explosive powder and\nGlass or which would mean the maximum amount of damage and shrapnel that ... that should they have gone off none of them have gone off usually in the mail bomb like that you would think if somebody opens it that's when they're going to realize that\nThat's the moment usually would detonate a thank God none of that has happened thank God\nI'm all packages or were lifted apparently Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the return address thankfully none exploded no one was injured and\nThis full scale federal local investigation as to hunt down wherever those maniac is that would be responsible for such things you know it is um I don't care who it is you know there is no place in this society for this type of violence\nThese types of threats this intimidation it should have no place in politics or country\nYou know this is evil ... we're talking about and I wanted act of terrorism here\nIt's ah having lived through some of this myself I Know how horrible it is my thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that is involved in this it's just wrong I Want these guys put in jail for as long as possible\nAnd it shouldn't they should not have to be said no conservative I Know what ever\nSupport this horrible act or this type of violence for depravity as the president condemn the yesterday\nUm nobody knows who's responsible yet everyone's rushing to judgment like they usually do when they can politicized something you know is this has now been unfolding you you watch people assigning blame\nOr to all political rivals especially President Trump and they go to Fox News then talk radio and it goes on from there\nMeanwhile we have heard the plate some of it in the last hour play some of it later in the program today the most incendiary over the top out of control statements that have now been going on for weeks and weeks\nAll the success of the west Virginia ... saving coal jobs and energy jobs and all the prosperity is because of Trump's policies and mansion didn't even support the tax cuts and frankly my guess is the capital vote was just an election year conversion they'll go right back to supporting Chuck Schumer\nAnd Missouri you've got the Daily Caller reporting that Josh Hawley who's running against Claire McCaskill sharing a photo of a yard sign that have been vandalized with a swastika and his name on the sign is this what it's really come down to we asked\nYou now the Missouri attorney general Claire McCaskill also caught on tape saying oh just like Obama I'm just I'm just saying these things to get elected um she didn't care about raining in or or representing the people of Missouri\nAnd now you've got another Daily Caller report\nTalks about non exploding bombs turned up yesterday and today the New York times has no reason at seemingly to apologize but the Trump assassination fantasy that they published\nThe day before the pipe bomb was discovered the first one times publishing ... short story about assassinating president Donald Trump on Tuesday one day before potential\nExplosive devices showed up at the addresses of all these political figures New York times are asking novelist to conjure up possible outcomes to Robert Mueller's investigation\nThey don't care you know the only care about Russia collusion as long as it's a Republican only care about sexual misconduct or assault if it's a Republican they ignore Ellison Spartacus Clinton\nThey only care about incendiary language when they think it comes from a conservative not their own\nBy the way Charles Grassley is issued a criminal referrals for ... and Julie sweat neck remember she was the woman that made the accusation\nOh that almost on a weekend basis they would they would spike the punch bowl and boys would line up in the halls and they would then take their turns gang raping young teenage girls\nAnyway Grassley announced he's referring Julie sweat neck and I've been out into the Justice Department for potential criminal investigation into the potential they made false statements to Congress\nAbout time somebody follows up Chelsea Clinton saying she might run for office if someone retires she probably went in New York\nAnd then we've got I think one of the scariest ... votes in power and elections going on this one in Florida\nIt's getting a little scary I'm not sure if people are fully understanding just how radical this uh Andrew Gillum is that scandal is widening according to the or a lobbyist paid for luxury getaways throw him yet that just look at his policies that's what's dangerous to the state of Florida\nIs policies will destroy the economy of

being here you know Bernie ...\n... you know I listen to Hillary yesterday compared to what you said a week ago I listen to you know Andrew Cuomo worst governor of New York history say conservatives he they're not New Yorkers they don't belong here I had every other governor in the country inviting me to move there which would be the smartest thing I could do because I wouldn't pay as much in taxes\nAnd and now yes they say no e pluribus owned them and I'm like just so full of crap\nThey listen to what I saw yesterday you know them trying to put the blame on the president's than making these changes are as you know Sean was much I walked off the CNN uh they they stuck\nBranded in the middle of broadcast they said that he was going to talk about the device that was ... which I thought was a good idea the general public some insight as to profiling packaging whatever the case may be um and then he got on for a ten minute blast of the president\nI just think it's bizarre I think it's way over the top I think\nThey're going to get what happened in Bernie you I mean you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining and detailed and you left in they'd send cameras following you for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the ... we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then they interrupted instead that ran it was going to speak about the specific device being sent that was set to CNN and his name\nUm but then he got on and he went on this ten minute tirade against the president\nYou know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involving the deep state\nAnd he went on a

year conversion he votes for Kavanaugh which was a good vote with the right thing to do um but with that had um now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nOr joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback\nI'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and I think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda\nAnd mansions or dishonest Washington liberal the more and more people drilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good and we're going to win an election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business and it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's but energy is the life a lot of our economy and\nOnce Donald Trump got elected which by the way would've never happened to Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are\nAnd I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policy that West Virginians really appreciate it so that's one of the president's comment very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWith ratio we really have you covered here are more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender

one Sean is our number Paul is in Ohio Paul you're on the Sean Hannity show glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you a good good I at first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are and uh\nUh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare a I Know other stories or you know kind of taking the lead\nNow but we really don't hear a whole bunch about a repeal and replace much anymore it was just wondering if you could give us an update about what Republicans are doing\nIf we in two weeks to have a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and\nWest Virginia being and plays huge if we can hold on to the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races than the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to have and by the way pre existing conditions the big lie that's being told all over the country or the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions nobody's going to be denied coverage because they have a pre existing condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about I've been able to get Dr Josh amber atlas MD in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita he's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month unlimited ...\nThere is care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals\nOr even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks or treatment for people and you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge care you ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor\nOr your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you get great reduction and pharmaceuticals\nAnd if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario and it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there on the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states of innovation\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute\nBut does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again every single house race matters\nSome more important than others we put up the most important on my website Hannity dot com\nAnd the top races that are going to tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every ... we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida we're a little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Centers for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose to Josh Hawley a Dean Heller needs to hang on in Nevada\nUh we definitely need more than ... Sally war hero against this radical Christ in ... now no problems with Americans joining\n... and and joining the Taliban then of course we've got Montana tests or has a lead at this point but that's still in play a Heidi Heitkamp is down by double digits\nA and Joe Donnelly is case he should be removed\nAnd we've got a good candidate brought against him but people can't waste their vote on the libertarian candidate in Indiana or else that's going to be a problem Bob Menendez can be beaten in New Jersey he's only up three\nBob Menendez could be the big surprise or the night second big surprise of the night is Joe Manchin losing in West Virginia you know this state uh most worried about to be very honest as Florida\nBecause this guy Gillum is a radical socialist leftist if elected governor is going to ruin this great state [noise]\nAnd you want to see all the prosperity and all the money that has been flowing into Florida\nStart dissipating almost immediately and you're going to businesses packing up and leaving in anticipation of what Gillum would do to the state not a good idea I we got to take a break we'll come back eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone

a decision about a Supreme Court justice for political reasons that was it\nAgain I'm looking I'm surveying the country right now this is how I see the Democratic party they\nThey only want to talk about Russia collusion if it's Donald Trump they don't care at all that Hillary we now know bought and paid for Russian wise to disseminate to the American people before the election that those lives where the the bulk of information to secure\nPfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate they lied and committed fraud before the court and then they used to set up a special counsel by leaking that information they're leak media elite strategy but does that apparently was their\nTheir insurance policy when people like Peter Struck a saying that Hillary should win a hundred million is zero\nAnd I'm Wondering why don't they care about Hillary's Russian allies why do they not care about Keith Ellison\nCharges against him nobody is asking for FBI investigation into him and in that case we have tape syntax and doctors' reports or the recent charges against Spartacus Cory Booker\nUm and it's the same on every other issue you know all the you know we have all these Democrats talking violently about the president Republicans on these mobs in ... most of the Democrats have been silent\nWell you're right they only go it things which a double standard and it doesn't matter what the issue is whether it's something legislative late that we're working on or something that is political and Sean what they want to do is say\nOur our outcome our ends justifies the means that we're using to go about this to get to where we want to go and that is not the way Tennessee him wanting to see ... what to\nSay fairness and trees and respect for others and respect for differing opinions and as long as she respect for the rule of law and abiding by the constitution and what we have\nWith fisheries just sit face and focus Democrat Party is oh well that ends will justify whatever means sit where we're using and people are appalled at how they are conducting themselves\nI saw the British ... first reaction to the tape of ah his staff calling people of the people of Tennessee ignorant and by the way Tennessee happens to be one of my favorite states Nashville like right at the top three cities in the country and I\nWell that's because they all get they love you in Nashville, Tennessee you\nWell I mean I live ... miles south of Nashville are just off a sixty drive and I used to go up to Nashville all the time I ... I Love music city and I love the people of Nashville and I've got to imagine they were pretty insulted\nA and a little bit shocked that somebody would be that duplicitous behind the scenes and then when he he said well those are just college kids volunteers and we find out no that's his full time staff\nAre I'm sure that he was embarrassed again\nI'm certain that they should have been embarrassed whether or not but of course he didn't they start saying\nWell it ... it was our campaign my campaign that put somebody in there which is not this was a project their a toss project they started saying well all these other excuses but the ... they got caught they got caught\nSaying we made this decision because we want to go to people about where he is don't worry he got to be a good get crap when he gets there\nBut we got to say this that and the other in order to get him there and it's\nLike as a parent I mean when when your kids do something wrong my kids do something wrong\nWhich rarely happens ah kidding but you know what it's not I'm I'm never as bad as what they did but if they try to lie to me about it then they're in big trouble not a little trouble I don't care what it is\nI can deal with a mistake I Can't deal with you lying to me in looking in my eyes and just outright lying to me and my lines of my kids is\nYou know I I Am not stupid stop treating me
