your job is to be a left wing partisan\nHack\nI'm Glad you're resisting that Alexandra Alice tundra Sondra bocce as a journalist my jobs to be skeptical\nTerrorist attacks are committed during times of desperation not victory\nPeople who've won against Obama and the Clintons in sorrow says no reason to attack them now when they have all but become irrelevant\nExactly my point I have to just a moment ago who on our side to worry about the Clintons\nWere laughing at him\nA nationwide stadium tour with Bill and Hillary have the ... eruption section where those ... get\nComp and\nObama folks Obama I'm Tate he can't draw crowds he's out there trying to claim credit for this economy wouldn't he wouldn't know how to create in fact the Democrats are the people that have people on their side that love bombs\nBill ... is\nOne of Obama's buddies and in fact but I'm not saying there is any connection do not misunderstand me\nBut uh other Sondra bocce is\nRight on the money here Here's Mark

in my head and I'll get to the point two seconds\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and\nAnd you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan the deep state and this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nWill tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on and tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ...\nUm there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight with signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and you know what you're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kind of thing right\nYeah it was a point it was a plant in it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy in\nSeparate it was already plans to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good piece and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush she taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences and there are no\nAh are you there is nothing that set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made off\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami for someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking\nHer time walking down the stairs or somebody who's open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like can conspiracy theorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense and I don't trust the Democrats never have you never let a good conspiracy theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no no you're you're ... you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them as soon as I say this is a philosophy that I have a stove for four years on this program asking people to\nNever forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say that these are all deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth\nUm if it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to it other than they're trying to get themselves on the radar but\nSee that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately need to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory trying to show everybody thinks he can still move the needle\nIn working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirts I used to the rush to excellent store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth and I would tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton a week before\nAnd that it was the strangest strangest thing and we ended up in an elevator together and just

Murray\nOn the radio Ninety seven point seven at twelve Ninety am chaos [noise]\nHey folks really appreciate your being here with us today if I Do every day [noise] back more than you can possibly know and\nYou have a great weekend be calm everything's call me back here on Monday wrapped in reading\nType dumb as only we can be doing as only we can [noise] and of course who is this week talking what am I saying [noise]\nThat when you think Kay s\nAnd high hard with your station now Fox News radio covers the world on news radio seven\nThe ring the dream a wholesome as you can get\nSo there's [laughter] except for the TV so you haven't got a TV show no you do [laughter] around we'll put you on to a a one way David Limbaugh's\nHere with us You're gonna love this past her\nYou know I Will say this pastor because you've been very good to me and you even said to me he prayed for me\nAnd I I I Am I'm very touch when people say that to me and I know you mean you're a good guy\nAnd and David has written these books she started with persecution his first book on faith and religion and um I think now the best book yet it's called Jesus has risen poll in the early church\nAnd David is that a pretty profound impact on me making me realize I'm not that religious and then I I Believe everything oh I'm I I Would be one of those people that sort of shows up at Christmas and Easter at your church\nUh and I don't go to church that much but uh but I Believe all of a ... and ah and both of you have encouraged me to to want to be better does that make sense\nIt makes a lot of sense to you know are often times phases contagious and faith and one can rub off on another phase breed and\nSo you guys getting in my grilled Telhami Hannity you know you need to shape up the ship out [laughter] or Hannity you're going straight to hell live I can read your mind knew I Would never saw the way David ...\nBook is now a two weeks and running on the New York times best seller list welcome to you too David said a pastor Scott and Kareem\nThank you hey how're you guys thanks for having me on what ... let's start with this mob everywhere we said we're not going to kick our ... I Would I ran into\nUm what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings is coming out of where I was going in and I said senator Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation\nIf he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over though I might just because I disagreed vehemently with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out of the ... ballot box I have\nHave a fear and when I say fear with him regarding myself that one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response will go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself how would I have always said you know it's just an old man of the why that's why I say I'm a fair I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for all Amy the old me would come out if I'm with my wife told me it would come out and then it will go by what my response would go viral but I think they pick and choose the targets that's exactly\nWell may be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this well it does it it's not going to top crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk like\nI Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or outright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nSo there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past not then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and past and what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of an Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on parallel economic success\nFourteen state record states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that there's a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regard list but others say listen I'm tired of this\nBecause all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am the lady so do you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior of the president during the campaign but you say that I have it to another level and you'll you'll propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a at African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama said we're never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus by night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent of that fifty six six six percent believe me his message is rent cream tell him as a message that lives within the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really go\nFor it would do it with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly bright and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN non blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the block\nThat said that the rates might be going down the government protect the costs of Medicare plants will decrease this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best right help markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide to help folks maximize their benefits and say\nHoney what is it people need to keep in mind enrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go it alone get unbiased help to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with lower copayments more choices like dental\nAnd vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now our health markets Medicare assistance as

and I approve this message\nGeorge Scott in ... calls for the government takeover of healthcare experts say their plan will result in long wait to see a doctor or care was seniors Medicare and risk [noise] George Scott is also joined ... calling for bringing back the dreaded\nOnly liberals like George Scott and below sea to propose a health care plan this in your ear as more\nScott Perry and I approve this message George is going to close or you're going for government run socialist healthcare just like him and the u._k. you meet someone who lived in the\nLast time I had ... for a rainy bingo landscape just blew my mind getting very terrible you know when you want to be a number of you need ... years you're waiting on a single how can people are dying\nFrom those are just liberal

they burn\nFor disabled them and their families\nLeft Washington bring their promises\nScott Perry and I approve this message\nRight congressman Scott Perry he is up for re election this is a really important if you want to look at the balance of power in Congress or in sixteen days this is it Fifteen days till election day\nOr a newly redistricted congressional district can in the state of Pennsylvania and on November the sixty three term incumbent isn't a fight to keep that dream alive is going head to head with a liberal Democrat\nGeorge Scott for this newly drawn district and\nPerry won the last three terms in Congress by no fewer than twenty five percentage points but now because of uh Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision\nThey decided read do you draw that state's congressional map as a district that has a chance of flipping and as Perry has said he knows the people the fourth district I grew up with them so when the district was we redrawing it was heartbreaking\nAnd that's the hand you're dealt and ah anyway a congressman Scott Perry is with us She's also a Freedom Caucus member and I wanted to give you an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting then they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have out this week that they want it to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it or to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you've kind of highlighted some of the things that are doing of course the big thing they're doing which they're not just doing it to me you\nKnow in talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever ah it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it\nAnd that's this this whole thing about preexisting conditions and healthcare a show on you know they're the ones that screwed up our health care system and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a\nTwenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan to keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right\nAnd now they're blaming us for mess it up um we tried to repeal it of course you know what happened with John McCain put wet thumbs down but you know Sean where we fought the original Freedom Caucus in particular fought that original a bill out\nOf a you know the ... the replacement for Obamacare because if you remember we're going to vote to repeal Obamacare and immediately repay replace it the original bill that deal with preexisting conditions among other things\nThe Mark Meadows Jim Jordan the whole crew\nYou know what and talk to the president talked or leadership it said you know we can't support this you can't have insurance companies denying people with preexisting conditions that we we got that right in the buildup we finally passed yet they're running this play book all across the country because they don't have anything else that we broke healthcare\nWell let's all hardly they tried to fix it\nWell millions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie is will Republicans didn't support preexisting conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific battle\nAnd in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill\nThat was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate is gone I mean ... ... all all Obamacare was was one huge redistribution scheme where are you going to have the young and healthy literally buying plans that they don't need or want be enforced by law to

not serious about combating illegal immigration hundreds hundreds of thousands of families\nWill be ripped apart if you don't think it's illegal you're not going to say I think it is illegal and wrong and the ... of American businesses will lose hardworking employees\nAnd the argument them as the president is Americans do want to do the work wage jobs can buy American workers to do the work was the

at the end of the day we'll find out where the money comes from that supporting some of those uh I understand you know America can't continue to support and prop up as the president has been saying\nAll of these countries that were given a lot of aid to and they're going to let people leave their country and come racing towards our border I'm all for immigration but it's got to be done

phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal but she's not going to tell you that until after the election\nAnyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you [laughter]\nHey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and\nHer Washington DC campaign office uh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she is going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they can basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people at Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for the state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where where they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same using everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nAnd we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those a bottle of like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well\nBecause the presses here and and we take it down and when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying so it's more it's basically the same thing and each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to want to moderate voters in play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be so liberal once you get selected that staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this is what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nMean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that ... that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really left or right thing\nI was at this first them and conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were ... you know very cheering and and nearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to them out or if they have to work with the moderates and that and they can only make one choice one\nFor this is not a choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody in his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone none it it it it her way back to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated is like someone\nTelling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's\nIt's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in\nMissouri they're east Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something Sean if it's wrong for me\nTo go Under Cover and record these folks then how wrong is that for them to mislead the voters if it's ... it's not fraud for me to record people\nBut it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such an awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that and asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station in Missouri every single one has covered these videos and I think the same things that are happening North Dakota this week you\n... everything from crypto currency is or how they work out a buys him and want to
