Fox News President Trump hosting a campaign rally in El ... for incumbent Republican senator Dean Heller\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe at talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is unreal legal jeopardy in all of this you also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThat was a great piece by Jonathan Turley the three reasons Mahler may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker now saying the FBI failed to provide a federal surveillance court with important\nEvidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that for Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through Perkins Coolio law from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton they paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so\nJason Chaffetz is with us former congressman now on Fox News contributor author of New York times best seller the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of diGenova and Toensing with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house\nAnd it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request\nAs they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to on for that is for the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the deejay won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also familiarize themselves with is marked Elias market why it was ... he was counsel for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name\nAlong with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up\nAnd do it in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth and it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope they send you were talking to your former friends and telling them to get them to uh get in to the Congress to take this ad and I don't care if they're not ...\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it\nYou've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh mind he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene and he said peanuts and then you say you can't make it went state and you make it they say\nThat I Can't believe there's no ... well\nI mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information that three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on of course it gets so subpoenas but let me just say this because this is really important\nOften means that you heard Michael ... is that Mr liar Simpson\nOr all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in United Kingdom between the Congress has an important issue a subpoena score we now know that the FBI or am I fix\nAnd that you see a cue to conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so\nAnd that information was in fact conversations of George Papadopoulos\nWere intercepted and in the course of intercepting those compensation they found out that off the top of it was not interested in Hillary's emails or anything else and they never gave information to the by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testifying that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there is no there there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed it this way Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid dossier that dossier information is leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaky so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be ... begin I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right\nThe people that were in that meeting and reverse the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being most candid about what was going on there but each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribed under oath\nBefore Congress you don't have these five minute little you know after you have questions\nWhen you do this and I've been in these they go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans if you can really get in depth information if they would do it that way\nWell Victoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just not fair but\nThe obstruction continually I Will take a break we'll come back more with Jason Chaffetz and Joe diGenova also Victoria Toensing with us\nI Want to remind you our friends at my pillow they have done it

an American citizen but he he wrote for the Washington Post for many years\nSaudi council and it can be heard on the tape saying during the show these tortured do this outside you're going to get me in trouble\nOr in another tape and unknown person again I Can't corroborate doesn't only telling you what the New York post\nAnd the British newspapers are reporting on one Turkish newspaper if you want to live when you come to Saudi Arabia beat quiet\nAnyway return to Riyadh on Tuesday ahead of a plant search of his residence part of the official Turkish probe and took a showcase disappearance that is the the Saudi council he's back in Saudi Arabia\nMiddle East English language website holding a Turkish sources saying that there were no attempt to interrogate could show ... but that us Saudi hit team came to kill him\nSource told the site that his death took seven minutes runs a physician doctor Sala Muhammad al ... listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe could show that he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denies it says these claims are baseless this report comes as my palm pale met Wednesday\nAfter being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president air do on and the Turkish foreign minister\nAfter ... rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation\nMight bump pay on Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh said he didn't want to talk about any of the facts a day after the president said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants all the facts\nTop us deployment diplomat Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged pit team were found to a close ties to the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nSolomon according to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... was murdered by Saudi operatives of except the president say they didn't get any tape but this time\nThey have a pro government newspaper reporting that show the apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing\nWell I Would assume that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but before leaving reality Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that had to back up and down the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that show that you could have broadcast signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection you know I think what's happening\nAnd clearly as the Turks and the Saudi constantly had the Saudi counseling wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later\nJoining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka former White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan hop but Fox News contributor thirty or CIA up operations officer\nA doctor Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis assassinating murdering this guy in a A R Paraguay that's what I'm thinking\nYou know there's a ruined in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questioned\nUh I think this man is dead\nWhether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between\nTwo nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world that's the new often I'm an avid won regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't an American so well that trying to spin it was a foreign national read them and it was a common type ... you wrote commentary\nAnd he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood that is also related to the biggest Arab um see a lot of the twentieth century ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have you back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil rooted brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nYeah I I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen ...\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived at the cost of the day that Chris Yogi entered\nAnd we know he just show gay never exited the consulate a week do the makeup of those of the safety and Saudis for them apparently part of ... one of them

and who gave them the orders and then to hope that they report posts for them those are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think was a hundred percent right to dispatch secretary state they gather the fact emphasize that they were a shoe of greatest concern to us\nWe'll get the facts with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters\nI Will remind the listeners that when they're getting power was poisoned back in March British home secretary rod said that we needed to avoid speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here in the last thing I Would just highlight is that well\nThere were three farms hey was needing and doing it is public diplomacy I'm quite sure that the FBI legal at Shea in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or an ... an uncle or probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it to be a part of reviewing a shot\nYou know it's I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying it I'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but\nKnowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because fall so the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had you had money in the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world\nUm I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this with that\nUm I think this will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nBut it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat a Nazi ism in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean you you don't make the perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics is like politics itself domestically it is the author of the possible ... all over the perfect\nOn on the truth is short we have a lot of a matter of rich or with Saudi Arabia or at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very good ties through a and B ... bombers been found them in a ...

right Mr mall when [laughter]\nHere's Sean Hannity\nAnd there was a twenty fourteen study scientific study and they said that average European American walking around his point one eight percent Native American she's half\nSo the idea that she continues to double down on the fly is the most disgusting thing to me is the fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put this to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it is backfiring on her and I'm Glad to see it because she was she needs to do is come out and apologized to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president I'm not running for president I Am not running for president of the United states are you going to run that I Know I'm not running and I'm not going to run\n\nI'm Geoff Diehl running to be your fulltime US Senator you don't need a part time author part time senator and part time presidential candidate I'm going to put Massachusetts first\nI'm Jeff deal the guy who stopped automatic gas tax hikes and now I'm not just not partisan gridlock in Washington that's why I'm running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren tame Elizabeth Warren they call Elise officers racist from front to back\nMe I call them heroes men and women with their lives on the line every day\nMy campaign isn't about party politics about getting the job done [noise] Massachusetts\nI approve this message or that is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now to the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\n... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren well she does have to get re elected a senator she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look here's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is negative\nCan we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she listed herself as a Native American and the directory of the association of American law schools he identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low ...\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a just this week well it turns out he is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career her political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this they and tries to prove\nTo her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nNow the question is I I Know that Massachusetts land solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but you really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nGeoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld than Mitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that are the people of Massachusetts can wake up are you doing\nToday showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm and you know Scott Brown won when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the model for the un Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston determines association has never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush um\nWhen Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist front at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nI'm In no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever\nOn this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Savannah", "day": "20"}
