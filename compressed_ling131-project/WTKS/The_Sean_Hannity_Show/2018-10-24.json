if these mobs don't stop what they're doing\nNow and the moms in the case as I was talking about you know let's through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages pipe bombs\nThat had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program there was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive but putting his mailbox and I listen what am I say about George Soros yesterday\nLike they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the store story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros his home in his mailbox the New York times reported\nBillionaire left is called the list of George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away\nI Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop\nThis is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days\nAnd on almost ... you can see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of the senators is done to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the hose you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces fitting it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue because it's obvious but what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she asked to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video up Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob and\nThen of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife id they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out and write and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bang on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then starts screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets hit with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their\nLeftist activists they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out Lindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out\nThese incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second you know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that is or racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national\nList and his policies of the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they weren't just just proportionally impacted by the horrific\nPolicies are bronco bombing sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where\nPeople are dying now you have a few famous people that have had these suspicious packages that had been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I had been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt\nI don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in a caravan hurt\nIt ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe\nBomb suspicious packages sent to the Clintons home and ... similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters\n... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros is home in Westchester New York suspicious package center Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office they're investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face holder kick them they go low we pick up\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant in department stores in gas stations and you tell them they are not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watching it happened to all these Republicans as any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are um you know let me be very clear I Know I Know firsthand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today I've had similar incidences of security\nIn my life you know Linda you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl at work for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation because we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore my life\nUh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today but\nI Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people\nForeigners alarms that but it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media is gone wall to wall with report suspicious packages and\nKnow that were sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder is another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nYou know look at it it's not about the coverage because you know but look we just had three weeks ago three weeks ago we had rice and sent to Trump mad as re Haspel\nI don't remember any coverage now in the case of any of this there were lunatics I Want to prove that we get back that I've been consistent I'm also going to prove what you're hearing today from liberal politicians about civility is they're

just like reticent in Tennessee just like Claire McCaskill in Missouri now we got Heidi Heitkamp acting one way before an election and trying to bamboozled the people in the states\nI'm you know it's a one of the things that I Am I I'm not surprised that but it 'cause it's all too predictable and that is this rush to judgment now that we have\nThe the what looks like suspicious packages some powder maybe pipe bombs all of this was going to be vetted out in the days to come the president has reacted very strongly today let off an opioid bill signing a van at the White House\nAnd he was with the vice president he retweeted the vice president's comments on the emergency and condemning the bomb like incidents and online statements as\nMedia outlets left wing politicians you know around the country we've got to protect our politicians they getting suspicious packages in the mail um\nWe know that it does happen to Donald Trump's family we know recently happened to done junior and his family we know that it has happened just rice and letters were sent to Trump and Madison ray and Haspel just three weeks ago and I frankly don't really remember any of the coverage in that particular case\nUm there is an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIs Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere\nOr it could very well be in and obviously the temperatures been hot\nAs we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day and not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen stopped confronting people like Pam Bondi\nStop confronting Henry Kissinger stop throwing boulders through the office of Kevin McCarthy maybe even watching this on a regular basis\nYou know it's a very scary thing for anybody to have to live through\nUm what's amazing again is to watch the professionalism of our law enforcement\nI mean I've known people on the bomb squad and on the NYPD they have their absolute finest in the country as they did their work today and and we've had no incident so far at all we don't know if they were alive we'll get updates from sure throughout the day\nNow the president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act so strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first lady said as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest an absolute priority\nSaid the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act the justice we will spare no resources or expense in this effort\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the u._s._a.\nAnd he concluded by touting his statement condemning they agree just threats et cetera et cetera and and mores coming but\nThat's not what you got the media writer almost instantaneously almost instantaneously some NBC News reporter named Ben Collins Soros Obama and the Clintons have been viewed as the root of all evil on TALK radio and\nFox News for over a decade when he just said Fox News and talk radio did it I mean this this rush the job we don't know who did it\nWe have no nobody has a clue who did this\nWhat I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative or Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with\nYou know I just very different tone isn't it tell you a little story so I had this and and\nWindow lived through this and when the you know we're still very great friends with the lease who worked for me for a long time and she went on to bigger and better things will really proud of her and happy for her and she was a friend of our program\nWe just saw her in Washington when we were last there right yep we just dollar um it was like nine hours when we had what we thought was potentially anthrax into my office of\nFox right uh yeah it was it was actually a little bit more between how long they held her over\nAnd the sad thing is and she was in isolation she was alone we couldn't talk to her even though it was just horrible for her\nAnd she was cordoned off we went to the hospital they wouldn't let us and we couldn't see her because they didn't know if it was anthrax right than what was that if it was ...\nI mean as with all my heart I Can't stand CNN is reporting I think it's fake news but I I feel sorry for the people over CNN Today I've lived through this\nAnd I and Linda on a scale of one to ten the anthrax incident being one how many tens of we had in the course of my career that you know about\nI mean you know we got ten death threats today via letter\nYeah but I mean and it's just a horrible thing there was one particular person at another network I won't say who\nWas going through a very bad time and going through a lot of threats I picked up the phone don't agree with this person at all and I explained everything that I've been through and tried to give my best advice\nI mean this person was upset had to leave their house they had young kids this person you know how to family and you know it's it's hard\nIt's unfortunately part of the environment we live in and that's why I don't understand why there's been so much silence about chasing people at restaurants\nAnd attacking people in restaurants you know somebody bangs on your table in a restaurant that's an assault that guy should have been arrested\nOr shows up at your house or spit on you or threaten view or follow you\nI have had all the above\nAnd it is very very very difficult and how many times if I said keep Obama said when he was president we got to keep our for our politicians have whoever did this is not a conservative in the sense that maybe they think they are but they're not anybody I Want anything to do with her any conservative once anything to do it\nBut this rush to judgment we don't know one thing yet who's responsible by immediate the trying to exploit it for political gain when it is a serious significant threat ever say well the president says fake news\nAre they are fake news you know truth is ... words are very different than actions\nJust like Bernie Sanders says incendiary things to that ... that was incendiary to me I just but you know he's not responsible because not that supports him\nSo unbelievable they apocryphal see how many of you know\nHow many of reported that three weeks ago rice and letters were sent to the president\nAnd secretary of defense Mattis indoor\nFBI Director right and to our CIA director Gina Haspel\nAnybody even hear about that I didn't hear a lot of concern from people on the left when Don junior when he had gone through that and by the way that's nothing compared to the threats people getting these this is happening every day this is a very very dangerous political

everybody I mean no one is set devices a note on one with a straight face acceptable in polite conversation incentive\nVices violence on public officials and anyone who does um is a moron and Savage I think there's a period full stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing Sean you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber he was a little more tactically of strategically devious he would send those bombs\nAnd there'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually develop\nA new kind of a you know let's say ways to put those in construct those bombs together was very difficult with this\nThey're basically you know ... ... nations whoever this was you may have done this\nSo it's going to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices\nAny clues but there's a part of me that believes Sean that this person or persons um wanted to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish on I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices\nSent to CNN was addressed that John Brennan\nWho does it work at the end I mean it's hard to figure out you just go to the Internet and you could figure out the John Brennan and that you know and it'd be the comet he's not a CNN country of this is just basic stuff I mean think about it if you were ... enough of the Savage in an animal to want to hurt someone or hurt someone in the mail processing facility\nYou think you do like basic homework like that so it's very amateurish the construction of it um from my experience and this is amateurish as well and\nYou know I agree with the a former commissioner that's I I think it'll be a matter of a few days before someone or a group of people are caught I Hope they are but\nEverybody hopes they are um and you know usually these things come\nIn rapid succession a commissioner and I would expect that that might be the case here although it seems to slow down so down at least for today\nWell listen you started on Monday was Soros right when you add a number of these things come in today we'll see what happens to borrow a like I said we're also going to hear a lot of false alarms in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks in New York City\nWhen you got ... which just in New York city there were hundreds and hundreds of false waters of the next two weeks\nSo we'll hear about that but um you know I I agree with that I think within a couple of days um\nTrump can jamming suspicious packages and explosive devices into high level Democrats activists and CNN contributor in New York one of the

government is not serious about combating illegal immigration hundreds hundreds of thousands of families\nWill be ripped apart if you don't think it's illegal you're not going to say I think it is illegal and wrong and the ... of American businesses will lose hardworking employees\nAnd the argument them is the president is Americans don't want to do the work wait just can't find American workers to do the work is the president that is a crop in many instances it's just not true\nIn my view from a citizen and the DACA program was some eight hundred thousand\nYoung people in the curler and most ugly presidential I in the modern just three of this country I cannot think of one thing though which is ugly and more cruel\nIt's amazing by the way to hear this tape the leaders of the

meanwhile you have this kind of protest a politics of the left\nThat they're just perfectly fine with that they don't they don't care about stability they don't you know if anything it's a sign that that we are winning the argument on the right when they've got nothing to do other than harassed or public servant\nBut I I I feel for the people I I really do because I Know you've covered these cases as attorney general and in last word to Sean Spicer I Lived through this myself I Know how tough this can be on on these people and their families it's horrible and the president said he will spare no resources to find the people responsible\nBut I Try I mean you've been covering extensively for a long time now that that that the right has been targeted and I think it's appalling what any

just add there's something or yeah or like making people go she doesn't support the wall and the other day I don't know but ah so don't say that she doesn't\nWant them to kind of people don't really understand this is my head and he lived there while I\nWas right on the wall or what do I want\nThe world for all\nNo she didn't vote against the wall\n\nYou\n\n\n[noise] you know or how do you weigh in\nOn them\n\nAnd then they'll be able to watch them\nWhen they do they want to be like you know\nThe amazing this is now number three British send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal but she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you\nA showing great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is that consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people at Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for the state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn an Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nWe and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those uh Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here\nAnd and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff is saying so it's more it's basically the same thing and each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they've toward a moderate voters and play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it and we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's got to be somewhat liberal once you get selected staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse over and says in this video quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties told or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that ... that's what we do it very tossed we confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity does it it's not really a left or right thing I was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and and\nHearing it may I suggest have integrity\nThis is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to work with the moderates and that and they can only make one choice\nOne for this is not a choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general
