I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive the nuts\nI mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just order this guy and I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most hating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them is the United states senator\nHad been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage I mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri they're they're they're the local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journalists do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like a Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about her somebody's position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much have shown for good reason\nWell I'd listen I when you expose fraud what this is now what's supposed as something that I've been pointing out for a while\nWe're Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and Everytime they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five then we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat\nRunning for office don't talk about immigration we know we\nKnow we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about the ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is polite to hide who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now uh this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding\nHiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us to take the money ... indirect means in order to I guess appeal to moderate to the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats were shrinking constituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out but the ... still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it has a truism\nThat in order to get elected in a state of Missouri are kind of see you basically have to mislead voters elected a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we the American people had it when the Democratic party a band in any sense of due process under\nThe law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute Kavanaugh was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then when all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so called corroborating stories fell apart\nThey still didn't care and I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you got these anarchists middle class of managers attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nNamed his state representative Sarah Anderson punch by an anarchist after trying to stop him\nFrom kicking her campaigns on\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it\nAnd yeah you're going to be hated but\nI think shining a light on truth I thought this was the stuff that sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable I Know you play a little bit on your show last night and she said\nNow that I quoted she says well it started with Josh Hawley arrested her opponent would be part of fraudulently embedding someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny that\nHe does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away from candidates I investigate candidates but she is one on TV Sean Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud\nWill will buy what recording the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own words there are it's

Warren will she does have to get re elected a senator she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is\nNative American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she lifted herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage she was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a just this week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty four\nNative American let me interpret it another way that is less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career her political career\nFor personal gain claims are family was discriminated against as a result of all this they and tries to prove\nTo her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nAre the question is I I Know that Massachusetts slant solidly\nLeft I Know it's a solidly blue state but the really ... somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that uh the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nA shrine great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm Scott Brown won when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the model for the on Affordable Care act so uh it can definitely when it's not tell you something the Boston determines association has never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist French at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House when you're twenty\nI'm no folks uh Massachusetts whatsoever on this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time it's", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Savannah", "day": "17"}
