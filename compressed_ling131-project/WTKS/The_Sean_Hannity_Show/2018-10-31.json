them\nFrom collectively losing their minds ramping up this hatred and rhetoric blaming Trump\nFor the Senate GOP shooting but yet the guy involved in the shooting hate the president in large part because he is so closely aligned with our closest ally Israel\nTerror threats in this country is white men most of it I'm radicalized brought up to the right and we have to start doing something about\nIf you stop say mean things about me I'll stop and signing angry lunatics and kill you you know whether\nThe president knew what he was saying the alleged gunman certainly heard something that resonated what\nTrump is doing is stoking and fighting for the purposes of political power the worst amongst us to take action in his name anybody who sits there and says that there is not causality between these events\nAny insight Lynch is dishonest as they are blind\nI don't think you have to be a rocket scientist to rule the lines between these people and the rhetoric that as being ... by the president of the United states for the reasons\nFor any time I think that he's perfectly tolerant of racial violence in just a matter of following\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates Trump all the evidence is there why he hated Trump hated him because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promised to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv\nTo Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel spanking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look\nIt would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve skull east on the ball field and and shot up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong\nTo blame Bernie Sanders\nBernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not isn't it's intellectually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rational they would ever give it if it's a conservative\nJust the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it's it is it is what it is the biggest donors to the Democratic caused this election season is the media\nIs universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs\nYou know the whole lie about Russia collusion it's just what I've been saying they don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid for ... full of Russian lies used to disseminate propaganda and influence the American people in the lead up to twenty sixteen it was it was used to get fired warrants\nUnverified uncorroborated Russian lies that even the own\nEven the author of the\nOf the ... even stand by let me tell you something let's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them were moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAnd the president went against it in many ways what is a new alliance forming that could be maybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east ones overall because of\nThe threat of Iranian had Gemini and the region now caused an alliance that was unthinkable maybe just the number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians\nThe Saudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean if there was an emerging alliance here because of Donald Trump in large part\nAnd what he's done but I Will tell you you know let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable that this guy has evolved into\nWhat I think is just he's he's lost any sense of reality all of these people in the media they don't even see what blind hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up\nTheir rhetoric that they fame moral outrage about but they are guilty of he's been he's been playing the race\nOf course I he said I'm a nationalist David Duke comes out the next day say thank you thank you so much for finally admitting that year old white castle list and then you have a we even some Republican back ventures are that\nAre are leaking George Soros in these anti Semitic threats\nTo the caravan Fox News talking about small pox and leprosy coming up it is I I'm Sorry I I won't say specifically ... regime this is out of but go back and read your history books and look at some of the most important regimes in the twentieth century\nMight as well be certain countries talking about gypsy ... lines up historically exactly with what certain countries we're talking about when they were talking about gypsies and Jews [noise]\n\nYou know I mean I don't even know what to say anymore you know Don Lemon last night or the night before whenever I think it was last night listen to what he says\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and not leaving I think biggest terror threat\nIn this country is white men most of them radicalized brought up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them there's no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy band so what do we do about that\nI just I don't even know what to say you know and then their morning host suggesting the Trump and the synagogue shooter using the same language\nTerm messaging we'll start with the president so he seems to be hearing in\nOn the two pillars of the media\nContinuing hit the trail attack against and migrants continuing to ratchet up the language about them just and and frankly I mean I have to thank you things on the same language that the mass murder at the synagogue used in terms of the theaters and\nInvasion these tragedies working at cross purposes right narrative so it's hard for him to celebrate his narrative of vilified gang migrants when again the alleged mass murderer did the same thing\nAnd I don't I don't even know where to go with this you know joyous\nBay heart not even on her show the view but on conspiracy TV MSNBC\nYou've also times going along with them as as his own all even\nJust like I I've I like the guy in a way it was like oh you're in New York character he got Republican or Democrat he's just an advocate and as far as I'm ... [noise] and I don't mean that an ad hominem wet [laughter]\nNah not at all let me tell you what it means they are afraid they eat a ... look there are three scenarios as I said for election night\nWill be examining the results one week from today on this radio program and there is an unknown factor here anyone that tells you they know what's gonna happen doesn't\nThere is there's not one outcome to be very Frank with you that would surprise me one week from today when we gather here to talk about the results but I Do know this\nI Do see the er at a level that is unprecedented they never saw Trump coming they never understood that the election day twenty sixteen they were in a state of\nShock and it was not only shock it was obvious sadness depression you know CNN white flash it'll against the country et cetera\nYeah that that's not it is they end up back at their head really fear you the American people\nAnd what you're going to decide every race matters is four hundred and thirty five house races your vote for any Democrat or you stay home you're voting for ... as the next speaker all these important Senate races Florida Tennessee Texas Ted Cruz\nClaire McCaskill I'm Josh Hawley Missouri Nevada or Arizona Montana North Dakota Indiana New Jersey West Virginia\nThey're afraid of what the results are going to be I'm not afraid of any result we I can deal with whatever hand the American people people deal last\nOne eight hundred five on oh twenty eight hundred where does it come to redirect dot com that's Coventry direct dot com [noise] one eight hundred five on oh twenty eight hundred coming to redirect redefining insurance company directors marketing companies were from qualified policies\nFX [noise]\n\nI just get a little crazy a Claire McCaskill those I'm enjoying um well first of all she's fighting fellow Democrats so she's calling in ads crazy in the Democrats are mad about that and I'll get to that in a second but now with a poll numbers tagging going into the last week of the campaign now Claire McCaskill is getting more desperate\nNow she's begging Missouri voters to believe her when she says\nI support President Trump a hundred percent on securing the border\nWell that's odd because I don't think I've ever heard Claire McCaskill ever chant or talk about building that wall even once\nBut anyway she told the fake news CNN that she supports the president a hundred percent to do what it takes to secure the border quote the impression he's given Missourians there's ... ... I had a cousin from Missouri Missouri what are some people say Missouri others say Missouri Laura\nI well you don't count because you have a language all of your own which is called them as Lauren which is called Philly street talk you know with the added flavor of do you are welcome 'em I support the president in a hundred percent\nOh that desperation that's really desperation I'm I'm I Can't wait to see what the what you might say tomorrow the president's right on everything I just happened to vote the wrong way every single time for the last two years\nOr we have some new polls out of Florida finding the Senate and governor's races they are statistically tied\nA Florida is the one state I'm worried about in terms of both the Senate and\nI don't understand this obsession with Gillum by the way he stuck taxpayers apparently with travel causes a fund raising about he was getting a lot of money from a we oh that's right we have breaking news on Gillum tonight don't we owe\nUndercover tape ...

say with if you look real clear politics too old for locked in seemingly leaning likely Democrat on the house side and a hundred and Ninety nine locked in Republican side you have all these thirty some odd races that are now going to tip the balance of power for the house\nConventional wisdom says that Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker I don't look at the polls quite the same way Nancy Pelosi picking out the drapes\nA for her new office was on the Late Show with Stephen called bear predicting Democrats would win big in the midterms let me say this up until today\nI Would have set up the election were held today we will win now I'm saying is we will win we will win we will when she added oh they're a bit freaked out by ... competence please don't say that\nDo you want to say that that on Hillary's a firework fireworks barge that she cancelled\nLater perform the sign of the cross on his chest and they feel like I should sacrifice a goat or something to take the heck's off of what you just said well below sea still adamant Democrats will carry the house we have a bigger victory the set at the governorships got to be a great night for America\nOkay well she can predict all she wants but that would be in the hands of the\nAmerican people were highlighting these races up on Hannity dot com that will tip the balance of power in the house of representatives all of the Senate races\nAre very very close looking much better on the Senate side for Republicans forty five retirements is a lot that means a lot of new faces Southern California later on we'll check in with a congresswoman Mimi waters of California's forty fifth\nCongressional district now they've got literally between Dana Rohrabacher in and these ... old seat you know former New York city mayor\nMayor Bloomberg just spent what nine million dollars in southern\nCalifornia alone also have a tough battle going on in Washington state in the eighth district Dino Rossi will step in and check in with us a little bit later a in Iowa's third district we gotta fight going on there a lot of outside\nMoney coming in as well against David Young and he joins us now apparently and I love these people in the Democratic side they're all saying the same thing healthcare healthcare all the way welcome to the program David Young appreciate your being with us but\nThey have people that gave us that they give us Obamacare\nHe'd be a doctor keep your plan and save money\nWell that proved not to be true right and so they want to double down on health care Medicare for all sounds great but what does that do with the the deficit and debt and rationing health care it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep\nThe prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa shots\nAnd correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages from Nancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's acted to cut that\nAnd then lying about their ... they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we had those protections for layers of it in our Republican health care bill\nYeah a lot of pent listen lying is just a part of it the playbook that the Democrats is always the same I even think it's gotten worse and I look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting that took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and\nWhat does the media but out they're blaming Donald Trump for it and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his strong support\nAnd I'd venture a guess that Ninety nine point eight percent of the people in that caravan want a better life and that they've been told that they're going to be able to get into America that's not going to happen the president's been very clear\nUm the left this meteor pushing a narrative that the thousands of migrants\nFrom Central America and elsewhere are fleeing violence in their homeland but in an interview with National Public radio on Monday the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some of the people some probably a tiny tiny percentage they make lip point two percent\nOr you know last source our quarter reporting that she identified MS Thirteen members because of their tattoos\nThat would give that'd be a give away um but actually the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some I'm sure a tiny percentage is very violent now nobody can vouch for any one person that wants to cross the border\nWe're asking the people come here legally if we had a border wall we wouldn't have a risk of thousands of people at once coming across the border the president has sent fifty two hundred troops down there\nAnd he's not going to let them in North Canton he but does there'll be thousands and thousands behind them we don't have room to take it everybody we have a right as a country we have sovereignty or nation built on a on a constitutional\nRepublic system the rule of law\nAnd we have border laws and we asked the people respect our borders and our sovereignty and just come in legally and we have an opportunity to vet them and make sure that they are coming for the right reasons they can sustain themselves and they don't want to bring harm to our citizens that are already here\nI'm nearly according to one border officials telling the Washington Examiner three quarters of the caravan\nA that is traveling through Mexico to the u._s. or adult man according to a senior border patrol officer telling the examiner\nFamilies and unaccompanied children make up about twenty percent twenty to thirty percent of the caravan\nRoy of dollar rail is the deputy chief patrol agent for the border patrol San Diego sector arrested that a single adult males he goes on to say uh Mexico now were shut down a lot of their public transportation so the people in the caravan went up to walk which you know literally weeks away\nAnd they've also offered temporary work permits to the migrants to register for asylum\nWhich I think it was a very you know Mexico's been far tougher on the illegal immigrants that we ever dreamed of big\nUm it's just sad that so many you know one of the things that America when the president talks about America First we've got to get every American out of poverty first reality ... every American their own opportunity by the way all this at stake six days from now\nWe've got to take care of our American family first and that only enriches us to help others as well and we're the most generous country on earth as I said so many times has been no country on the face of this earth that has accumulated more power\nAnd abused it last and used it more for the advancement of human kind around the world paying the price for

was over one of the things stay home and then they feel about run out one voted\nYou have to have ended up not having voted by election day you're not doing anything else that day to vote if she got serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics and they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are\nSafe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or work with the Republicans have in the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again is a pretty frightening thought um where do you see the house going\nWhy not functionally ah I I my personal range is between the bottom of about ... ... which would mean policy where speaker and hiring them around to be Twenty one or two thirty which would mean with Kevin McCarthy I think would end up with speaking [noise] um\nAnd I can't him in all honesty you know I've always been candid about fishing I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nI Can't either when I really can't I mean and I think now and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that they can see below sea what when the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is you know some House Republicans have\nAnd the rest of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back a sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nAnyone who does not vote has effectively voted for Nancy Pelosi who should be no one should kids themselves if you want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd they're hard to have to house and people like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services to the single phage\nIt tells you how ... how how could you know again she's smart lady she's not somebody I Want to have watching over banks and financial services um and she goes down the list and I think to yourself\nAnybody shores I'm tired of it all I don't like to know why should sort of a I'm not going to vote not voting is in effect a half vote for him and she closer to the next week um I think that's\nGood yeah I'm telling people there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection\nAnd every race is important and the idea is knows is if he either stay home\nOr you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for below sea the same in the Senate races\nYou know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for Bill Nelson you vote for\nReticent in Tennessee ... you're you're voting for Schumer and I know that it's probably not the way these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in reality that's how they're going to vote\nThat's who they're going to vote to be their leader\nBut I just tell everybody and he wanted to some of the claims you're a moderate Democrat asked for the voting for him to say I'm a moderate Democrat in the house of of course and when she goes you know and I would have to do that fine\nTo treat them throw level if they said you owe I'm really kind of a moderate Democrat you know I got to vote for sure we're defeat them who's sitting here\nAnd I think uh we have every evidence because his team sport 'cause the radical wing of the Democratic party in control

how\nAmerica has got to look America is going to make a choice there is now a movement that has evolved Mr Speaker out about it argue from moderate Democrats or I think it is one party one voice

disagreement\nLegislature vision of two totally different American you know there there are Americans wanted which we don't teach American history we don't want to be American I'm not proud of the flight motion so you could count on an emotional leave the star Spangled Banner\nAnd you know we're just one more normal country though to be subordinate it to the un and international bureaucrats\nAnd because we're the wealthiest country in the world how we're only seeing huge amounts of money to other folks are because they'd like to be wealthy chew on is the tiny chance that they don't have the money isn't it like you I mean it's it's amazing to watch and serious\nAh these folks are and how much they would eventually undermine America for the purpose of idea unless\nThere's a lot at stake I think the most you know if you're barely pay close attention to the Democrats stand for nothing except hating Trump wanting their crumbs back open borders not anything that's going to improve the lives of the ... men and women in this country but it's the speaker you spend a lot of time with us today we really appreciate it thank you and five or six days now to election day I'm

denies playing politics with immigration at least the Brady Fox News reporters asking him a short time ago whether he's using the thousands of migrants heading north from Central America to scare voters ahead of next week's elections\nIt was the first time in eighty years since FDR ran for president did we had a Democrat nominee for president when Orange County and so the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they hit zero zero in on us\nWell this is really interesting because most Republicans you don't think California races being that important\nBut now it's become crucial in terms of in a we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com\nUm that they're really focused in in which means that could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money I'm can ...\nExactly yeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there and do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money in the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest employment in forty nine years that you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years\nPeople have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs consumer confidence is that I mean we are really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era\nToo where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes you had government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we had over ... fourteen point advantage on the ... the the return over the Democrats\nSo we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump my big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power that forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job with the people in your\nState and in your district but the you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out and vote so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now and the Democrats have thirty nine\nAnd sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we've got to turn the state around and you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that cannot Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that\nUh it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it get to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOne of the problems that you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations on high taxation of states like California and New York Illinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of and a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave their liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your is\nThe unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles we may start to see that money go out of the hands of that and the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future in the state of California\nI got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California you now have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions for California Democrats and in tight races\nAnd one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district or and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power and\nThe vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're\nPretty much voting for below sea hope the people in those districts do understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nWell fun running for office who wants to run for office these days are All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out of election day let's go to Mary is in upstate New York Mary Hi how are you glad you called well New York's on the verge of re electing Cuomo and\nWas done a thing for upstate

Minneapolis ah in well in Minnesota for this race um that are going to tip the balance of power like Southern California it's interesting New York New Jersey\nOr places like Minnesota Wisconsin Michigan California state you wouldn't expect that's where a lot of these tossup races that I keep talking about our um look let me ask you when you move to North Dakota and you're and you did this radio show and you started your own business\nDid you make a lot more money\nI mean here I mean\nWe were in such a bad recession and Minneapolis and when I moved out there I mean that excitement and
