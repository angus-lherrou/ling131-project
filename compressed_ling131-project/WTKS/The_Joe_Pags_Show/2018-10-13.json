Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell hopefully I I Want I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number ... holding people accountable but here's what I Would say\nIs the fact that you're covering it you're listening interest and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or trying to work today\nOr to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general much caught me at\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that uh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final Pfizer warrant the one

president first talked about classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe Lisa Page all those documents as well\nThat would include McKay number so we we need all that information and again it's it's a real good friend that reading your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the

points out an six o'clock [noise]\nSeven [noise]\nDefending arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'm Roger Stern Fox News President Trump today defending his desire to continue selling arms to Saudi Arabia even the Washington Post columnist your mouth to show he disappeared after ending the so entering the Saudi consulate in eastern bowl and he is feared dead\nShe's made that decision and the left media the legacy media in this country listening to what she has to say and it's like now giving her greens if he hears the odds then\nAnd the whole thing is a bit Lewis him on those involved at all but here's the really odd thing\nWhen you turn on a television network whether it be CNN MSNBC or Fox News or were you see me during the week on Newsmax when you turn it on\nAnd somebody has presented as an expert on something\nLike I'll have an author on are all have a geologist on are all have a\nAn actor honor and I'll say this is an actor that you might remember from this this is a geologist who's an expert on this topic that we're talking about this is somebody who is a senator former senator um the IRS the president's son you'll normally present the person and say here's why you want to hear from this person\nOn some of the networks they'll say that the person who's a contributor well that means is the person is getting paid for the appearance or an analyst generally speaking members and getting paid too but they keep on presenting Alyssa mulatto and they never say why are we supposed to listen to her\nAnd address illicit mulatto says we need an equal rights amendment and then they do a whole story on it and USA Today\nI'm confused why are we doing a story on a list of a lotto I don't get it I'm confused but not as confused as she is\nFor some reason she thinks if there's an equal rights amendment which is unnecessary because we have guaranteed equal rights and equal opportunity in this country for some reason she thinks that we had an equal rights amendment then Christie lousy forward would have stopped\nThe Kavanaugh nomination an appointment\nAnd she's never really said why and again I don't really care why all this um a lot of things why she's not an expert\nI talked about this while I've talked about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes that people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we see you on the tube or or on the big screen for a long time\nAnd we set ourselves well we were you for some reason project intelligence on them\nA list of a lotto is not intelligent\nShe's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what she's talking about\nNone she has no clue she has yet to make a point that makes sense\nYou have to the legacy media keeps putting her up on high because a she's attractive and be they think that she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers and general Americans I guess where the dumb people out here like a like me to buy you into this far left wing garbage\nListen to the lotto actually doesn't help at all not not doesn't help their side they think she does but she doesn't want to listen to the lotto actually does is she hurt the cause\n\nMe she actually makes intelligent people like you and me\nSay well I'm definitely not going to vote that way lookout dumb the the thing is that she's saying or liquor taking selfies or taking videos well sitting in a very serious hearing\nOr look at her blindly saying you must believe every woman 'cause every woman who's telling the truth well we've got documented case after case after case where sadly women have lied\n\nThey don't misunderstand me I'm actually from the beginning you should take every allegation of sexual misconduct seriously\nBut you should not just simply because it said believe it you should believe in once it's proven\nBut there you go you turn on the job or you're you're reading you know some of these current events websites there's illicit mulatto and they never ever ever never say why we shouldn't believe or you should believe a list of all I'll be cause filling the black\nJust doesn't happen oh another trending thing that's happening today which will boggle your mind is Robert ... robbery ... of course the Confederate general who lost\nAnd had to surrender to to us rent\nAllegedly if you believe NBC News of the Washington Post President Trump last night went to Ohio\nAnd praised Robert ...\nPeriod and the story and of course that's the only period and the story of your legacy media that lies to your viewers and your readers and and those who follow you on social media of course the president did praise Robert ... on his lead up to talking about how Ohio in\nUlysses Grant kicked his ass\n\nHe talked about what a great general Lee was and how great still kicked\nHis ass now the media knows that but they also know you don't know that you don't have the\nPresident said it that way so if they say the president praised Ulysses S grade are they telling the truth or praised Robert ... are they telling the truth yes\n\nBut it's also a sin of omission or lie of omission\n\nThey didn't tell the whole truth\nI say I got to a section of ad and make it sound like the president went to Ohio\nSo and praise Robert he leave and left and waved to the crowd and the guys that good so what is the best thing I don't even get on my my plane they'll go back to Washington yeah I guess you could say that if you're a liar [noise]\nA better thing to say it might be what he really said\nUlysses Grant was so freaking good Betty kick this guy's Ashley this guy was really good\nThat was the context\nBut white tell the truth when you can lie and then corrected later and by the way on social media will you lie under your your legacy media tens of thousands of a retreat to likes when you're correct that few\nHundred that's the way it goes to this day and age\nEight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty one eight hundred and five zero one seven zero eight zero bottom of this hour is going to be former Governor Sarah pale in\nThe great state of Alaska what a great conversation I had with her and how we ended up connecting on my show\nThe Joe ... show Monday through friday is kind of mind boggling if you want to see the live video feed just shot by Joe ... dot com is the topic of the page that we've redesigned the page you can also see my parodies there you can get the interviews that I Do and my monologues as well\nAs the new stories to Joe packs duck on coming back on the weekends there\nMessaging ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your work loud\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors\nAll on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree and it's a little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nHe was arrested for for DUI DWI in the late nineties the guy who reported him because there was an accident says he tried to flee the scene the police report says he tried to flee the scene\nPolitically he said things like I'm open to the idea of abolishing eyes\nHe said things like we basically stole half of Mexico from them just patently untrue\nHe said things like he would definitely want to impeach the president of the United states should he get in he's an open borders guy who believes in open borders doesn't want a border wall\nYet we usually use commercials or here's commercials he's saying things like or diverse cities or strength and we need to be together and work together for better Texas\nWithout corrupt doesn't work anymore because people with America actually watch what you people did in the capital hearings it was disgusting and you went from probably winning the Senate to you're going to lose it now provided people actually go out and vote you need to go and vote\nAnd and a guaranteed when in the house doesn't look so likely anymore\nAnd the reason for that is people understand that right now to this president they've got lower taxes we've got more jobs than we've had\nEver got black and Hispanic unemployment through the roof women unemployment through the roof you got manufacturing coming back our standing in the world is much better the terrorists are working because we're getting better deals with Mexico and with Canada the EU [noise] things are shifting\nThe left overplay their hand and that's what we're seeing now to they have to pretend like the president doesn't doesn't like us grand to love Robert ... which is just dumb when we come back here from Sarah pay with former governor of Alaska right here\nOn the weekend don't touch that uh\nThis is the weekend with young [noise]\n\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or

live video feed do [noise]\nThe blaze radio network as well it is the weekend with Joe ... and I'm Glad to have you long for the ride a there's a lot going on this past week\nI was able to connect with us or a payload yes that Sarah Palin the former governor of Alaska and also the former Republican nominee\nFor vice president of the United states it was very interesting how it happened and and I show to tell the story in the interview we were able to connect and and do you hope you're watching as well as listening and if you're not go back to the live stream later and watch it because the scenery behind her as beautiful in Alaska but the ladies and gentlemen boys and girls that surveillance Sarah how are ya\nI'm doing great thank you for having me\nThey were not be mad at me for that whole thing like friday because the people know I was actually and this was unfolding on me or live you are listening but I was telling them what was going on and and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew\nWho said Hi Sarah Palin and pick up the kids up and dropping kids often and I'm listening is what is it good point they said man you've got a famous name and correct me if you're a teacher was do you remember what you said you said it's really neat I promise\n[laughter] sick\nAnd going back and forth and I needed it oh\nMy goodness somebody is cognizant of the fact we get pumped a lot in yeah Ali yet so thank you for doing that and know it was funny I started getting the calls and the tax people up here in Alaska listening [laughter] I don't know what I'm trying to verify me\nWhile I tried to verify the few ways when I got the email back from Sarah appealing dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I said do you have an iPhone ... face time you'll is just settled this once and for all and it's a good as we got to figure that fake you so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd that's about it and then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd phone by that time out of the vehicle and we're all in all the button to try to figure out how to say that\nAnd it worked out 'cause you press the but you took my face time in there you are it's like well that's definitely her son Tina Fey that's her that's all I I Know you've got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day Sarah have no idea how Lisa Murkowski ... became the senator\nAs a write in really so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican I Can't support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she said she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDo the people of Alaska except that excuse\nNo and go back even\nWriting campaign after he lost the primary up here remember what your senator Kramer cats yeah after having served twenty two years in the U.S and he gave his daughter the job\nWhen he was elected governor up here right there on charming and I ran against him into heated rhetoric that we've got and that's how we stayed in essentially 'cause man once you're in and you have a special interest from around the country right up funding you\nYou know you have to have to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough\nTime to go but no\nRational reason that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote again cabinet because as you point out she daddy good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know of course it is and whether either good manners\nYet I'm no no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles right very very very disappointed because as you suggested it outright set on friday\nThe things that she's pretty in jeopardy not just for the state of Alaska country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its grass having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate that you that you that you liked was about the Ninth Circuit court of appeals and I'll repeat that in the second it's a Sarah Palin of course the\nFormer vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska and just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't gonna vote for John McCain is going to write in my mother's name until you got on the ticket and then I voted for you\nSo and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski of people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states the Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um\nThe law issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court has eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost every really would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment tenth amendment for Alaska where did that make you think\nExactly right and Joe I Would go for it because nobody else was talking about topics there what her\nAction was with essentially bolstering the nights get had she had her her way in that\nThe Ninth Circuit out of San Francisco right you know talking about injustice and justice being delayed for Alaskans because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest as the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very person very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power\nAnymore say over Alaska so for me to be messing around with that uh that was very very dangerous another thing is that the\nTrump President Trump saw the light and is allowing animal are only decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has\nIn terms of resources to help our country become more energy independent that inherently between energy and security energy prosperity that Anwar that's our oil and gas development here in Texas and elsewhere that Lisa would put that in jeopardy and\nYou know make it different where you guys keep\nOkay we're going to do that as Sarah thanks a million alone with millions of other Americans I voted for you two thousand eight I'd vote for you in a heartbeat again I really appreciate your reaching out and thanks for taking the time today\nThank you so much cricket you we appreciate Sarah ... taking the time you know it was interesting how we ended up connecting she's riding around in Alaska\nAnd listens to my program every day we're on it you know in in Anchorage I'm guessing that's where she hears it we're also on ah in Fairbanks but to have the opportunity to talk to her and she really doesn't have a similar if not even worse story been cabinet does because Kevin all we had to put up with it for three weeks or or Penner eleven days\nOr is there a veil and had to put up with it for more than a year in her family to the microscope and just the\nThe craziness from the left him and the lawyer showing up in Alaska her perspective really made a lot of sense to me and I look I Hope she runs because Lisa Murkowski\nLisa Murkowski in my opinion do not represent the people of Alaska which he voted no on Brett Kavanaugh I'm the reason she gave was\nBecause he's not the right guy at the right time which doesn't make any sense your thoughts on what you just heard one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe packs dot coms that writer\nKevin going well\n... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were a business degree that further your career and gave you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule\nOne that opened doors to some of the

hundred five zero one Seventy eighty one eight hundred and five zero one seven zero eight zero truly\nGreat to have Sarah bailing on the program a an interesting story interesting backstory I I've been requested may have run the program for a few years\nTo be honest with you and I think she's got some really good protection you know around her because I don't have you ever got her the word I had no clue as you listen to my show every day and and I guess they hit the right buttons that one day and getting that anonymous strange a message on Facebook\nEnded up getting the interviewing and hopefully we'll have run again and again and again um I Do hope she runs that Lisa Murkowski Lisa Murkowski showed that she is not who she told Alaska she would be when she said she'd be a Republican there is no reason for any Republican\nOr anybody who's a conservative a traditional American values person to say no to Brett Kavanaugh uncorroborated the allegations don't count\nI'm innocent until proven guilty due process do count\nAnd and her no vote was a ridiculous move\nAnd hope that people of Alaska are smart enough to get her essay out of there as soon as they can it is a one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty will have energy secretary Rick Perry on the program what's going on with the energy sector what about this liquefied natural gas that we're sending over to the you know how does that help out and much much more we talk about that we've got um uh we we also have\nDug Adler he's a senior vice president of regime that associates why did the stock market do what he did this week\nDropped eleven twelve Thirteen hundred points what about ... plus we've got um Dr Sebastian Gorka on the program too is a one would then bunch you know there's a lot to get to know plenty of time for your phone calls as well at one eight hundred and five zero one seven zero eight zero gonna be line one dog is it Michigan Doug what's going on\nI joke um thanks I listen to your program what I can catch it a nice to see\nThat you got all the fair okay I'll Try and make those were you when you're old trainer asked me what I wanted to talk about I had mentioned that I read an article or some kind of go by couldn't validate where the article came from Tyler change my question to\nIn this election how do we check invalidate every person involved in counting the electorate ... votes to make sure they can't corrupt the actual vote tallies that critical areas of our country\nWell allegedly there are checks and balances in place but I don't trust that a lot of his electronic voting um I I think ... is scary because you can hack\nThese machines I don't know how to do it but but you know these these guys out there do know how to do it if you're going to happen during our government or hack into Facebook or acting to fill in the blink Yahoo um if you could do those things after you do an election machine\nI Would think would be very hard um so I don't know how we guarantee that I I got to tell you Doug I I've been voting for as long as I can remember and I can't tell you for sure that my vote counted every time\nI still go and I'll continue to go\nBut we are leaving it to a very small number of people to validate something that that we all hope will vote that they'll get right it's a great question I don't have a good answer\nAs fast you know all of a sudden it's about a whole box of votes were counted in critical elections and it's like\nOh well I Can't live I I'm guessing that you you might be referring to Minnesota where Al Franken wanted he shouldn't have but suddenly there were votes that were in somebody's car trunk\nIt just doesn't make any sense and it is it's a scary proposition although I bullied a little bit by the ... the election results in twenty sixteen ... election and that will that would've been the one but I think they let their guard down I ...\nThey let their guard down because they thought Hillary Clinton was going to win rather easily\nIt sounds like our votes really do care but it's a great question I don't think there's any guarantee one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty one eight hundred

Richard Nixon no yes yeah it's\nReally um you know a stimulated get motivated by this testimony and he says\nI Know where the bad guys on one of them is former presidential advisor to former State Department official shop you know the left a darling of the media called out ... yes right and he goes on record for the truth to say this man is a communist and he's a spy the left\nDecides to destroy him\nThey publicly accused him of being an alcoholic of being a closet homosexual they say that this man is responsible for the death of his own brother and all of it is an ... off to lie but chambers never give us and he never surrenders and eventually long enough that he's dead\nWe have been known to the crap that the Soviet signals intelligence intercept that prove that yes lo and behold out this was a Soviet agent at the top about government so if you're surprised at what the Democrats did the justice Kavanaugh over the last month\nDon't be they get update done it before and not just Clarence Thomas they did it back in Nineteen forty eight with this great American hero Whittaker Chambers\nThat is the unknown mistake voice of Dr Sebastian Gorka why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies that's an unbelievable story because I ... and again I'm you when I talk about it all the time and you know they're not as smart as you um but but I Know a little less reactor\nAct [laughter] I I it's a\nI Know a little bit about history I pay attention I I Do a little dog and pony show every day I Would never ever have thought in my wildest dreams that the Democrats have been doing this\nFor Seventy years you're telling me Seventy years ago how they do the exact rice said em oh this is a modus operandi as we just saw a bunch of indoctrinated idiots scratching and clawing on the ... of the Supreme Court so you're saying this is what they've done for the ages for generations now\nAbsolutely but this is what happens\nWhen you make a deal with the devil when when the left decided that the end that there are ... getting power\nJustifies the means this is what you end up doing your will destroy innocent man\nYou will try and you'll use every dirty trick in the book because as far as that can set it doesn't matter what I Do it to another human being because I have to have the power\nAnd that was so important I I couldn't put it in my book you know why we fight because it happened off they came out yeah but when the president stood out in the White House two days ago\nIn front of the world and pulled out the Democrats for the evil things they did the justice Kavanaugh and thin pronounce that innocent that was a historic moment because just as\nWhat it could chambers within it said Seventy years ago so is justice Kavanaugh eight year old man who the Democrats tried to destroy\nThe name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies going get five copies giving to your friends and family doctors Sebastian Gorka that yeah I\nI read the audio book this time so the whole book on the order of all is me with my funny acts that\nIt's not funny at all and that that that's going to sell a billion copies everybody wants to hear you read the book so go and get that as well get the audio book as well so so let me ask you about this ... this whole idea from the left that that you so well said and actually talk to my\nMy friend did do denounced as soon as about this as well he goes back even further even before World War one and World War two where this sort of fascism has been known to be on the left we just have pretended through history that didn't happen that way but but let me let me ask you about why we're so successful and I have an idea as to why\nBut but I'll ask you more more specifically\nWas it so successful because the right always cow town gave in and again you just have outlined it incredibly this president said I'm not giving in this justice cabinet decided I'm not going to given I'm not going to allow them to do this to me\nBut is that why it's lasted for probably the better part of a century because the right always gives in and pull the nominee or or bend over backwards for the left\nI'll tell you what I saw when I was in the White House so I I I had very quickly I developed the reputation the White House and a lot of people especially the press department said I I miss the strange one why\nBecause I refused I just refused flat out from day one to talk to the the fake news I I ... I didn't care whether it was washed the post ... ... and it I said no why would I tool to people who wish to destroy this president I'm ready to talk on record or off wreck all\nThe trouble is the majority of the establishment until the Kavanaugh hearing\nThe majority of the establishment the geo peace than it is that the the the bureaucrats in the in the White House they want the joke they want the approval\nOf the New York times why they want the approval of CNN this is the problem and you know why that is so ridiculous number one they wish to destroy us look at what they've done for the last two years and secondly who cares\nAbout CNN yeah you know I I Know just because of the White House book as you know how many people watched the most\nQuote unquote important show on CNN every night and listen to what I have no you know how many people know OK so Sean Hannity crush it like he is the ... while they get all yes he is the king millions and millions and millions of us every show\nAnderson Cooper the star of the Clinton used that work Monday Night his show gets six hundred thousand view is\nAnd that somehow this you don't want to record Dr Gorka how how is it that people and you're right people on the establishment right people in the swamp on the right or afraid of what Anderson Cooper will say about them\nRight we have three hundred and twenty five million people in this country ... less than half a percent what's what's Anderson Cooper if they were paying thanks to ... and we now they we now do they pay if they weren't paying the CNN to be broadcast in America's airports that'd be three people including\nSome who are watching this show is is what\nWe have to break the ... the approval of these people but I Know what last friday did you watch the press conference by the Republican senators\nWho it ... it was actually in power and yeah\nThey were angry I have never seen them so angry at the Democrat so that is costing behavior\nSo you know what I think something's changed but everybody be deadly serious the midterms are the most important election of our lives don't take it for granted go to vote take your friends to vote if you like the last two years and you want six more we have to win the mid ...\nIs Dr Sebastian Gorka the name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies one last quick question I always appreciate the access in the friendship thank you and social and I said oh we're friends as well\nI'm a welder when it comes to left versus right politics I just saw an article by the hill that says that millennials overwhelmingly are liberal leaning left will vote left I also saw another recent polling I forget who the pollster was but it's a real one that says that suddenly the G. O. B. S. even things up for the race for the\nFor the house of representatives how do you balance that\nSix four or five [noise]\nAnd I\nWill not pay river\nRussell and you'll have dot com [noise] all the good there we've redesigned the website Go check it out also\nThe blaze radio network it is the weekend with Joe ... heavier always glad to catch up with my former governor the former governor of the great state of Texas Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America no and you might wonder well what does that person do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked to about ... we're talking about liquefied natural gas we go to an war as well ... ... ... how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much we're I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so uh you know Texas but it's a it's what I call temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight ... as you know I'm connected with several people on your staff and I can see their travel on Facebook and on Twitter and so on you or your or a globe Trotter now is it did you know that was going to be part of a job to be over in Africa to be over in Europe and be over in Asia and then back home base it on your back over Indonesia we do know that that was going to entail all of us\nAre not necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revolution runners off that occurred in the United states\nIt makes sense in hindsight that would be in all those markets because it's you know we're now selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five continent and ... and uh there there's more to be done so I'm being there uh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being a regulator making sure that we're\nA you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and has a\nUh as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know as a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world\nAnd the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIt's the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and delivers that are that the president has in and he's putting it on me you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining you know good he's putting terms is going to ruin trade and in no time flat\nBiggie you stepped up and said we're making the deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade him in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas now are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make a part of the deal how does that go down\nThat have he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet for the cause of secretary of treasury the notion and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross day all have a a a role to play\nIn that and and uh so absolutely there's a there's there's good and a correspondence back and forth a and a ... everybody's on the same team\nI Want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like it for a lot of reasons that I you know ... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] sure of that but it's true\nAnd and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator a person who goes and what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen if I have trade ya and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine\nUh and and that's exactly what he's doing with these trade deals where he comes to a certain really hard stuff I mean you think about with you and then a ... and came back in here or after they laid out some really tough or a sanction or not sanctions but tariffs retro\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so did the Chinese ... again you know hedge blew up when they announced the tariffs are originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose a\nThey know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese don't lose a trade war with us so if\nI were the biggest customer they don't want to screw with us that would lead them\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRight oh good neighbor\nYeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you're in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming under the great guidance of a\nGreat guy but now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got\nTo see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange\nYeah it it was really pretty fascinating and\nHere's the other side of it as these things were outdated do you think about that North American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two as rent was side\nThat was twenty five years ago and and think about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree\nUh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who or a a developing the energy sources that we were buying and now\nI'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different\nThan we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president would say you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing and we got an email now the uh uh I think it's a ah what do we call it the uh uh U.
