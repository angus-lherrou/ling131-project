own it would be a it would be bad for me to not start we're the most important story of foreigners happening and that's Panama City in that area I Know that you've been there a lot you've been you've been monitoring what's going on you been talking to the people feel my listeners and viewers in on on what you see there and how things are going\nWell they really why I mean we taught I'm born and raised in Florida and we've seen a lot of storms all the money into\nYour home spending Ninety to buy into the worst damage I've seen in terms of Panama Sandy and in terms of Mexico beach in some of the area and so\nI'm a I'm a self servants rising was turn away out um they're starting to get power back off\nOn a structural damage because you had basically about category five\nHad um I talked to some of the sheriff's they're um they're actually progressing ahead of schedule which is good I thank God\nYou know wanted that surround neighboring counties golf county are going to have their power on by the end of the day it's supposed to be back on which I thought was going to take another week or two but you know there's a certain amount of damage that weren't going to have a you know at that\nAge secondary obviously we're talking to run the ship is former congressman he's a Republican running for governor of Florida gives leader Gillum um this is secondary of course but I've heard reports that I've seen reports I've read reports that\nVoting might be an issue it might be not as easy to vote because a lot of the places that are traditional polling places in that region of the Gulf Coast I'm going to be out ... and taking care of who's working on that\nIt is so there's a the governor's working on that some of the local folks I think what you're going to see is they'll probably be extraordinary accommodations for the people that were displaced\nOr just for the people are still in the county so I think you're looking at adding additional\nPolling location and then I think there's going to be\nA some consideration for if you are displaced or you can vote and other counties and your vocal silk out so I think they're working\nOn that and by saying that\nThat's something that's doable and I think that they well look I mean you know a lot of these folks um uh you know are not necessarily thinking about voting on the first thing on their mind but at the same time these are resilient people I mean you know the people in Bay county I mean they're so they're very didn't mind it so I think a lot of them are even though they got a lot of there's\nGot to deal with it I didn't want to appreciate Ivan Watson Cheney to cast a vote\nIt is a Republican around a shared is running for governor would reach me to float around you may or may not notice I've got several stations in Florida very highly rated in South Florida which is where I grew up I'm I'm I grew up in South Florida who's there for Twenty one years I mean ... to go back all the time my mom was there my sisters are there and I saw the understood the politics of the area\nI clearly don't there's there was a sea change that happened since I moved away that I didn't see coming in and the southern bureau Florida that it's very heavily populated ... having a fight whether it's center writer's center left but a lot of like the school districts and school boards and and a lot of the sheriff's officers do lean left\nOr how much of a challenges it for you to get any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand that your your your conservative guard that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting good track and I mean I think if you look at South Florida for the Miami Dade County\nHuge energy with Cuban Americans um other Hispanics Venezuelans and the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism\nThey don't want to see socialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home country or we also have a very significant contrast which usually doesn't work this way and Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a pro Israel leaders in the country where I had been in Congress\nYelling at the hospital to Israel I mean he is I endorsed by a group that dream defenders which is prominent into bbs movement against Israel they say Israel genocidal apartheid state I led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great day you don't want to pose it\nGillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem in Israel\nA ton on indivisible capitals so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway and areas that may be a Republican wouldn't cause the Democrat\nEven though their party has drifted more and more anti Israel and Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't find they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really aligned with the radical left\nA which is really a very hostile to Israel now\nWell he's a he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and big government is also pro abortion me the guys are socialized launch Medicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's\nIt's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me run in and I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and what a guy who's like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nThe physical relief maybe even more as you

Laura Trump but really great to talk to you if your brother in law I asked the ... I asked her husband this I asked the President Bush\nWhen he made the announcement I'm ... I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually do this\n... jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but his love for country said this is my calling was my duty who's your who's your thought process when it looked like\nYour mother in law was really going to take this up\nHere and he actually that all of them down and said\nI Want to do this and then two days before the famous ... birthday during dinner and said\nYou guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack us they'll tell lies about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it will get to this level rise up but like I said I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew\nThat my father in law to do this job he's a businessman he is so smart when it comes to negotiating you see when he's been able to do in in so many different respects with hair of the trade um he's really great at that than I knew back then that he would be great at it um so for me it was a hundred percent and\nAgain I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this um it it is so much bigger than any of us but that's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president and get the tax every second of every day\nNone of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future of the country and if we have to take a couple of planes and arrows here and there and the president\nOr you know take that every single day more than any of us it's totally worth it because I really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest presidents of countries ever had\nA ... roof that it's Laura Trump her husband was there with her father in law is the president I asked him back in twenty sixteen\nOr because you said it was nowhere near I mean you expect to the media would come after the leopard come after you does but not like this and I understood it was just completely unexpected he said no I Know that they would want to go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media\nYou told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice for thirty or forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper or television or radio show so he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you been in the media for a long time I've been to newsrooms for a long time as we'll just leave left but I didn't know was going to be like this so\nWhat what was when was the realization for you in the family that this was way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I was actually still for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television\nAnd I ... it became very frustrating for me to to work there because I Would be\nAll different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things in and say hey that's not what he said you know what he said um that that was it it it was very clear wind to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for\nForever if you know he became president ... but um but certainly\nAfter they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked\nMy unborn child I mean it's the talk about it is a it is\nSo crazy but again I think it's because they knew before the Trump became president that if he got in there\nThere was no turning back that he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their old way of life was going to come to an end so um I have to say that it is just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nI Would agree with you you guys were you have the ... of any family members you to my wife is Lara Trump irritates her husband her father in law of course is the president of the United states we've done we've got several races now that are starting to lean writes the midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although I can see that it doesn't mean anything unless people don't vote\nIn Texas where I should you've got Ted Cruz the incumbent who's doing an incredible job in working with your debt with your brother in law are very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's been shown from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided Texas but under the surface those you know he's a former left wing socialist is going to war if you look at places like Michigan ... who's been there for three decades and it's time for her to go now you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get\nThat show the ... seat this really use going to come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now in the country to get off the reruns and go vote for this really what it is isn't it\nOh absolutely well as I think you right now I'm In Minnesota\nTraveling estate campaigning I Will be in your neck of the woods in Texas on Monday youthful I Will be on Tuesday ironically in Michigan um ... it's so so important we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and that's what a lot of people against and even people on his own party sometimes money and get them to think about\nWhat could happen if he had a cohesive unit of people behind him that voted alongside president and and really pushes agenda forward we can be so much more progress in the country and by the way\nI Know we talk about socialism if anybody has any question about what socialism look like the look in Venezuela right now\nThat could become the United states of America if we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda forward it's really very frightening socialism has never worked the fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that should shocking everybody to\nA degree that you you not only are going to get out and do it in the midterms but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go vote um it it's very area and I I Know that it felt

I've always been against abortion extended a rate you know but that changed my mind right there and then when I went back to have a lady at the reception sign for it\nThey had a a magazine right there and I got started that let's do it I just ask you what it was and she said miss their new catalog and ...\nIt was just like a ... catalog or or or Sears catalog and a half a T park and uh at prices for a full faces arms fingers and now it's just something new and she was you know uh\nBut you know thank goodness I I didn't have to go back and I told my boss to fire me if I went back in their\n... listen to your story use is startling and certainly bad that you shared it but I I got to be honest with you I'm a bind but there was a JC Penney's type catalog with baby parts on it I mean you'd have to be something other than a catalog well what does it mean what you saw what was you know\nI'm\nI'm always called it a catalog has a title on the front what did it say\nI didn't I didn't even look at it 'cause I always found it through it and ask her why she signed up for it and I'm a born again Christian I wouldn't lie to you I mean I Know what I saw\nNo you you you sound you sound like a really honest guy I just do that there was a catalog\nWith baby a hard subject Abe's obviously has been exposed through undercover investigation that a lot of these abortion providers orange about dealing in baby parts and body parts of his disgusting and it makes me sick I Would be ... we'd be startled if you saw a JC penny like catalogue with baby parts of which to\nMe I mean maybe maybe you're describing maybe you're describing it incorrectly ... wasn't a catalog let you go shopping for close so that's that could be\nIt ... it was ... and I looked at ... had baby parks with prices by him I I Know what I saw Joe I I'm not going to like this\nIs what would you want you to get offended but but I find it extremely hard to believe the other part of your story I find to be very believable and I'm Sorry that you went through that W testing and I say one thing you could say whatever you want but what I'm saying is if you tell me what the title of a catalog was I mean you're actually tonia some through like a JC penny catalog that makes no sense to me\nWell what would I guess I Wish [laughter]\nAs horrible as abortion providers are they're not stupid as as as horrible as abortion providers are they're not stupid enough to leave a book like that around for anybody to see\nIt had just come in ... she had was brand new\nBut the thing I Want to I Want to\nIt's just like you know a cabin on hearing and the lady that she was traumatized and I don't buy it for it because you get your traumatized you'll remember things that that happened I I mean I tell ya yeah where I was I can tell you I mean they're staying traumatized me and\nI Know what I saw\nI I I Believe you think you saw something like that I'm here to tell you I Know I saw I ...

governor of Florida now Rick Scott is running for Senate he was the governor is the governor now and the ... the Democrat nominee for governor who's a far left wing socialist\nA run I appreciate Joe are you\nI'm doing good how are you doing I'm living the dream in really glad to have your own it would be a it would be bad for me to not start we're the most important story of foreigners happening and that's Panama City in that area I Know that you've been there a lot you've been you've been monitoring what's going on you been talking to the people fill my listeners and viewers in on on what you see there and how things are going\nWell they really why I mean we thought I'm born and raised in Florida and we've seen a lot of storms all the young one and two homes better Ninety to buy into the worst\nDamage I've seen in terms of Panama Sandy in terms of Mexico beach in some of the area so I'm a feminist cell servants rising was totally out um they're starting to get power back a\n\nStructural damage because you had basically a category five\nHad um I talked to some of the sheriff's they're um they're actually progressing ahead of schedule which is good I thank God\nYou know wanted that surround neighboring counties golf county are going to have their power on by the end of the day it's supposed to be back on which I thought was going to take another week or two to how much you know there's just certain amount of damage that we're going to have a you know at\nThe age secondary obviously we're talking around to see it as former congressman he's a Republican running for governor of Florida gives the Andrew Gillum um this is secondary of course but I've heard reports that I've seen reports I've read reports that\nVoting might be an issue it might be not as easy to vote because a lot of the places that are traditional polling places in that region of the Gulf Coast um are going to be out is that getting to handle a jacket and taking care of who's working on that\nIt is so there's a the governor's working on that I'm In the local folks I think what you're going to see is they'll probably be extraordinary accommodations for the people that were displaced\nOr just for the people are still in the county but I think they're looking at having additional polling location\nAnd then I think there's going to be a consideration for if you are displaced or you can vote and other counties or your vocal silk out so I think they're working on that\nAnd by saying that that's something that's doable and I think that they well look I mean you know a lot of these folks um uh you know are not necessarily thinking about voting on the first thing on their mind but at the same time\nThese are resilient people I mean you know the people in Bay county I mean they're so they're very ... minded so I think a lot of them are even though they got a lot of there's\nGot to deal with I didn't appreciate having walked the Kennedy to cast a vote\nIt is a Republican Ron deceived is running for governor would reach me to Florida rung you may or may not notice I've got several stations in Florida very highly rated in South Florida which is where I grew up I'm I'm I grew up in South Florida who's there for Twenty one years and I love the ... go back all the time my mom was there and my sisters are there and I suddenly understood the politics of the area\nI clearly don't there is there is a sea change that happening since I moved away that I didn't see coming in and the southern bureau Florida that is very heavily populated ... having a fight whether it's center right or center left but a lot of like the school districts and school boards and and a lot of the sheriff's officers do lean left\nOr how much of a challenges it for you to get any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand that your your your conservative guard that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting good tracks and I mean I think if you look at South Florida and for the Miami Dade County\nHuge energy with Cuban Americans um other Hispanics like Venezuelans and the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism\nThey don't want to see socialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home country or we also have a very significant contrast which usually doesn't work this way in Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a pro Israel leaders in the country have been in the Congress\nThe element hostile to Israel I mean he uh is endorsed by a group that dream defenders which is prominent in the ... movement against Israel they say Israel to genocidal apartheid state I led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great\nDay you'd at one of those it Gillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's\nA total of individual capitals so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway in areas that may be a Republican wouldn't cause a Democrat\nEven though their party has drifted more and more in Israel and Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't this time they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really align with the radical left which is really a very hostile to Israel now\nHe's ... he's like he's really he's also a part of freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and and big government he's also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants Medicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's\nIt's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me run in and I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic\nOr Christian who is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have guys like you and
