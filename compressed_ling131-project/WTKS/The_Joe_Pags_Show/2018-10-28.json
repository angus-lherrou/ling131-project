also\nThe blaze radio network a lot of you listening there and I appreciate you every single time it is your boy Joe packs a note about ... before I go to John ... a couple of things are important number one when you called your radio show\n'em you can't both be heard at the same time so do you make an allegation that I Want to comment on it you gotta stop for a second and then I'll let you can kill you but the fact that she wouldn't have stopped talking she thought that she would win if she kept talking unfortunately for you I have\nThe microphone and I have control\nOf of what's being hurt at any given time I have a decision to make either both of us speak the same time and my listeners and viewers don't get to hear either of us or turn you down or just hang up on you know just keep talking um it's not going to be both ways now I Am a fair guy that I'll stop and let you continue\nBut if you could make allegation after about an allegation about how great CNN is and not let me respond it's not going to work when it comes to ... because there are there are a few big lives out there about Donald Trump he was trying to ban all Muslims from coming here that's not true in fact the Muslim ban or the the travel ban yes\nYes predominantly Muslim countries were involved but Ninety One percent of all Muslims around the world are allowed to come here so that's a ... Islamic focus just not true of the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people\nAre very fine people he didn't say that what he said was it's a it's a very loud debate debate an emotional debate there are very there are bad people on both sides there are very fine people on both sides\nThe debate we're talking about isn't whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues to Confederate of war heroes or soldiers\nOr leaders that's what it was about 'cause they're tearing down people turned up monuments because they feel like they can and they really can't it's against the law first of all and second leads to debate that we should have are there are good people on the side of of course the monuments should stay there it's our history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yep\nOr they're good people on the side of terror tear it down sure or they're bad people and that side absolutely so he's ... he's not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listen to CNN and MSNBC and and the other left wing media outlets saying it over and over and drawing on and on and on you actually believe\nThat he is a pro white supremacist guy he's not\nHe's never said anything that would that would suggest that he is and this whole thing about how we mocked disabled reporter is also ally\nYes the reporter does have some affliction where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms where I I guess he I don't know what to do with the ... it's called but I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this\nAnd when he talks his have stay like that they that he doesn't have the full mobility of his hands in his in his forums as as most people do\nAnd the president what I guess the guy wrote something bad report something bad about or negative about the president and he said oh look at me any sort of did his hands at a similar fashion and made you know just spoken to in a certain kind of way well aid the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't ... mimicking them that way\nAnd be very good just go to you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story there are are are ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before even considering running when he's on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\nSo ... mocking the disabled reporter\nUh beforehand was the president was the clear boy and once he making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety when a reporter didn't do the reporting till two veteran sixteen or maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not\nSometimes he acts like a dark that way the president and he does is he is that way and he speaks that way do look at me with Donald Trump um stupid ... you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing or you're going to do your own research it independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant wouldn't hand motion to do and if you ever done that before and one not talking about this reporter\nAnd then you make the decision but if you buy hook line and sinker with the fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong and don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV Guide know squat an angel in New York and I know more than you\nYou may in fact to intimidate the more than I Do but you failed any debate when you walk into thinking you're superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level of anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in his business\nFifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces I gave you straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what my politics work so bring it next time I get ... you better bring it better than that\nAll right let me get to John Hi Bush he's the guy that runs the or the Reagan facility the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate jour yet\nI'm just great to be with\nYou I'm really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll it's wonderful but that thing behind you just got my attention it appears to be a plaintiff some short and some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nYeah well we're right here at the Reagan Library that's our escort team at that jet is one of the famous jets that philosophy carrier or a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots them when they came after our fleet at one point to Nineteen eighty six\nI Do remember that and I also remember that the President Reagan said watch this and went back in and launched an attack on on Gadhafi himself and that really got him under control didn't it\nRebel and I'll say when you\nEnter sales you know it's the real deal and\nWe can get a bargain fading don't why thank you all year

dentists and doctors the eleven people killed inside the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh ranged in age from fifty for ten Ninety seven\nThe are ridiculous legacy disgusting media reporting that it's still McGrath bomber the make America great again bomber which is disgusting\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no not the case what you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\n\nThe bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter had the congressional baseball game the Sanders shooter even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do that's also not being honest and it's not reporting the news\nAs as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\n\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know is name although it's been a reporter to use a white guy with a beard and also it was\nReported as a bombing suspect who was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American as first name is ... says are so he could be Hispanic as well as all sort of reports that he's\nA talented Filipino the media always though quick\nTo say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman the guy who killed Trayvon Martin because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of them in in self defense he shot and killed him they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was Hispanic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is\nSo the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can\nAnd that's what we have out of Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like it's some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just to picture the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected or even years ago where they are a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican in twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made him do it according to the media\nSends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced there were really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people we return addresses armies wouldn't fake addresses on the actual sent into an area that we're supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it\nThere but it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about Trump did this I guess there were some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow\nInciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact it sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media\nIs inciting violence against those who support President Trump\nYou if you were a make America great again hat your target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist and Islamophobia Xena fall but that's OK the media school with that\nYou're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for for putting that's okay that's perfectly fine\nFake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example every example example of that\nWith the media again playing the victim in fact Jim Acosta from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment or engaged over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give that in mind\nThis is a guy whose job is supposed to be the gold and report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a cost and and and his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living so make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be on the president you don't get to tell the president ... mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose who perpetrated violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who committed violence and they're on the right same thing should apply\nBut the selective reporting and there's the desire by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is and it's just a crazy person that was unhinged that's irresponsible\nThat's they're responsible or by the way the the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian\nIs family or a family friend or a lawyer or somebody claimed that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or an American Indian and the other one sounded Italian first name certainly sounds Hispanic who knows what he is\nWhen we do know is he was some promoter for shipping veils\nAnd some bouncer at at a bar and even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the left is trying to glean from him and pin it on Trump is irresponsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw\nIs not go there or observe and then tell us why Trump caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly we've got a bunch of interviews coming your way a bunch of interviews I might take some false led called ... Charlie go\nI'm I'm not going to do conspiracy theories today that that that's that stupid Charlie you can go ahead and hang up in Maryland I'm not technical I'm All right\nWe've got John Hi bushy use the guy from the he's the executive director of the Ronald Reagan um Institute in California\nGreat interview with him where we compare and contrast how Ronald Reagan um through his accomplishments treated was treated by the media and how he treated the media\nAnd it was a much better than what's going on with Trump and then how Trump does it very very different styles both of them had incredible accomplishments for the American people the media was not on either one of their sides how is it the that the media is Harold ... Ronald Reagan as a great president great leaders thirty some odd years later whereas Trump is being treated as he's being treated\nSort of get that for ya I've got representative Kevin Brady you're hearing the president talk a lot about a new a new tax cut plan for the middle class in America is that tax cuts to point out or is that something different we break that down we talked about it makes you stick around for that I've got a ...\nThat caravan we've got that for you which is okay I did it last minute I think\nMessaging ... earning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your work loud but what if there were a business degree that further at your career in case you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEO's\nCompanies law firms entrepreneur where it's been thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree and it's a little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

County Arizona he is a right they're separated by an Indian reservation but right there on the border and deals with illegal immigration all the time I Want to know how he's preparing for the caravan heading this way\nAnd and what exactly it is the law enforcement is willing to work has to do as it gets here a share of our research how're you\nDoing great thanks yeah around me I\nWas always appreciate it really had a good time with you at the fair get together in a Washington DC\nGot some great knowledge I have to wear my cowboy boots next time I played a shrimp um six one I've got to do for standing next to you but ah it was a great time and really great knowledge I Love the way you guys there in your sheriff's department\nDo the job and especially you know watching you out there on live TV I saw out they're interacting with the people in the community and I love the way that you take the job on a lot of people I've seen police officers you know guys like this to\nGo walk around like like you know their stuff doesn't steak I've seen some who I think are sometimes too lenient you seem to really have it down to ... I'm going to interact with my neighbor here maybe somebody who goes to church with me or my my kids go to school together\nBut at the same time I can't let them go too far because then that would make it bad for the community is that kind of how you approach it\nYou know that in these are my neighbors these are people that I'm gonna see at the store and these are people that I'm going to deal with in the future and uh I don't know what is what is it it's gone on in their life to put him to this point yeah so I tried to treat everybody with dignity and respect we try to go in there now they escalated\nI don't have a problem escalated as well but I find that you can you can attract more slide and then you can bet ...\nAnd in watching you interact in a good share of mark lamb from ... county I've seen that I mean you walk up generally speaking to my ... unless they like get a shot somebody you walk up generally speaking very respectful and and you seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt now\nHow often do you think is there a percentage you can put on this or somebody will not get with the program not understand that you might actually be willing to cut them a break and they just don't shut up and they just give you a hard time and it's this whole community versus the police ...\nIs there a percentage of people that you think talk their way into jail or into a ticket or something\nOh yeah I don't know what it is for most police officers I mean for me it's probably about ten percent of those ...\nOr ... difficult to deal yeah yeah yeah you know I'm I'm a believer in combat power if you walk out your calm and they can steal that they don't steal your wrapped up it it really helps that situation go a lot smoother you must you have to rest\nAnd ended up going to last but there's some people that are just like you said from the word go they're not with the program and that you can tell that immediately\nWhat I've learned from watching your sheriff mark ... County Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like like pd and others um is that when you walk up\nYou generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was a but again if somebody's going to get with the program you probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on 'em and but they're also minor enough to know where you could still get them home tonight\nThat you know it's kinda it's I didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look\n[laughter] just relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently or did you think if you just stay calm which work through it um and it does give us the ability to use some of that discretion but you're right and if we wanted to get stuck on a ton of charges too so it it really just depends on on where they want to take it\nWe you know stick to the laws are in or is there a sense of nervousness among the community now with all these people had no way\nYou know we're very supportive community because we deal with it so much you know in this county everybody understands what the majority of the people understand the immigration issue you were with\nCars running from us almost ... almost every night were given the drug company dark community or you've been affected by heroin and buy 'em by ... by these other drugs that they're trying to get our our American public and are you hooked on so\nHere in Arizona and here in our county we get for the most yup and uh so we get a lot of support and they they expect out of the I was voted into this position on those grounds that I was strong on border security and protecting our community so we had a lot of support from our up from the people that\nAre good is it they sound like very good people and they certainly have a great sheriff sure mark lamb but al ...

afternoon you're probably going to have more information I'm I'm I'm Glad he's in custody I'm Glad nor people are in harm's way there with the fact that he was able to get in there and make that happen is is disgusting\nIt really is yeah there was a time in this country not very long ago where you could leave your keys in the car and he'll he'll even running of it was a cold day out the due to warm things up didn't have to lock your front door well this day and age that I don't want a police state our martial law that's for sure\nBut what I Do want is for people to be smart because the bad guys the the fringe moons out there\nWill take advantage of our welcome are welcoming nature of our openness of our togetherness of our want to be one community that gathers\nThe synagogue did nothing wrong so don't misunderstand me\nBut I'm at the point to where I Want where people congregate and gather to have protections in place I'm to the point to where if you're going to have a place where people can access innocence you should have somebody there or some mechanism in place\nTo guard against a piece of garbage like this guy is alleged to be I don't think that's asking much I really don't whether it be a school\nOr a movie theater or a church or synagogue or mosque or whatever it happens to be there should be a put a pretext a protective mechanism in place whether it's armed guards or bulletproof glass or you can't get in unless you're busting something has to happen\nBecause you can go down the list of all these places look as we're talking about soft targets the movie theater where somebody can walk in the exit door or the movie theater that says you can't conceal carry here that's the future that's chosen or the high school that\nThere's some stairwell door is easily accessible from somebody from the outside it was just dropped off by Hoover and the guys carrying a rifle back\nAnother synagogue how does this guy get in there well Saturday morning we have congregation we have services where there should be a mechanism in place to wear a bad guy can be identified and if not stopped in his tracks at least deterred\nTo wear a good guy can get there and brings safety\nAnd sadly that's where we are\nThe idea of just open doors and everybody's welcome in somebody shoots than you know than they do know or somebody bombs and they do not know it can't be that way let's now get to a place to where we are we're in a stance that have the ability\nTo resist them reject a piece of garbage like this or the bomber all remember it's a one eight hundred and

about what is this new tax cut plan that we keep hearing about Kevin I appreciate you how are ya\nHey I'm good thanks for having me on\nYou know what what an incredible time we're living in right now I Want to get into the incredible succession the positivity that came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today I'm first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI\nShows was this idiot that sends out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what are you going yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police law enforcement work obviously this guys had a history of of problems you have a ... and then sending in threatening\nTo blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do you know this is a person that ah frankly um and I don't know what to green how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know\nHad like a low on right now we picked or they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it and again it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these ... and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and and you know I I took a A R e ... advice early on and said you know some let's stop talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady the house ways and Means Committee chair what one last thing on that um is there any changing how the media is doing this or ... demographer bomber they're calling you know for our good bomber ... that people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice and almost killed these college they didn't call him a\nSanders shooter or so why is there a double standard here and\nThere is and I will tell you a jot play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only\nA few minutes and in fact the coach after batting practice or after I took some a swing city want to take some ground or is the second I looked out\nThe was take them now I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about four minutes ahead of the shooting so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here and and and I guess my frustration is\nAll the blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often um are silent when you hear\nHillary Clinton you know urge instability or Maxine Waters Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder and began to list we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens\nThey made it happen I mean we we'd like to see them tamped down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to leave the guy who did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know it is that the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right for some people criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the region a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing the contrasting what this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished and in fact there's thirty five forty years later the media looks back in ... lovingly and and they didn't love and back then\nUm and and they're treating Trump horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds\nThis president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it's it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point what thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that to redo that the economy for decades and and ignited prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing\nA record in the courts of a constitutional judges\nFrom the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success yet the media again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair or it'd be the success that we're seeing\nWas fueled by what you came up with ... ... you worked on this night and day I remember you your jaw want to come on but I only been up two minutes and you were like you you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with a with a um a all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow and all of us every American who pays taxes got a break\nEvery American to pay taxes has a bigger paycheck many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are now manufacturing stuff here again or promising to start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that success as\nWe got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations are going to drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so repealing the tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas or manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and and and and in a period where President Obama\nThat's ...

the hell out of Mary's only on the job for a living days will have that for you to write none of the phone lines so let me say a little welcome to align one each Lisa in California I Lisa\nHi how are you I'm living the dream which I Would have\nJust calling um I actually ties into what the last caller was talking about um went shooting how how would you get that\nChurches typically forget I mean there are a whole nother story in the movie theaters and other other places church at ... ... how would you get to the church\nTake action sort out the bad guys from the gun versus the good guy with a gun and I'll tell you I'm a good guy with a guy you know and I certainly\nWhen I go to church I go to church and I take it that personal responsibility not only protect myself but anybody that might that might come under attack against the bad guy with a guy you know\nWhen I first and foremost would allow concealed carry a churches but that that's for sure I carry a gun everywhere I'm allowed to ah I live in Texas do allow to in many places but at the same time they're also signs up that prohibited from carrying my gun I think at that point if you're going to\nIf you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target\nThe simple answer is that is if you're not going to allow me to carry my garden\nAnd you should but if you're not gonna allow me to you better have protection there for my family\nAnd for me and that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever I mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say that that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun you want to to get a license for and you've gone through the classes for a and then there's no protection whatsoever\nI mean we can look at the Aurora shooting a gun in Colorado that guy quite literally avoided six other theaters in the area because they all allowed people to carry guns but once we interviewed tacked did not allow good guys like you and me to carry guns in their twelve people died\nSo we are I think that you have to work in conjunction synagogue should either allow people to conceal carry and I don't know if they do or don't I'm guessing they don't or they should they should have protections to make sure nobody gets in there with a gun I Would also close it down to one entrance annex it\nThis way anybody getting an are getting out or anybody get a good move there can be an emergency exit on the other side to get out but anybody getting into that facility\nAnd they want to cause harm you're gonna you're gonna identify them before they could pull the trigger one time\nSure I mean I guess if they can do it at Disneyland they can certainly do it at a church [laughter]\nWell they well they do it in the halls of Congress they do it at the White House so so the people that we pay to be our legislators are representatives or a president they are protected one hundred percent I've been to the White House\nYou can't get anywhere near that place until you have a full body scan so why do they do something to protect the good guys when they're out there were church synagogue school whatever they happened to be doing\nYeah as much as I don't think it's a bad idea there there are other things I think that come into play things like obviously the the economics of a full body scan for example or even a metal detector and you know those are those are those items that\nIt's not just that have an accent that the people around that and then in a church probably qualified people that are going to be there anyway you know that kind of thing but then there's training involved and right now I just feel like there is it\nLike I said it's not just I don't agree with you I I certainly think that it would be a great idea I also almost more ... think that it's not a realistic idea as much\nWell I I I think that you allow concealed carry them almost at a time if you allow concealed carry by good guys like you and me congregation members that people know and that we know have\nHave gone through the steps to get the license to be able to carry like but also you you just have a bus system where you have to be close to the to be let it I've been back ended up itself could save some lives without a doubt it's a one eight hundred vibes are all one Seventy eighty Joe ... combat\n\n\nRoles for alerts and

Sabbath\nWell yeah what was I was there for ... days it was a\nDeliberate gray days though I mean there were living amazing days come on\nLet's appreciate I had a great time you know I Wish I made a mistake and got blown out of my seat with a you know there were political reasons for that as well which I described in the book with a you know what I was there to help the president or they're loyal to the president you know I did some a\nMedia this morning I was on CNN and try and then when I say that I call the president a liar now or is it yeah\nPresident is telling the it's like that and he's covering the truth is doing it to set your hair on fire right into a finger in your eyeball 'cause he knows it's going to distract you cause you to be like a school monitor all rocker\nAnd it works every single time when you go to a CNN or MSNBC when you're walking into stores and look I've done work at CNN headline news on fifty over there I mean ... when you walk in it still feels good it's a nice organization but then you realize\nThat there is a definitive spin when you walk into that ... did you know you really get you know some some left hook from them and it's hard to get you to spend the president a certain way\nPretty much on message I think they were really hitting me that or this morning and I'm trying to sell a book they figure that could kill me with base but that's fine people that know me they know what I'm super loyal to the president to say listen I got fired Fifteen months ago if I wasn't loyal to the President Joe you would have figured it out by now uh I wrote a very colorful very funny book [noise]\nAbout my relationship with him do what do you like it like it as a guy what he's like behind the scenes and by the way that a lot of research on him and his father when they were a lot younger you know his father's obviously now deceased but I'm going to get back into the seventies\nWhen his dad was working with him and mentoring in\nWhat they were like so this was a real fun book to write a rocket called me yesterday\nOr she said that she she went through the book she read it a hundred percent but Bush said\nIt was great he couldn't wait to show it to her father Kurt\n... one of his best friend said the same thing you know 'cause I listen I I I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president two or three times when I was given my press briefing nasty bad I'm a New Yorker I have to be an Italian I like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nIt and again I'm from New York I'm an Italian ... of course short for pat and we will oh so I mean we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like everybody I've got to tell you my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so as the president of these people are fighters who come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of American certainly not the elite\nMedia in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it the you know then it there's micro aggressions Reagan president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotional feeling you could ever politically incorrect thing to say you\nAre and they want that totally sanitizing edited and God Forbid you should say something that they are offended by right there is a tiny bit of a micro aggression they started sending bottle rockets off the president place than like a Stradivarius that he does\nA ... and that's how people from queens or from my area in your area talk and I don't mean anything by it I'm ... my personality\nI agree it's embodies their and moved to the blue collar President Bill blue color president it's out now going to up his great book\nLet's go back to the media stuff because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he made tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he said he's running for president were you were surprised I've talked him seven different times he he was actually not surprised they turned on him when he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty bad got were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office and he looks at me so she's you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened I said there was a combination of things they don't they don't like your some of your policies\nAnd you know we we let Steve Bannon declare war on the media and that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took them a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right\nHe purposely like looks for a cost to now and tries to tell me your fake news ... enemy turn in a cost to eats it up he does it every time you make fools himself when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but again I bought but it was really really good pick up a time I understand what happened\nBut um when you were in that job did you think that the media would work with you\nDid you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House when the price of\nA I thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought there would be some kind of a peace offering me Jonah what Adam ... and the press I turn the lights and cameras back on that first day job we announced era\nAs a press secretary I did the first press conference and I sold ... that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team and also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the ... plant\nBut listen you know I'm accountable for the mistake I made I trusted a reporter I was having off the cuff conversation with ... everybody forgets the context to eat was being very of Secret Service and flattering to me any begging me effectively to do a profile story with him yeah\nTrail me around I was like well I'm not the ban and I'm not their self promoting myself read my use of expletives which I obviously regret\nShe loved that got it changed ran over to CNN with it right he waited he wrote this ridiculously\nIn you know exaggerated article and then he really ... you know four or five days later people looked at him like the taste sounds like\nTo normal guys from queens talking to each other right why would you do that to the guy and the answer is well we want to the ambush in to see if we can get him out of the White House ... and you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping the president so what's\nThe other one I thought so if you went back to invite but\nIf you went and checked out the pod cast after you were named I thought it was a good pick because I felt like you were a guy who wasn't ... going to be very direct you're going to be very straight with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with the ministry Asian here's a way it's going to work but you're right I think that you got suckered into a little bit there and it doesn't feel good I've had that happen to me\nBut you got you got pulled in because you're actually trust somebody something that guys like you wouldn't want to do we want to trust people\nThe age Joe I made a mistake it's dishes vibrant place down the area I didn't anticipate how bad it was a I told my Wall Street ... Thirty years on Wall street now let me tell you something the worst person on Wall street is literally the best person down there so while\nI Know how bad it is down there and it is what it is and so for me uh a lot of my book is also about that well that you know where I got up\nDusted myself off I was sort of like mayhem and they all say commercial comes with a car crash right and I told my kids watch what I Do with this thing now because we never want to do is be on your back for too long or you don't\nWant that left wing media to build a shame box for you to stand inside of\nYou want to be you and so I'm I'm fully expressing myself a lot of fun writing this book I Hope that people who go out and buy the book at ten percent as much fun reading it as a kid writing it because it was really an enjoyable thing for me to do a lot of research that\nIt's a ... and the name of the book is the blue collar president I originally go ... go get five copies give it to your friends and family it's the blue collar president a last question and I think people are dying to know the Senate but what's the relationship now with the president\nYou know I Would say it's good I mean we we we don't talk or a super ... is the part of the United states I don't feel the need to bother him a\nI had a very good conversation with them last July recording trade I put in an op ed in the s gee we had a rigorous intellectual discussion about that um and I get along I mean we I think we see the world are pretty similarly I'm and I'm not sort of em I Hope he's not sort of me for what happened\nHe seems to be a that kind of guy I right at the end of the book guys like ... I see myself a day wasn't fired Korea was fired I was fired I call this S P L Z were fired but loyal [laughter] so you know I I feel very good about the president\nIs that the one of the toughest jobs in the world I certainly didn't want to make it harder for him I was there to try and make it easier and by the way\nI'm here to help until I Do a lot of media surrogacy for the campaign a and I'm writing a lot of op eds warm state by state\nEverybody going to get this book the blue collar president it's we have to be ... you know somebody that you said earlier in the interview really stuck out and it's a you know here just Fifteen months later and you're still world for the president or his operation was out for Fifteen seconds and had a new book\nSo uh I really think that that you showed your loyalty and the fact that the fact that you could look at me look at my listeners in on what to look at my viewers and say I made a mistake\nI should have ... better and I really think I could've been ineffective guy I agree with everything that you just said I think that's also\nGot on the mistakes you make in life you're going to tell my kids that be accountable I'm not blaming anybody I'm not playing the victim and one last\nFox News I'm Debbie handling and so they say she held a news conference this morning to address the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue now left eleven people that\nWe will be here to help you through this horrific episodes will get through this dark as day of Pittsburgh history by\nWorking together they start their Dell predicted out the victims range in

to conduct interviews scribes social media review possible surveillance camera video and exploit digital media to determine how and why Bowers committed this terrible act I ask again that if you have information that may help these contests\nFox News [noise]\nCapsule and\nWell\nAn environment in the cross land Joe ... dot com Facebook Twitter Instagram email all of animal rights activists that joke if the uh the leaves radio network also\nThe blaze radio network a lot of you listening to appreciate you every single time it has your boy Joe packs a note about ... before I go to John ...\nA couple of things are important number one when you called your radio show\n'em you can't both be heard at the same time so do you make an allegation that I Want to comment on it you got stopped for a second and then I'll let you can kill you but the fact that she wouldn't have stopped talking she thought that she would win if she kept talking unfortunately for you I have the microphone and I have control of of what's being hurt at any given time I now have a decision to make\nEither both of us speak the same time and my listeners and viewers don't get to your either of us or turn you down or just hang up on you know just keep talking\nUm it's not going to be both ways now I Am a fair a guy that I'll stop and let you continue but if you gonna make allegation after about an allegation about how great CNN is and not let me respond it's not going to work\nWhen it comes to ... because there are there are a few big lives out there about Donald Trump he was trying to ban all Muslims from coming here that's not true in fact the Muslim ban or the the travel ban yes\nYes predominantly Muslim countries were involved but Ninety One percent of all Muslims around the world are allowed to come here so that's a ... an Islam and focus just not true um the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people\nAre very funny people he didn't say that what he said was it's a it's a a very loud debate a debate an emotional debate there are very there are bad people on both sides they are very fine people on both sides\nThe debate we're talking about isn't whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues of Confederate a war heroes or soldiers or leaders that's what it was about cause they're tearing down people turned up monuments because they feel like they can\nAnd they really can't it's against the law first of all and secondly it's a debate that we should have are there are good people on the side of of course the monuments should stay there it's our history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yep\nOr they're good people on the side of terror tear it down sure or they're bad people and that side absolutely so he he's ... he's not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listen to CNN and MSNBC and and the other left wing media outlets saying it over and over and drawing on and on and on and you actually believe\nThat he is a pro white supremacist guy he's not\nHe's never said anything that would that would suggest that he is and this whole thing about how we mocked disabled reporter is also ally\nYes the reporter does have some affliction where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms where I I guess he I don't know what to do with the ... it's called but I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this\nAnd when he talks as have stay like that the ... he doesn't have the full mobility of his hands at his and his forms as as most people do\nAnd the president what I guess the guy wrote something bad or report something bad about or negative about the president and he said oh look at me any sort of did his hands at a similar fashion and made you know spoken to in a certain kind of way well aid the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't ... mimicking him that way\nAnd be very good just go to you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story\nThere are are are ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before even considering running when he's on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\nSo is he ... mocking the disabled reporter\nUh beforehand was the president was he Claire boy and once he making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety when a reporter didn't do the reporting till two veteran sixteen or maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not\nSometimes he acts like a dark that way the president and he does is he is that way and he speaks that way do look at me with Donald Trump them stupid ... you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing or you're going to do your own research it independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant what hand motion to do and if you ever done that before and we're not talking about this reporter\nAnd then you make the decision but if you buy hook line and sinker with the fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong and don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV Guide to know squat an angel in New York and I know more than you\nYou may in fact at the end of the day no more than I Do but you failed any debate when you walk into thinking you're superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level of anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in this business Fifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces I gave you straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what my politics work\nSo bringing next time I get a little bit you better bring it better than that All right let me get to John Hi bushy is the guy that runs the or the Reagan pursued the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate sharia\nOn this great job\nReally glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll look wonderful but that thing behind you just got my attention it appears to be a plaintiff some short and some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nYeah well we're right here at the Reagan Library that are at fourteen at that Jen is one of the famous jets that little off the carrier or a
