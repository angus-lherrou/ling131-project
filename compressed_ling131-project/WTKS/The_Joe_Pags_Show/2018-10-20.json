com\nI needed new blind I knew I could save a ton of money if I put them in myself but I was nervous about measuring right and then installing them that's why I went to blinds dot com I heard their ads on the radio or the number one online retailer custom window coverings\nBut I still had to install them so I called them I defined consulting Carla she talked me through it all from picking the right lines to installing them class online defined consultation was free samples were free shipping was free my home looks perfect\nIt turns out I started new story this morning that nobody one what was the mega millions or was it the power I don't know what the hell when it was nobody won the billion dollar jackpot\nNow it's going to be one point six billion come into what the hell is going on one point six billion dollars if you imagine that would be nuts\nThat would be absolutely nuts are let's talk about Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren for decades has been claiming to be a Native American\nOr as I like to say American indian why am I right when it comes to American indian because the individual tribes actually call themselves Indian tribes\nIf it's okay for them it's okay for me\nShe's going to be an American Indian uh Cherokee in fact for admissions to schools for applications to jobs she she has been listed as the first woman of color to be a professor at what Harvard or Yale or something like Harvard\nShe's been making this claim but there is no verification there's no proof she's never ever given any bit of evidence to suggest that she is in fact an American Indian so the president like he's apt to\nHas been name calling her because it sounds so stupid he calls her Pocahontas I think it's funny as hell people who are offended by it are very smart and don't have a sense of humor\nYou know like Rachel does all who's white like Sean King who's white\nYou know they're both pretending to be black Elizabeth Warren it seems has been pretending to be an American Indian\nWhat's your well because my cheekbones proves that no that doesn't prove anything in fact thanks though\nSo president been calling around he said do a DNA test if you could prove to be the year in Indian or give it a million dollars or your favorite charity so she I guess it really does a DNA test gets the test back\nAnd gives the results of the Boston Globe which is a far left wing left is the outlet\n\nAnd they write this big story that she proved that she's Native American they say there is a there is a likelihood of up to one in thirty to chance or she's one thirty second Native American\nTo as little as one one thousand twenty four ths Native American\nAnd then the Boston Globe how to four hours later updated and corrected and say well\nThe most you could possibly be as one sixty fourth Native American and the least is one one thousand twenty fourth then when you look into the actual test further it turns out there was no comparison of her DNA to DNA of American Indians\nIn fact the only comparing that was done that was even close was was South American native tribes\nAnd maybe she got South American blood or maybe South American native blood\nBoth the probability is one one thousand twenty fourth is this not only didn't prove that she is a Native American this group that she's not on average the average white American\nHas more Native American blood than than Elizabeth Warren that's a fact I'm making it up as a fact she's not a ... an American Indian she's gotten benefits for pretending that she was she just thought she was going to prove the president wrong when in fact she proved herself in ...\nShe is so not American indian that the Cherokee Nation has come out and asked her to just stop now or when they did bad some left wing cable news outlet called the Cherokee Nation racist\nOr a [noise]\nChair of the Cherokee Nation is racist retelling a white woman to stop pretending to be part of their nation that's the world in which we live guy let that sink in\nThat any time you go through this week thinking that lives with Warren proved to president wrong that anybody go through this week in the sink to yourselves while she really is Native American and by the way this is not a story anybody any of us didn't even care about\nExcept for the fact that it's an abuse through lying to get benefits that were meant for somebody else but nobody was talking about this nobody cared about this and Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas herself decided I'm going to go and start this whole thing up again\nAnd you ask yourself what she's thinking nobody nobody was thinking about this or even a second yet for some reason\nWe had to have her thrust of this in our face again why decided I had to do a a a packs parity about they call it Pocahontas

a pact or you\nKnow I'm living the dream but it's it's going great today I'm ... and we've got a big debates when I was you know it's going to be Ted Cruz speaking on a Robert phrases work going himself ... for some reason I'm not sure why but that's going to happen and it's only ... tonight in that race is probably not as close as the media's pretending but we really can't take it for granted right\n[noise] let's see if they gave her a thing for granted people have to go out and they have to vote and the the amount you I hear people say to me what my guy guys Trump he's on the you know now he's on the ballot or something I could go and vote and I go please you can't think that way you have to get out and vote idiots so critically important I mean\nDo as a country we're winning I mean everything about our country is winning right our economy is on fire it's four point two percent GDP Growth three point nine percent unemployment the lowest unemployment in the history of our nation we've got three percent wage growth which is the first time wages have gone up and sixteen years\nYou know we have the largest military spending we have the largest tax cuts in history a manufacturing is coming back to our nation four one K. through the roof and small businesses are paying Fifteen Percent less in taxes than they were a year ago which is just created such tip you know financial engine\nUm I mean we are doing so incredible that's before you start talking about you know president for and what you need to be done you opioid crisis he's taking on a Supreme Court justices and\nPrescription drugs no one wants to talk about that everything that he's done to lower the cost of prescription drugs you know something that is is is so keen on his mind you I'm you know no one wants to talk about it but it it it's we're winning we're not getting ripped off by China anymore we're not getting ripped off by Mexico anymore you know we're finally negotiating good trade deals\nYou know the Chinese economy right now is you probably know better than anybody is down you know ... almost twenty five percent right right oh while America has the strongest economy that's ever hatch who's winning this thing right and and that's what he promised the American people he was going to do he promised the American people he was going to come in and he was going to win we're no longer get get used and abused in the country and\nBut people have to get out there and they have to get out and vote\nIt's er Eric Trump to sort of a president Donald Trump Jr absolutely right but I watch these races it's very very suspect how the Democrats are running what they're saying use in races across the country you remove all the advertising you're saying\nOh well what Trump gave a tax cut to his corporate buddies Ted Cruz give a tax cut to his corporate friends the top one percent of the vast majority of the tax cut everybody else got nothing ... that's not true everybody who pays taxes got a tax cut and corporations will employers got a tax cuts are all making more money some people get bonuses so\nHow do you think about the large when you see them walking around with\nHonestly they're truly some of the most dishonest people in the world I mean I I I've never seen anything like that I've never seen deception I've never seen the dishonesty of politics again this is this in a world right where business people were not we don't we don't come out of a ... a political world these people are truly the most dishonest people in the entire world I mean\nYou look at the amount of small businesses in this country right or you know dozens and dozens of millions of small businesses right all across our\nOur nation they're getting they're paying Fifteen Percent or less in taxes you look at the regulations right I mean the way he flashed regulations it's promoting manufacturing coming back and people are getting hired that's why you have three point seven percent unemployment is ... you have the lowest\nHispanic unemployment the lowest African American unemployment in history\nThe lowest female unemployment in the history you know what I mean it's it's unbelievable it's all because of of of that right and you know negotiating trade deals where ... you know this better name but you have a trade deal with with with China where\nIf you had the product to them they were charging twenty five percent twenty five fifty percent and terrorists right where they can make the same product over there they could send it to you and we were in charge of anything so I mean\nWho do you think's gonna win that battle I I mean it's absolutely unbelievably we we over tax companies we over regulate it you know companies as soon as that disappeared\nAre that the economy of this country went crazy I mean it it it it's going through the roof are they the\nStock market this morning last time I looked at it was four hundred point I mean we're doing so well as a nation and we're winning but people have to get out there people have to vote you have to realize the lies and deception\nOr some of the other side and and they do you know why because every single time they open up their four one K. you know every time they open up their paycheck or when they go to pay their taxes and they see that they have a lot more money in their pocket and they have jobs and they're they're not working two or three jobs and that they're getting pay increases\nBelieve me people read through it and um I I think we're going to see that and then they terms but again people have to go out and vote\nFor Trump to sort of president Donald Trump ulcer trumpeter national interesting about what you just said it's all a hundred percent true we've got companies that can afford to give us bonuses three to four million people go ... or give us raises millions more people got ... a small businesses are adding employees instead of flushing the with Obamacare alone\nThey slashed employees because there was a penalty if you had over fifty\nEmployees who your father made promises that he's sticking to it when it comes to the trade stuff\nCanada should no way we're going to do it then they made a deal Mexico said no way to deal with them and made a deal that you use it in a way we're going to do with them and made a deal so your dad being punished and humbled by the media over the leverage that he knew he had when it came to the terrorists and stuff like that it all works and then they don't give them the praising the back and how we're Detroit\nWell how about health care costs I mean the same thing or a or a Obamacare wrote touting Obamacare Obamacare was the greatest disaster in the world they were supposed to be able to\nKeep your doctor you're supposed to be able to keep your plane you're supposed to say twenty five hundred dollars healthcare costs you know food through the roof and that's all coming down you see all the new prescription drug um legislation that road has drastically reducing the price of prescription drugs you you you look at right to try you look at so many of these different efforts and\nJake and to me and I'm just didn't

I asked her husband this I asked the President Bush\nWhen he made the announcement I'm ... I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually do this\nWhat was your knee jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but his love for country said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process what it looked like\nYour mother in law was really going to take this stuff\nYeah I actually that all of them down and said I Want to do that in two days before the famous athlete or a day during dinner and that\nYou guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack us they'll tell lies about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it wouldn't get to this level rise up but but I said I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew\nThat my father in law can do this job he's a businessman the is do smart when it comes to negotiating you see when he's been able to do in in so many different respect what pair of trade um he's really great at that than I knew back then he would be great at it um so for me it was a hundred percent and\nAgain I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this um it it it's so much bigger than any of us but that's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president and get the tax every second of every day\nNone of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future and the country and if we can take a couple of planes and arrows here and there and the president\nOr you know take that every single day more than any of us it's totally worth it because I really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest presidents and countries that were had\nA ... roof that it's Laura Trump or her husband his or her father in law is the president ... Mbeki twenty six teams of because you've just said it was nowhere near I mean you expect to the media would come after the electric come after you guys but not like this\nAnd I understood it was just completely unexpected he said no I knew that they would probably go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice four thirty and forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper or television or radio show\nSo he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you've been in the media for a long time I've been in newsrooms for a long time as well yesterday le left but I didn't know was going to be like this so\nWhat what it was when was the realization for you in the family that this was way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I was actually still for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and\nI ... it became very frustrating for me to to work there because\nI Would be all different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things and and say hey that's not what he said you know what he said um that that was it it it was very clear wind to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for\nForever if you know he became president ... but um but certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked my unborn child\nI mean talk about it is it is so crazy but again I think it's because\nThey knew before that I'm trying to McCain president that if he got in there there was no turning back that he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their own way of life is going to come to an end so um I have to say that it is just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nYou know I Would agree with you and you guys were you have the ... family members you to my wife is Lara Trump irritates her husband and father in law courses the president of United States we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean writes the midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although\nI can say that it doesn't mean anything unless people don't vote in Texas where I should you've got Ted Cruz the incumbent who's doing an incredible job in working with your debt with your brother in law are very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being Jones from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided Texas but under the surface those you know he's a former left wing socialist disco ward you look at places like Michigan or Debbie Stabenow has been there for three decades and it's time for her to go now and you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get\nThat show that Israel's seat this
