the Margot bomber the make America great again bomber which is disgusting\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no not the case what you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him the smog bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter at the congressional baseball game the Sanders shooter even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do\nThat's also not being honest and it's not reporting the news as as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today\nWe don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\n\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's been a reporter to use a white guy with a beard\nYou know it also was reported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American this first name is Caesar or says are so he could be Hispanic as well as all sort of reports that he's a talent in Filipino\nThe media always though quick to say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman the guy who killed Trayvon Martin because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of him in in self defense he shot and killed him they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was Hispanic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is so the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can\nAnd that's what we have a Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like it's some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just the pictures the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected anything here's a guy with a ... a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican and twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made him do it according to the media\nSends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced there were really bombs but it sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people and we put return addresses armies when fake addresses on the actual sent into an area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut\nIt's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about\nTrump did this I guess there was some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact it sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump you have you were a make America great again hat you're a target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist than Islamophobia has either fall but that's OK the media school with that you're\nLate night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for\nFor ... that's okay that's perfectly fine fake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example of for example I drink sample of that\nBut the media again playing the victim in fact Jemma costs are from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment or engaged over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give that in mind\nThis is a guy whose job is supposed to be the gold and report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a cost and and and his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living so make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be under the president you don't get to tell the president what mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose who perpetrate violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy who was the shooter was in at that congressional baseball practice\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who committed violence in there on the right same thing should apply\nBut the selective reporting and there's the desire by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is and it's just a crazy person that was an aged vats irresponsible\nThat's responsible or by the way that the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's uh\nSeminal Indian is family or a family friend or a lawyer or somebody claim that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that it went by different name one name sounded Native American or an American Indian and the other one sounded Italian first they've certainly sounds Hispanic who knows what he is\nWhat we do know is he was some promoter for ...\nAnd some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the left is trying to glean from him and put it on Trump is irresponsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw is not older observant and tell us why from caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated know what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly we've got a bunch of interviews coming your way\nA bunch of interviews I might take us impulse led called ... led Charlie go I'm I'm not gonna do conspiracy theories today that that that's that stupid Charlie you can go ahead and hang up in Maryland I'm a technical I'm All right\nIn South Florida what we know these things we know that also his\nAllegedly who's the lawyer for his family I couldn't verify that was his lawyer but I'm was on NPR or something saying that he was actually Phillies actually Filipino and Italian who knows\nI don't know what I Do know\nIs the FBI says these were real devices [noise]\nThe FBI says yes\nThey were really

County Arizona he is a right they're separated by an Indian reservation but right there on the border and deals with illegal immigration all the time I Want to know how he's preparing\nFor the caravan heading this way and and what exactly it is the law enforcement is willing to or has to do as it gets here a sheriff I appreciate Joe are you\nDoing great thanks for having me on\nIllicit always appreciate it really had a good time with your at the fair get together in Washington DC got some great knowledge I have to wear my cowboy boots next time I played a shrimp um six want to do for his standing next to you but uh it was a great time and really great knowledge I Love the way you guys there in your sheriff's department\nDo the job and especially to watching you out there on live TV I saw out they're interacting with people in the community and I love the the way that you take the job on a lot of people\nI've seen police officers you know guys like this to\nWho walk around like like you know their stuff doesn't think I've seen some who I think are sometimes too lenient you seem to really have it down to who I'm going to interact with my neighbor here maybe somebody who goes to church with me or my my kids go to school together\nBut at the same time I I Can't let them go too far because then that would make it bad for the community is that kind of how you approach it\nYou know that is these are my neighbors these are people that I'm going to see at the store and these are people that I'm going to deal with in the future and ah I don't know what his wedding it's gone on in their life to put him to this point yeah so I tried to treat everybody with dignity and respect and we've tried to go in there now they escalated\nI don't have a problem escalated as well but I find that humans can attract more slide and then you can then ...\nAnd in watching you interact that again the sheriff mark lamb from ... county I've seen that I mean you walk up generally speaking to my ... unless they like get a shot somebody you walk up generally speaking very respectful and and you seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt now\nHow often do you figure percentage you can put on this where somebody will not get with the program not understand but you might actually be willing to cut them a break and they just don't shut up and they just give you a hard time and it's this whole community versus the police but\nIs there a percentage of people that you think talk their way into jail or into a ticket or something\nOh yeah I don't know what it is for most police officers I mean for me it probably about ten percent of those\nAre difficult to deal yeah ... yeah you know I'm I'm a believer in calmness and power if you walk out your calm and they can feel that they don't steal your wrapped up in your it really helps that situation go a lot smoother even if you have to rest\nIt ended up going to last but there's some people that have just like you said from the word go they're not with the program and that you can tell that immediately\nWhat I've learned from watching you would share of mark limping out County Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like lie pd and others um it is that when you walk up\nYou're generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was a but again if somebody's going to get with the program you'd probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on them and but they're also minor enough to where you could still get them home tonight I mean that you know it's kinda it's\nI didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look\nJust relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently than you think you just stay calm was work through it um and it does get us the ability to use some of that discussion but you're right and if we wanted to get back on it on a charge us to do it it really depends on on where they want to take it\nI I think that he's one of the best that we have in the country and uh if you haven't caught him on live video hopefully we'll be bill beyond their again we're going to probably talk to him again next week because of the Caribbean is getting that much closer\nAnd without a doubt his agency is gonna have to take some action to

was a cold day out there to to warm things up didn't have to lock your front door well this day and age that I don't want to police state oh a martial law that's for sure\nBut what I Do want is for

that gathers\nThe synagogue did nothing wrong so don't misunderstand me\nBut I'm at the point to where I Want where people congregate and gather to have protections in place\nUntil the point to where if you're going to have a place where people can access innocence you should have somebody there or some mechanism in place to guard against a piece of garbage like this guy is alleged to be\nI don't think that's asking too much I really don't whether it be a school\nOr a movie theater or a church or synagogue or mosque whatever happens to be there should be a put a protect a protective mechanism in place whether it's armed guards or bulletproof glass or you can't get in unless you're busting something has to happen\nBecause you can go down the list of all these places look as we're talking about soft targets the movie theater where somebody can walk in the exit door or the movie theater that says you can conceal carry here that's the future that's chosen or the high school that\nThere's some stairwell door is easily accessible from somebody from the outside it was just dropped off by the river\nAnd the guys carrying a rifle back now the synagogue how does this guy get in there\nWell Saturday morning we have congregation we ever services where there should be a mechanism in place to wear a bad guy can be identified and if not stopped in his tracks at least deterred\nTo wear a good guy can get there and bring safety\nAnd sadly that's where we are\nThe idea of just open doors and everybody's welcome into somebody shoots and you know than they do know or somebody bombs and they do

go where I was a backward\nOr just because of the fact that freedom there's a certain amount of risk that has to be taken so if if you're free to walk in and out of your synagogue yes there is a risk their however there's thousands of other synagogue that haven't been shot today\nRight oh so so so ... and no big deal that eight people died at one synagogue everybody else's saved everywhere else\nWell guess what I'm saying is um [noise] there's a certain amount of risk and the freedom to move freely like that and and it it did that and there's got to be a way to the limit the shootings however\nI well we we we don't we don't have unlimited freedom in\nThe ... we don't I mean we don't have anarchy we actually have a government you know body and we have police officers that police in than protecting serve there was a reason for that because there are laws I mean you realize that the fact that we have laws means that we don't have\nUnabated freedom right we don't have free to go kill somebody went up reading the go deal drug delivery them to go I mean still in the blink bad thing that you can do we don't have freedom to do all those things because there are laws in a in a civilized society so if it takes me an extra two seconds to get into the synagogue or into the church\nTo ensure that the guy with a gun can't get in I'm okay with that I'm Still free to go to my synagogue it just takes two seconds longer what\nSure yeah I Know we we only have the freedom to do what side to side we have three ... do you know through law but\nI I just I guess my point is that I I feel I I tend to be moving towards\nUm that it's okay to limit everybody for the sake of catching one well\nHow are we limiting everybody you know when you get on a plane are you happy that people are going through a checkpoint or not\nWell I guess well yes or no I mean it's a simple question no I I don't like it was not that long ago and there was filth\nAnd what would you like for the TSA to

so we can with Joe ... glad to have you here I hooked up with the um uh the chairman of the house ways and Means Committee the or the district\nRepublican Kevin Brady he's the guy working on tax code word human tax played with President Trump are we talking about the the the bombing suspect being arrested better just happened before we spoke and also about what is this new tax cut plan that we keep hearing about him and I appreciate you how are you\nHang on good Joe thanks for having me on\nWhat what an incredible time we're living in right now I Want to get into the incredible success in the positivity that came out of at that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today I'm first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI\nSays was this idiot that sends out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what are you going yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police and law enforcement work obviously this guys had a history of uh of problems you know a ... and then sending in in threatening\nTo blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do know this is a person that ah frankly um and I don't know what to ... how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know\nHad like a low on right now he picked or they didn't they didn't detonate I mean forget about it and again it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these ... and people up the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and and you know I I took a A R e flashes advice early on he said you know similar ... stop talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair what one last thing on that um ... is there any changing how the media is doing this or going into the ... bomber they're calling ... ... people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice and almost killed these college they didn't call him a\nSanders shooter or some ... ... why is there a double standard here and\nThere is and I would say or do I play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only\nA few minutes and in fact the coach after batting practice or after I took some a swing said he wanted to take some ground or is the second I looked out\nThe was take them now I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about four minutes ahead of the shootings so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is\nAll the blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric\nThey often um are silent when you hear Hillary Clinton urged instability or Maxine wandering Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder a media analyst we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens they made it happen\nI mean we we'd like to see them tamped down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to leave the guy that did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know it is that the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right for some people you write criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the region a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished in the fact that thirty five forty years later\nThe media looks back on a regular ... lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating Trump horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds\nThis president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it's it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point but thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that to redo that the economy for decades and and the United prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing\nA record in the courts of a constitutional judges\nFrom the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success yet the media\nAgain is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair it'd be the success that we're seeing\nWas fueled by what you came up with ... ... you worked on this night and day I remember you your Joe I Want to come on but I don't even have two minutes and you were like you you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with ah with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow and all of us every American who pays taxes got a break\nEvery American to pay taxes has a bigger paychecks many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are no manufacturing stuff you're again or promising yes to start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that success as\nWe got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing and tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas or manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and and and in in a period where President Obama\nUh keep the house like a lot of tough races in the day I Believe we do because because Republicans and conservatives are now turning out and understand\nIs not a mid term this is really about you know keeping this house the Senate
