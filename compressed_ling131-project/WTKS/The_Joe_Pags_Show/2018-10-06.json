bed laid on top of her try today are closed off put his hand over her mouth and she she got away and then and then left she says it got him or judge was in the room was playing the music loud lead running interference for Kavanaugh mark judge says wasn't there no idea what she's talking about\nHer her very good friend Leighton somebody a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else did she said was at that party has refuted the claim\nWell Christine Blasey Ford testify in front of this panel the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd leaving their left and right middle everybody's orange incredible credible witness credible which is actually untrue she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWhere she really does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple to to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house it was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party\nShe's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually give it a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nRed cabin on the other hand has everybody corroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and hope to yourself you need some help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that to a point of delineation that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and then a report that correctly the second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez\nWho says that at a party\nThey were playing some game\nThat I don't know you do to spin the bottle or it was the quarter is if they were playing something to where if you lost you had to drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk you've got to remember anything and then uh she's told wrecked Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out\nAnd put it at near her face\nThat she admittedly doesn't remember it and when Democrats staffers from the Democrat senators that are on that panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed something happened to me\nYou remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six day she decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it to his cabin ourself with no there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer ... this is Julie sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys are taking in gang rape\nKavanaugh and judge she said would spike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happened between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party joins ten of them and I said that he too she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nBut continued go into the parties for the another full year\nAnd instead of calling the police which she said was just don't drink the punch\nShe changed her story to NBC News at least once\nNBC News instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable that ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the story she originally told us her story has changed a bunch of times in her history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lay heat that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to ... they didn't didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\nHe was he's\nGuilty Cory Booker grow because you know it causes all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he grow up to a girl he he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he made that\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process it as in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent nothing any of these\nWomen has said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resists lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people\nJulie sweat Nick just choose to be a ... from outer space story she's given and received Ford only vase say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent five days\nSix days interviewing many more people in Cuba who didn't come to the Bush has offered up evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today go on Twitter\nRead your favorite website they still today have these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls ... ... people which means are putting out their information their their phone numbers or addresses\nIt say a violent crew of idiots better still just completely disconnected from the rest of us would listen to the lotto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nA ... for your flakes lakes lake I did go to just go and play play but I'm going to call it 'cause my ... am I going to do that but there you go a little some something for your thoughts on what's going down on what's happened so far and\nAnd again we do the show before a vote would have been taken on Saturday So or to keep a close eye on that there are a couple of big monkey wrench that can be thrown in you got this guy deems a believe a Montana\nWhose daughter is getting married today\nAnd as the father of five daughters I'm with a [noise]\nHe's got to be at his daughter's wedding we that's got to happen\nSo he's a Republican and he's a yes vote for Kavanaugh will he be there when the vote happens\nIf they have fifty that's enough because they've got my sense for me to tie breaker\nVery very interesting to me\nThis is going to go down I Want to know where you are on this especially if you're on the left [noise]\nIf you

enrolled it all really started with Diane Feinstein sitting on this letter that she had for two months you realize that Dianne Feinstein the ranking member of the ... member bunch then you realize that she had this letter\nEven when she was talking to Brett Kavanaugh privately in her office didn't say a word\nHad a letter when she was questioning Brett Kavanaugh I'm In the open to hearing didn't say a word when it looked as though Brett Kavanaugh was going to be fast track because he's easily qualified for this job then suddenly somebody in her office or some lawyers somebody leaked to the fact that there was a letter and with the woman's name was\nSo no matter what you think of Christie love before she was a victim year two of the left politics eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty let me go to the phone lines to see where you are on this 'cause we're either a country divided or it could work country galvanized I think this was just\nAn absolute practice in futility for the left and I think that it\nProbably served to motivate those on the right I think you'll see a lot more conservatives and Republicans now\nGo to any centrist that lean right go to the polls for the midterm whereas they might have said sat at home before I think the Republicans will gain two or three seats in the Senate and we'll keep control of that body ah it's still going to be very close in the house but we have a better chance now because now the bases riled up\nThis was a really bad miscalculation by the left of this country the political left let me go to the phone lines and say hello to uh Roger who's in Spokane Roger what's going on high\nEnron and go hey I think lake lake is appropriate name thank you and you\nWere in favor of that and I'm really disappointed in every ... getting all that ... stronger during the early process\nThat I'm even more upset with the Democrats in the ... and ... not a and get your act together and that he truly representative and not\nGetting crap and\nAnd get very disappointed in the whole process and that will happen to be elected in ... the green court justice\nRoger I think it's a very good point the Republicans were very weak to the beginning venture with a call by the way I'm very weak in the beginning they ... they wanted to keep decorum they wanted to keep it all up and up and I and I can appreciate that but when the hearings started let's go back to that a month ago\nAs soon as grassy started speaking Kamala Harris interrupted him rudely all this fake outrage about how cabinet interrupted Feinstein and some others because he was fighting for his political and personal life and for his family Kamala Harris purposely\nInterrupted him yet Cory Booker purposely interrupted him\nI think ... started\nThere were ... ... it was it was set up that you had protesters that there are some pictures out there that suggests they were getting paid to go to the chamber of protest so all this fake outrage about Brett Kavanaugh on it and his ... and his temperament is that it's all big ass\nBut I agree with you the Republicans a grassy I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have consequences\nWe won were in charge of this can be I Will clear this rule would be given interrupting then it would ... would proper protocol is when they were breaking it on purpose us they really thought they're putting on a show which somehow window for them he turned out it made them look like idiots well be it used to that they are Clyde in Lexington, Kentucky iCloud what's going on\nYour back thank you very much for taking my call really you're not a I think the Democrats are definitely oh now they're getting worse and not just getting worse and worse and try to take that man down it get it very frustrating\nTo the other thing is I Can't understand how anybody could think that pointing a finger at a man\nNext thing guilty and you got a list of the best shot if that's true but that's why the court case and I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy obviously has a lot of classes that very well rounded young man I call and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill\nBut ice he he he's just a great guy and I hate to think that people think that our justice system is going to come down to just pointing the finger

with Joe pads we go back to the phone lines and say hello and welcome to a Christie in Carson City Nevada Christie what's going on\nOh lots of stuff going on [laughter] on TALK to me I just\nFind it very very hypocritical that here were interviewing this man to be a um fair and fair\nAnd honest person to decide that ... court cases where we find it very strange when he gets extremely angry when he's accused of these baseless crime\nI'm both a a survivor I Will never said victim survivor of a sexual assault more than one [noise]\nUm I was in law enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and we let\nOff allegations like the um Dr Ford may have been assaulted but there is nothing that was ... and if we let women like this come forward and do this kind of damage to manage reputation it's actually going to set back women testifying by decades\nUm I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked and it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term crime rate because women have notoriously done at when they've been scorned or that\nOr or many other things and the fact that we would want this that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh\nWho surprisingly enough he's now in the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before now it's it's just a political smear campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they are becoming more socialist\nI have a friend that would actually grew up in Argentina and came here and became a citizen and she is\nA hard core Republican and and try to explain to people what it's truly like to live in a socialist country we don't want to go that way that\nI just find it so hypocritical that here we're examining this person for a job in a court where he's supposed to be fair right we get that when he showed his emotions when he's being attacked unjustly\n... you couldn't be more correct it'd be ... something one of the most dogs there are things I've ever seen and then be charges no going be fair and and liberal hinted about this I'm Sorry but I'm Sorry that happened to you and I'm Glad that you're a survivor and you're not looking at yourself as a victim no I I Wonder\nDo you remember the details of what happened to you because this was lousy boar doesn't remember anything\nDoes that mean you just all the victims\nThe survivors that I've ever spoken with have remembered every book\nWhere she lost me one of my I had a a less traumatic incident when I was fourteen and where she completely lost me I'd written single parent household with that there were six cats when I was fourteen I had something like that happening any I didn't tell my mom right away\nBut I wouldn't leave her side for men right that when she first started to live with me was when she said that they went to the grocery store and she wanted to go on a separate entrance just weeks later when after she almost died than the fact that she had the physical composure to say Hi\nTo someone that was in that room when I saw my attacker when I was Eighteen and was it was a home invasion I was raped and my home at gunpoint front of my family when I saw him in court I became physically ill I couldn't look in the eye and tell us to identify him\nBut I became physically ill and I have a horrible memory my family laugh about it all the time they'll say to me mom don't you remember an off a that was your first mistake\nBut I can remember what I was wearing every single detail and both times every single detail there's nothing that isn't completely clear and cemented in my memory\nAnd I just I found her not credible with regard to cabinet and I honestly I hate data that I find her not credible I'm trying to be as open minded as possible because I was in law enforcement and I know ... ... oh my God on her is now\nShe's back in ... I'm with you but but you you and I both know that the the left said well here's what we're going to do with laws for no matter what she says\nThe word we're going to use as credible to everybody that we talked to and we're going to force them to all repeat credible because then the the watching and listening public will will agree\nBut she was credible but around with you and I\nAnd I should Israel you on me I Believe that maybe she was a victim of something or survivor or something I don't think anything she said about Brett Kavanaugh was in fact credibility but that was the wrong usage about words and that's\nWhere I was I mean and I was attacked because I said but what so what I mean I saw when I saw or heard what I heard and even her best friend doesn't corroborate that tells me something\nWell and and I what blows me away is how much I have personally been attacked\nBy either survivors probably all the victims\nBecause they've allowed it to victimize that likes to write a book me away as I had a guy friend that I grew up with that I Can't\nBelieve with your history Dr ...

they've never seen a positive data point that they have it ignored enough and I guess I'll start they'll start down ever\nCovering this economy Joe if God Forbid it ever starts to go down but even if all the numbers you already know the low unemployment numbers among\nAfrican Americans in Asian Americans in Hispanic Americans and women and teenagers and veterans and\nAnd the growth rate is up but even today but it was very little coverage anywhere but there was an estimate of one hundred and eighty five thousand new private sector jobs created for the last month and it said it was two hundred and thirty thousand\nSo the wages are up the job availability up people feel mobile they can move around and find a better job closer to home maybe with better health care and retirement benefits and

anybody that Donald Trump nominate joy Supreme Court are certainly not going to find their way to supporting judge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen certainly\nNot after the testimony they demanded to happen and so they should just be honest about what this is this is about destroyed destroying a man's life because he he was nominated by Donald Trump this is about the laying and keeping that seat open pass in terms of not three twenty twenty and Americans had it\nAmericans are smart and they're watching this process people are disgusted by the process Christine

and the majority of the other Republicans I gave her that I bet you're right they're talking about ice and beer this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the process of folks like

oath privately and in California well it ever having a kind of washing either\nForeign lied under oath that she didn't know that or her lawyers failed to tell her and it's fair to tell us you know there are no cameras and cleaned lights in private testimony in California there's no Washington based\nObsessive media right to to to go and cover every jot until and a new client base for them
