confirmed as the next Supreme Court justice but some Democrats are hinting they'll continue to try to learn more about the sexual misconduct allegations against him\nPush on the bed laid on top of her try to dig are closed off put his hand over her mouth and she she got away and then and then left she says the guy to be more judge was in the room was playing the music loudly and running interference for Kavanaugh mark judge says wasn't there no idea what she's talking about\nHer her very good friend late somebody a girl should I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else but she said was that the party has refuted the quite\nWell Christie lousy Ford testified in front of his panel the say the Judiciary Committee\nAnd leaving bear left and right middle everybody's ... credible credible witness credible which is actually drew she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWe're surely does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple to to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house would was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually give it a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand has\nCorroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was\nEvery weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she gets built CDs and help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that's a a point ability Asian that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and then to report that correctly\nThe second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez who says that at a party\nThey were playing some game\nThat I don't know he was due to spin the bottle or is it was a quarter as they were playing something to where if you lost you had a drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk she's going to remember anything and then uh she's told Brett Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out\nAnd put it in near her face\nNow she admittedly doesn't remember it\nAnd when Democrats staffers from the Democrat senators that are on the panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed\nSomething happened to me you remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six day she decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it so which Kavanaugh said no there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one\nIs from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity is Julie sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys partake in gang rape\nCabinet and judge she said which bike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happen between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party she wants ten of them and activity to she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nBut continued going to the parties for the another full year\nAnd instead of calling the police which she said was just don't drink the punch\nShe changed her story to NBC News at least once NBC News instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable\nThey rented anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the stories you originally told us her story is changed a bunch of times in history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lady that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to tune it didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because in the clubs all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he wrote the girl he he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he meant it\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanize this as a people we said that's not fair due process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent nothing any of these women has said\nOr the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resist lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a nutty from outer space story she's giving\nAnd of course the Ford\nOnly they say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent five days six days interviewing many more people in Canada who didn't come to ... offer of evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today going Twitter read your favorite website they still today have these paid\nProtesters showing up in the Senate halls their dock sing people which means are putting out their information their their phone numbers their addresses\nThe say a violent crew of idiots that are still just completely disconnected from the rest of us Melissa mulatto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh they're still attempting they're still exempting these days are rapist serial rapists about her rapist on the court it's it's a disgusting this way\nThey are trying their best to change the best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to be in Saudi Arabia or something or China\nCome on man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do a show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen between now and then and and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an alleged Republican from Alaska\nWho is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today\nAnd she the reason she gave was he's a good man just not the right guy for the job right

that's one vote for you as I'm Me so I'm going to say yes as well but it's up to you guys are\nAt Joe talk show on Twitter you got to follow me on Twitter or else it gives you notifications have got it set up to our cutesy trolls just you know saying he'd things to be so again at Joe talk show a lot of people want to be heard um this confirmation process has been disgusting\nIt really has been enrolled at all really started with Diane Feinstein sitting on this letter that she had for two months you realize that Dianne Feinstein the ranking member of the ... member bunch then you realize that she had this letter\nEven when she was talking to Brett Kavanaugh privately in her office didn't say a word\nHad the letter when she was questioning Brett Kavanaugh I'm In the open hearing didn't say a word when it looked as though Brett Kavanaugh was going to be fast track because he's easily qualified for this job then suddenly somebody in her office or some lawyers somebody leaked to the fact that there was a letter and with the woman's name was\nThe matter what you think of Christie loves before she was a victim your two of the less politics eight hundred\nFive zero one Seventy eighty let me go to the phone lines to see where you are on this 'cause we're either a country divided or it could work country galvanized I think this was just\nAn absolute practice\nIn futility for the left and I think that it probably served to motivate those on the right I think you'll see a lot more conservatives and Republicans now\nGo to and even centrist that lean right go to the polls for the midterm whereas they might have said sat at home before I think the Republicans will gain two or three seats in the Senate and we'll keep control of that body it's still going to be very close in the house but I didn't have a better chance now because now the bases riled up\nThis was a really bad miscalculation by the left in this country the political left let me go to the phone lines and say hello to uh Roger who's in Spokane Roger what's going on high\nIn line and go hey I think clay clay is appropriate name thank you and you know\nWe're in favor of that and I'm really disappointed in every other than that they cannot stronger during the early process\nThat I'm even more upset with the Democrats in there and sit in their ... not a and get your act together and that he truly representative and not\nGetting this vote crap and and get very disappointed in the whole ... thing that we have and that needs to be elected the next ... court justice\nRoger I think it's a very good point the Republicans were very weak in the beginning venture for the call by the way I'm very weak in the beginning they just they wanted to keep decorum they wanted to keep it all up and up and I and I can appreciate that but when the hearings distorted let's go back to that a month ago\nAs soon as grassy started speaking Kamala Harris interrupted him rudely you know all this fake outrage about how cabinet interrupted Feinstein and some others because he was fighting for his political and personal life and for his family\nKamala Harris purposely interrupted him yet Cory Booker purposely interrupted him I think lower started\nThey were ... ... it was it was set up that you had protesters that there are some pictures out there that suggests they were getting paid to go to the chamber of protest so all this week outrage about Brett Kavanaugh on it and his ... and his temperament is that it's all BS\nBut I agree with you the Republicans a grassy ... I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have consequences we won were in charge of the city I Will clear there's room if you keep interrupting\nThan it would ... would proper protocol is where they were breaking it on purpose\nBecause they really thought they're putting on a show which somehow waiting for them he turned out it made them look like idiots will be it used to that they are Clyde in Lexington, Kentucky I applied what's going on\nYour back thank you very much for taking my call really you're at it uh I think the Democrats are definitely oh now where they're getting worse and got him on that just getting worse and worse and they try to take that man down it it it's\nVery frustrating or the other thing is I Can't understand how anybody could think that Corning crying or at a man next and guilty\nAnd you got to live for the most out if that's true but that's why the court case and I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because that guy obviously had a lot of classic that very well rounded young man I\nCall and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill but ice he [noise] he he's just a great guy and I hate to think that people think that our justice system is going to come down to just pointing the finger and you're automatically guilty we have due process in this

go back to the phone lines and say hello and welcome to a Christie in Carson City Nevada Christie what's going on\nOh a lot of stuff going on [laughter] you bet on TALK to me I just\nIt very very hypocritical that here were interviewing death man to be a um fair and fair and honest person to get tied to print in court cases right we find it very strange when he gets extremely angry and when he was a kid in the face with crime\nI'm both a a survivor I Will never have that then survivor of a sexual assault more than one [noise]\nUm I was in law enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and we lack\nA validation like the um Dr Ford may have then I felt it but there is nothing compared that with Kavanaugh right if we let women like that come forward and get it kind of damage to announce reputation it's actually going to set back women have to find like decades\nUm I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked and it was because of women that come forward I mean that's why we have that term crime rate\nBecause women have notoriously gun at when they've been scorned or that or or many other things and the fact that we would want to do that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh who surprisingly enough he's now in the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before now it it's just that\nThe mayor campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they're becoming more socialist I have a friend that was actually grew up in Argentina and came here and became of that if she is\nA hard core Republican and and try to explain to people what it's truly like to live in a socialist country\nWe don't want to go that way but I just find it so hypocritical that here we're examining the person for a job in court where he's supposed to be fair right we get it that when he showed his emotions when he's being attacked unjustly\n... you couldn't be more correct I mean he's used facing something one of the most dogs there are things I've ever seen and then be charges know going to be here and and liberal hinted about this I'm Sorry but I'm Sorry that happened to you and I'm Glad that you're a survivor and you're not looking at yourself as a victim no I I Wonder\nDo you remember the details of what happened to you because this was a lousy for doesn't remember anything\nDoes that mean you just all the victims the survivors that I've ever spoken with have remembered every book\nWhere she lives with me one of my I had a a less traumatic incident when I was fourteen and where she completely lost me\nI'd written single parent household with that there were six cats when I was fourteen I had something like that happened I mean I didn't have my mom right away but I wouldn't leave her side for Matt right that\nWhen she first started to lick me was when she said that they went to the grocery store and she wanted to go on a separate entrance just weeks later\nWhen after she almost died than the fact that she had the physical composure cafe I\nHad someone that was in that room where I found my attacker when I was Eighteen and was it was a home invasion I was raped and my home at gunpoint front of my family when I saw him in court I didn't ... L I couldn't look in the eye and tell us and I kinda find him\nBut I became ill and I had a horrible memory my family laugh about it all the time they'll say to me mom don't you remember an off a that was your first name\nBut I can remember what I was wearing\nEvery single detail and both times\nSingle detail there's nothing that isn't completely clear and men in my memory\nAnd I guess I found her not credible with regard to cabinet and I honestly I hate data but I find her not credible I'm trying to be as open minded as possible because I was in law enforcement and I know ... right my got on her is now she's\n... and ... but but you you and I both know that the left said well here's what we're going to do with ... no matter what she says the word we are going to use as credible to everybody that we talked to and we're going to force them to repeat credible because then the the watching and listening public will will agree\nBut she was credible but I agree with you and I should Israel yawn me I Believe that maybe she was a victim of something or survivor or something I don't think anything she said about Brett Kavanaugh was in fact credible in fact that was the wrong usage about words and that's where I was I mean and I was attacked because I said that what so what I mean I saw when I saw or heard what I heard\nAnd even her best friend doesn't corroborate that tells me something\nWell and and I was away at how much I have personally been attacked\nBy writers survivors ... victims\nBecause they've allowed to victimize that likes me away as I had a guy friend that I grew up with that I Can't\nBelieve with your history that fully her I wouldn't be doing a complete disservice if I get\nI I agree we we have to run great phone call I appreciate you taking the time\nMe that somebody who really gets it\nWe come back we'll be Donald Trump junior here on the weekends vigor\nRadio Ninety seven seven to twelve ...\nMessage indeed ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors\nAll on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

Africa Deborah yeah of course we expect Obama to be able to fix anything you haven't done anything\nIt turns out you know ...\nDone anything you'd never had any experience there was no way and we should expect him to be able to fix anything economically guess what my father has done that he has built businesses yeah he didn't build that\nAnd so it shouldn't be a shock to people that were able to turn that around and now the Democrats won a reversal of that they want to take everything into one eighty why because we have all time historic lows for blacks and unemployment\nFor Hispanics for women you you want to reverse all that I mean if the Democrats the don't ask Donald Trump came out today in favor of oxygen\nDemocrats would be against it I mean that's their policies\nJust hate but we have to show up we have to stay on the fight because people's they've done I Love your dad doing it's so great it's amazing it's\nYou know but as I say well how are you voting for who your congressman they are voting for November what do you mean what is November right they're not in a way they want to vote and twenty twenty but they don't realize that it can all go away in twenty Eighteen they don't realize that Donald Trump is on the ticket in twenty Eighteen Donald Trump is on the ticket in six weeks\nSo we got to get out we got to mobilize if you like what's going on and\nMake sure the fight for it because the other side I don't know what they're motivated by I don't even know what their platform there's other than by you'll hate and outrage I mean you know what they are outraged that they should be outraged about their platform and their failures over the last few decades but they are outraged about something else but they are turning up we got to turn up I see it all the time they're like no no\nNo the same fake news media that said Donald Trump can't win is saying that he's going to lose now\nBelieve it I see the numbers you got to\nGet out you got to stay on we can't just be fat happy in lazy and expect that stuff to continue he needs he needs guys like Ted Cruz got any guys like ... to all of the congressional people in Texas that are up he need those guys helping him he can't do it by himself he imagined giving the house Nancy Pelosi\nSeries like is there a question I think about it I mean\nI Would be a disaster for this\nCountry because we got to turn around and we've got to bring our friends\nIt's trending on drugs today to ... I'm going to be the speaker again it's Donald Trump junior and ah we we always appreciate the time a couple of things they didn't realize that your dad had the magic wand the whole time we didn't want\nIt was common sense and experience right you know this isn't a magic wand it's just\nYou know you can't expect a community organizer to ... understand let alone actually affects your weight real change when it comes to economic our fiscal policy by on fiscal but I think about it we we've discussed the economy I Know him what about foreign policy\nI look at the end you look at the Israeli embassy you look at what's going on in North Korea that took guts fine you know we don't just draw red line in Syria like Obama did when they crossed that they slap you in the face will they they tried doing that and we should put fifty seven Tomahawk missiles in there and guess what the rest of the world was watching\nOkay we were not going to let people take advantage of something whether it's trade deals got NAFTA it can't be renegotiated\nCan be done and congratulations Mexico and Canada now on board done when when you have a real leader\nI Wish that we had somebody in journalism in journalism is dead known him and he says is all the time too but it didn't go on one person steps up and says\nFormer President Obama just told me one thing you did that caused this to happen because how you take credit for it if you look your dad when one eighty on everything Obama did and fix the ... how can Obama even for a second even think to himself yeah I did that because we're not\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and that's why we all have to get out because we're fighting with one arm to arms to arms and a leg it feels like at times because the media look like I said oh no this is the new normal one point eight percent what doesn't that doesn't have to be why why would the New York times back him up on that front because they needed to make him a success because they all believe in the asinine policies you see that\nI mean look at what's going on in fact that in bed or August putting up a challenge I mean Beto O'Rourke and run for mayor of New York city and be on the left side of the ticket\nI mean that's the only way\nYou know his his money's coming from all places other than Texas\nBecause you know those are our tax that the values that he espoused or you know the attacks on law enforcement want to eliminate ice in the ... I mean I've only saved nine hundred kitten last year from you know a sex trafficking but there are terrible we should get rid of them I mean these people are insane and so we have to get out we have to stay motivated we have to bring our friends\nAnd you can't buy into the media stuff just look at what's going on in your business is look at what's going on your place of work with your paycheck I mean you're winning with these policies these policies are moving the needle these policies are making a difference in America's getting respect again because we're not going to let little third world countries push us around and slap us around\nYou know I have a ... and\nWe have to remember that because they can all go away in November\nAnd people need to realize that it's Donald Trump junior and I appreciate the access let's talk about Texas I as you know based in San Antonio Fifteen stations in Texas we've got a hundred and twelve around the country but we focus now on Texas because it was ... or ... challenge Robert Francis awoke is what I call news somehow cold really appropriating but he's Hispanic and he's\nNot he's not at all that spending and he'll pretend he is for the road but that's a democratic ... you can get away by the way if Ted Cruz did something like that now he happens to actually be Hispanic something but if it's something like that they would destroy ... absolutely you you you got out of every day for better or it's not a problem\nWhen he said something about what was the voluptuous breast or whatever that that's not a problem that only one day story of Ted Cruz did that right it it would be you know he should be disbarred he should be you know write it killed ...\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and there's down ticket races that are dependent on this thing has been great for Texas He's done he's fought for those values I look at them you know ... platform and like I said I mean this is in New York City mayoral candidate running for senator in Texas\nWell he's getting big support from Ellen so you know that's good it was like oh this is Donald Trump junior so you're in Texas you got Ted Cruz who I've known for ... wait longer than he's been a senator and he's always made promises that he's always done exactly what he said he would do what's the best thing is your dad and went out in the primaries but they're very very similar politically in that they're not\nDoing it politically based say I'm going to do this this this this moves and your dad and Ted actually believe I should do those things I promise bigger it was just given as you know a rainbows and puppy dogs it's weird well of\nCourse I wasn't I I really respect that I mean was it was a brutal primary and a little story I don't know if I'd actually even said this publicly but ... you know a couple of weeks after that and it was a brutal primary there was\nA big AI dinner in DC you know the usual lead on this stuff I I went uh and\nYou know all my friends are from Texas I'm there all the time hunting fishing or raised a lot of money during the campaign down in Texas I'm sitting there at the Texas table and a couple of friends ... at the table and we actually have a great dinner good conversation at the end of the dinner and we say hey\n... you know we're going back to the Trump Hotel right in the middle of the AC on Pennsylvania Avenue we're gonna have a couple of drinks hanging out whatever you want to come along\nIt came with us and ... and the Trump Hotel we had a great time for three hours\nNice that got you know but you know when I showed me beyond\nThe guts if he understood Donald Trump going to be president and he was going to help support policies that he believed in that we're going to be good for America and they were going to be good for tax and he was able to put all of that aside and now they have a great relationship\nBecause they're doing what's right for their constituencies and that was impressive to me that was a great\nA testament to his character and everything and I don't think I've ever told that story before but I think it's actually relevant or because you're doing what's right for your constituency and I don't see that everywhere else I mean again look at where ... money is probably coming from that probably doesn't represent the average guy in Texas right now that\nProbably represents the average guy in a Hollywood studio somewhere else you know that's the difference and I don't want Texas to become California\nTexas and I mean just look at the economic success if it had to look at all this debt but you want to become California give me a ...\nAnd the people from California bringing their politics but that doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's Donald Trump junior you have an opinion as to why anybody would listen to I'm going to take away your tax cut ...\nI'm going to lower your paycheck we're going to open the border we're going to get rid of arguments and forcing the border in every single week they're either catch agreements Thirteen or stopping sex trafficking why would anybody want new blows you to be in charge against things are going so great right now why you have no idea but like I said we're we're not in a fair fight\nYou know the media will show business low right thing to do I'm all for taking care of other people once we take care of our own problems but we've got plenty of friends we got a disastrous education system would what twenty eight and like the world after\nA long list of third world countries to the gym and half of you know to spend that I have spent the a small fraction of what we spend per capita right I mean we had we had that problem that we're working on fixing and they're making great progress with all of those things but like we need to keep going\nAnd you're going to have people in there that basically the next two years until twenty twenty you will be a total stalemate nothing will get done it'll be a total disaster\nI Want to keep this winning going for another six years so we need people in the house my father can't do it by himself\nI bought\nA check that out if if that's true that it's definitely a done deal because you you you'd hate to see things Mrs daughter's wedding I'll check it out I'll see if I could find something on\nA very interesting to go on what you do and see what we can find obviously you want me to check all

cabinet Bette Davis and what was going on the economy as well but the germs coming up a ... to me it was inappropriate for a time at any time of year and wants to come out to be honest with you know we actually when I used to do it for going on a\nOn television and radio in the desert or met Kellyanne Conway probably eleven or twelve years ago she was on TV show\n'em back then so we've been friends for a long time about killing and I appreciate you how are you\nI'm wonderful how I'm doing great you know I started out when I answered the phone I used to manage Missouri and that you actually very positively or do you know really glass bowl right\nFor me I'll leave that Kavanaugh had last week when I wake up on the guy had and now All right I'm sure it kind of live in kind of getting a fantastic job\nAnd keeping us peaceful and prosperous some you can ... you can't argue with the jobs numbers which I think is why the mainstream media refused to cover them they've never seen a positive data point that they have it ignored enough and I guess I'll start they'll start down ever\nCovering this economy Joe if God Forbid it ever starts to go down but even if all the numbers you already know the low unemployment numbers among\nAfrican Americans in Asian Americans in Hispanic Americans and women and teenagers and veterans and and the growth rate is up but even today but it was very little coverage anywhere\nBut there was an estimate of one hundred and eighty five thousand new private sector jobs created for the last month and it said it was two hundred and thirty thousand so the wages are up the job availability up people feel mobile they can move around and find a better job closer to home maybe with better health care and retirement benefits and that's what freedom looks like the deregulation agenda\nThat the twenty eight or so judges on the United states circuit courts and of course justice Gorsuch and and\nPerhaps soon followed by justice capital\nIt's Kellyanne Conway a closer to the president are going to tell you you're in by the way she was also the woman that\nThe president says really the reason why you want to win the election and I agree with that when we talk about ... they couldn't make anything that that they brought him early on as you said\nThey couldn't get him on the marriage now let's go back and find out who he ... you know it might have started the auto was back when he was fourteen now the guards who abuse device allegedly somebody at a bar after\nYou'd be forty cultured revisions ... was already I mean they really have nothing to do would be of no where to stop the guys who was mumbled sitting behind him in the far left\nWing resist lawyer that's helping out\nYou know some of these witnesses I mean when you step back just for a second and take a look at it\nThey weren't going to be okay with everybody were there\nAnd they're not they're also not going to those who have said that they oppose anybody that Donald Trump nominee joy Supreme Court are certainly not going to find their way to supporting\nJudge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen certainly not after the testimony they demanded to happen and so they should just be honest about what this is this is about destroyed destroying a man's life\nBecause he he was nominated by Donald Trump this is about the laying and keeping that seat open pass in terms of not three twenty twenty and Americans had it\nAmericans are smart and they're watching this process\nPeople are disgusted by the process Christine Blasey Ford has Dianne Feinstein a Democrat is due to blame that she is now a household name a recognizable everywhere because they're the ones who smoked out her identity she asked to remain anonymous they did it by sitting on it by dropping it and after the twelfth our had told and\nWhat for the Republicans lousy Ford may not have ever had a forum\nTo testify under oath it's the Senate Judiciary committee and the majority of the other Republicans I gave her that um but you're right they're talking about ice and beer this week and\nSo that's probably a positive sign we respect the process you folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um expand the supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six\nVetting on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed this last July which is on the desk of every senator\nSo we'll see what happens but if you're if you're a few of those red state Democrats Joe pads you're really nervous today because you're caught between a on one hand your Democratic Party drifting so far to the left towards socialism and toward destruction and resistance an obstruction and delay and and\nAnd stop sign as a symbol of your party\nAnd you're stuck between that and the will of your own people right because West Virginians\nAnd and ... and who's yours in Indiana and certainly people
