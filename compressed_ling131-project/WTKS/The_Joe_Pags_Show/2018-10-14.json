packs led to have\nYou long for the ride so talking about a ride the stock market as we took a bumpy ride some say a roller coaster some say just went straight down I'm the president calling the fed logo\nI guess I guess that's the issue I'm not even sure what that means but whenever the financial markets thing or financial question I always go to my friend Doug Adler use the managing director and senior vice president of investments ruby dreams of associates or Doug I always appreciate it how's it going brother\nJoe I'm great thank you so all the president has to say that the fed is logo\nAnd that we get eleven hundred points to the negative on the stock market people obviously you're freaking out some of them are dug you know me I think we stock market is a slot machine anyway some but I don't really worry about it my four oh one K. still looks great today um but people are freaking out about can you point to one thing that made this happened ... conglomeration of things\nYeah I think it's a conglomeration of things Joe it what's always interesting about the market is\nThings that we know that are potential headwinds the market looks at it stares at it shrug it off drugs it off and then suddenly it matters I think what's kinda manifested here as we know that the Federal Reserve is on this trajectory of raising interest rates so\nWhat does that really at the end of the day designed to do cool off the economy so that brings into question next year twenty Nineteen what earnings look like\nTrade or China looks like a tough a a photo if you will and in this regard so that's problematic we've had a few companies a pre announce their earnings which don't didn't look necessarily great\nOil has gone up the you know that's I'm up to Seventy five now it's pulled back the last couple of days like everything towards Seventy but still it's a much higher than it was Eighteen months ago I had went on the economy should have some of these things that no those have all been there but suddenly they mattered and people that sell button\nDo do you have an opinion it's Doug handler managing director senior vice president over at the gym and associates you have an opinion as to why the fed would want to cool off the economy\n[noise] well they have this in a state it inflation target of two percent going here and then when you start to she\nMentioned oil as an example there's other places we can point to that are that are showing some inflationary pressure which is part and parcel of course to a stronger economy in this economy as much stronger than it was when President Trump took office you're getting some of those pressures\nFed tries to stay in front of that because you you it's kind of like a you know the old porridge three little bears story they don't want it too hot or too cold and want to just right and so they're trying to\nDo that meaning a slow things down into that sweet spot where we have reasonable growth but maybe that's three percent with reasonable inflation which they're they're Damien to be two percent so that's that's why they're doing it\nIs it rational or reasonable Doug I heard today somebody may mentioned that there's a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the midterm election if the if the Trump ... tank and he's ... he didn't work all the tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational to think the politically people can make this happen\nUm that that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um think about it if you're on that side of the political ledger you're kind of hurting yourself right if you are right except for things go down I don't see that yeah\nOkay uh each they'll gambler he's managing director of the vice president of a investments of regimes that associates so as we watch this you know Obama when he was an office let me talk to you about this before we started so he doesn't pay attention to the daily dry rations of the stock market or when it wasn't doing so great in in what he was doing great he said look how great I Am I'm\nThis of course the left politically is saying well see the bubbles burst for you know sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now they've been sending the bubbles going to burst\nThis can't continue like this do you think this is something temporary and it will correct itself again or are we seeing that maybe you do get too big for its britches\nYeah no I I think so investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people you think it's a bull market or bear market and they have an opinion based on how they feel about things but\nReally what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this fed some deregulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive we have an economy that had been held back because the consumer\nAnd then very low in terms of their confidence in the outlook All right now and this is actually right we're at twenty year high something like that in consumer confidence I think last week we hit an all time high since Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence so when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet\nAnd in that regard I have to tell you this is really for found two things first one is debt service so that's just simply\nWhat comes in and income a into a household and then what goes out for a ... student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income and go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies and household networks in this country such assets minus liabilities\nIt's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nWell it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better salesman they've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat\nAnd the guys are are you

media would yes that Sarah Palin\nThe former governor of Alaska and also the former Republican nominee for vice president of the United states it was very interesting how it happened and in a shorter tell the story in the interview we were able to connect and or do you hope you're watching as well as listening and if you're not go back to the live stream later and watch it because the scenery behind her is beautiful in Alaska\nBut a ladies and gentlemen boys and girls that Sarah Sarah how are you\nI mean\nThey were not being mad at me for that whole like friday it's just people no I was actually this was unfolding on me or I Love you were listening but I was telling them what was going on and and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew\nWho said Hi Sarah Palin picking the kids up and dropping kids often and I'm listening I just want to say a good point I said man you've got a famous name and crack me up what your answer was do you remember what you said you said it's really neat I promise [laughter]\nLike\n\nIf we get in there to get people up here in LA there\nWell I tried to verify and a few ways or when I got the email back from Sarah appealing dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I just said do you have an iPhone let me face time you'll less just settled this once and for all and it's a good as we got to think of the state you so much for reaching out by the way\nThey want to think about it [laughter]\nIt worked out 'cause you press the button you took my face time in the area where it's like well that's definitely her not to say that's her that's like a ... and now you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day sir I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski became the senator\nAs a write in relief so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican I Can't support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she said she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nPeople of Alaska except that\nYou know and go back even further from her write in campaign out after he lost the primary up here remember what's her dad Senator Frank Murkowski after having served twenty two years in the U.S Senate he gave his daughter the job\nWhen he was elected governor up here race or one term and and I ran against him and defeated him for that that's always got and that's how we said they didn't essentially 'cause man once you're in and you have these special interest from\nAround the country right up funding you you know you should have to it's tough to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no I'm\nIrrational reasoning that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote again cabinet because as you point out she said he's good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know about calls like of course it is and whether it's a good madam yes I'm\nSo no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as even suggested as you it outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy not just for the state of Alaska but for this country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its graph having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate but you but you are you why was it up and our circuit court of appeals at all over the ... of course the\nFormer vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska and just a great ... ... but I wasn't a vote for John McCain was going right in my mother's name until you got on the ticket\nAnd then I voted for you show and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court to the United states\nThe Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um the more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court has eight members that it's tied for the foreign almost everyone we would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals\nWill decide the first amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment temperament for Alaska what does that make you think\nThat's exactly right and Joe I was impressed because nobody else was talking about that they share what her\nAction was was essentially bolstering the nights circuits had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out of\nSan Francisco right he talked about injustice and justice being delayed for Alaskans because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest as the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why\nWe don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so for me to be messing around with that uh that was very very dangerous another thing is that the\nTrump thank you for President Trump saw the lights and is allowing animal are only decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has\nYou know we haven't gone I\nThink that's a fact you know more become unhinged I I think the more that I'm reasonable rational Americans which is the majority we said nah enough is enough of that and um we're going to get in there we're going to put government back on our side get it off our back we're going to follow the constitution constitutions all about\nLimiting government that we can govern ourselves and I know I think people like you have to get to be out there every day in the arena make you a different where you guys so keeping\nOkay we're going to do that as Sarah ... million along with millions of other Americans I voted for you two thousand eight I'd vote for you in a heartbeat again I really appreciate your reaching out and thanks for taking the time today\nThank you so much\nWe appreciate Sarah bailing taking the time you know it was interesting how we ended up connecting she's riding around in Alaska\nAnd listens to my program every day we're on it you know in in acreage I'm guessing that's where she hears a role so on and not in Fairbanks but to have the opportunity to talk to her and she really doesn't have a similar if not even worth story been cabinet does because capital where to put up with it for three weeks or ... or ... days\nWorst their ability to put up with it for more than a year and her family to the microscope and just the\nThe craziest from the left him and the lawyer showing up in Alaska her perspective really made a lot of sense to me\nAnd I look I Hope she runs because we were ...\nLisa Murkowski in my opinion do not represent the people of Alaska which he voted no on Brett Kavanaugh of the reason she gave was\nBecause he's not the right guy at the right time which doesn't make any sense you're also you just heard one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe package dot coms that writer\nMethod you dear made ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to

they hit the right buttons that one day and getting that anonymous strange a message on Facebook\nEnded up getting the interviewing and if we will have run again and again and again um I Do hope she runs with Lisa Murkowski Lisa Murkowski showed that she is not who she told Alaska she would be when she said she'd be a Republican there is no reason for any Republican\nOr anybody who's a conservative a traditional American values person to say no to Brett Kavanaugh uncorroborated allegations don't count I'm\nInnocent until proven guilty due process do count\nAnd and her no vote was a ridiculous move\nAnd hope that people of Alaska are smart enough to get to rush out of there as soon as they can it is a one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty will have energy secretary

there are checks and balances in place but I don't trust that a lot of his electronic voting um I I think ... scary because you can hack\nThese machines I don't know how to do it but but you know these these guys out there do know how to do it if you're going to happen during our government or hack into Facebook or having to fill in the blank Yahoo um if you could do those things actually doing much machine\nI Would think would be very hard um so I don't know how we guarantee that I I got to tell you Doug I I've been voting for as long as I can remember and I can't tell you for sure that my vote counted every time I still go\nAnd I'll continue to go but we are leaving it to a very small number of people to validate something that that we all hope will do that they'll get right\nIt's a great question I don't have a good answer\nPast you know all of a sudden oh critical election and it's like\nOh well we have I I'm guessing that you're you might be referring to

it incredibly this president said I'm not giving in this justice Kevin ... decided I'm not going to give it I'm not going to allow them to do this to me but is that why it's lasted for probably the

W T\nRoslyn Joe Heck dot com [noise] all the goods very redesigning the website Go check it out also the\nBlaze radio network it is the weekend with Joe ... you're always glad to catch up with my former governor the former governor the great state of Texas Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America no and you might wonder well with the actors that person do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked about bad we're talking about liquefied natural gas we go to an war as well uh ... how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much we're I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so uh you know Texas but it's a it's what are called temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected with several people on your staff and I I can see their travel on Facebook and on Twitter and so on you or your or a globe Trotter now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa there'd be over in Europe and be over in Asia back home base it on your back over Indonesia where did you know that\nThat was gonna tell all of us\nAre not necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revolution runners off that occurred in the United states\nIt makes sense in hindsight that would be in all those markets because it's you know we're now selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five caught in the next group and uh there there's more to be done so I'm being there uh I I consider one of my jobs are obviously being a regulator making sure that we're\nA you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and has a\nUh as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a\nA R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world and the secretary of energy\nOught to be their job\nIt's the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and delivers that are that the president has and and he's putting it on the ... you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining he's ... he's putting terrorist is going to ruin trade and in no time flat\nYou use stepped up and said we're making a deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade that in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas now are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make a part of the deal how does that go down\nYeah he he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet or the as the secretary of treasury my nutrition and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross day all have a a a role to play in that and\nAnd so absolutely there's a there's a good a correspondent back and forth a and a ... everybody's on the same team\nAnd I want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons that I you know ... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] that's true\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a negotiator a person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen\nIf I trade ya and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine\nUh and and that's exactly what he's doing with these trade deals where he comes to a certain really hard stuff I mean you think about it with you and then a young and came back in here uh after they laid out some really tough or a sanction or not sanctions but tariffs retro\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese ... again you know hedge blew up when they announced the terrorists originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose\nThey know that we will lose a a trade war a or the Chinese no they'll lose a trade war with us so yeah\nI Know because we're the biggest customers they don't want to screw with us\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be right an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRight oh good neighbor yeah that that's it\nThe big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you were in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming onto the great guidance of of great guy but now\nWhen you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange\nYeah it it was really pretty fascinating and\nHere's the other side of it as these things were outdated you know think about that North American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two Israeli side that was twenty five years ago\nAnd and think about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who are still a developing at the energy sources\nThat we were buying and now I'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different positions than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president will say you know what\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it saves are not very attractive they usually end

NBC News fake news NBC says Facebook says hackers so personal info oh fourteen million people\nBeing exposed data including relationship status birth date hometown education and the Fifteen most

fact by visiting your Facebook help center on line the company also said that in the coming days it would send customized messages to users to explain what information might have been access\nThe social networking company disclosed two weeks ago that a security flaw in Facebook's view as feature had allowed ... into the potentially into a potentially take over people's profiles Facebook the

jak or certain groups of people were targeted but it said it was working with the forties including the FBI to investigate think about that you truly go to one of these Web sites and it's all Facebook is a freaking website some\nDo is made up a website and college in the hopes of finding hot chicks on campus though Facebook is what they started getting rid of a judge made at Facebook\nThat you know blossomed into well yeah everybody wants to go meet hot guys and girls sure what\nThe hell we could share a picture to Ellis is going to be able to connect to that and then it became a very powerful

world\nThe radio Ninety seven point seven at\nStraining ties between allies this is Fox News lawmakers on both sides of the aisle urging the White House to reconsider an arms deal with Saudi Arabia following the mysterious disappearance of a journalist Fox's are now Scott has more live\nNow I mean let's face it the her attorneys wanted a show trial you know they wanted to make a spectacle of her\nAnd her Brett Kavanaugh and that's what they got they they they they weren't really representing her interest as far as as far as she said what are rich resource you want to remain anonymous she didn't want her life publicly exposed to sway but that's what her attorneys did to her\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson rest of the last question on Kavanaugh known them onto the on affordable healthcare act and and what you guys are doing a very positive way for the American people are but one last question he's now on the court and the left the screaming and yelling give us back the house will impeach him\nI mean again it's ridiculous and I'm not really sure why any voter even somebody who lean left would say well yeah I'm gonna vote for impeachment for no reason um what do you make of that that sort of their Montreal we're not going to kick them off the court because we're so unhappy that he's on the court\nWell ... was there an angry mob and they they've been\nThey've had this primal screams since the day after the election when the wrong person according to them one you\nKnow I've never seen his like this job you know in my lifetime there's always some measure of honey room there's some\nYou know best wishes to any president who's taking on enormous task growing hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous insecure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage administration from day one in the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican the grace of the Wisconsin let's talk about the unaffordable Gary ... use supported the president as that all Republicans and has been all Americans because their paychecks are bigger and and do this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually help the people of the major\nAmount of people that were paying that find that tax and the an Affordable Care act were middle class people\nThat were harmed horribly you guys did a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of preexisting conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you're a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the idea that the left somehow is making it a a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this was a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you'd like health care plan and keep your\nFamilies who have their previous reduced try five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside it'd be the two thousand Eighteen live a year or they're they're pushing a congressional Review Act to reverse a rule\nWhere President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right\nAnd they're saying that we're gonna take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three to sixty four days which is they weren't or Obama yeah and then in addition to that allow companies to offer every new ability\nOkay so so you give people greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare and Joe the premium estimates and get their just estimates and in Wisconsin for example health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost or by Medicare plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year you know they can get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current level so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks a year you may be only pay a thousand so I didn't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back and nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guaranteed remains in place those protections you can always go back\nTo the Obamacare exchanges if you could afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums costs because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to something you said it's not going to go and you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing to do the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody is saying of those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something but just really reiterate that former senator if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of covered for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do it through regulation right so the ... the protection terms or preexisting conditions you could always go on the Obamacare exchanges were just giving\nThose individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't get the subsidies that can't afford they'd been priced out of the Obamacare exchanges we're giving them an option to be out to be able to afford health insurance for once\nOkay ... this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false with the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of of the short term when when ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because they want single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or or free enterprise base is that really what the argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if the if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away that protection preexisting condition which no Republican wants to do right okay the American people spoke on that\nOr they think they can win the election but no I mean there are a long term goal obviously is Bernie ... Sanders your Medicare for all which is which gets rid of Medicare takes the Dallas dedicated to Medicare and puts it tore his single payer government run bureaucratic system\nThat will ration care will reduce the number of doctors because who's going to want to be reimbursed at Medicaid rates right and that's the only reason only costs only\nCosts thirty two trillion dollars if we reimburse providers at current rates it costs thirty eight trillion dollars everybody's individual income tax for at least have to double business taxes at least double and they still won't pay for it\nI urge anybody who's listening or watching the right down to number thirty two trillion they realize how much money but as a Senator Ron Johnson a one last question I run a rose reshaped the access of the time and You're welcome anytime I friend um when it comes to the mid term you just mentioned briefly\nI feel strongly that knowing that the Senate stay with you guys but you might gain two or three I'm not I'm not predicting it's already should stay home everybody should go and vote certainly but the houses\nNo but yes it's pretty expensive it is [noise]\nThere is no way to armed with a young mom [noise]\n\nRadio nothing\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it seeps are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet wouldn't it be great if there was a saint that had to look up a beautiful antique so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino\nIron works at rhino safe dot com\nAmerican Made an antique styled our sakes are part art part furniture and all security\nAnd if you're like the classic look of our rhino fireworks apes we also feature beautiful matching tool chest and furniture with hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers and a huge network\nAcross the U.S we've built our reputation on having the best bill best looking and most convenience sake what great surface and warranties and you can get online financing so go with the best\nAnd gets style convenience security and true peace of mind with rhino safe dot com today that's rhino save dotcom rhino safe dot com and international\nDiamond center we just want to stop and say thank you\nThank you to the people here in Savannah for how you embrace are unique content how you've made id see that go to place for diamonds engagement rings in fine jewelry our mission from day one is to provide you with a better alternative address we jewelry store when exceptional value\nOur no middleman direct importer approach has been a big hit for smart shoppers here in Savannah\nYou love value and you appreciate transparency you also love writing and selection that's why we are committed to carrying the largest jewelry inventory in the state of Georgia\nWith a multimillion dollar selection of blue certifying diamonds and over four thousand designer engagement ring [noise] and I see we're proud to be a part of this amazing city when did you mean carrying your and wonderful people\nKill again we say thank you for all the gear supportive and we're doing to make the man is Marco just on the more\nInternational diamond center mumbling on official jewelry and your just having universal [noise]\nYour truck is much more than a vehicle to you whether it's a workhorse roughly toy Utah takes a serious meeting so permanently protect you went to us from gal just rip than there is with ... fly to excess of that is also your truck accessories doors carrying a whole lot of excess Lisa ...\nSays is that some of that on average going to see how they can protect you and just this running boys or is it more ... more frequent anything worth protecting is worth over protecting it ...

com faceless Instagram email all my they're also the live video stream it Hughes the weekend with Joe pacts why to have\nYou long for the ride so talking about a ride the stock market as we took a bumpy ride some say a roller coaster some say just went straight down I'm the president calling the fed logo\nI guess I guess that's the issue um have buddy rich or what that means but whenever it's a financial markets thing or financial question I always go to my friend Doug Adler use the manager director and senior vice president of investments room of dreams and associates or Doug I always appreciate it\nHow's it going brother John great thank you so uh all the president has to say that the fed is logo\nAnd that when we get eleven hundred points are due to the negative on the stock market people obviously you're freaking out some of them are do you know me I think the stock market is a slot machine anyway so but I don't really worry about it my four oh one K. still looks great today um but people are freaking out about can you point to one thing that made this happen or is a a conglomeration of things\nYeah I think it's a conglomeration of things Joe it what's always interesting about the market is\nThings that we know that are potential headwinds the market looks at it stares at it shrugs at a stretch it off and then suddenly it it matters I think what's kinda manifested here as we know that the Federal Reserve is on this trajectory of raising interest rates so\nWhat does that really at the end of the day designed to do cool off the economy so that brings into question next year twenty Nineteen what earnings look like\nTrade or China looks like a tough or a photo if you will and in this regard so that's problematic we've had a few companies are pre announce their earnings which don't didn't look necessarily great\nOil has gone up the you know that's I'm up to Seventy five now it's pulled back the last couple of days like everything tort Seventy but still it's a much higher than it was Eighteen months ago I had went on the economy so you have some of these things that no those have all been there but suddenly they mattered and people that sell button\n... do you have a video of these guys are managing director senior vice president over it or read the gyms and associates you have an opinion as to why the fed would want to cool off the economy\n[noise] well they have this in a state it inflation target of two percent going here and then when you start to see a match it oil as an example there's other places we can point to that are that are showing some inflationary pressure\nWhich is part and parcel of course to a stronger economy in this economy as much stronger than it was when President Trump took office you're getting some of those pressures\nThat tries to stay in front of that because you you it's kind of like a you know the old porridge three little bears story they don't want it too hot or too cold yeah they want to just write so they're trying to\nDo that meaning a slow things down into that sweet spot where we have reasonable growth but maybe that's three percent with reasonable inflation which they're they're Damien to be two percent so that's that's why they're doing it\nIs it rational or reasonable dog or a I heard today somebody may mentioned that there's a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the midterm election if the if the Trump autonomy starts to tank who's oh so you didn't work all those with the tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational depicted politically people can make this happen\nUm that that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um think about it if you're on that side of the political ledger you're kind of hurting yourself right if you're right ... thanks go down I don't see that yeah\nOkay are you still gambler he's managing director of the vice president of a investments are emerging that associates so as\nWe watch this you know Obama when he was an office that I talk to you about this before we started so he doesn't pay attention to the daily dry rations of the stock market or when it wasn't doing so great and and what I was doing great he said look I read I Am I'm\nThis of course the left politically is saying well see the bubbles burst for for you know sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now they've been sending the bubbles going to burst this can't continue like this do you think this is something temporary\nAnd it will correct itself again or are we seeing that maybe you did get too big for its bridges\nYeah no I I think are so investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people you think it's a bull market or bear market and they have an opinion based on how they feel about things\nBut really what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this vets and the regulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive we have an economy or that had been held back because the consumer at Denver\nPretty low in terms of their confidence in the outlook All right now and this is actually right we're at twenty year high something like that in consumer confidence I think last week we hit an all time high since Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence so when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet\nAnd in that regard I have to tell you this is really for found two things first one is\nDebt service so that's just simply what comes in and income or into a household and then what goes out for a ... student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income and go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies\nAnd household networks in this country such assets minus liabilities\nIt's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nWell it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better sales and they've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Savannah", "day": "14"}
