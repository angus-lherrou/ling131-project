with\nUm you know so no I I wouldn't go to the doctor or I Would get comfortable with that doctor one of the two\nI'm now may be that that's an off putting enough 'cause it's kind of a weird request it may be the debts off putting enough to you that you just don't want to use this doctor but that in what you said in the email\nSometimes I hear people say you know I I'm not going to tie that church because I don't agree with things that are going on at that church\n\nBut you're going to trust them to spiritually train you\nYou're going to trust them with your children's show one Sunday school class you're going to trust them to influence you on your view of scripture scripture and your walk with God but you don't trust them with your money well let's just dumb\nSo into the system that's appalling\nYou don't trust them enough to touch you don't trust them with money but you trust them with your salt\nThat's just weird it's\nJust a bad idea so that's the thing\nNow I have at times with the church that I'm attending while I'm watching the misbehavior of leadership and I've taken a little time off of tithing and set it aside a little bit to see how this was going to turn out but long term if I'm not willing to give their I shouldn't go there\nIn the same would be true of this doctor story here and is with us in Baltimore, Maryland Hi Ann how are you\nI'm great how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] I paid thirty five well not paid off but I paid thirty five thousand dollars in less than a year good for you I'm\nTorn thank you taught student loans listening to you and then I was in a car crash and the money thing going for medical expenses and um I two things I've lost my motivation\nAlso at the other thing is I found a great deal I have some auto body um problems with my car and I found someone who is willing to do do it for cheaper price and I want to get that we've had that but it it's going to be eight hundred dollars\nAnd you don't have eight hundred dollars\nWell I have that I Know you're not gonna like that but I got it I have a thousand dollar emergency fund the IRS just hit me and they ... they are going to get that money [noise] um I can save up\nI mean I thought you were out on a debt oh no no no I'm not out of that well just paid off their I've already\nFive thousand a year now that was torn my student loan that\nActually I have and you didn't pay the IRS before you paid your student loan\nThat just came out of nowhere that I haven't I'm getting paid park in the mail from my CPA half a fan tend to pay for that for a marked on right now\nMhm ballot now\nMhm okay and so you have one thousand dollar saved for emergencies is all\nYeah than that I have I got a credit card and I know you don't like credit card and I don't normally use credit cards but if you're an extra Twenty one line and I can use their credit card and just pay a hundred dollars a month\nUse it for one candidate for the auto body repair which is eight hundred dollars yeah yeah I ... and I mean\nThat that's so backward from everything you've ever heard me say I'm appalled that you think I Would actually respond positively to that ridiculous statement\nI mean really\nYou just called Dave Ramsey and said I Want to use a credit card on the air\nOkay well I take that back I Want [laughter]\nI mean either way you are going on here no I mean you've got you've got to think about an hour a day Ramsey thanks but you need to think about what how do you want to live your life here's why you lost your motivation is you're inconsistent\nYou need to say in your mind and in your heart of hearts and you need to grasp intellectually and spiritually that the shortest path to wealth and generosity and stability in your finances sustainability just to get out of debt and stay out of debt and at that point you're saying I'll never borrow again as part of that\nRegardless of what I Need to have happen now you have a car accident they do not get an insurance settlement for that\nNow they're saying that there was no ... ... a damage to our vehicle and there than they don't believe that it um in that crash injured me but I I'm actually had pain before the crash occurred\nSo I'm just paying for myself with my health insurance\nOkay but I'm Talking about the car wreck so you did not get any insurance for the damage to your car\nOh yes I did I got five hundred dollars I paid for my student\nOh OK\nInstead of putting it on the auto body repair which now you want to do yeah so this repair is very very minor an eight hundred dollar is a bump it's not our okay\nSo the eight hundred dollar pair Marine I want to do it now become a great deal because it's not it's damage that I've been driving around with\nFor a long time the other damage yeah well then I might I may stop if we're not going to be able to talk to a few thousand dollar let me stop you for\nA number one I'm not going to tell you to borrow money you knew that for you call me right number two this is not an emergency\nSmaller margins right there it's not an emergency\nI don't care if it's a great deal not emergency and you don't have any money except what's in your emergency fun now and you've got the IRS breathing down your neck which is a lot bigger deal than a bump on your car\nAnd so now you need to clear up the Irish and save up the money to fix the car if the guy won't do it in a year from now for eight hundred dollars then when you actually have the money then you just want to be able to do it with him you just missed that deal but so what\nI'm ... you know one thing I have learned is that when I Am impulsive\nAnd when I make quick decisions on something based on something I feel like I'm being emotionally drug into it's almost always a bad financial decision and a lot of the things circling around this conversation and have had that field with them\nAnd so you need to slow down get yourself on a very strict plan in the lives that plan all the way out regardless of what opportunities or crisis is come into your life anytime there's a problem you just get back on track\nBack on track back on track\nAnd when you stabilized that you're going to stabilize not only are money but a whole bunch of other areas of your life that I also felt like a dog tracing its tail or you just been going in circles\nAnd that's what's going on I can hear it I can feel it and talking to you you're going to be All right but that's what you need to do and now we're not going to use a credit card to take advantage of a bargain to fix your car not what they are athletes that are now and is not an emergency so we're not using the emergency room on\nA very clear principle here I'm Glad that you just like a lot of them to everyone else [laughter]\n[noise] but you get to do it because you're thrown out\nAnd\nCan\nA great team production officer for the show and here's a little tip for two thousand and

AM radio broadcast then\nThat a mere Knight planet or planet X. Y. indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt and the cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is shaped rock guy than ice left over from our solar system creation and then from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto to adopt the astronomical unit from our son\nAnd the crowd of mostly ice and to go much further starting where that guy prevailed in and ... and three point to light years from earth\nAnd theoretical shape that surround our entire solar system including the ...\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of ... at ... dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I say planet nine ... indirectly found in twenty sixteen because it eight no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object\nBut Michael Brown ... professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nHere now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident that ...\nYour job he ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving\nIn a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nProfessor brown simply calls the planet nine because he's the astronomer that got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades it was twenty three\nProfessor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called Eris out in the hype rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that put our should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to a dwarf planet in the ... belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten\nThat was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming when I first interviewed professor brown about the\nMassive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes half a dozen other hyper belt objects\nTo cluster together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery\nIt's now late twenty eight team after several tries at the ... Subaru observatories in Hawaii defined planet nine and visible light and or infrared professor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go\nAfter more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet because he only seven times more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update\nOn his search for this ... save planet nine or planted act that he uh is still trying to mine and he told me that he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week\nAnd this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to actually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement\nAnd for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun\nSo that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than Neptune a good way out there but they have ... narrow down the focus so yes there were only going on November first started another surge because the new calculations\nPredict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California is astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet and looking at it in the end for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for\nYou isn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system perturbations and even just being the plane of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing enough direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right and like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter]\nThis is what we mean when we say a planet and the other part of the solutions to\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where my does have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or not he was inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition of\nAll of this was just speculation you can probably come up with so many different ideas to explain how it got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a ... tune like planets just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clones it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be sings about it that we never even thought about that are completely president\nExactly how far from earth to where you think there is no object is\nWe think it's about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd use that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter later you're it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the rebels and your cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there's a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond the planet and we don't quite know how the planet is affecting what this border is\nI haven't got to hold on right there let's come back we'll finish that up in conversations with [noise]\nHe's a man is news radio Ninety

she did it become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what her computer models showing to do is have you worked on the ... the report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those that stuff's coming\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nation the United states included\nMy adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that short a period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned votes on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by two level Roger and forced to migrate as their\nCities become habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you get\n... of such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees and that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally wants to go somewhere\nWhere there are better prospects and so I think we can expect\nNorth America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war in ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises\nSuggesting that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency during the Obama administration's climate change was considered\nA major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist\nBut this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was for years ago\nSo global climate change in increasing more could definitely bring more wars\nYes there you go\n... well it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control and one of the big headline the\nSummer of twenty Eighteen million for at

November aide twenty seven teen I did my first earth files YouTube channel broadcasts\nAnd since then on most Wednesday evening's beginning at seven thirty PM mountain and another time zones around the country in the world\nI've been in my office where I'm Talking to you tonight in front of this computer to share news with the general audience that is growing around the world for my work and they like uh my YouTube channel\nWell just a three weeks ago and October third I was doing updates on three categories\nThe first had to do with the very distressing subject of half cats beheaded cats\nAround the world bloodless weird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was Fox is in a car road kill\nAnd that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspots solar observatory shut down I had a received a whistle blower emails saying that are actually\nUh the child pornography was just a funny deflection that he actually involved the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Harlem an air force base\nOf the ... down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak\nAnd then the third update had evolved from my asking my profiles YouTube channel audience\nOn September twelfth if anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body specifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately\nAnd I had received a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was\nTalking about when the next\nMorning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty who manages\nMy are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream [noise] so I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird\nUh I sent the puzzle to a photo shop a video and also I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show and he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a ... report what are the smoky fog\nSometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see these videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was that he thinks this is truly anonymous and uh then I asked a that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience\nIf anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office and believe it or not\nA second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder on October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me\nEmails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like ... I Do not know this is the extremely a translucent\nAnd uh when I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt that there were people who were telling\nMe they had never mentioned any of this parent to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight thinking about all of this\nIs provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream\nThat's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard or talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida home\nThis was in the spring of two thousand in age and I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn of the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bad coverage of all my show and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see\nAnd then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and ears open them again and through the window\nI can see this misty gray bomb drifting in through the window\nAnd I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that in this dark bedroom was luminous and I can see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head\nAnd I was just raising the fascination that I didn't know what to think and then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted hire a glass passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was feeling of euphoria and one is which is living thing\nAnd that was surrounding made and then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time\nI was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia and they were all being answered at the same time like all of these answers were coming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously\nI don't know why this was happening I was just going with it I don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\nCan you describe the shape of the ... that you remember vividly and tried to give us an impression of what kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head tell a possibly\nKnow there were no words there was no sound the hiring glitz we're almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I can see peripherally these hiring glass but they had the same texture as the fog good would shadow in life\nBut they were living minutes at the same time and they would just blow by me but kind of ...\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a download information\nThat was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was this super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall this information because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDid you have do any sub text in your mind or your soul about who we'd be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it may be cousins my past experience with ever since I was a child I've had psychic dreams\nDreams of having relationships with an entity that was giving the instructions I can describe the entity to as a very thin\nOr something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that there's going to be like a shift or jolt and that it would cause your nominees in tremendous amounts of flooding\nAnd I had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them about exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle\nInteracting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that is written about in genesis\nAnd that is how woven and a complex all seem to be going that every single question is leading to answer that people are raising more issues and scientists are also coming forward and saying that they have information about this\nAnd so tonight if there's anybody listening

Kevin demanded a blur capital with me today so let's ask him Kevin how are ya\nGreat George thanks yeah in two thousand and two silver was four dollars an hour to narrow the cost of production we predicted silver would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely not nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now\nSolar in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go down\nThe hall I guess not but could silver reach higher than a hundred dollars announce\nOr if you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach us all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach\nOne could that happen\nOver the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate you have anything that you can send out to listeners so they can find out more about a hundred dollar silver\nWe do George or how to make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high silver report listeners can learn more about China's massive move into solar and why experts the silver rising to a hundred dollars announce\nThe report the twenty dollar value but it's free for your listeners by calling one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nFolks this last week even for just came out with a report saying China was leading the way with solar and that in two thousand Eighteen global investments in the solar will outstrip coal gas in nuclear combined\nLet's get Lee or sky high silver report in some fascinating report and don't miss out on the ... revolution call now to get your copy it's a twenty dollar value free with no obligation call one eight hundred\nTo nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred [noise]\nIt's so important to get a great night's sleep and I can get that with my sleep number bed\nIt really is comfortable is has a certain setting to it in mind is kept at Ninety which is nice for him set him from the new sleep number three sixty smart but also helps every one from parents to pro athletes improved their daily performance through proven sleep quality it's so important to get that\nSo many couples disagree on mattress firmness sleep number beds let you choose your ideals furnace on each side so it's just right for both of you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Savannah", "day": "26"}
