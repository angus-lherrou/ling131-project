{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "Than babysit when you're out of debt but the house then baby steps three years you return to the one thousand dollar account raise it up to three to six months of expenses and then\nA a\nThat you restart your retirement start putting Fifteen Percent away for retirement start saving for kids college pay off your house early as baby steps six so the house is way down the list so it it's not even going to come up you're not getting to the house right now you know in the money\nSo then we bring in this idea of I'm going back to school to be a nurse which is an awesome goal uh not only will you be very employable you have the ability to make really good money and um and can really adjust your schedule\nIn crazy ways to really double your income if you want to for short periods of time I mean you got all kinds of options in nursing that are going to be really good for you and your family [noise] um\nSo are we the return on investment\nThe investment into Austin is a really good investment\nBecause of your field of study you know you're not you're not getting a degree and left handed puppetry here this is actually my degree and so\nIt's worth every penny you're spending on it and a bunch more is what I'm saying so if we're if our goal is to get out of debt so that we can build wealth than the first step of that before we start anything else to say no more new debt\nYou can't get out of debt while you're getting into debt that you can get out of holding out the bottom right so that means we got a cash flow call it\nSo what's ... what's going to cost\nA it's about three thousand dollars a semester and semesters\nA it's probably at least three years' worth of school\n... years three years of school so I'm thinking really twelve maybe\nSo you you didn't complete your undergrad already then\nNo I mean I'm I'm a baby in in college I I'm just now starting I mean it's a semester one I haven't I you know this\nIs okay but you don't have enough you don't have an undergrad under your belt that you're adding a nursing degree to rye rye okay she got to finish up some undergrad or do some undergrad and then move into the writing so you need a three thousand a semester\nTimes three our our I'm Sorry I taught for three years you said is where I was going to take you and so six thousand dollars a year for three years Eighteen thousand bucks right\nYeah something like that OK okay and what's your household income um ... it was about sixty thousand dollars and my wife were having our first baby next well in the beginning of November\nWhat's your household income during the next three years going to average\nProbably around forty to forty five thousand dollars whoa\nOkay so you're not gonna have a lot of cash to finish school and you have how much in savings\nAh twelve thousand okay\nAh I get the good in that emergency fund fourteen thousand\nOr your emergency fund a small yeah okay yeah I think your total money make over baby steps are on hold until we get college paid for\nOkay\nSo I'm going to set the twelve thousand over in my college fund and it needs to be Eighteen as my very first gold\nAnd then when it gets to Eighteen then we can talk about building the uh you know we talk about taking the emergency phone down to a thousand and start working on the other day that's how much other data got not counting your house\nOr the car how much do you do on the car it's about twenty five thousand\nOh lord and you make forty five\nWell at that time we uh we made like I said I made about sixty sixty\nFive dollars an hour if you're going to be making forty five thousand this car does not fit in your goals for the next three years\nOkay mathematical insanity\nI mean look at look at these numbers we got an Eighteen thousand dollar a you know investment into Austin which we've agreed is a really good investment we we've got three thousand dollars to our name we've got a forty five thousand our household income\nAnd twenty five thousand dollar car no I Need to hear like five thousand dollar cars wanted me to hear\nIn the middle of this because cars not your goal right now your goal is get all this mess cleaned up and get your education on your belt and double your income which is what's gonna happen\nOkay agreed yeah so a car okay\nGet you get you a much much much cheaper car so that you hit these goals because what you're doing is you're paying a price to when you're living like no one else so that later you get to live like no one else\nBut this car as it stands out as you had this have this really logical really smart a whole thing going on until we got to the car and then and we went to stupid land\nIt just it just sticks out it doesn't it doesn't fit in your equation it doesn't even fit in your life is like you all had a you know a really bad impulse one day and you know just went off the ranch or something I don't know but even if you're making sixty five it didn't fit it was ridiculous purchased so it's just way too high\nAnd even if you paid cash for it in all of the middle all this so it wouldn't have made sense so ... time to time to move that puppy and then let's live our lives because the good news is you have anything you want man 'cause your income is going to be eighty\nWhen you're finished with this and you're able to pay cash and\nYou know but you can't have these blockers in your way that you're trying to get around this elephant in the room that says car\nIt it's the only thing killing you it's killing your plant it's it's it's just it's death so anyway that's what I Would do and I think you guys are really smart and I think you'll do it open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Doug is on Twitter is it normal to continually adjust my budget during the first month\nYes\nAnd it is okay to adjust your budget continually during the first month if\nIt is not because you're out of control being immature and impulse sing if it is instead because you didn't estimate properly like for instance you didn't have enough set aside for food\nAnd it wasn't because you went out to eat every night and you were a jerk it was because you just didn't have enough set aside for food you on that had an unrealistic budget for food and you're discovering life looks different than your theory and you adjust that\nBut I have to continually adjust my budget so that I get to do whatever the flip I Want no that's not a good idea\nOr people will do that but that's not a good idea\nSo your budget is to give you a guideline but it takes about three months of doing your budget trial and error adjust trial experiment trial adjust experiment adjust experiment adjust to get a completely dialed in and the first month you're going to have we always laughing so you're gonna forty to emergency budget committee meetings\nBut those are to adjust only the things\nThat you miss estimated or you just forgot and it is something that's real and something that's important it's not like oh we've been on a budget for two days and I'm like really tired of that I Want to go out to eat no that's not what I'm Talking about [noise] no I just you know I'm really you know just this is really stressful I've been doing it for three hours now no that's not what we're talking about\nWe're talking about you just missed your food budget or you didn't win anything aside for repairs and you think about and then you have a car repair jihad to stopping adjust for that and pay for that\nAnd so yeah you gonna continually adjusting for three months you're first month the worst second month the next ... months of work that's how it's going to play out for you to address or your impulses list is today\n[laughter] Mm\nGuy

com double duty ...\nAnd high hard ways yo station now Fox News radio covers the world on news radio seven points out an ad needs twelve o'clock [noise]\nLet's see Kevin ...\nComing friday ... Fox News the Senate is expected to hold a procedural vote for reading on the nomination of Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh the outcome will be a key indicator whether Senate Republicans have the votes needed for confirmation\nRule for other reasons you know maybe it's just that I've been watching too much American horror story apocalypse but my dad that God if you watch that\nThat's a lesson in in the fight between what is the dark powers in whatever powers out there in the midst of an apocalypse\nPredicted programming revelation of the matter is that\nIt would be increasing globally should a globalization of political and economic institutions it's becoming easier for a relatively small group\nTo deceive itself into quite staggeringly influential positions and one couple in particular reveals alarmingly what another small group will do is driven by financial belief systems and a cult things and all the things in the shadows all the things that can reach out and grab you from the darkness\n\nAnd while there are many conspiracy writers and observers that tend to talk about the material world within the conspiracy history\nWe always seem to point to whomever we hate that has control over the world the spiritual realm\nBut what is it the thriving right now in the midst of globalization a lot of frightening and somewhat complex things that are difficult to understand even I sometimes have to go back and read\nAnd understand that's why I come in every day early\n\nAnd yeah you can go through all of the bad guys the masons the Jesuits accusing them of controlling all of a spiritual realms of what appears to be the same trio called however it becomes more complicated\n\nWhen you deal with witchcraft or priest craft that takes place within the spiritual matrix of the elite\nAnd a lot of this I mean I'm sure many of you don't understand it and you know I understand a little of it because of what I've studied my my\nEntire life what I what I put into this program every night every major step in the development of the new world order from a simple ideology to a worldwide super states can be traced back\nTo specific ideologies which uphold ruled by a chosen body of spiritual elite secret Brotherhood's from behind the scenes the Brotherhood whatever it may be or the sisterhood if you want to be equal\nAll plays a role in the hidden hand that guides us towards disorder and it can also be seen as a manifestation of elusive theory and spirituality the professors to enlighten practitioners through mysticism and magic\nAnd I kind of alluded to it\nIn the last hour I use the the the word synergy\nThere was a guy by the name of a Joseph ... saying hives\nAnd\nHe had an opposition to the rise of anarchy and the second half of the nineteenth century\n\nAnd to him the ideal state was a rigid social hierarchy topped by an elite that is predestined rural absolutely at odds with the band emerging concepts of democracy\nAnd so he decided that the only way to win and to gain power which do you use the supernatural as a weapon\n\nAnd so he wanted to transmit the secretive synergy throughout the ages basically coming in coordination and cooperation with a divine rule meaning that some spiritual fathers do not exist on this planet and they must be conjured up contacted\n\nAnd one of the spiritual fathers or some of the spiritual bothers us that are key were of course the knights Templar\n\nAnd other groups that you know actually spawned and and and new ideas and and mysterious mysterious subjects and hidden meanings and certain conjure rings and all these things\n\nAnd I said before that it seems to me that you know be beyond the deep state in the dark state or whatever state you want to point to as a problem there is a darker type of rule\nOf dark command that actually uses the darker powers to create a sin arcade may be in power right now the government it's run\nAnd it's not our government into towel but what it is it is a government of some kind of group of conspiracy of men or women that form of priesthood and are ruled by a secret society open societies are not always the ones\nThat are named by conspiracy theorists all of them however it played a role in establishing\nTheir power plays within the United states and within the world the formation of this nation was perhaps the mother of all conspiracies but from there there were other conspiracy groups other secrets societies\nAnd I know many Christians in America I Believe that the establishment of the United states was based on Christian values and ideologies this is half true because the rebellious nature of the insurrection was purely Syrian\nAny bordered on things like her medic arcane them announce the system so from the very beginning we've always had that group\nThat are simply observers they they they're custodians and they make things happen\nAnd they call themselves into a different opinion that of the Christians or the Jews are the Muslims and they're in systematic opposition\n\nTo the apostles through the disciples to those who've adopted the views of Christianity Islam and Judaism and they're against the general teaching any gospel whatsoever any word there would be connected to a God\nA God that they don't approve of\nAnd they are on the opinion that the dog was of any gospel are not good for anyone\n\nAnd this is why they're really oligarchy in most respects has a secret doctrine which is reserved for the elite\nAnd this is why when you see things happen that don't sincerely seem\nGodly or Christ like or or or anything you you look at the symbolic language you look at the actions you look at the numbers and all the numbers in the symbolic actions and the language and all of them are puzzle pieces to a greater picture and not always do you have the greater picture and even I don't\n\nThat's why you know I gave a few clues gave it a few hands and I said a couple of nights ago I said you know I'm not gonna give you an exact date I Can't give you a decay exact date\nOf anything I'm not here to tell you the world ending I I that would be stupid to do something like this and many people say and many people are used to the idea that people who talk like guy talks are wanting to just gather everyone together and say the world is ending do yourselves then that's it no I'm not a cult leader I'm a talk show host\nI Know what I'm Talking about is not magical thinking it's really pattern seeking it it it's basically acknowledging the a lot of the coincidence is that I haven't seen lately are meaningful at least to me they are they might not\nBe they might not be meaningful to you [noise] and it can be intentional or unintentional but I see that there is a confidence stricter a foot with what is happening between the uh the situation with the four cabinet meetings the FBI and what's about to be set [noise]\nAnd as I said and I always say prepare

Am so excited about the die\nBut uh I was wanting to offer some information that I thought would help people understand where we're at and us simplify it and also solidify\nA lot of what you're saying um\nI'll get right to the chase long time ago I was in church and I heard a preacher say this and I had time while I was on hold the hammer that real quick okay but if you take the computer and are\nYou a sonnet alphabetical a position numerically he likes the bakery oh being Fifteen damage Thirteen pay is sixteen\nUsually be Twenty one key is twenty he is five and or is Eighteen\nNow if you add those up it comes to want a weapon ... and I think we could all agree that the number of man according to I think John the rebel later in revelations number of land would be six nephew multiply that low the old way come up with mark at least six six six\nAnd a number of guy I think numbers don't why but I found it totally amazing that man bought two thousand years ago or so I\nDidn't know what he was saying but here we are having to computers has taken over a\nWell if you if you want you want to really get creepy so um when you look at the Hebrew alphabet okay and the Hebrew numerical systems and you say to yourself ah\nWWW is an acronym for the world Wide Web WWW and it's been pretty fixed WWW and so if you look at the Hebrew Greek alphabet\nHe doesn't have separate characters are outlets are numbers and letters they describe certain letters and numbers together so there were letters that have numerical values so if you look at the Hebrew equivalent of our W\nThe letter is vi V. A. V. vibe or it's Bob\nAnd so the number of value of Bob he's six so Bob Bob Bob or WWW numerically it's six six six\nThat is correct and I think again solidifies uh\nEverything you're saying and and uh I just want people to\nKnow if you take the Roman device if you take the Roman numeral a you take the Roman numerals six okay which is vi\nYour vi vi vi and then you connect to vi V. I. B. I. it's WWW so you have another six six six\nSo lazy and\nIt just it's just weird but it it it's weird a cold ah numerology a newer number gaming and let her gaming but it's certainly a comes together in such a way\nI'm sure that I Would be escorted out handcuffed and thrown in jail but see that's the thing is it a swastika used to be an eastern philosophical symbol it'd be Indian cultures\nWould have a swastikas symbol but since it's been hijacked by the Nazis you can't wear it but the symbol means something to somebody and it means different things to different people with a by ... by a where across\nPeople will say well obviously he's a Christian and yet if you were if you were a ... gram they'll say well obviously euro which but the ... used to represent what the cross represented be until after the crucifixion so I didn't know that\nAnd so yeah I mean see that's the thing it'd be represented the they had their hands outstretched and the legs sprayed turning it upside down in birds that so they had this in the ground and the body you split up word\nSame with the upside down ... it was the same principle but you wouldn't hurt the hat and the arms and it perverts a perverse the meaning of what the symbol is\nSo if you know anything a symbolic gee you know that this arch is very symbolic of something that is being talked about right now in Washington D.

emotional lobbying and that's scary because that kind of weaponization of the population can take a very bad places\nYou know I had to Lindsey Graham had a ramp during the time I thought oh my God I'm agreeing with Lindsey Graham is truly frightening [laughter] but you know he basically said he turned to the Democrats and he said you you better not get power because he can't handle it\nSo it's pretty scary and I I Will say this I think both sides have increasingly done it and the population is increasingly allowed themselves to be weaponized so you know the reality is is is you know these people are not metaphors they're individuals and you have to judge them according to the evidence and according to the law\nAnd I'm now where does this come out I think the capital is going to be confirmed\nAnd ... if he isn't confirmed as some of the moderates filled out it's because if you you know if you do a deep dive into his record\nWhat it says he's he's a little bit more loyal to the establishment and the constitution so I think he's apt to bend the law to help the ... the establishment of the government go where they want to go and that's what's going to give some of\nThe moderates you know problems and so but my guess he he's going to be confirmed probably this weekend and what's interesting about this is the impact that will have on the election um and I think one of the things it's done is it's really galvanized the Republican base because there\nAre you know two weeks ago they were concerned about Trump's personality now you know in his tweeting now they're not they're concerned about what would happen if the um you know if the Democrats had the leadership position\nDo we do we all loses people because of all of this\n[noise] any any time any one of the things talk ... support the violation if due process um we we put our whole culture and our whole system in jeopardy and the whole our whole financial markets in jeopardy\nSo you know I think this is we each have a responsibility under the constitution the law to\nTo protect the law and I'll tell you something you know I went through an eleven year highly lawless process where I was targeted and and you know efforts by government people to frame me mhm and\nWhat what saved me George was that I literally you know I went to the process and safe and what happened was there were so many people inside the FBI or the department of justice or the different agencies involved\nOr my attorneys or the general population who really believed in the law and it was their belief in the law that ultimately saved me\nSo we need to believe in it it's every one of us and um you know I think I think that a lot of people uh you know who is allowed themselves to be weaponized oh oh ah\nOh an

the appeal of the Rocky Horror picture show remember that\nI really absolutely I think that that did have an audience participation aspect to it you know when when they have the host everyone throws a piece of toast at the screen\nPeople have call and response where they're yelling things up at the screen or you know there's rice prone during the wedding and I think it's sort of immersive experience but I also because of the sexuality of the film you know people who are sixteen Seventeen years old and are kind of emerging into their adult life\nIt's kind of a ... thing that they can go in with their friends and you know they might uh\nAccidentally see a little scanner so [laughter] so I think that all that factored in and and you have a you know people who who met met each other at sixteen year old a Rocky Horror and ended up getting married as adults and I've heard\nAs I've I've seen that that I've seen the shadow cast in the states for a performance that goes along with the movie performing very you're very different markets all over the country\nAnd over and over again I flew people who have met at that show and gotten married so I don't know what it is about that but

ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on a kitchen table and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense\nDrinking\nI drank it and it causes massive pneumonia and I almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand\nConscious embody once you were wrong\nI guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raise their luster when I was Twenty years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember until now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then the marsh first places I was in two were Michigan Farmington Hills and then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis a Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference\nThere family still there\nI have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my modus motorcycle accident uh-huh you're born heights really yeah well he\nTold me weird cause you must remember this the the street\nOh I don't I don't know who was ... was it a busy street\nYeah it was a busy street but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over ...\nI'm going to I'm going to close my eyes in yes you'll\nRemote viewing now that you were on telegraph road\nMm that sounds that sounds about right\nNear Michigan viewing skill new Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf it more when you're back here my gosh yeah well thank you my friend I preach\nShielded ... really steer you in the direction where you are now um and you get a PHD and social after apology you've just been elected a vice president of a Psychological Association will get into the but is this will lead the foundation for you\nWell I think I really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and what time of course the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown no um [noise] well I discovered\nTo books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Kuhn book called the structure of scientific revolutions\nAnd that book said that we live in a paradigm or a worldview kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history and\nThat was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating\nAnd then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen out you're not ready and I didn't apply for the job at no at sciences but it was about ... Fifteen\nYears later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe show for your university no\nThat's right we are looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological lens\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that\nKind of notion\nThat there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough the understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer right\nIt is any relationship with the family\nWell it's you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but ah actually ... brewery which you'll remember I remember the Troy lists and so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nDo they do the huge do college which beer you know I don't know I haven't really ... I'm sure\nRight although micro breweries have taken over\nWhat would it be you know what have you learned about\nDeath experiences of all the other side what what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture\nTakes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment that the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and pays\nA then that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world view or a culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nAnd if people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intention is very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to ... you know make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across it during the ... [laughter]\nEvery day more and more [laughter] I think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about\nThese different cultures expect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the actual are in Ecuador and you know they really do believe that at night they're consciousness leaves the body when they're dreaming\nWe'll talk about that it's an amazing story so many more Dr Merrill Lynch ... with us her website is her name and we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com that makes it really easy [noise]\nFree zone email newsletters send out six days a week and it was a great way to keep up on all things coast we detailed program recaps the fascinating today and strangeness listing upcoming just info and weekly free audio clip\nIt must have caused them for the re sign up on the coast to coast am dot com ...

think the jury would decide based on his their life after death\n[noise] I think most people believe there's something there I think people have had experiences that\nGive them a sense that I think that there are a lot of experiences that people report you know\nBeyond the survival of consciousness or identity you know people ... reporting of like pre cognition knowledge of the future\nUh people you know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location whole remote viewing paradigm they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that\nThe majority of our population in including people with\nHigher levels of education report so this isn't just something that people experience and they have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is is something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their lives\nAnd you have written in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and full or and less filled with stress and anxiety and how can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspective and opinions but it's also possible that people\nYou know began to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences\nCan lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious then we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mistakes and we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation send and that in that we really created kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHow'd the younger people react to these things now what do you think\nWell I think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of\nUh there's certainly a lot of fascination with I you know horror movies I think you were talking about that last program\nYou know I think our imaginations are very fertile I think popular culture has a way of training us and we know that these kinds of topics are extremely interesting for people who choose TV shows or movies to go see\nSo what's that about you know is that about just something that is idle curiosity or is it something that helps them to take a deep dive into their own personal experiences and I think the ladder maybe what's happening\nWants to take some calls will pick it up by going to Giovanni in Los Angeles on the wild card line either\nGiovanni hey how's it going your great me it's been a war\nYeah and I've been a while and I'm always listening I Love the show as always and a doctor Marilyn thank you so much for the work that you're doing on consciousness absolutely that's very your pioneer and I hope you continue doing your work and I hope that this uh this this birth\nMore a wonder and and and and after you off into this world\nBut uh I just wanted to share that experience of mine that are just really springs to mind when I heard you talk about the about the forests are about the jungle it ended up being a form of consciousness or out of a of kind of a a pure consciousness\nWell my parents are from Nicaragua and uh our our indigenous people are very very uh very rich culture of uh\nOf mysticism and and also ah you know being able to travel and to you know injured eventually and and uh and explore the potential of the mind through um through an ancient practices\nAnd so it's been instilled in me overtime or the practice meditation one uh one one one one moment at one time I'm\nOn my travels I was traveling Nicaragua and the Nick and Nick and in Nicaragua there's a a jungle called last Monday going out or roughly transmitted the the black a jungle and uh this this\nBlack jungle is just is an illusion jungle with\nMost of it as untouched by man very rarely ex lord still still rich with with a with a with undiscovered of\nLord knows what's out there but uh when I was in the jungle I sat down to meditate and while I was meditating maybe an hour in my meditation I felt what I believed to be this pure consciousness I felt the jungle\nCalling you ask me now it was so strong that I had trouble breaking for my meditation and and to a certain point I became a little bit\nHammered a bit bit fearful because I was I kind of lost control over my ability to extract myself from the meditation for a moment\nAnd I believe that this pure consciousness was was calling me or or or trying to pull me into it somehow\nAnd I wanted to share that consciousness I Do believe that there's more out there ... and ah the more we explore the more we'll find just like you say yes we put it into our mind that there's something there and we will find it as opposed
