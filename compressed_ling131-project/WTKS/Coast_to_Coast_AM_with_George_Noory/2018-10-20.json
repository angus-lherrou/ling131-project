two hundred and twenty thousand are paid for home in Roanoke, Virginia that is not a ... that's all right great house as a matter of fact\nI'm well above average square footage and the United states in a great neighborhood by definition in the realm of market that's what the house so I I couldn't do it um if you want to do it you can do it um but I certainly can't tell you to do what I what Sharon and I would do\nWhat we worked our butts off to get out of debt and there's nothing will get us back in there is nothing I Want bad enough to go back in the dead\nAnd there's a lot of stuff I'd

default\nThree months ago I put my town home on the market and my wife my pennant I get help um found her own place currently sitting on the the entire complex that it and has gone down in value from my unit is very shifting ... less than what I had bought it for five years ago\nRight now I'm terrified that unit to hang dialing land mine and might not have a lower\nPrice added like a thousand dollars good uh yesterday a\nHimalayan it came on the market in the last one hundred Ninety I asked him starting to feel a bit of egg and Peter how because it hitting nprmontagne tightening I was thinking of capital my price one Ninety four and adding contests that out over paid X months way of kind of\nGot anything out there that I Would pay five to six thousand dollars out of pocket on the

out of pocket that'd be one limiting factor in Ireland I don't know what I'm going to judge the situation and\nHow quickly are these things dropping\nOverall and uh you know that's going to give me my urgency um I don't I don't want to just get emotional about it I'm going to judge the future and say these things are going down in value there is already five of them on the market\nI've got to be the lowest one on the market um this is not looking good you know so um I Would I drop it another fifty thousand no I wouldn't you know so you know so at some point you do you laugh right in and

had this romantic belief that area and cultural superiority based on nature's laws all dressed up in political pseudo scientific biology and it was offered encouraged would ecological apocalyptic ideas that certain people\nWere a burden on resources and the environment and some argue that many people believe that in order to bring balance to nature\nWe had to eliminate certain people we had to kill off some of the population so people were rounded up and killed means\nCenturies prior we're European columnist who took the land for the natives because they were believed to be a strain on the resources their beliefs were different than the puritan beliefs\nAnd so they hunted them down and kill them she was always this\nAffect the process for creating an agreed upon way of hunting down and killing other human beings in order to boost to some sort of agenda in order to make you feel better about your belief system because these are believed that you don't necessarily agree with it so when you have like for example the times I'm assuming which trials\nThere were governors who are complicit in carrying out a lot of the atrocities and the public trust is always exploited in situations like bees\nAnd it would be opinion of the political elite that the day but these changes the b._b._c. is that we're seeing we're actually happening because there was this work going on this working\nThe devil is like today that there was a polarization of the people on on one side we have the devil and the other side we add God I didn't\nThere was something else and there was black magic being used in other ways of trying to I guess take care of the governors take care of the leaders go against the bankers it's just a never ending process in fact Thomas sharing it on our show today we're talking about the attack and it's being planned tomorrow on justice cabinet\nAnd I mean a lot of these actions have not been you know a lot of the uh uh different people have very views on what

I've had people with whom I prayed over whether the as you say that the ... I mean there's not a physical\nLike somebody putting a bag over somebody and all of a sudden there there's a a different had right I have seen the contours of a person's face change in may and and appear to be reptilian and and and and have the head of a cobra\nA and I and I when I said is to people they have a very difficult time believing I oh I Do not I've I've I've seen this\nPhenomenon is

kinds of darkness and that we won't be if we don't know how to be prepared for it in fact I Want to talk about that coming of Thomas about what to do to prepare for what is coming because it seems there are a lot of people out there\nThat are using a magic and the paranormal as a weapon and I think that the weaponized seeing this type of a magic if you will this type of a practice is dangerous

colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analyst\nGroup and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me to feeding\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us\nNational security adviser John Bolton is reportedly are pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the ion air for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nOf course the Russians or suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that a wave tractor cruise missile recalled nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria are of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe powerful renewal of a twenty two new start and you know President Trump said I'm ... weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow ... concern to solve it you know that is cutting back dramatically\nA nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven or vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really\nOff the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S we're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began his largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers\nOr this was a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the\nRussians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand a soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia straight at the United states now practicing what I Would consider\nBombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear\nAnti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the north Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the cold\nWar when President Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated\nSome might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their\nTheir passions for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest as perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back\nAgainst the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania that'd be entire a\nFormer Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down\nCame to this country met with Bush Camp David we had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course have captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because they want to rise again they want to be a great power again\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\n[noise] it is a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other uh components to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of the the Russians and the Chinese becoming a bed me is is driven by\n... in any way or are there still vestiges of\nA communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many\nWell a combination of things uh I don't if not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy if it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence and we're the nation is as opposed to what they would call an amoral west\nA and the things that they represent they paint or the wife says what Hollywood is spewing all of the world and they said you don't want that in fact you know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nAnd the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he you know even though we suffer Terry and he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in\nThe ... in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but you know it was just this week\nYou had you know a a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hint at perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in\nThis case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course ah yeah this past march they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion a predatory economics strategic extortion\nInformation warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and\nThere was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been rushing Chinese prime leaders have been meeting here recently and their parents ministers just met you know for taking time over the top\nSorry for the interruption I got to jump in here will pick us up on the other side of the lines of evil lieutenant colonel Robert

S.\nIt will manipulate the information at a strategic level that will harm our interests are not only you know interference of elections\nUm but uh certainly in jeopardize our dominance in space or satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just\nThe military it's economic it's diplomatic ah it's\nAll these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world and you ... on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and is helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things on the use of the cloud et cetera um that that's disturbing or you know they are a U.S company and\nYou would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and not become a pawn in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're doing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising\nChinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that\nA country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's leading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way or they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because uh the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a cause Shelby\nUm and how that might mean there was there or dominoes at play here obviously\nI'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states or the Trump Administration should proceed ah with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary situation is it\nTragic but if you've been watching Mohammed then psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nAnd the so called Davos and the the desert which he was expecting all these ah donors and investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so they can develop a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course now they could go to the Chinese are Russians but they don't want to because are typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nAh ... how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with and of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians in Chinese are aligned with Iran\nAnd were lined up with a Riyadh a regime I'm Merrill ... they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west where not all excited about uh but the reality is that um\nYou know a friend of my you know my friend you know what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is my friend or something like that that the idea being that we we have to have partners in that part of the

Decatur or destroyer\nOr in the grave and race in the south China Sea the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of bi fifty to shut it flew over a you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that these islands uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here defense weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers with the practice from\nThat these are claimed by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range South China so this is not just\nNext door to them it's really in the middle of a sea but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air as I indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for\nOr are given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did a in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we kill a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent a the Assad regime a and of course uh the Russians wife their hands of that even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any time scenario or is it is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into says ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the the dog a mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president of turkey is really a seeks to be the collie and\nTo establish a cow of fat and his statements have been\nVery very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but you know the release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently was after great pressure we put on him a aired on a to cooperate with us but yet\nWe find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places current cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA and he consistently has had over the years a very ambitious thoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that some\nOf these are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians\nWho of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together uh and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together\nYou see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of our lives\nAnd the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria hoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so\nA lot of players here a confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to one and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know that's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through muzzle to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her want her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait\nUm air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the U.S for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or the even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the med from the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to run\nA and on the coastline there then you can begin to make a\nPlutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what I heard one wants to\nAlternately well it's just too rich so the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO ostensibly use to protect NATO from Russian missile\nYes and that you know because we will not connect our patriots and other fat to a Russian as four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk practiced secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his Islam ec viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nOr we don't acknowledge a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up to no good\nIf there were to be regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that'll come about by the Iranian people\nAre just getting fed up with the situation with you and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so Iran has regime change how does that change the equation [noise]\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the\nYou know the military and their diplomacy or you know for me to\nPromote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic world view of of the ... when I I think that you find that they're not involved with the who teaser not involved with Assad uh they're less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests\nAnd perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia Riyadh into Iran it's going to continue a buddy ... if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his law in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas and\nYou know Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history\nAnd were were they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another fallout from that are positive aspect of that might be a\nLiberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the ... were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects in in Saudi Arabia is well

Bush Iraq Iran North Korea back is illegal\nNow your book is your equal but we want perpetrate evil around the world where the weapons of destruction everywhere even a theory or\nOr or or not did not do one you're going to try to get people year we're still lives there and that he did or what your response or [noise]\nYeah well I certainly had a question in their\nRichard ... it is it is perspective um yeah I think that the the history of the Russian a Soviet Union certainly and where they killed millions a under mouth and China where they kill millions\nA and their foreign policy where they provoked all sorts of proxy wars um the the types of values that they support uh yeah we do sell weapons her defense security cooperation agency has done a robust year this year double what we did last year\nWe we made mistakes with some of our alliances and the like uh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is\nA we don't have any friends we just have interest and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what the United States needs to secure itself and to prosper um sometimes uh in the eyes of the beholder it is is evil or\nCertainly in my perspective and I've you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I look at their history and I look at what they want today and it's certainly not what my country wants and I do believe a United States\nIs not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and care for our interests over there's\nParticularly because you know people talk about democracy and and how that is really what protects a freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization\nWhich I look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world they don't have rule of law it is the wild west and there are no protections afforded to the individual you can be literally swept off the street in the middle of the night and executed\nAh for for no reason in most places in the world\nA and to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims that are incarcerated in West\nAnd the western China Today and that's a un report or somebody can look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong and we've acknowledge that\nWe do bad things but the rest of the world you know I I have\nI've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world I've seen some pretty bad places um and\nYet you know it's always wonderful to come back home to the United states where we enjoy the rule\nOf law we aren't afraid as Richard pointed out of being arrested pulled out of bed and shot and they had 'em for families being carted away and yet unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and\nThe likes of the Chinese are doing some of that to their own people and so they're all\nGotta jump in here and thank you so much for spending two hours with an alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War thank you
