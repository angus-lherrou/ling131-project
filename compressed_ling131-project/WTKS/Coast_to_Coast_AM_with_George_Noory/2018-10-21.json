a bad one right is fairly safe\nIt was it was the environment changed around it now for this house here in Jamestown did you find any existing nominate two that were still active\nOh yeah there were definitely most of the house had some now than to than there were a lot of things tapped off of that now than to just like I just said people trying to get something that they didn't have and make it

wanted to learn loves what she does so those types of people are always fun to be around\nSo they were brought on this show basically as an example of what we eat in this country which is young people that are learning skilled trades do you think they were good ... for that mission\nOh for sure yeah you know they both love what they do they both loved to learn about what they do so that's a great

but definitely a great guy very very nice to talk to a very knowledgeable and very interested in this whole Generation Next than apprenticeship proliferation stuff so\nHe's a great guy in that field and he didn't make a federal case [laughter]\nNo no he was very easy going you know you could just tell that that's really his passion is to get young people to trade jobs that will really carry them a long way\nWell you guys have done a great job at doing just that then Giles thanks so much for something to go to the ... the inspiration leadership that you've shown by helping these young skilled

should they get interest when I can get it that's right and then when I have to sit down and I have to write the check I'm I'm really angry for a while oh yeah and then I forget\nYeah it just makes too much that it will ever happen\nThat's correct they're not they're not fools\nYou have a good they are or\nWhat would you choose or thanks were cheering me up that's right if they hold the

the Supreme Court quit hearing any cases I\nWell I'll tell you something it it may be well that they're not hearing cases on it because they're a maybe a case\nTo suggest that it would be a state's rights issue and that the Supreme Court would say the second amendment only applies state by state or I Want to ask I interviewed judge Bork and that's what he said that's what he said he believed\nIt could be the tenth amendment that's given that\nSo I wouldn't be too much of a hurry especially in the present climate\nYeah but for for the last three years the Supreme Court has refused to hear any case on the second amendment\nThat's what I said you may you probably ought to be saying thank you because that leaves it in a gray area if it goes to the court that could be it\nYeah [noise] yeah on a lighter note at that conference call you had the other day with the with the old tour\nThe people um that was that was really fascinating what what are you referring to\nOh the the conference call with um I was trying to think about the permits and everything\nOh yes yes yes yes oh uh you mean the Graham Hancock Robert Duvall a Richard ... extravaganza\nOh that was that was fantastic well\nUh it was a lot of people miss understood it was such a critical important thing that was actually being argued they thought we should have done the show on what might have been under those things are in the ... or whatever but what was being argued was near term extremely important\nAnd um so like some people were disappointed they well they want to talk about what was in there or not the politics of what was going to be done to get in there but it's so uh right on top of is that it wasn't important argument very important\nYou had asked him about that you have a ... and also the strange animal in

saying in the summer of two thousand and five\nThomas's taught a class based on the sad thing for the center for lifelong learning he's spoken publicly numerous times both in person and on the radio and in September twenty twelve you spoke for the prestigious lecture series mind and soup\nMind which is run by the SBC see Graham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the month for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty fourteen\nYears the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics\nWe're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might spend some money to get that um\nThat young student who had bound the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and he would have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but this time there's\nThis guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his\nMuscles weren't for this guy really late into him and the trauma into his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake mediums he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he would even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know we say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to the sky or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and\nAnd uh you know the fake media would be totally surprised and you say you and you say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a ball of of disgruntled psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry right behind\nHim up that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I ... I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife or were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini\nA and therefore it may have been possible for so much you know about that because now we get into the say on and and uh we should back up and explain that aren't Houdini deathbed in Detroit\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this is actually true but allegedly told them that\nYeah I'm a skeptic I I I'm a bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try and then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he how Ford get in touch with best\n[noise] well I'll touch an interest in it but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked because bath and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments\nChecking into reality as if it's a heartless machine\nAnd I think it's really important for us to think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry die [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and\nIn his on putting the word for give an all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to pass\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul were spirit with surviving gap and so this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was well aware of\nHoudini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDid Thomas I got a jump in here forgive me Thomas I gotta jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking is going to the break with do me on coast to coast them\n[noise]\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo I didn't\n\n[noise]\nSeven votes out or to find nothing hours animal and he's the most lenient muscles and buy a new Web site for Apple's like time\nDuring early voting handled on a regimen of all voted\nFor him and voice I'm an epidemic well ... when you see chaos\n\n\n\nYou know goes to goes to the you\nKnow use your guest host Richard ...\nSay hello on Twitter at Richard Sayre and asked why because I Love you R.

and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com Thomas tight Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nHe was in a really bad car accident he was with his sister ... eyes car accident and his healing processes hated by pain killers and some of this is um morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later you know the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSay on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James Pike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah yeah and I think it's in I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for it and how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the tip of the secret to his own that\nYou're kind of breaking up on his Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nI'm James ... this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little up front research brings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went to his papers\nAnd found his research preparing for this say on and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is in his exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredited the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's\nPut the cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is a\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to duty than it is and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know at first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail so she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and\nAnd that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and Simon and go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream belief\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm now someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo a whole world that Harry Houdini still live and they will prove it

true story they don't want you to know Steve you any welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nRichard I'm graders what have you back\nI have to tell you after we did that to that program on who murdered Elvis back in August I received just a deluge of email um people arguing back and forth a um because for many people this was such a new information\nAnd here we go look at this time FDR and I expect a sort of a a similar reaction um these who murdered books and how how do people received them obviously you know people are they're they're flying off the the book shelf people are buying them but do you get also some pushback because\nYou're you're this is kind of uncomfortable for some people you're you're pulling their their reality out from under them\nPlaying with people's normalcy bias and they don't like it [laughter] you know people like that um you know\nPeople always tend to believe the first story we're told you know I'm only some of the stories that were first told them I was born in one of your work to shovel the victory but\nUm you know a lot of history has been sanitized or you know and people don't like it when you re investigation things and uh and what kind of pull the rug out from under him\nIn the case of the things that I write I as I was asked me to write history and I just really impacting what's how have you found out there just because I have a you know I'm\n... you know you like the question was in her life history for table was so I have to be very careful when I write the books not to fall into confirmation bias commissioned by its meaning was was on its back actually\nI'm finding just the fact that you want to grant you that sort of losing\nThat can be very careful not to fall into that because out of every four or five books that I start to look into that one might make it will be information that I bought and so it's not like I just say well that's right [laughter] it don't work that way than function thanks you were asked to go so\nFar right now in the case of FDR um you know this is Seventy almost Seventy five years ago three quarters of the century I mean was it or was it difficult at this stage in the game to to reopen this very very cold case\nThey're all they're always difficult because I never want to know everything there is a germ students read all of us like truth justice and the American way and you don't want to think of anything sinister is going on a you know behind your back and so so they're all they're all they're\nAll I just I just mean finding the documents I'm Sorry say again\nI I just mean finding the documents or uncovering the the the real facts of the case after all this time\nWell what I did as a I went through the laws about mansion\nAnd upstate when Hyde Park New York which was a terrific place to be able to get a chance to go and spend an hour or two it was\nA beautiful place in the Roosevelt mansions I'm here to ... but all her overhead is the national archives shuttle Iceland a tremendous amount of time the Marshall archives of winning the opinions with top secret previously\nAnd they're huge files there on the hour and a his wife Eleanor ... there's that's very corrupt filing cabinet right in the middle or the animal's struggle over actually\nBut and I want to Roosevelt and actually the communism she was being invested their investigator for being a comment on so you know it's it's who you will never had that information years ago you know\nSo that's one of the majority promotion came from is from the original documents and I'm turned out to be a way to reach that expires robbing people the wrong way I think everybody Rob somebody the wrong way for doing something you know I don't really even I mean listen all\nRight well truth is often uncomfortable it's a it's it's not about necessarily making people feel good it's it's like a scorpion sometimes things um but you it needs to say you don't\nPaint a flattering picture of of FDR you mentioned a communism although you know let's be honest communism was was kind of the fat back then before people knew I guess the real truth about what was happening in Stalinist Russia and the er the programs and the the the the forced\nA started nations in the Ukraine and so forth\nUm but um let's let's talk about a young FDR talk about someone born with a silver spoon in his mouth\nA paint me I'm a ... a portrait of a young FDR\nNo yeah I was a I pledge they always say use beneficiary of the lucky sprung up this guy was\nBorn in week who\n[laughter] you know I mean is it they were just sitting in the news was old world well I mean there are on ground where quarter mile down the road is the Vanderbilt man\nYou know they're on the same basic parcel of land I mean to say that this guy was wealthy in and had every single thing if you have the desired was an understatement\nUm you know the big every one people at nothing\nSo um he was a you know it was ... was out around does not establish student um sees all the way through school or he'd rather roof off and go play football and so forth and uh\nIt was a well I Can't use the words that I wanted it was but it was a little something it was really a you know this\nIs really something I think that anyone is there for the asking and his political where it started out with the loss of Maine and in ... physicians\nAnd they blossom them being I Wonder if you are a lot of people don't know what I was governor of New York edited forgot that they're just not talking about let me more or less you know he he was the road will mean maybe just cause I Know [laughter]\nAll the Roosevelt was born a Roosevelt maybe Roosevelt spider Roosevelt which was a little odd or the woman got ready to change the monitor grammar and part of your life actually [laughter]\nUm you know I mean this is the evolution of the gift person\nAt least his cousin teddy was his was a distant cousin was the second or third cousin\nBecause it was a second cousin right\nAnd and he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he received his younger cousin and the Democrats\nWell they got along really well\nI'm at the our father wasn't too thrilled about that because that was just not the way that he was raised with a that Roosevelt name was done anything to find out if he was um ordinarily a full on their special unlike some\nOf those so he did a lot of things without unsavory than some self marrying his thoughts on on funding a\nNumber of Teddy Roosevelt you know that in public there's awful lot of ways so you know he was a ... benefitted from the laws will name as well so\nRight and he was also governor of New York lots of you know he would you know he was also governor of New York which is ... has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah it has happened that way through history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have um these sort of I I think of George Bush a senior in trying to buy stocks in Kmart back in the er the remember that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man and there was a famous\nTV report he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know while he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter]

and a a scientist has created a representation of what the world really looks like\nA true map of the world and you can check it out it's a posted in the in the new section of the coast to coast am

problem is it's very difficult to portray the reality of a ... world on a flat map and so you get this distortion\nIt's called their Mercator projection map\nOr the most commonly seen hanging in classrooms in textbooks it was created back in Fifteen Ninety six I think it's maybe time we have to wait and see what was it was designed to help sailors navigate the world ... the Mercator projection buddy distorts seriously distorts the size of land masses\nSo for example you may have noticed that a while Africa is around fourteen times larger than Greenland and yet on the map\nBoth are almost the same size Greenland is huge on these maps Brazil another example Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska yet Alaska is much larger than Brazil on the map much larger\nThe map also suggested Scandinavian countries are larger than India whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together\nLooks like Europe is larger than North America on on these old maps but in reality the reverse is true Russia isn't as large as its depicted with Africa larger than Russia in reality so if you want to see the world is it really is represented on a

Mussolini at first he was in awe of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but you know again I'm history books being what they are that tendency over the last\nUm [noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed and night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn 'em coverage of the tree and in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that\nPersonal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way I'm\nAnyway are we going into the war and we're we don't have anything to do was down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there how close\nEngland cans are losing their island they were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel and this was what their MO was they used to go and lay down air strikes bomb them into oblivion and then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially with France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them I'm of course the two at my previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church shows the one who\nGather together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans because they were so similar to the time\nThat style and in America and the the American president FDR were working\nIn unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be from\nSo you know the answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great birds I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on he wouldn't have been his fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure calling us I mean there's ...\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and [laughter] you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their faces a ... million\nFDR it seemed to a ... and reading a book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or but that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we need it's balanced island in the U.S\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and installing a pack well ill or violated the fact and\nWent after style in which completely blue silence mind and they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march\nAnd then you know it was ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to ... because it held his namesake so now it was leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go toward styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing\nA winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission\nAnd he'll just says well I don't care I Want it will do it so\nStalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging at his style on the table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a the conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran I think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have at even at this point they have their eye and sort of carving up the post war world\nA instill at this point you know I I think she was Roosevelt still looks pretty robots\nOr you know he you know by by standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nUm but I Want to back up with a minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nWorked in ... and look at what we've done and you need to do this to your country has your you know look at look at your depression that going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities town was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how are they tried to recruit Hemingway ... ed loudly\nSo it was a fictitious town that didn't exist that was made it hard work basically so they can village a Potemkin village and there you\nGo um he sends all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country maybe our country into this wonderful new ideology you didn't know what you're saying about evil empires\nYou know in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings strength going by stone stone is the puppet master\nHe ah he's this guy what he managed to accomplish with his wife was incredible\nIt was one of the six original members of the ... revolution and he ended up there just to make fun of stone it was nothing more than a he was to keep the party journals are used to call them um read a cone hundred index\nCard used to call them ... used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless when the party\nOne by one he knocked off everyone in the party to take control\nI mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was standing stop I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote the it is a quote from one of those will I'm rich donors to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after Stalin to death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nMurder I gotta I gotta jump in here Steve will take a timeout Wilson picket taking us into the break with everybody needs

I was fascinated with tall and how I got away with all the stuff when Roosevelt died Stalin set somebody to look at Roosevelt body currently and make sure that uh let's see if he was he was calling because I'm a scholar and did a lot of that\nAnd I think he would do for the story was that it would require you to ... he won that Roosevelt ... break them over the cold that the\nThat Iran and uh you know and all that and got the deal he was afraid of but ... ... again by the fact that uh that's dollar one of the debt\nCan clearly saying you know Elvis Presley did not die of any sort of heart related in a um affliction\n[laughter] now as for FDR or he was sixty three and I mentioned you know that was pretty good age for Nineteen forty five today that's fairly young uh but just because he he surpassed\nThe average lifespan I don't think it was his lowest forty nine back then but I mean George Washington you know live to be in ... I Believe in his seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point is obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be um the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts in time and um you know I spent ten years researching all this stuff\nAnd you know after we are not quite that much for sure but um there's this information in the book is is pretty compelling I Will check it out\n[noise] uh Easter the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi

down nice guy that I never have no idea how the relatives out well and you can be\nYou have a clue as to how they made their money ranching right\n[noise] well I Know that I I yeah I Do\nActually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when he came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the stock market was not as big as it is today and there were only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so\nA handful of players could really influence things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market so when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly\nAnd Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the FCC the security Exchange Commission and FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote fix the courage to crush across\n[laughter] really interesting stuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I Love to hear it but their their their money came from summer\n[noise] um and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family are probably it's all money so you know just kind of a ... to me elation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those nice to call them the Boston brain than those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be on that as well\nYeah I heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging these guys are never written a book on let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour I'd be lucky [laughter]\nBy the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach their names who wants to be as best they can\nYou know for them as

the paradox of enlightenment\nAnd his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm way Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying as strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred\nFor these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um\nHe um was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics\nWe're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had been on the boxing\nTeam to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and he would have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but\nThis time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma into his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why he passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and\nThey would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he would even get the guy that was in control of light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer and the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know we say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to the sky or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer would take a picture and\nAnd uh you know the fake media would be totally surprise you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a ball of of disgruntled a psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task\nOf of uh yeah this\nWriting on beating on Harry write them\nUp that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was ... I just wanted to ask\nYou about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a ... to find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between\nThem that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important for you to point out that this secret coded message\nWas sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini a and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because now we get into the sale and and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this is actually true but allegedly told them that I'm a skeptic I I I'm a ... I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try and then she has contacted basses\nSeveral years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he how did for get in touch with best\n[noise] well I took an interest in it but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked\nBecause bath and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine\nAnd I think it's really important for us to think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nUm Ford was reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in his\nMind putting the word for give an all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death well that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have and she says\nIt's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul were spirit with surviving gap and so this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither best Houdini nor Arthur forward pursued this any more they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was well aware of Houdini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDid this I got a jump in here forgive me Thomas I gotta jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking us into the break with do me on coast to coast them [noise]\n\n[laughter]\nNo\nNo I didn't\n\nWe will not eat\n[noise]\nNews the use of bad news news radio Ninety seven point seven after him and well ... ... am when you see chaos\n\n\n\nThe mirror networks presents goes to goes to the you know use your guest host Richard ...\nSay hello on Twitter at Richard Sayre and asked why because I Love you R.
