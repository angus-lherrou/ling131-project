I mean I I ... I don't tell people to buy a home when they're in debt okay so if you call me how to time I was told you ought to buy but this house is not like you know if you call me up you're making thirty hundred dollars your house payments Fifteen hundred dollars now we got a problem\nI'm going to put that house on the market but your house payment is way less than a force of your take on pay\nAnd so you're fine I mean it's really not your problem\nI think you guys are just starting to budget and uh the emotional weight of a a of dealing with the medical situation you're facing and when you're with your baby I mean when you're babies' heart and they're just that's just it just wears you down you know it just makes you human her makes you a good daddy and a good mommy\nBut according to the truth is it makes it kinda hard to see past ah I'm just looking at the ... numbers right now I don't ... I mean I I\nIll for you guys know pray for you but I don't have the emotional weight that you guys have got facing the stuff you face every day dealing with this situation you know so\nThat's just very real a ... but but the math actually you know thirty eight hundred bucks minus nine hundred dollars minus a eight hundred dollars for a house payment or you know minus ... minus ... minus water doesn't leave a lot of room but you could pay your payments on everything doing that\nAnd then you can pick up your overtime and start making some headway on some of these deaths and cleaning them often as they these little that's clean all these credit cards outstanding medical bills in student loans clean off\nYou know over the next year and a half two years you're gonna start having a little bit of wiggle room and you guys will keep moving forward and head but I think that's the you're just\nYou know you're just feeling the weight of all of this and it's kind of clouding it's this is doable though where are you are is doable I I think you can pull it off no I Would not sell your house or would not about it because I don't ever tell anybody to buy a house where we got that but\nIt's your house is not like when I hear those numbers on my like what are you crazy none of that so there none of it you're you're it's very very reasonable\nUh for your situation now would it help if you earn an extra thousand bucks a month you're dead gum rotted would clean this mess up faster two thousand bucks a month to even faster so are you have you got a couple of years are really hard work and lots of overtime and saw jobs ahead of you yup you sure do\nAre you guys gonna be taking a bunch of fans who vacations nope you got a bunch of that\nYou're cleaning it up at your reality but hold on I'll have Kelly pick up we're going to get your copy of the total money make over book and give it to ya and help get you started and if you need some more help you call me I'll help you in any way I can\nI'm Sorry you guys are facing all these challenges but I think you're up for it I think you can do the math makes sense to me that you're giving me unless there's something we left out of this equation so thank you for the call Josh is with us in Los Angeles Hi Josh how are you\nGood how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] not too much I've got a question for you among baby steps which it pay off my house early [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't have any other debt inside my house I have a six month emergency fun um but I kinda did all your stuff out of order because I've never really liked that but anyway um [noise]\nI have a hundred and sixty four thousand dollars less pay off my house but I also have about a hundred thousand dollars invested in mutual funds and stuff like that and I'm curious\nWould it be wiser to um take that hundred thousand dollars out of my personal investment put that all towards the house and then just pay off the remaining sixty four thousand or should I leave that money invested and the money that I have every month just accelerate payment from my house\n... what's your household income\nUh probably about a hundred and fifty thousand\nSo you could be like dead free in one year if you did this\nUh um yeah yeah I'd be done by the end of next year I'm sure if I if I took the hundred thousand for the house\nAnd if your house was paid for and you didn't have any money in investments would you borrow a hundred thousand on your home to putting investments no shame putting in it\nUm I don't follow okay\nWell I mean if you have a hundred thousand dollars in an investment and you take it out of the investment in order to put in and pay off your home that's the same thing in reverse if you didn't do that it's the same thing is if you if you leave it in the investment it's the same thing is borrowing on your home to invest isn't it\nGot it yeah\nOkay so it's a balance sheet equation meaning that balance sheet is where you list your assets on one side of the pager liabilities on the other side of the page\nAnd right and you can switch them back and forth by borrowing money\nMeaning if you were sitting there with no investments paid for house you could you could borrow money and put you know money you have data over there on that one side of the page but on the other side of the ... now you'd have an investment right and all I'm doing is on doing that by asking the question in reverse though it's a bit of a trick I kind of ...\nUh the trick is that it makes you think not just with your head but also with your heart\nAnd I always like to think of when my my head is where I Do math in my heart for a measure risk\nAnd your real risk averse you hate that like I Do yeah and so the idea of borrowing on a paid for house you create an investment is absurd and your mind\nYeah I mean you immediately\nReacted but that's a hard thing to me that's where that's at risk bart that that you're measuring that's causing you do that you didn't stop and do math you went you recoiled and went crazy and your mind right you know\nAnd that that but ... and start by asking it in reverse so all of that to say yes I Do the hundred grand at it in a heartbeat I assume it's just not in a retirement account no penalties right\n[noise] [noise] uh no that that hundred thousand is just going back right yeah and the only thing is I mean you're talking about the head and the heart and just with\nThe mathematics of it I'm ... years of it if you leave ... lawyer if I if you put risk in the mathematics of it and it changes the mathematics and so and and so your\nHeart is actually correct your heart is helping you do a complete measure of the mountain\nAnd so yes I take the money out of their house

FBI or maybe even solve the boat uh we're talking about that right now\nI I guess my point is I'll Try to sell it because there is a ... it would cost the state to a well with him getting in carpets or so a lot of those costs just as an uh as far as buying\nIs going to you when you call a program stick to topic it's going to fill the hype fill up your own ground zero\nClad Hi I just had a\nMemory out the story that they're still going on in in the summer of two thousand one right before nine eleven and a matter of fact that morning nine eleven before the trade towers had on a reporter's stand outside a Democrat Senator name that guy ...\n... and and the investigation on the ... sugar levy remember that\nYeah I remember that it it after the planes hit the towers and\nThere was also getting a function that they the art but after the towers that story was that was God I didn't hear about it\nOr have you been to say oh I Love you I mean but she she disappeared in May of two thousand one right and uh yeah I mean\nThat was a the hot news item until the the towers went down and then that everyone was like by\nAfter that you know no more are talking about Gary Condit\nWell I'm thinking this is comparable would have enough for\nWell I I yeah I I but Gary wasn't planning on a or B being achieved justice [laughter] we're having one again we have an extramarital affair story we have\nA a dead woman Chandra Levy a we have an investigation started in may and probably just disappeared off the map after that no one cared about it because of the nine eleven attacks\nAnd you're right you know there's a ... that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad to have a bat but uh I Would say that you know they're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many people lost track of what happened was on her leaving the Chandra Levy case\nWould Gary Cohn did that is if they were able to look through the ... the nine eleven attacks\nRight okay well I got out there and I'll let you get to know that very good\nVery good point though very good comparison history you get your brownie points for being a story

back in September\nAnd then I ... when the when I was one plus one add up to nine\nPlus one plus one yep twelve\nNine oh what a loving sorry that's right although nine eleven had\nThe total eleven twenty Eighteen eleven you have this thing going on at two Eighteen as you said right\nWhich is an eleven eleven yeah and\nWe just had a job or who was murdered in DC not too long ago\nRyan Miller to what was discussed just recently by the previous caller right Kentucky yeah it does have an air quality to it in\n... you might want to get technical when was the ground broken for the Pentagon\nWhat I've what day was that September eleventh\nAll right yeah I'm saying just one thing but I was calling up about the rice and and to to go on Ben and I forgot where the young man was from but when he was speculating on it being possibly from someone on the Republican or or Republicans sympathetic side because\nIf you recall back in terms of predicting programming\nWhat happened to the general in Venezuela where they accused him of staging his little assassination attempt with that drone ... might have tip their hand right they're letting you know in advance what was coming\nWhile I mean you can see that there was something going on with these uh when I called these gain and function exercise I Believe the Emirates plane was part of that\nI Believe that when you have a group of people on

they're moving a shift to the ass off to see a off of the Ukrainian coastline over there in Crimea right and so I mean there's a lot of powder keg occurring right now within the war\nRight and so there are a lot of distractions but the thing is is that how are these distractions affecting them both how are they affect you invest you know\nThe vote I Will tell you you don't have to I wouldn't even worry about it because I'm already screaming now the court has been de legitimize by Mitch McConnell's machinations and when something comes down that's going to be a dramatic decision that will

a court you can't make it political\nHow you feel though if the FBI did not release the information about Kavanaugh in his activities when he was in high school\nOh I Would be I Would be ripping but

I'm Sorry to tell you it's not speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when as far as news that I heard it already from inside or that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressure them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just a value wait a certain times in certain other things he could be guilty as hell and they wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but don't Mitch O'Connell has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nAs a

your thoughts on whether those global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box tell me about the title first of all\n... this is a book that tells you what your green consult doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over his think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they're forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and are populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nIn in my presentations and I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man's since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nAnd they knew\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ice is getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit\nUm if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying this huge sheets of ice falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew it was\nA Antarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have a big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about the city's not want renewable energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional a nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind a you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries so this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure\nUh some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the cost of a wholesale electricity\nAnd that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good\nUh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about in my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes\nUh all modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S are lined with a with a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide actress oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe the ... the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and he this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah it\nIs kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible a man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect\nBut over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so so a natural factors dominate\nUm and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth has dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of it just cycles which are uh\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that a scientist believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm\nUm the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather and our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example than the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's

Streever wrote a book\nCalled the coming global superstorm and that inspired a movie\nCalled the day after tomorrow and when I was wondering was or is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what these protections\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with\nYellow stone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming and the Kentucky or is it very possible that the fans in both of those movies that very well happen [noise]\nYeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under their call during the day after tomorrow is based on the idea that um manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream\nWhich is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian in the Pacific the\nThe theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there\nUm to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fear though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream Muslim slowing down and really not happening\nThere was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this is an actual thing right\nLet's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll egg and they'll make you\nStill don't think whoa okay go ahead you're on\nA Monday morning who ah who quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking\nAbout wind field when I\nWhen I was living in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind you know that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat\nAnd it was up by plenty more boy blue flame you know they were were burning off the methane gas\nWhile we're asking now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know electricity now come back and they had no no no it's going to cost ... can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that\nAnd they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Want to go why hasn't been anything done about that\nWell I think there are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things\nThat's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi George and thank you for having Steve von Loor bumped into smoking to him several times I heard him on many shows\nAnd he has a breath of fresh air and inside and that accuracy a there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends she\nNot to make the same mistake that these are climate change hopes are are are using a bag lady I Believe you said\nA one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion ... it's quite a few of those are those are the United nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nWell I was using the one point three billion a papal\nTwo dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day or we would have just\nNine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double their two dollars a day just four dollars a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject man and a a ... a a young child than a\nHere's the point is you've already said they're more willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what's frosty has told us is this is just sat in thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people's daily\nA dollar allowance or will somehow going to a massive really\nImprove their lives they're doing All right with out is just lost the will ridge a lot of them are are counting illegally into this country because they had been tricked and seeds into thinking they're going to get a better quality of life and they had down there\n\nOn the weekends we have great programs like crime suffers focus at nine

we're short most every agency that I'm aware of is short [noise] it's a tough job to get into and a lot of people just aren't willing to to do it any more\nIs challenges but it's also very rewarding and so I Would say to those out there that have considered a career in law enforcement ... this is probably one of the best times ever because everyone's hiring this is one of those careers at ... again very challenging but very rewarding I mean we were able to make a difference in people's lives every day the size of garden\nThis audio is for your review and now for ...

the last couple of hundred years or any politician hotels you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nThat obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there are\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about um uh there are some some um indications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well\nUm those are about five miles from the coast with historical accounts peas are used to be a big court or a big uh port\nOn in in a northwest Italy an\nExcuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise so matter what the what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I I I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a mention I perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and gum and what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is abrupt climate collapse and we\nFree care about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky they no doubt this\nA lot of ... Sandler harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove that kind of self I can tell you how to do it\nFirst of all any time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon\nBut there is a fight I it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologists he keeps on him is his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure zone coming directly into California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees\nThey can steer hurricanes they can start hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex what's happened with our weather ... when I hear about it in the new\nLuskin Steve's reaction to that Bruce IQ\nBruce uh some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across a and there's been a lot of discussion about climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead [laughter]\nWell let's go man just said is exactly right I'm One of these conservatives it happens to believe\nThat the way that is being gay oh engineered the Kim trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently at gentleman on his show\nTalking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the body now son well people are so much heck you weren't heck\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's dish to the point now where you can go to Wall Street and bet on the stock market on the weather if they want hurricanes that they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid of heart\nAnd now on top of that then you got the geoengineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct\nAnd if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea that may never come up with man is not smart enough to harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing\nWith Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham men they want they were doing is gripping the oil from industrial nations away\nDistributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China sit there with her sky completely on with pollution not paying a dime and do it either as Russia but the United states of America was going to play the oh okay now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for

um\nI've had other encounters in my life but not with the ah the hairy men and after I saw that I said to myself my God this type of thing is roaming around North America and a unlike other people who thought it was a hoax and still do to this day\nI was a I was sold on it from the beginning I just said to myself this thing is real it's out there and are these fellows or have seen it and got in on film\nYou I'm convinced people William or seeing something very strange and unusual they're not making up these stories some things out there and there's somebody on a creature\nI have no doubt about it George and are based on um the encounters into testimonies if you think about it what would make a husband and wife sell the home that day love if they hadn't had something that scare them off the land exact\nUh what makes a hunter sellers gun collection and vowed that he'll never enter into the woods again\nAfter having encountered a something in the forest uh to me is everybody a lying is everybody out of their mind I don't think so I think these people are having real uh encounters a in most cases they've been frightened half out of their wits\nAnd uh for as far as everybody else is concerned uh everything's a hoax right from the get go\nWell will come up with a number of different theories and what we all think big foot might be we'll take calls next hour I'm going to ask you this because I was raised Catholic what is it a Catholic blogger where do you do\nWell basically I uh talk about the things that I Believe a troubling mankind and uh try to get to the bottom of the

Ninety seven points ... am double duty chaos\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast here with William ... author of the big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when a\nBreak on us yes yes oh well this gentleman was ah canoeing in a creek up in Vermont and really he was poured urging stomping when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and\nAnd on this particular day he was standing there and the noise or the falls and on the opposite bank of the creek which was rewarded with toll kind of pointing spruce has inspired a pines\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee so he's watching this thing going up and down and keep them self\nWhat on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here now he couldn't cross the river\nAnd when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it all in other words there were like low gross ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it\nAnd want to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and one position and staring at him so now he's looking at it\nLooking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later he sees them less willing in the bushes on the other bank which kinda came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy coming along the bank and going out to fight in front of him into the woods so we had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think given in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with your kid in the park you know\nAnd that is right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved down to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved houses are a\nUnited sooner aren't and rural areas right\n[noise] ... yeah for the most part are people have backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very

snowman the lady from the Himalayas is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting uh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor\nWho was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of things but time Nicole\nAnd they form this unlikely friendship and turn that into a hiking partnership\nThey had run across a couple of big for its messing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor said that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was on familiar with now this is a Russian speaking immigrant\nSaying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with so when you talk about the the Eddie in ah the abominable snowman\nHard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea\nAnd it did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman a speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard\nA voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing and Minnesota and they talked on a pulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought look clear and they could sit there and rush for a little while and they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there\nOr they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ...\nAnd they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant\nAnd they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the ah the ah yesterday and the abominable below snowman I have no idea uh I have a Sanders since book the bomb Rose Bowl a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature a\nAnd yet getting back to what I said earlier\nNone of this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the globe\nThat book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about big foot or a hoax\nThe film is a hoax all of the uh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taken everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of ... what the majority of the people out there I think about it so that's one of the things I Love about coached\nYou know uh uh we all\nTune in because we're hearing things that we can't get in Oklahoma cases nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos in big encounters where's the giant\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the ... falls incident but one day they'll share with you a was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys ... we're working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and then the second day uh the focus was on that of ah getting attention being have so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words hell than SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green vows\nAnd that night they decided to go on a night hike to see what it was like a navigating around in the dark ...\nAre now during the day they had climbed up the side of the mountains to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area right night for the hike\nBut when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear\nHe had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose your own monarch yellow\nOr that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail one of the kid says hey what's that and they noticed in the distance of light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a you know a battery operated lantern but then they realized that this things started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAnd that got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they've been trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it\nFinally they got to a place where they believed there were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it they could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but\nWas about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming eating the trees around it\nRight so that their parents and that was that bright\nI mean it's it it it's a glowing or both white\n... around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world\nOne scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey\nMany times when dogs are left all alone without much interaction or attention they can become bored and then act out their frustration with nonstop
