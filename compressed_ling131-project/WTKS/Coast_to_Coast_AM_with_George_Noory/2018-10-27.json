really made is made out of great ingenuity but he said that he will hardly think I shall meet the ... power disclosed the path to forecast the future\nSo we know that the industry of do the talking board into this into the community of the spiritual Smith meant and also it in the United states only that it was an Eighteen Ninety the we used to board that we know today got its start\nIn Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point so there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada Watson writes from the United states to sell their own version of the leash a board and so they started making boards and Eighteen Ninety two\nAnd the rest is history and so bored such as Bob sports which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the wage what makes it a prominent splash into\nThe market I mean everybody was buying them and using them at the heyday I mean this has been a spiritual moves it was going big time and I was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat boards and started doing different types of the wrong type a\nBoard and of course we as a trademark path of the name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly as unique as the story of of Bob being a a suspected serial killer or making a board ah basically it's it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he would feel right about himself\nOr what have you ah in his own special way\nI'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned earlier people do make their own and start customizing assign um um but the degree of this type of story no I've never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards\nAnd it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case\nI'm In it I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted a legit or we don't know if he really was or not\nYeah we we don't know if you to be checked into somebody mental institution right in\nFact a you know that's that's the that's the thing is he avoided a any kind of prosecution because he checked in a mental institution I mean in in since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any ... any of this information to the authorities and if so did they take it seriously\nWell which is kind of awkward because I haven't really you know this is really just a small thing that I was just showing on on on we just put the color\nA Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy used to work for ... which is an old TV show or on the which was on like channel five or something right in the east and um\nShe was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board and he worked on hated like um show he did like producing I think mhm\nCurrent affairs and then he was the one who introduced it to the guys that make these um [noise] it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level like the same image to same exact\nYou know but then they took it and they just put on more quality thing with boxes and everything\nYou know in the in the background to write the background history\nYes and they were told and everything you know and they put it down\nTo they made it more like a sophisticated I guess\nBut I'm the same story and it's a very good I tell people you know not to I ... I made them put on that you can't be under Eighteen years old\nBecause this is real this is really happen this really works and it's very scary\nAnd if if you have the wrong intentions and you know everybody would call go to the same place at the end but says some bad people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to some of them back\nSo I always say that it's shot a joke ...\nNo I'm In I Want to ask her and you know I have some idea of criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use the board in a long time let's be honest with you to board a gosh I Can't count back maybe I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they used it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated or lemonade peace that had a a crystal glass so they use I mean I you know boards can rudimentary like that even even when you see the TV show stranger things that you kind of a mix you bored with Christmas tree lights so\nThat her little boy you could go to the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know ... ... it doesn't ... we really don't need ports do we care and I mean even the boards of bear or you can channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point and the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves support just becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard and to be able to to access your own ability to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here when I started working the board was at my own\nSix cents ... he started developing really started really being fine tune and taken\nSeven hundred dollars by Louis was ground zero in\n[noise] and [noise]\nAnd\nEh you\n\nAnd\nMm [noise] Mm\nAnd\nA\n\n... years ago making a murderer became let the TV show of\nForce of nature and they don't cover to re injustice in the criminal justice stuff it was also completely death on it and I would know a dead O'Donnell Hubbard this ...

demand from the train\nAs scary as that story is um it's still not as scary in some respects to some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael dealing with Clint joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd if you go to coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also the ah the story about the small town which claims to be the most haunted place in America\nAnd uh and when cameras captured ghosts all of those stories are in the news segment that coast to coast am dot com but there's also this other story on the top of the food right in the carousel\nOn the top of the website it goes to ... am

you believe me\nThere's there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel the no prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell ah you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston Tea\nAnd it was hard for me and my son was born in Boston and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's right yeah ... uh uh later on a\n... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the elite group of science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way um I we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary Roach\nOh you're missing missing a lot to tell me and\nYou know she's a she's a frequent guest you're in but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nOr ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen if she did just love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students should be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I have you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah\nYeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or ... for somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you are [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in the sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth and so it's more likely that um what Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or\nOnto a super computer and then downloaded onto I've very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah\nCan remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robots man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAgo and I was reading some of those sections in I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nCare here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence they really spectacular many of them are really in\nA lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous why I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim or great\nAnd so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality\nOut for many many years I was\nMuch an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be an\nExport into wisdom and Buddhism and a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life\nAnd she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it it's so I became a man of faith faith I'm a\nChristian and I take my my face very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics\nMorality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist phase system there are some innovations in this book that I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should

book is ah is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical lights are on this planet is like the weather that was due uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nTrying to get their hands on from DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to\nThen bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and there's an even deeper questions that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before and that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're gonna traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining\nThe natural flow where to find the natural order of things and he kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old ...\nSo you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yet not nice I forget what it was\nThe commercial was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah and we all know margarine is not so great for exactly but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of\nEvolution right where we didn't do that if we take it on or who's going to be the casualty\nI'm thinking we are yeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and\nI'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant you know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right or we have a a a a ... year peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about this guy I think his name is Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but\nHe recently applied to the area and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots powered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we\nThat they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because they know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYeah I play in every once in a while you write in artificial and tell us now can beat the pants\nOff or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean ... it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no\nAre no longer just doing computations ah but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once posts about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button that up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seemed to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the day when all singularity him when they will have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is let's use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo ... or like that the cushy Murphy abs yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how easy would that be All right now I fully believe that completely and I do and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile and people would like to think it

privacy we're we rest right now at this frontier of all of this home technology with Michael Guillen in a moment but I I wanted to wrap up\nThat conversation about uh about trends humans as you talk about them in the book people who are becoming part of something else or use physical um enhanced Smith ... from technology to be able to compensate for\n'em either for injury or for a deformity um and there's a couple of those that are very entertaining like the guy with the built in my breeder and some of the other stuff that's\nIn the book but the part I thought that was really interesting and I just I wanted to mention that because I I I think they're this idea the eggs those skeleton I'm ... I Know several people who have a ... who has\nA trouble walking or the ... lost their ability to walk and they've been spinal injuries and and that this to them as a dream ... just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\nOf I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a but where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's it there's actually\nA movement called the trans human movement where as you say ... or the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I ... this is an area where I see very little downside I mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he'd lost both arms zap them right off\nNow here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses\nBut the these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we are mechanical\nThat requires you to wear a harness and you have to ...\nYou know these are these are arms that he can move with his thought they're they're they're wired is\nMine and I mean isn't fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I I agree with you and even even end um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you\nKnow they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just ... you know so so for a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off of their own skeletons I I think\nThat uh I I think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that I\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's\nThe only one I'm here's why there's always this belief somehow that if we can if we can come up with the technology\nUm that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that decades weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence yeah from the\n... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about\nMaybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then it never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to [noise] and uh you know we're talking about an ... a human soldiers abilities\nBut I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know\nAnd and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nRight you know ... in some ways you know\nIt is that I often I often think to myself you know\nAll this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we are just still the same you know all our faults in our for evil in our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate\nOur weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor tuna under which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the euro opponent Hugo unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism and you know\nYou know I mean that's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending for a million or some terminal but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nOr at his weaknesses but but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a new had an old hat on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay or had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween\nYou kind of moments right there were like All right now that this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with it I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in the pursuit\nYeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists\nUm\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed the monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nNow I I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter maybe it there in the ... they have a they have Google and they had the little theory whenever there and they monitor that way but however\nIt happened that kind of the debt that passive listening that is going on that we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our country I just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so saying that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something

talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now are more than ... billion\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book and the Chinese or see this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home\nYou're talking about the showcasing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered in the police started looking into the the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nTo kill he killed his wife in

words what I'm saying is sure that that technology\nThat yeah yeah they they won't have soles God didn't make them they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education piece and and I think that's where a great science writing and science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense\nRight Kenya right after\nYou read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that\nTime the beds and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um playing God is kind of baked into our DNA that when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense ... now into my\nQuestion before I get I if I read your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be\nYeah I Will yeah but yeah I don't give a little plug for an up [laughter] they're I think you can you were talking\nAbout immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality\nAnd when the wrath of God or out of a finance fine it says is that they were afraid that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in the stones to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this period that you're talking where we've achieved get more\nOut of this is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse [noise] um you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references\nIn the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint as to what what's in store for us\nAnd how it jibes or doesn't jive with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating er and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelations I I think also my other thought is\nYou know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of um of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot of it we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but gets so complex\nAnd so the non\n... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know [laughter] you know it's like the sky net running it's like running on\nOn energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the horror from saying or from the crush souls of the people in stumps on on you know getting going you get some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop\nYou know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and plug it and it still goes on you know [laughter]\n... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so ... that was exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject\nOf immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in mind let me go to a\nLet me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast am David\nGoing hey my question for you I'm In ... and the ethical and moral conflict created by June ... artificial intelligence\nUm one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing me because it sounds like a really good\nQuestion [laughter] yeah and then or if they do we just lose him and we just love [laughter]\nOh no Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him while we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh I enjoy your show but um I've been on and kicking machine going on forty five years\nYes er here and I was a banker degeneration I'd like to know from your guest or would you feel that the shoe will be overcome through CRISPR or\nA maybe a ... modified pigs I'll take my uh and show up here\nAnd hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nHe on he's on dialysis is on kidney stones and he has macular degeneration\nDislike my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful um they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman\nUh who had the operation and you know even though her fight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that or is already working on a second generation\nA that will help actually restore\nSight to people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also and the kidney but I don't think we need to create these by merit a there's a lot of great research and I've reported on off for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell\nOr ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left ended with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and a three year ... spirit and looking forward to carrying on a with open lines next on coast to coast am this is\n... years ago\nMaking a murderer became led to the TV show of\nForce of nature and they don't cover to raise the injustice in the criminal justice and it was

G and Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with you as a form\nOf ... to ... so so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there's no real explanation for why there are goes there\nBut that video ... especially ... and the fact that ... what really got me was because it's a kind of a shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it you want to jump in on open lines of loved to have you let me go to a Mike in Charlotte North Carolina coast to coast to get us started Mike\nGood morning hours [laughter] we're good thank you\nYeah Halloween all out of the night the hills run with the animal shelter\n[laughter] yes well I Am right now not enough runs in the Los Angeles because it's now going into the are going to be in the Eighteenth inning for the game this World Series or the question of being whether this show ends before that game and where do you want to take off\nA about your last guest oh dear well\nEverything was fine and the trailer talked about a clothing that is not the strip or bitter or forever blah blah and one problem\nDownload memory download horses can download mannerisms can download actions match by robots now but it all gang because you\nCan't show [laughter] I guess some of the feelings and the personality of the I\nI'm with you in spirit I mean within that\nOh the Bible says that there are where nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but [laughter] it's impossible because we are not God that's all I have to say\nOh it's bad enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that so peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say that and it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were why wouldn't it have a soul\nIf other people out there have you know uh other meant if there are other people who have a ... problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease you know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human or that they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology on soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about\nTest tube babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we get a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi I'm I wild hog iceberg for not for five years I don't want to get through my interest\nBut um after last night I have a couple of things to say on this whole in March ... he ... her and I'm a revival manner awarded a habit of things he could've dash toward it survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and I said environment now and furthermore it our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first survival situations and there are a religious groups such as the Mormons\nWho are you know highly compiling surprise for for years to come for for that is families with multiple wives with multiple shoulder with multiple multiple and um\nAnd we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not\nThese are usable and we don't know even with training we don't know if the supplies what's this ... somebody in a cave or in a whole or in a sketch or whatever I mean\nSo I Would hurt and or you like to I'm falling scare myself not to consume companies supplies but just chew on myself and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer\nA myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just see if somebody could even\nHis they themselves\nAnd interesting you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know who's going to survive it could be a child\nIt could be a twelve year old kid who haven't had any training on how to use the supplies that are stored up in these caves are or wherever I'm\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are\nA latter day saints and so I just really be a clear for people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do but to her point I was watching on Netflix\nOr there's this series called uh like the men with three wives zero three wives club or something I don't know but it's about a renegade\nA Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife\nIn the following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab and um and that they they've already talked about saving up than having enough food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and what did even work Kennedy even work I don't know\nA ... but uh yeah so ... willing to be a volunteer but um I think the only thing I ever get to bring your kid a done is in a in Kent, Ohio I knew well on coast to coast am done\nRather a I'm happy to have\nA you know I got a kick out of your commercial buffet ghost in the pawn shop in the court that was their name was Andy Gomez remember ... of the monsters\nYeah sure loved them as a sub gung ho you know\nNow now you mentioned the young lady mentioned about the woolly mammoth and you know Howard could survive a first of all wouldn't survive the five gee cellphone radiation or the country over today\nBut I'm getting back you know back in may\nA coast to coast published and a picture of a police force that washed up on the beach of Georgia will reach I Believe it was and the scientist claimed that it was ... decompose body of basking shark now check out of the ... totally different you know a\nMessy doesn't have ... doesn't have a dorsal fin it has a very small mouth um uh so you know we're being led astray there now I I I'm On the phone number of things that I don't want to pick up a lot of your time regarding the caller about the immortality abroad relation nine [laughter]\nSomebody very topic for discussion and they are related to some of the things I wanted to say too but sure this gentleman Dr wrestling now and uh also had a a ... experience of a failure\nOr twice in surgery which his patients died\nAnd they were children and they later many years later a visited him from the spirit world and delivered a message for him to give to their parents\nAnd so anyway this individual by the way it's the same

of a church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three and a an amazing man even if they um downhill skier at that age\nAnd um [noise] anyhow um what I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy\nAnd some other things in which Churchill ... judge gave a little bit more in hiding from time to time I hear things our coast to coast\nAm that there can be perhaps the connecting and for ... informed that link about paranormal and things from traditional Judeo Christian teaching a that we find them and also in the Bible\nAnd and and that is a lot of things that Joseph revealed or haven't revealed to him I should say by a Jesus Christ and\nMany other this or that he had profits\nAnd he brought about a lot of new scripture hatred scripture as well as new scripture [noise]\nYou know and and we're going to get about thirty more seconds here so go ahead I said\nBasically to wrap it up to be a turtle man is one concept that he spoke about it and he

and truly a Christian\nI don't know who won six now ... now\nAs I as I say this you know I'm going back to your conversation with my God what and who describes himself without using the word as an event job on\nA ... that's what I was talking about when we're talking about his couldn't Perkins or reading the Bible of that on absolutely or I I I Know this sounds the tall or a better person uses one thing going that way\nSo here's what I have to say\nYou had a caller who mentioned a town hall or in a couple of other people and he said there is an air time trans you then more men out there\nYes in a small step Ninety nine we were told there was a do away with a legalized abortion and move that\nYou got to be Falwell founded the moral majority ten years later when then now we have

there\nTen years after that and I went to a Kenyan well here's a second version of the second edition\nOf its auto biography right so here's what I'm saying okay I got to get to that\nThere are a major political force in America and they are they are now supposedly the anti trail human involvement by that I bought it\nAnd I see your point a gun I found out that if you use\nThat as a parallel you're saying they they that you use suspect that some people will position themselves as anti trans human is a way of um a catalyzing donations and creating an organization and and doing a lot is that in the end they have no intention of actually following through on ... am I getting that right\nThat's why we have to have\nGeorge or an air comments\nOn on a George George has got discovered I'm I'm just the guy in the paper had begun the French Roast a very interesting though it blows your dog would do you think it's too much it was very insightful hum and an interesting argument to well positioned Terry\nIs in Austin, Minnesota spam ... ... am\nDuring the you know it's a pleasure to talk to you I Know you live close to me and I did that for a long time before yeah it's a long time I lived in St Paul\nYes sir um it's nice to have you back on the air but either way thank unfortunately I'm a fan I got a question for you and I like your opinion I'm an old military guy and with everyone coming through ...\nOh and all the bomb issues are clearly I kept waiting for the marine corps must green\nYou're breaking up a little bit of it so do move around if you're talking 'cause I didn't want to lose anything you're saying go ahead\nI'm not I'm not um it's it's what we call a smokescreen and my question for you I Know you know getting quite a goal and I won't ask that way but my question in their opinion I Want and\nWe're looking now we're looking what else is going to happen that we're missing we're missing all this on purpose or missing something what is your opinion on that\nWell it's an interesting claim it that the the the marches on purpose or coordinated toward us I mean I\nI think that you'll always see migrations and the good the long history just bring up the Bible again\nThis is that we're all immigrants right the Bible says that we we all move 'em and that would be you know all of the stories you a lot of the stories we're both from people just trying to get food just trying to move to get food and begging people to allow them to live in in space it has food\nSo I kind of see that as a perpetual thing not something new but you know ...\nIs or is or if it that's the smoke screen than what's behind it I guess we're supposed to wonder about or are you suggesting that something is going to come from the north um while we're so busy looking south and east is that was that part of your implication\nThat kind of my question I mean all this was happening at one show or something else happened that we're missing and all media concentrated in one direction and I uh I\nWell I think that's something I I Can't answer but I'd love to let that just flowed out there like All right so I write down what you just said and we'll see maybe a couple of weeks where there's something comes of that um because I think that's that's an interesting thought that maybe\n... ... what what are we in general taking their eyes off of well we're so busy focusing
