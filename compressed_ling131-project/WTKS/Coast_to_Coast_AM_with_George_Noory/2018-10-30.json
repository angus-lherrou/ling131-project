bring I Want to be a game I Want to be bringing you a hundred percent competency and\nWhen I'm outside of my competency it it doesn't indicate a lack of ambition it indicates a lack of self awareness on my part and I'm self aware enough to know that I'm not good at that\nAnd um so that's why I Want to step down not good at this and if that's the truth anyway I just tell the truth it's amazing when you do that how it just kind of releases you Eric's with us in Afghanistan and don't get a lot of calls from Afghanistan Eric how are you\n[laughter] pretty good how are you doing\nBetter than I deserve your military\nA ... a former military I'm a contractor announcer\nOkay well thank you for your service how can I help today\n[noise] um Yes sir I'm I have a rental property addition to my primary home that I also rent out um but I was just notified by my property manager that the house came up on the market or of the house of\n'em that Kim ... am I kind of threw it out the uh there was an inquiry if someone actually wanted to buy the house and I my question was whether I should just sell the house or continue renting it out where is the house\nA sin El Paso Texas where's your home it's in southern Arizona\nOkay so when you finished contracting in Afghanistan and you live in southern Arizona if you did not on a rental property in El Paso Texas would you go by one\n\nOf what I go by another property if I\nDidn't have the opportunity you know it was run in your lead in southern Arizona and you did not have any rental property and you got it ready to buy a rental property I suspect you buy the southern Arizona not al Paso I'm absolutely yeah because you'd probably have this house left over from being stationed there right\n[noise] um yeah well I bought the house right after I was a right after I got done being stationed in Fort Bliss a I bought a home there then um I moved I ah 'cause it was it was a good deal together zero down VA loan so I took advantage of it which is stupid in hindsight you know I'd sell them but after\nThe reason I Want to sell it is because you wouldn't buy it again\n\nAlso for the same reasons you wouldn't buy it again you wouldn't keep it by the way you could apply that decision making tool to almost anything if you got a boat sitting in the yard that you never used and you look over and go you're not never buy another boat then so that one\n'cause you don't use you know for the same reasons you wouldn't buy another one you saw that one and that's true of investments that is true of rental properties true of a lot of stuff if you wouldn't buy it again\nThen don't keep it a cause by keeping it tomorrow you bought it again in a sense so I think you take the offer or get a really sweet offer up the off or whatever but uh dumping a definitely do but\nNot only is in Little Rock Arkansas Natalie welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nPatty how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up [noise]\nUm how do you mean

time I rented a car for a month while I saved up the money to buy a car I'll bet you could say five thousand dollars a month\nYeah probably so\nAnd then by five thousand dollar car and drive it for six months or four months while you save up a bunch more money and get you a Fifteen or twenty thousand dollar car and pay cash for it\nOK so rent for one month by five thousand\nThen okay then drive it for four or five months and by your Fifteen or twenty thousand all with cash\nOkay because\nI don't borrow money anymore\nRight well we also we consider the armchair and talked about it or super thrilled about it but we we have a four O. one K.\nThat no no no money anymore okay we don't borrow money well okay if you borrow money on four one K. it's a debt you borrow money\nIs that borrowing it or yeah its borrowing casting\nOr if you should have actually been worse if you catch it out they're gonna charge you a ten percent penalty plus thirty five percent on your taxes that's a that's

try to keep it I've got because it works\nOK if it's not if it's not super because the more you spend on the real the less you can start to buy a better car right right but you just need a little five thousand dollar get around than a little mini van just something that runs yeah for just a little walk 'cause you make a ton of money\nYeah and you've been broke for long enough for you to be an broke

trends that the I guess can not just businesses should be using things like this I Would guess anybody who's doing something marketing niche you name it should be aware of these things should night\nYeah absolutely it does [noise] it it it's mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't think about this because it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\nWell it has to a large degree um\nThe [noise]\nYou know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that [noise] if people are still people when when you have\nOh I don't I don't know [laughter] I Hope so yeah I'm sure I'm sure they're they're done in a in a very careful men are very ecological manner\nI mean that's that would create another problem all by itself how about the population in terms of ... men and women fifty fifty what they're buying is that a market change\n[noise] yeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now in in in ... no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in law school at Seventy thirty I mean think\nAbout it really is it that high on that's a flip flipped from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I said listen you you you want to hassle of women there so you don't do it\nBut we wish you had to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions\nAnd they're going to want us all excellent went absolutely excellent once and and uh so\nWe're we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because if it's going to be run by women\nTom what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\nA generation said was born ... being going right now it's it's actually a two thousand five to ... thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there are but Gen Z is not going to be entirely different than Gen Y ... they're going to be just the same\nCyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially the parents\nOf Gen Z a but it's what we're watching is is is a at a new crop of kids and and I tell folks I feel if it ... you know people say well these these ... that they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they caught complain about the same\nYou know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are that I'm hearing about them and I said let's let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be find it just got to be just like the hippies that everybody hated as as soon as they had to feed themselves\nAnd and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that and\nI don't care listen it is what it is [noise]\nWhat but let's listen here here's how it works is zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some possessions that the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a um liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing a conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo on all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just care about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah what he tells me that makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country and it's horrible yeah it it troubles me it really does we knew not it's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a\nI mean it looks it I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president day takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight\nOn Twitter give me a break that's the problem yeah that's\nAnd that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter thought that it would be used the tools like that I don't think so\nI Know that when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal\nAnd somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know is\nWhen you talk about the trends in change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't get ... they didn't agree with each other and in I've never seen that this bad him you\nKnow no I haven't and it it's called diplomacy and I wonder where it's way where it's gone I I I just simply don't know you know people\n... ... I I Can't tell you the number of people at George that say to me I you know why don't we run our our government like a business and and so we you know where you're going to have these huge deficits and we won't make all these mistakes\nIf you think about it I'd rather have a government that runs like a government I'd diplomatic government or\nA Republican it's based on a constitution not one that's based on business principles we used to have that yeah we used to have that but now we have a government\nThat's essentially run on business principles and it's it seems like there's there's no\nUh you know we were just taken all do we have removed the rules but what we've taken away the the we've taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat and what will what's going on with China\nChina's enter freaky position China right now a\nNeighbor lax their uh their their child to a lot too right how many people uh how many children know family can help\nYeah they can have really as many say what now which is the absolute positive did last thing they should have done\nIt's it's I you know George I don't know why I really don't and I and listen I Am not that smart I'm really not in in in a few ... my wife or my kid they'll they'll tell you but the ... here you have a situation where we're trying to\nHold on for a second wherever the at the top of the hour we'll come back and talk about China plus will open up the phone lines as we talk about demographics and trends we're talking paranormal later on tonight [noise]\nDon't forget to watch a TV show beyond

trendy not trending down\nChina's cooked going on in\nChina I'm Sorry that but that's that's just like I Can't think of it in any other way to say what they've done is they've they've committed the biggest demographic blunder and the history of the world with that one child only policies\nThey did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy let now they're letting their populace have as many kids as\nA novel desperate for uh how's it going to catch up you\nKnow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born babies born as adults\nAnd buyers that's for sure\nNo so what what you have is is they're missing and this is a real number I'm a five hundred million people that weren't born five hundred million\nAnd a half billion so so here's here's how it works any country I don't care if you're if you're of a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people that make big incomes that have been big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax\nYou mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nAnd the the the starting at about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise]\nSo what's gonna happen well that will lead cooked himself because they're going to have a sexually a quarter of a billion elderly that they've got to support that can support themselves and now that they they have a whole new crop of of kids that can't support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen and how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah what what whenever a country gets in trouble um with ah their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's frightening as they go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has won in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI I don't know what's gonna happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is they they don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not much to take some calls this hour come ruin in here for the guinea let's go to Dana in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi jarred jak off your well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I I have\nI called because I have a phone compact with you I'm just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response so two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war\nUm he's not diplomats so all of those politicians that have look and see I I Can't do that as a human being or as a Christian\nBut I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman I wanted to see two things first of all I'm he called her a horse face\nShe was trying to jump start her career uh um the wiring star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that warrior here's what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he put Ron and possibly win a presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys said and all they had was temporarily side track\n'em a booming economy or try to bring down next man\nBut more importantly that man has kids actually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one but a young white and crude and catch quite and\nWe had a president and did something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was paying for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember from its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look\nAt everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you have found him he's going to come back at you that's human nature and the second thing I disagree that is sad is that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm I'm not that old value there\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than the things is that and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business myself is that men and women don't have time for now and then\nYou get a deal done we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then that and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and so the fact\nThat you're saying we need more diplomacy that policy doesn't win wars diplomacy doesn't faze money we need a businessman I voted for him because he said no nonsense that is that anyone that would bankrupt it four times and they had\nThe audacity to get back up and get on the horse\nI die I I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in a dish and he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what time it's hard and other people know that ... ... if it doesn't matter about his policy she knows who he is as I as a man on and uh and as a prior to that so I disagree with you on both of those um things\nAnd let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things would get anyone to jumping\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running the country as a business I think he did to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country in period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented you're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver toilet a fair market value or even\nBut again it's less and I think when people say let's let the country run as a business they're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that uh our country is a republic with a constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a ... a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to come as young as you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um the fact that this you know porn star and in our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just not areas\nYou know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nThat well they were but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them about what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in the punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I I don't know I I think what he has done is dignify but at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows but\nReally they're very happy ... oh\nYeah I Would describe to that it ... you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes\nOne of the things that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and if that's going to remain in place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that is actually demanded\nA you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force than we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and

take place even even with wacko is like like a Kim\nJong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening in ... in fact I say I say what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north in\nThe south [noise] do you know that the south is not having children there for ... heard that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern though not for my country but from some terrorist groups that obtains new or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is having one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population\nYou can't possible it has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen here with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right at or just above\nI spent level fertility Michael in

B. Ryan Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is and I\nCome from this with with dean because he's doing and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in his research and there seems to be a and I suggested to him there seems to be like a paradigm shift\nGoing on of of gaining acceptance and I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWell and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast himself they're dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and ah I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just that ah it's just as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building at night and he's got some stories so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once more people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people\nUh express their interest in and their support I think it's going to it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce olive sold ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things\nUh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the point which to do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I ... and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle and my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a wintertime and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on\nAnd I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap and\nIt was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know and they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep a crime myself to sleep and I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like I it it was an end jelly presents\nIt it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be okay it took away all my fear and uh\nAnd I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me\nSo that was the first ... experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's that's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic\nRight to see 'em there's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this was a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or buy a ferry or vote or there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there's no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and and that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nCharges have already been filed and we intend to do on duty in this matter with

breakfast and I told them about this nightmare\nAnd then we proceeded to the uh the base\nAnd uh we were on a tour when the sirens went off and they closed off the base and we went back to the education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so\nSo that was my um my pre cognitive or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nA the you know a in a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event\nAnd later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific than mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there there is my daughter had nobody wants to we didn't know ... yeah we didn't know what it was Bruce but uh she she she had the vision she was ah in in a city where ashes falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep\nUm but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was it\nYeah yeah some people had it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people around the world who have who has a verified that this that this happened to them and so there is something to that this is the ... that people had since that and and and I'm On a massive scale so which is\nAnd it's been studied uh I think\nA dean rating talks about in one of his

mother and uh she was very psychic and we used to just a regular deck of playing cards when I was younger uh ... uh camping on the Oregon Coast we'd have wonderful camping trips\nOn the uh uh Oregon Coast in at night my mom would bring out the deck of cards and we would uh try to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have a car and she looked at it and send me the you know try to send me with what the card was\nAnd a wet well above chance we would get the the suit right we would get the sometimes the number or the or the ... you know whether it was a king or jak face card\nA very often we get we get it a right\nTo the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical\nCarpenter a blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it\nNo more yeah he did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop a and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and that she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from it so it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but I\nThink I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big sort of experience\n[noise] I I did uh I well I think it was a I'll tell you this was a ... near Oric\nWhich is northern California and the redwoods highway there and a driving south and uh my girlfriend was was asleep in the uh uh in the passenger seat and it was dark and we were driving to you know the big tall trees it's very ...\nAnd as I was making I think it was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit all of a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark\nBut it was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat\nAnd a ... it was just kind of leaning into the truck as we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by and or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said\nI I think I just saw big foot and and she ... she said what what are you talking about big for I said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she she [laughter]\nShe said no no that's okay just keep drive\nAnd I said well we got to find a hotel there's one here another miles from here and she goes no no you keep going keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later I found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about\nTen miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Paterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking with them that this was in fact\nThere's been yeah there's been more sightings there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand from what the ... the uh the reading that I did about it so now if it if it was a hoax or this guy's taken a\nBig chance by stand right on the on the edge of the highway in the dark total dark\nYup uh and then you can get shot at or anything she got\nRun over crazy you know whatever or you know the alternative which which you know so

going to get to your calls as well as we talk about time was the paranormal world just so many different kinds of paranormal stories you had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket um the title alone kind of makes you shiver [laughter] well\nI grew up in a in a I'm In a Norwegian American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was\nHome to me\nAnd he said ah ah Bruce it's it's it's OK I'm OK there is nothing to be afraid of uh uh I'm okay\nAnd uh I I I I looked I kinda\nI looked around and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut uh I didn't actually ask her about it but and then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it than than the typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um it it it was\nKind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird when it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that\nTime I I I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just to check everybody out and\nSee what see who's there very\nCurious I think I Would be curious to\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kinda paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh well do you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it isn't offered it\nAt the college and I am a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they say well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and\nSo I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could've accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues and and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California\nOr younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just sit there they all have one thing in common they've either they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it\nBut there are a couple that are a little skeptical ... including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks and the or seven weeks in the course into the course\nUm and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience of really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomenon I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which\nWill be fun a that's a hunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in all go stories I mean there is yeah it's amazing give me your scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you the I've had two full affirmation experiences and I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a
