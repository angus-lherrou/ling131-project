{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "I Do and I'm just wondering if I tell you it it gives me to stop code would that give you a coup\nYeah sometimes the problem is a computer so dumb the air masses they give you ... it may or may not be a germane what does it say\nWell uh eight times no I'm Sorry to nine times it totally it was a bad pool hitter\nYeah that's a memory problems\nOne other one of the thing is identified was age fault non and\nYeah and if page fought means something tried to write somewhere it shouldn't okay oh this is kind of the same so tell me the steps you said so what what is it that like if you did it right now it would force of blue screen of death [noise]\nThe last time before I called you that's what exactly what happened\nSo what are those steps said again\nI Do it the power button and you know the power came on and it crashed right away\nRight away okay so usually that means it's a hardware issue and there's something going wrong with the hardware which means it's not the browser\nIt's not something you can fix or just by saying I'm going to use a different browser on these different software or something lower level than that did you\nUh before I mean ... [noise]\nSomebody in the ... are you trying to print something it's true that if you tried to if you had a corrupt print driver which could cause a blue screen\nAnd every time you build it up and tried to load that that would cause it it's probably a driver that's getting loaded when you first turn on the computer how far does it get before blue screen\nWell it just last time it was instantaneous before that a few timed it gave me some time and I I manage to get a little research in and bad drivers as one of the main colleges\nAnd and so one of the things I tried to do is go in and modify change out or delete some\nStop some drivers [noise] but I got confused during that I I probably did the wrong thing oh let me kind of if I what\nWhat I I Would do here's one diagnostic and unfortunately and windows ten it's a different\nWay to do this but if you can start windows ten in safe mode and you would then not load the majority of drivers your screener would look terrible because you'd have a V. Ga displayed reverence over\nHad that last night I got into safe mode\nAnd did it run reliably in safe mode\nWell it did but it saves motives when I was trying to do these correct\nIs yeah you know I mean you know what he wants to stay in safe mode\nBut if you can boot up in safe mode usually that means that something that's loading some drivers loading not in safe mode is causing the problem so so if it was completely reliable in safe mode\nAlmost always I look at the video drivers so the first thing I Would do is is get newer video drivers for your machine is is your machine from a major manufacturer\nOkay so go or you might need to do this in safe mode or another computer but go to jail and go to that area for specifically that computer you know you have a Dell um service number use that to get to the exact page\nAnd download all of the drivers for that system and re installed them sometimes that that will think make it safe a stapler because then replacing those drivers with something more up today um I Would bet that is the first thing I Would do and I would bet that that's what's going on it if you so safe mode ran okay\nIt it did until I started you know trying to do some corrective actions and I was following instructions that I I got\nOn the Internet [laughter] I don't know I got it from Microsoft okay good that's getting\nTo that is a job in itself I Know voted that and then I\nTransferred under chrome on my on my phone to a micro books are still have that available\nYeah but I\nKind of thing where they have and you do\nIs you know I was confused I'd have to go it would take me a long time yeah in a mall and\nYeah the problem with doing stuff and you don't know what you're doing [laughter] you know you can really get into all sorts of mischief that way um\nWell no I I appreciate that and and it's you know my wife has said it's time for you to get a new computer and I said well hopefully I can get this done and I was thinking\nIt might be able to here's a here's the real thing to do once you go in a safe mode [noise] type uh you know we just can't type recovery and go into a recovery mode that will let you kind of re install\nA windows it'll keep your data there's various levels there is one level that will raise your drive and you'll lose all your data but there are several levels that will let you refresh windows without racing any data and that's and windows ten has some very good recovery mode\nI Would definitely try those you can do those from safe mode uh so I I Would see you know see if any of those tools\nYou have a reset this PC which is which is pretty good if you do the reset this PC and choose keep my files it'll refresh the system without a getting rid of anything you want to keep you have a backup of everything\nYeah just yeah all my data I'm not worried about me\nI have all that well worst case you can wipe the drive and start over she's got a good backup well\nThe thing is I Want to replace the drive anyway within is\nWell now's the time I was a great\nTime and if it now the only problem is if it's a hardware problem other than drivers if it's you know maybe your mother board is your whatever you you might be replacing the drive in the computer will still be problematic but is that it's much more serious and your wife is right and I think given spousal approval buying a new computers not a bad thing\nThanks for the call I appreciate it I Want to talk about remote PC before we get a lot out of here they let you easily and securely access your PC or Mac Homer office anywhere even with your

I've decided that this is here to put a little more effort into rural pioneer a friend of mine who uh is an oil rig engineer and yet there are still oil rig so yeah there are many isn't it [laughter]\n... and ... goes back up which is one of those left field possibility a yeah things will be cooking in Houston again although they're not write out\nA pioneer uh started gosh a long time ago um I I was looking for a little different voice and urban survival ah urban survival was my capstone project in my MBA program back in the mid nineties\nAnd um the problem with urban survival is it not trade market\nAnd so if you do a Google Search on the word urban and survival uh you'll get something like seven million at ... ... and and and it really was you know it's a lot of fun and uh between that and um the\nUm people ... dot com website uh I I feel like we actually had a major contribution to the starting at the ... movement back at me uh two thousand two thousand two period when I was living on a sailboat and we really were ready to sail around the world at one point\nA but a pioneer is a little different rural pioneer actually did trademark a and that website is about being a modern subversive in a nice legal way what I mean by modern subversive\nOr somebody who actually tries to do a little bit are recycled re purpose for use a a place where we can talk about things that really kick us off or I don't want to buy things twice\nAnd one of the problems we have in America\nIs that there are certain items that you almost have to buy every six months every year every two years five years or things like plastic gas camp a oil man too is is his moniker because he he he doesn't want to use his real name in public\nUh but uh he he wrote a devastating a piece of we've been we've been complaining about how bad plastics are you know plastic sure everywhere and they're not really the right product\nFor things like consumer consumable almost every country in the world use a flash because it's cleaner or it doesn't have partying compound it doesn't break down in the sun it doesn't float around the Pacific\nYou know all of those things and and and yet there's there really are either extremes of environmentalism\nOr there are extremes of plastic ... and and what real pioneers is about is trying to find the rational way to recycle rip purpose for use a and make a life\nThat is not in the box for being put into [noise] there's a there there's a major downsizing of America remember we were talking earlier about the\nUh the migration in virtual space you're part and parcel of that is a new housing is coming online that is designed around the concept of three hundred fifty a square feet\nPer person and people are expected just to use that square footage to live most of their life in except when they go to public places where there's a different way you can be confined inexpensive rural property\nYou can put a little cabin on it you can have\nYou know some basic gardening some basic survival ah goods and lower property taxes because you get taxed on the improvements on property as much as anything else and in in and in fact I just to give you an idea of comparison friend of mine up in Seattle uh the Seattle area this year\nHe and his wife are paying almost three thousand dollars of property tax and that's nothing I mean seven eight\nThousand or even ten twelve thousand is not uncommon in Southern California\nAnd and yet out here and what I call the outback\nOr our total tax bill this year on twenty nine acres was eight hundred a eight hundred eighty seven dollars or so\nSo so there there are different ways to live and uh we we don't honor thrift like we used to in America or when you and I were young we were our grandparents talking about\nIn our day yeah in the day oh gosh I mean it\nWas it was saving stamps it was you know building your own you know\nPaying things off they like doing it with cash\nYeah you you you live the cash lifestyle you buy quality and if something breaks what'd your grandpa to\n... ... exactly\nWell you know that's the kind of thing that that that we we don't care about\nToo much on the prepping websites we don't hear about a American inventiveness I have a I have a really nice riding lawnmower and it's got a twenty three horse power the twin engine on it and a couple of years ago the starter\nA gear broke so I tore apart to fix it\nAnd it was plastic I called the manufacturer and he said what the hell are you doing\nWhy are you using a ... you know plastic starter gear and I got you know Fifteen minutes of run around when the fact of the matter is you know starting gears on cars are virtually all metal because plastic just doesn't cut it but these guys in the small engines world have made a fortune for themselves\nSelling twenty dollar replacement gears every three years when ... you know start five hundred times there you go you've got to buy something so you know I I take a certain amount of pride in flying a fifty year old airplane driving a Fifteen year old truck and a ten year old car\nOr a George let's think goals were lining up my friend let's go to Tom in riverside California Tom Europe with us\nYeah I'd like your guest George or the or you know a thing that bothers me you know one of the things you said was a migration into this country or the uh what I look at it as a some sort of program of forced\nOr immigration or not or they're being forced but it's reinforced on the American people\nAnd uh we're losing our identity really I feel that uh over the last thirty five forty years and uh all this that you're being forced you can fit you know a well being forced to accept these people and to this country and what about other people that\nAre standing on the street corners why are they being given job I Would think that if you were in charge of anything you would want to be creating a reviving Detroit are reviving our industries and seeing that a vocational programs are in the high school\nAnd then we can get our our act together not bringing people in and where do these people I Can't get enough money to get out of this country where are these people coming from war torn country and El Salvador and Honduras or the middle east\nAnd Africa where are they getting the money to buy houses and buy cars I you know I just throw that out there and take your\nOkay who you know he's right we're I I have always been baffled how people from some of these poverty stricken nations in in you know I feel sorry for them for all of them but I mean how do they buy things here so quickly\n... because they they have a a very high level of incentive and we don't have that same entrepreneurial core because it's been largely bread out of us in our public education system\nThat we need to go to work for somebody else rather than becoming responsible for starting our own business\nTo generate local products don't get me wrong on the immigration thing I have I have written rant after rant after rant\nA on urban survival ant and also I'd looked at the economics of it over on the people in the back side I don't like it it is not what we sent people to Washington to do we did not send them to bring\nIn foreign people who um are ... many of whom may not even like us\nBut the fact of the matter is that in the very short term immigration is an economic boom or the people need houses they any cars they need social services there a reason to raise taxes there a reason for more government\nUh at some level uh even the gangs coming in from South America or represent a tremendous opportunity for the American for profit prison system now I don't think\nExplain\nWe'll pick something like\nA U.S Middle East policy the the background of us Middle East policy or was that the ...\nThe Clinton Administration uh was running a somewhat balanced approach\nA to things like the Palestinian problem\nAt it as it was called at the time and along came the project for new American Century\nAnd the notion of regime change started making the rounds and this was adopted and a ... was taken up has the right way to sort things out in the middle east uh\nWe started attempting to change government and so far our success record in affecting regime change\nHas been that where we've where we've gone in and actually done it we haven't really reaped any particular benefit and in fact we have caused some of our own problems of today\nOr even the Obama administration's policies with a Libya for one example uh have have yet to yield uh any net positive effect that I can see\nNext up some and Concord, California Tom ... a while\nI tell you what we're coming up on a break so I and I don't want to put you on hold so we will wait a

stories that are connected to it around a little bit\nLet's go to my ... in New York City my walk good morning one had been wanting in ... and ... now with my phone number okay\n... called ... and

world order and at AOL pap ... at a sonic Philly theater\nWith the flood life continue right so what is your ... and about the current it with a people understanding that it's not what it seems to be a novice in over there and thank you put a\n... going to rush well first\nOf all a little bit on methods ah methods that I use art literally all over the board because not all problems can be looked at the same way\nUh one approach is a basic financial modeling a sitting down with a spreadsheet or another approach is to look at charts of the stock market from the present day\nAh am from past periods of American history and look for similar policies and market performances or another approach that I use is called the aggregate index approach\nAh that's based on the uh the notion that on any day of the week there was only so much money in the world\nAnd by noticing uh the total performance of global markets one can infer whether money is being made or being washed globally so that's that's a a a real basic look at it\nNow as to nine eleven glad you brought that one uh uh the reason for that is if\nWe were in a position where we could have slid\nInto a greater depression in the fall\nOf two thousand one now ah I wrote extensively about this at the time the charts for all lining up nicely the Internet collapse took about depending on which number you use\nBut five point a trillion dollars for about one third of an entire year's GDP off the table\nIn about a twelve month period of time\nSo uh when you talk about ritual and consciousness I don't think they're just as much weight should be given to the notion of consciousness so much should be given a cash flow and people's financial interest\nBecause you see what happened with nine eleven is is it is a a it is a large enough economic stimulus\nThat it becomes highly suspicious\nOr economic stimulus in that it gave us an incentive to go to war or economic stimulus because we hired initially I think it was fifty thousand a additional personnel for TSA\nA there was a huge a stimulus in terms of\nI hate to call it the terrorism industry but let's face it it's a it's an industry a terrorism has become an institution and huge profits have been made by consulting fees and by contractors a full\nBody scanner developers not seeing any of this is bad but uh from a forensic economic standpoint my my it sure is coincidental that when we're about to drop into a Great Depression along comes a massive economic stimulus\nAnd that was followed by a Alan Greenspan a\nLack of diligence that led to the no dock\nLoans somebody who's sleeping at the wheel but\nBut not necessarily I mean you you know the [noise] the bad news yeah uh it looks like a suspicious coincident but you know the good news is the unemployment rate is still not as bad as it would have been\nAnd and by having cereal bubbles what's happened since two thousand is uh we've had this economic Gulch out in front of it is called the greater depression\nAnd we're kind of building a bridge of cereal bubbles and wars to get across that coach the problem is that as we're doing that or the dynamics of the the money flows from the world politics are such the\nCoach keeps getting bigger so every time we think we're getting close to the other side with a new word new bubble of news is that what happens is we actually just\nPush the problem out kicked the can down the road\nAnd when the depression get charity going to be us depression which the Nineteen thirties so that was largely a U.S and European this one's going to be global it'll take down and it'll take down trying it'll take down your up we'll probably be the last ... go simply because of dollar a Gemini\nWhich so far seems to be hanging on but beyond that uh

you\nDon't go work on your car and just walk outside with a screwdriver\nNo not at all you know because you're going to take the whole tool box and I thought what cave this is part of the tool box I Need I Need to do this [laughter] next thing you know I'm [laughter] I I I'm more than ... than waist deep in this [laughter]\nWell let me tell you something to me using this field that you were going to get it all the various aspects now let's go way back you know when you were little trial this no doubt is hereditary and your family is\nAbsolutely absolutely and I and ... and it was a closely guarded secret until I came along\nWhy [noise] um you know\nYou gotta think back in the day and age you know taking us back to the forties the fifties so taboo even in the sixties still very taboo I mean we were going through flower power and all that stuff\nBut very taboo um and I was told as a child see we just don't talk about this okay we just don't mention this to people but one of my first experience happened to me at about four years old\nIt showed me something that was wrong with that statement because I was playing with friends my mother was talking to the neighbor and it was playing with the hurt their kids\nI turned around and their houses on fire\nYour house was on fire\nWhile I thought it was I mean it was I mean in what I was looking at my turn around and shook my head and looked again and it was it and everybody looked OK I mean I'm\nLooking around and everybody's just going about their business and I felt like wow I'm On a think an eye on all of a sudden I got scared and Iran home ran and talk to my mom and my grandmother and this was the shoe shouldn't say this\nEven if you saw keep just\nJust don't want yeah [laughter]\nI haven't you know I'm like okay but it was only ... it was probably a year well their shortly a few days later the house didn't catch fire\nShame or either way you saw\nYep I mean thank goodness everybody got out and you know safe and it didn't turn out to be horrible olives and I'm losing you know a part of their house how did you feel\nUm I was kind of the straw taken back but as a kid you know you don't grasp all of it you know four years old I'm your\nYour ability to really think about things on a long term basis are isn't really developed I think it really hit me about the next year when you hit that five mark\nFive and six when you go huh why have what they had been injured\nAnd you didn't tell when I did tell well but I'm I'm I'm a bad person\nCulpable or whatever you know like\nYeah and then that hit me like this could have been\nAwful you know what and I and so my mom after I Can't shut up\nDid you use this growing up for your own life\nAbsolutely even though it's sometimes I you know the funny part as I say you know sometimes I don't listen\nI like everybody else on human it I wouldn't know the right thing to do and be stubborn and turn around and do the wrong thing course it didn't work out of course\nNever does no no\nBut then you know you you live and learn\nSo how did this evolution or curfew you where you started helping law enforcement\n[noise] um [noise] I was um roughly about\nSeventeen years old um and and there was an incident that that took place I'm prior to uh the home that we moved into 'em and and the kid was actually missing now mind you\nSeven years old I told my mother this is what I was going to do with my life\nI you know it was kind of yeah the ... there was somebody that went missing and television and and I said oh that's what I'm going to do my mother was like OK\nYeah you know like no big deal right um by the time I I I reached the stage where we moved into a home and\nThe boy had been missing and he used to live in that house [noise] I didn't know this at first but I kept seeing him and he kept talking to me and at this point\nI didn't know exactly what to do I did know hit where his parents lived but I'm not going to say anything you know\nUm stir up problems [noise] so\nI kind of sat back and I ended up I had a few friends that I could talk to thank goodness and\nThen they understood you to the\nYeah the few that I had and what you you don't have a lot of friends when you're like that most parents tell the kids to stay away from you\n[laughter]\nYou know that that gets so that's part of life I'm trying to get under ... notch the away from ... well they would\nTell their kids that I was a which\nWas a strange time back then okay\nUm and I I'm like okay you know\nWhat I Would have been burned up the ... of them do they\nHand so afraid of that some days [laughter] you never know but\nYou know I was when I got this information and I absolutely didn't know what to do well a friend um well actually it was a police officer and she's ... can you you know can you tell my dad and he is is um\nLike I I don't know it's kind of you know maybe a little embarrassing or you know he's going to think bad she goes no my dad's a really open person\nSo I did I tell them what happened\nWell lo and behold a month later they did find his body\nWhat was he murdered was murdered was murdered okay uh-huh Fifteen Years old\nThat they find a killer did you help them find the killer\nIn that case I I did not help find the killer but the body was exactly as I had\nA tribe and where no new role the actual location\nBut let me ask you this deal because I've known a lot of law enforcement who don't believe the psychic world\nAnd so I'm asking if you were considered as a suspect when you tell some police officers information but only you and the killer no and they know\nThey kind of look at you differently there's no question about whole\nAbsolutely I was called in and I'm On a case and and and I talk about this case uh in in the book I'm\nMissing and presumed dead\nMhm and I'm the king of the one we're close is the chapter but I was pulled in on that case\nUh when I got to the police station after making the location of the body and the police were notified [noise] they sat me down and I'm I'm assuming they just want to say hey you know okay what went on where you ... what did you see any you know\nAll of a sudden they're in my face go why did you do it\nWon't just like a\nJust like that I'm like so um because I thought I I I ...

I have a site that's kind of a you know cocky so um\nYou know I said well I thought I'd take somebody out that I didn't know I'd say you're kidding me I had no I never met these people before I certainly never met this person\nIf you have been doing your job you would have found six months ago\nSo the back down\nUm and he kept saying he goes well we know you had something to do with us\nShe don't they don't believe you that's why\nNo absolutely not and I ... I I think sometimes\nAnd I tell people this when you're I'm Upset sometimes that actually can enhance your ability sometimes good sometimes bad um and at that moment I just blurted out\nMm that vibration took me two states away I drove there\nYou you you know ... have you ever been confronted by the killer directly\nUm oh yeah I got um I got an email on day what does it say from and\nThat was really really\nI I'm reading in the mail like I Do I get hundreds of emails and it said would you help me find my wife and when I hit that point all of a sudden I just heard the loudest voice of course not my own saying why would you want help finding your wife you know where she is you kill their\nWhoa I like that's what you felt\nThat I I heard it loud and clear\nUm I I just kind of looked at the end when okay great this yeah this is just going to be\nThe killer email to\nEmail me so I sat down and I and and they gave it a day to think about how to handle it\n[noise] so I went ahead and emailed back\nAll done right there we're going to take this break and come back the killer emailed you Gail St John with us her book is called missing and presumed dead a psychic search for justice\nWow we'll be back always on your bones that you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized ... users just point your iPhone or Android Browser to coast to coast am dot com and enjoy [noise]\nRadio seven point seven\nLocal weather ... here but not as cool overnight going into our Monday morning temperatures mid fifties and link closer to sixty along the coast sunshine dominates today wants to get high and the upper seventies for the WTO see first alert whether team I mean ... just extraordinary\nOkay everybody listen I actually ran a Toyota every ... comes with a unique no cost to make this plus program\nOnly serve on a Toyota has is your real vehicles covered for two years or twenty five thousand miles whichever comes first at no cost to you Andrew the oil is due to change title rotation mostly for destruction to take care of everything for two years or twenty five thousand bottles that's a long\nTime since ... has your selection of Rio vehicles to choose from\nA hundred years models soldiers just six thousand dollars ... usually don't matter what your situation is the\nWants to save ... savannah will do that\nJust as association [noise] for\nYears so it was almost two years going back on my cell phone service recommended every six months of five thousand miles he do it for details\nMultiplying October twenty and now that I'm prefer that one of my camera county falling bodies that\nPurpose seven seven is a bad news news radio Ninety seven points to have an epidemic twelve ...\nLong usually the best we can do so many different\nPrograms so many different aspects of things on television with beyond belief our country great shows interviews with David Wilcox ... shall travel interviews with Cory good on secrets based programs to\nShow many years of programs and you go watch them all by simply going to this website to sign up and beyond belief dot com that's beyond belief dot com [noise]\nMessaging the rates may apply\nEarning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech\nCompanies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

help you with us\nAll right so you're playing a straight absolutely All right\nSo um I ended up going to the area where this case took place which happened to be quite a few states away [noise] um I was very uncomfortable riding around with with the killer [laughter]\nDo you call or did you call a law enforcement first\nI did not because\nI Know and that's dangerous\nI said so when he comes back we all have everything together so we did all that well lo and behold the officer was right theory I described he recognized it being from that area of course they're going to and they did find her\nThey found her within what a day or two\nOh a few hours a few hours mhm he no longer I ran out and he took off how long has she been altered deal\n[noise] I Believe it at that point it was like sixty days\nOr a home where decomposed oh yeah and the ...\nOf course they performed the autopsy but how does he fainted when he found out he did very well how ... how much she murdered\n'em strangled strangled or mhm so now we go back to him she means a lot of these phone in front of the officers fence legitimate or not I don't think so I was using ... anybody\nCatch themselves as they fall\nInto that when I'm like\nOh he gently kinda he went down but it was like hand went back to you know you're you know so\nAt what point did he become the suspect in get arrested or is he free\nAt that point he's free ... now\nAnd I was now that point of having to go home and I tell the detective I I have to return to my area but I you know here's some stuff that I did see whether you want to believe it or not you know he goes oh I'm starting to really think something's going on here I went well thank you\nUm are you are legitimate or the part of it that I was legitimate or and I said and and this is what I saw\nAnd this is the what I I I see where he was I also look at the person that gave him the alibi the problem is they left the paper trail\nSo they couldn't have been he couldn't have been with them at the certain location because this person was here and another area and if you pull the cell phone records and other stuff you're going to find out that they weren't even in this state when they gave it up by far and\n\nWe're going to be checking things out six weeks later though he was arrested\nSure when he's arrested why did they call you did they have the courtesy to let you know what was going on\nNow to do that so [laughter] find out about just read about ... a lot of\nFriends that were in that area that I happen to know\nAnd as of now we're is locked up law that life got lawyers mhm gosh\nAll because he emailed you\nYeah mistake\nYou might have well I still think you would have been as such but but you do you do we ever get a motive for\n[noise] you know not really I'm ... and everything that was sad and read there the police\nEver really came up with a mode of 'em I honestly felt that it was because um he had someone else\nAnd was thinking that he needed to end it with the wife and she had a huge insurance policy\nHe had gone insurance in about a year and a half prior to that of course he's the beneficiary right oh of course that makes them so spoke right there are two well known you only got\n... with that murder the little twist on that case is their child died six years prior\nNow what's the time with the other than it was a\nI really believe he murdered the child oh my God\nAre you kidding discouraging reading with it\nBut I mean he's life in prison but you know\nYeah I understand no justice for the child does the victim of\nThe dead person do the shoals or the spirit ever come to you\nI Do see them or talk to them I'm\nIn a couple of cases they came up in the book you'll see one's called my roommate my room mate [noise] um she

Washington and I'm actually quite close to my room there\nOn the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed um he sold the strange creatures while he was driving along the road and it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings but it was kind of Harry as well [noise] scares me and had the shining a yellow eyes\nBut they sort of the ... the hair angle combined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like ... ...\nAnd um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four and it was actually quite big news in that area and then like a lot of other these\nYou know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I've talked about that before a that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you in Georgia I'm doing five books now on\nOn this phenomena foreign to men in black and one of the women in black\nAnd I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and I say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies I typically are described as looking ... you know go on and the skins live white white\nUm um people talk about how vaccines have this ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them pay for the even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that fateful and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black of turned up in homes right after paper being using wage of bullets which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a golf a horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe the ... the ... street it's fall be on you know just guys in black

than just um\nUm humans and helicopters that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they are humans that are\nCarrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\nWell yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the ... you know you've got a really weird lungs and exploit couple and then some which are easier perhaps to explain there is a power line with demanding black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think the\nGovernment agencies are responsible for the modern day but I think it's a very small cats agree versus the the January unexplained ones and the way the ones what I think is happening on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the over the years agencies may actually have employed the legends of the men in black\nA means to cover their tracks in other words the may be paid for with the governments who know that many black are all too real but I don't know what they are but he doesn't prevent them from using the ... the most have\nAs a means to to threaten and quiet people who who by my\nNo one of them you know the men in

old joke about paranoia paranoia ... but something along the lines of just because you're paranoid that doesn't mean somewhat isn't really following you around it sort of the the the inspiration for this new book of yours top secret alien abduction piles\nYou're talking about the world in which we live where mass surveillance is sort of a given now right\n[noise] well yeah and of course you know subsequent generations of growing world wherever I've never known any different from\nSt Louis night you know before the Internet age will remember it was not that sort of well Why Violence that we have now\nYou know I think that's what I mean I'm fortunate things for future generations are going to be helping normal thing for probably accept it as well\nYou know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea of the fear that people used to have that maybe the government is going to\nTalk us into getting a computer chip stuck on to our skin and then they can follow us and they'd all be for all the good reasons you know for our health and wellbeing and\nAll kinds of ways but in fact they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance devices like that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would what time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things of that sort alien abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what Iliad alien abductions are all about that that idea which seemed preposterous but too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\nYeah I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually facial vacation guy to November people can already got it [laughter] but\nThe the reason I wrote top secret I mean abduction falls is because over the years I collected a number of official documents on abductions which again the classified through the faith in the information act in the u._k. um the u._s. and finally I was in a position where\nI could actually sort of put the book together and you know provide the ready to leave us it's another book on Eileen abductions but instead of going just overall ground you know\nWhy not present people with the guy to showing how falls would be put together now I'll start the book actually with the contact a movement of the Nineteen fifties which preceded the abduction phenomenon by just over about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would\nGo so to speak but um\nAgencies do uh put together falls on paper who claimed to have had in Kansas for example just about all of the ... of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George Burns hassle true and bathroom ...\nAll of them how to FBI falls out putting on them one of the main reasons pain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI that yes they ... they are and see Israel eons\nBut they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or governments very different two hours and bordering communism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file 'em is\nExtremely extensively about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm ... was about four to and so on so you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now in the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one a with a bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess he's the defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get waited a they don't fail writes the you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft would they be strange creatures\nAnd being subjected to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly intriguing is that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning to I Am\nAn essay was driving these vehicles to the location they the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd this is they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomena within you follow Jake what's intriguing\nIs that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised them security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond if you like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the the the the Providence security services interviewed Ronald Wildman of ... to with the with the ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most challenging and intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police so this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction low in today's world but Ronald ... in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO come down\nLights went out of his vehicle and then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch and there was something about states it's actually you know Boatright completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think\nYou know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject than thinking sort of amusement well there there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen when you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and when the Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around it takes it seriously for whatever reason\nIt makes me think of like the Roberts men or that the CIA scientist a UFO topic and they include\nThe UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion is that a justification for going around people I condemn ski bathroom those folks\nOh

clearly a real one um they just seem to be tied to both ... and um\nThe abduction phenomena and one of the things such as being notation I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these flying these helicopters\nPotentially I think it's part of an organization that up right outside of government you know my actually my sort of do research for the government but it's not you know what the CIA or anybody like that flying valley cup does I don't think I think it is sort of um\nThe story and someone else told it to me but anyway what happened was Nineteen twenty two it was a

had their names to excuse me one was named ...\nAnyway she took them and she looked at and actually the parents were anything like that\nSo she took him in and raised in Missouri and they are when they got in the late teens I noticed that they didn't have any hair on their head on or anything but it wasn't a bomber who read where\nThey had believed all these ... ... she took them then it went

chaos\n[noise]\nWelcome back Christopher a white received his PHD in religious studies from Harvard University where he studied religion and culture he's interested in religion and science spirituality and ... church religion\nNew religious movements electronic media and popular culture and there's currently a professor of religion at Vassar College his new book other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions is a spectacular and mind bending a Christopher welcome to the program\nMorning George thanks for having me on the show\nThanks for staying up so late or ... I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch grief for doing it\n[laughter]\nIt gives me um [noise] no it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um\nYou know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences what whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of a privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interests and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this one move here in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it's the sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about their death experiences and and the parents and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how of belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening yeah\nI think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they ... pretty high numbers in America\nUm believe in and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregation so things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real sense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and\nTrying to think well where where people getting these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi first with thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves and the Braves with ... with offensive on mystery and and wonder\nI think of those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for new spiritual infections and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look out of the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard time to normally Georgia through\n[laughter] yeah a pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out look kind of look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it's it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is um I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I could I ask the question of well what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about\nThat and maybe I can just say worried about that for for for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going\nAnother ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions if there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um Sinn fein filing that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and I'm fine\nI spoke about this but some other people I talk about in my book talked about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction\nBase or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line as one dimensional objects that has length if you then draw flask where on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions that has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object\nHas three spatial dimensions ah links with and hide\nAnd then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else\nAnd the the something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raise this possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth spatial dimensions that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations look clean or they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise] uh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine um but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through trials in turmoil so in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment or

wanted to share a quote with you because it's sort of flows from what the Robbie with singing about and that song there are men have got to feel at home in the universe again and I I Believe a great

... seven ... well ... ... am when you say yes\n\nWe're back with Christopher white Christopher I at one of the great things about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own hands around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah yeah he was his wife is is quite a story um but you're right there there's Hinton and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the\nUm you know sort of like a habit being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimensions has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual love levels are worlds to reality I Am an intimate an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right in the situation is he he embraces math Madison geometry as a kind of a\nAnd he kind of hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty onto him but I think is his stories a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nSee I'm into the future and you write these ideas up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes I give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that than\n... than a than happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or deja blue or were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back to this one side of the idea of what's ... how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well also in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on cs Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the the famous writer of wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made a vat of that book but she talks about time slips um and and time travel um and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my presence could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really counter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of\nPrime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that of the ways that we experience time has probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that\nEinstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe at all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past in in our\nIn our president and in our future and in the earth's future and then our son's future and and all of our defendants future's\nAll of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions to discuss if anyone wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia\nHe wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies talk all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it lays it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices um and so on [noise] um so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did\nAs they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that you know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lift it\nSo up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should start ornament world right because we have three facial dimensions and one approach to mention\nThe dream itself and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment and don't believe that um you know using a bit of aren't buying here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space lost their um that's what he believed happening among dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction in\n'em and and we could talk about that as a facial dimension or we can talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and hit everybody\nEverybody's sleeping so had freedom and you also believe that every one of the cabin kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and and that's all you had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believe that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and then I'm sort of mixed up together [noise] well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about science is a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we've discussed on this program before white
