[noise] uh Kathy Akron, Ohio your next Hi Cathy Layla port the guy\nThan if you're taking my call thank you it's my pleasure\nThanks for calling I've been wanting to attack you for a while I had a small private hobby where I collect a landscape photos and um I Would really like find a way to is like holidays in it as like it you don't say\nOh how nice digital trains are usually kind of small and yeah let's have\nIt on the big three ounce out but I don't know how to do that\nYou know it's funny because almost all now these are Internet connected TV devices like the Roku and the Apple TV [laughter] have screens savers that are often landscapes Apple TV as a beautiful uh one it's a slow motion landscapes so they're moving 'cause their screen saver\nAnd I saw that on a TV yesterday horse yeah location that I figured it was probably felt the television\nThere comes to the Apple TV it's awesome so that would be one way to do it is to get one of these devices\nAll of them have a photo capability so for instance the Apple TV if you use a mackintosh you'd up lower your landscape pictures to your you put them on your apple photos and you could actually have have a particular folded let's call it my special landscape collection\nAnd you'd say to your Apple TV that's my screen saver\nHow does it get from my ...\nIts magic you know through the through iCloud it's through the Internet and that's the whole point is that you are now now this is not the only way to do it I'm gonna tell you some other way\nBut that's one way to do it and the advantage of that as you can updated without having to do anything and just put new photos in the folder on your computer and the way it works is you've you using the iCloud photo library So Apple the Mac is uploading all your photos to iCloud its its cloud storage\nThat ... yeah yeah I can I tell of\nAn Apple TV it's called the Apple TV [noise] and so the idea is that this is one way I'm going to finish until you some other ways but it's only because it's going to cost you a little money because Apple TV is a couple of hundred bucks\nBut then the Apple TV let you watch movies and TV and and other stuff you know it's the idea is that it makes an Internet connected T. V. C. connect the Apple TV to the Internet now your TVs connect the Apple TV and you've added Internet capabilities you your TV [noise] many TV's already have this uh does your TV have Netflix army right Gail yeah\nI Do like we we can get on you know like ... to it and he I was\nOkay so it does already have Internet you might investigate if your television look in the menu and see what apps it offers you might already have a photo lab in which case you'd have to just figure out how to get photos to that\nPhoto op lots of TVs have slots for photo cards for S. D. card so that'd be another way to do it requiring no Internet you copy the photos you want onto an S. D. card a little memory card on who hack\nSlotted end of the TV you can buy if your TV doesn't have that you can buy little ad on devices that do that the only the ad on edge steak\nYeah as the card reader onto your TV and and a USB flash drive it really depends on the television and the capabilities of the TV but many TV's can do a slide show if you put a photo folder in that's Estee carts laughter on the USB port again you'd have to check to make sure you do that [noise]\nAh the nice thing about the Apple TV is it will work with any TV that has an H poor\nRoku will do the same thing but it doesn't use apples a photo sharing service it you know you could use some other one Amazon has those Amazon fired TVs use Amazon photos and you could put Amazon photos and your Mac and put the photos and that\nAnd then have them up on your Amazon TV as well lots of ways this ah because what you want to do is very common I see my family photos as a screen saver for instance on my\nToes yeah yeah that would be great tip [noise]\nSo you could do that with Roku with Apple TV probably your own existing TV capabilities are there lots of ways to do it and it's in your right it'd be great way to use those landscape photos [noise]\nExcellent thank you my pleasure\nAnd if you have an Apple TV I stopped putting my family photos on their cars the a normal a default screen saver what's it called Ariel is studying\nHey have aerial photography in super slow mo a and it just rotates through everything from the urban landscapes of Dubai to ... overhead for LAX to the lush jungles of Hawaii\nIt's kind of like that opening shot of Jurassic Park you know I almost want to play the ethic bark thing as they zoom down that valley but they do it's very slowly because it's a screen saver and they want to change it but then I Want to change dramatically or drowsy I so it's just beautiful\nAnd if you have your Apple TV set up with a nice big screen that's gorgeous hey we're at a time I um\nI hate it when that happens when you come back next week we have lots more to talk about by then I'll have a new Google phone I can talk about that [noise] thanks to Michael ... he makes that

tell you about our special guest tonight three hours Benjamin ... charted financial analyst certified public discounted but\nHis professional backward includes not only money management for high net worth individuals and money manager and he is a noted author of the underground best seller the day of the lord is at hand no Benjamin wrote\nIn Nineteen Ninety six as a warning to America\nAt a time of crisis was coming upon our nation including a stock market collapse currency collapse terrorism ultimately war and we're going to be talking with him about the new tactics the global war and then also the day of the lord is at hand\nWhich is biblical prophecy Benjamin won't come back it's been a long time\nWell it has and thank you for the invitation back I as you recounted that history of sort of the topic of the my first appearance in two thousand and three twelve years ago George a number of those topics are mainstream news or have now happened to America\nThey sure have a much promised each other Benjamin we're not going to let twelve years go by again before your back on\nWell I appreciate that because I really enjoyed the program that was with art bell back in in the olden days but it it's great to be back and we sure do have a lot to cover to nine\nMy gosh we should do when you look at what's happening in you know your title is super pre at the new tactics of global war isn't that what ISIS is doing right now Benjamin\nThey are a pain on the chessboard George you know think about it there are a number of players that are all positioning for their piece\nOf the new world order they want their day in the sun and I I Would say they're one of the pond is being moved and there's a lot of speculation are they why are they black or they read you know which color is ISIS today that's an interesting question we can get into in the interview\nAnd you know also who aren't they they just seem to be popping up all over the place\nWell it's a really interesting amalgamation of a potentially a number of tribal factions that are all radicalized Islam is who have come together to create the Islamic state of the bond you know I feel is our um\nImposter and she would call them and yet they operate as a trained army\nAnd they're not just a bunch of ah unemployed or Arabs from Syria and Iraq the guys are organized they've taken heavy weapons which were abandoned by Iraqi an American forces and they're operating them skillfully they produce and export oil there is a mini Mike Rowe\nState that has formed out of what appeared to be a grass roots\nOrganization but the truth and nothing of this magnitude ever rises from the grassroots level there are state sponsors that are using ISIS\nLike a chess master would use a ... on on the chessboard\nAbsolutely and I wonder if ISIS most of them I Wonder if they even realized Benjamin if they know their pawns\nWell I think the term is youthful idiot and I think [laughter] I\nUnfortunately there are a lot of people fighting for various causes that are really under the illusion of propaganda\nYou know and they want to die for God king and country and they're really serving in the various agenda without realizing it because it at the end of the day everybody does what they believe and so people first have to be convinced to believe in a lie\nAnd so it is with ISIS but yeah there are various no doubt I mean have you seen such brutality it's almost any human the way they treat humanity\nThe latest report I saw just a few days ago then apparently they are harvesting human organs and selling them on the marketplace\nYeah I'm\nIn sometimes I Wonder if that's you know if we're being deceived and misled would that kind of propaganda I'm not sure sometimes\nWell there's no doubt a propaganda war that in place between the various factions and you know you want to look bigger picture or who are the players involved in this game well in the west we have of course the United states\nAnd our allies in NATO Western Europe and there is a bit of a division or fracturing that's occurring at this point between the western alliance\nBut it still led by the Americans and then of course you've got the Russians and the communist powers China's supporting Russia's military adventure in Syria there obviously allies\nAnd then Russia is of course an ally of Iran\nAnd the Assad regime which is really a a sort of a puppet state of the Soviet former Soviet Union I should say you know I never really I'm very impressed with the name change George\nI'm because what happened in the former Soviet Union was um\nIn many ways a very well orchestrated it was a wag the dog kind of event ensure there was a reality of the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and and the disintegration of the evil empire\nBut if if the Soviet Union really did collapsing and became a legitimate democracy why was no one ever arrested for all the crime of humanity and why did the Communist Party\nPower and control of all the world and why was the KGB allowed to basically changed the name on the building to the FSB continuing operation as if nothing's changed at all\nYou were when you wrote in Ninety six Benjamin and warned America allowed to come in crises the stock market issue the collapse of the currency terrorism and we'll get into all the ... war what did you see where these events happened what did you see about terrorism stock market collapsed currency collapse\nWell I had seen in more of a global top level view all of these events and of course they didn't nobody could imagine the details of something like ISIS arising out of the crisis of the middle east\nBut I had understood through my professional career the geo political balance of power I was a money manager and part of being a money managers understanding the forces that are driving the economy and investment returns in the various sectors\nAnd you'd have to give some consideration to the geopolitics to the economic and ultimately the military balance of power because these things have an effect on the performance of the economy\nSo I had some insight in understanding into the players I'd also spent most of my life since a young teenager\nStudying diligently Bible prophecy and reading everything I could get my hands on in terms of the subject to Bible prophecy and so I was really trying to piece together ... together in my mind\nThe prophecies of the Bible which are pretty clear in terms of the events that would take place in what is called the under the age as well as an understanding of the the real players\nI'm In the current world system and I had spent a brief career in military intelligence I was an order of battles specialist trained to study the Russian military I was a specialist in the middle east sector I'd spent considerable time on the ground in the middle east\nI ended up going to graduate school in the middle east\nI studied the middle east conflict at the graduate level\nAs well as is part of the intelligence community so you know I had a pretty good working knowledge of what was going on and I also understood the prophecies are the scripture to some degree so I I guess I I saw the big picture if you will I knew one day we would see a major war\nAnd is a financial analyst an expert in the housing space I knew we were a in a huge housing bubble I understood the and carry trade and they were doing this massive inflation and us financial assets that you know these bottles ultimately pop\nSure in two thousand three I was warning on this program we were going to see a major housing crash and at the time it seemed ludicrous because housing was the only game in town\nYou were four years ahead of the game\nAnd that's one of the problems of being able to see the fundamental trends is there you know you always see these things a little bit early and who can ever really imagine or estimate how big the bubble can get\nWhen you when you look for ... years\nEarly but the housing market popped and today George we're in an economy that is supposedly six years into a recovery or an expansion in which we cannot raise interest rates\nAll these militants who may be here get their arms in their assault rifles and so while the war is going on elsewhere they crop up here to\nWell they no doubt are here in in in ... even more serious threat is what if they're equipped with weapons of mass destruction\nWell that's what if they have access to bioweapons or suitcase sized nuclear weapons or ... or you only get one or two small nuclear devices to change our world forever\nYup no question about that no question so when you went through biblical prophecy you picked up these events I mean ... ... most of it is it in code how do you decipher it\nWell Bible prophecy is definitely in to some degree symbolic and you have to use the Bible to interpret the Bible but the correct or the proper interpretation of the scriptures is not as difficult as it seems [noise]\nUh you have to understand the central\nElements the Bible prophecy which are contained in the ... the writing of the profit Daniel and they involve the identity of mystery Babylon which are the ... the kingdom of this world in opposition to God and there were four of them that rose in power before the first coming of Jesus Christ\nAnd they were pictured in the dream of king you can as her wedding witnessed a great statute with a had a goal arms to her than fire of rats in the legs of iron representing the radical battles on it so\nThe silver kingdom media Persia which followed Babylon\nThe brightest kingdom Greece thunder Alexander and then the legs of Rome electrifying representing the the empire of Rome\nDaniel in chapter seven was given a vision of four kingdom would rise in power at the end of the age and they are perfect type in the shadow of the force superpowers that ruled the earth before\nThe first coming up the lord and those kingdoms were pictured as first ally in out of which came eagles wing well the lion into it and\nThe eagle America it's not a hard stretch next with picture to bear it was in the position of

Benjamin we're talking about Russia and go back into the biblical process you with that there that's always concerned me\nWell Russia is that there [noise] and the beer is going to be used to attack\nThere's prophecies in the Bible in his ... thirty eight that talk about an invasion of Israel's time at the end from a great power to the north along with an alliance many kings of course north of Israel is Moscow and Russia\nAnd some would argue the prophecies of ... pertain to turkey or the Islamic countries but the major ... terrorists stays in the Arab world our satellites of Russia Iran and Syria are the main terrorists powers and\nSo Russia's been behind the scenes from the beginning George the KGB created Arab terrorism\nAs a third wave sort of a a fifth column to be used against the west\nAnd they stirred up the natural animosity for the Arab world against Israel in America by publishing this information works and they were the authors\nAnd publishers of a book called the protocols of The Elders of Zion I remember just pure propaganda\nAnd it out it presents the\nIsraeli and Jewish people is behind a\nWorld conspiracy to create a new world order and and bring all of Christian them under the control of the anti Christ\nAs if it's all being orchestrated from Tel Aviv and that the United states of America is just a puppet of Israel that men on the street in the Arab world this propaganda is acceptable to him\nAnd so you know it fanned the flames of of the hatred of Israel and and the hatred of the United states and and so the Russians were able to\nBasically shape and direct the various Arab terrorist organizations most and most of the leadership of all ... was trained by KGB ISIS today has military officers in it that are KGB officials\nThe today we're in a world of almost zero return where you need to focus on preservation of capital but a massive financial reset or a financial crisis is\nBaked into the cake and that is already in the oven it's only a question of when the financial crisis hits and it's not very far off\nWe bailed out a General Motors we bailed out a A R G insurance we bailed out many banks can we afford to do that again\nNo um we took the federal the national debt from well roughly about eight trillion to today's Seventeen Eighteen trillion dollars no we have um we bankrupted the country and bailing out the criminals\nAnd you know the the whole thing was a sham because it was a robbery you wouldn't have to bail out it was a bank robbery\nThey literally Rob the American people blind and they're going to handle the American middle class the losses because you know there's a you run a short little pad as part of your um intro to the show and you talk about the ... to talk around the murder of\nKennedy Kennedy\nAnd then the question is who really runs his country and where are they taking us there and it's true that's an excellent ad there was a coup your top secret could've talked Kurd and who really run this country the shadow bankers the the elite behind the shadow banking system\nDana ones is taking us the road is to war at this point\nI was gonna say they're the ones I Want us to go to war\nBecause they don't want to just the country George they want a global government they want the whole world\nAnd they would sacrifice some US cities to achieve that goal wouldn't they\nThey'll kill two hundred and fifty million Americans without even thinking about it\nHave they no shame\n[noise] they view people as property they think we have five billion too many people on the planet anyway and the Americans are going to be a problem they have this idea of freedom and they're really not going to give it up\nOne once the Benjamin that you saw which 'cause I I'm sure you went through school and college and training you didn't think this way something changed you what was\nWell candidly I met the Lord Jesus Christ when I was a fourteen years old and somebody told me you could actually meet him and I'm not talking about religion I really got saved and\nI met the real king of the universe and he actually answered me when I pray and I heard him with my ears and I began to walk with the lord and circle forward by\nThe mid eighties started explaining Bible prophecy to me\nAnd then circa forward again by the time I was running money I was a professional money manager in the mid nineties\nPraying about the stock market because I had larger dominant money I was responsible for George I asked the lord show me the end of this matter I was thinking about the stock market he translated me out of my living room into the future and I saw what is coming upon America I've been there I've already seen it\nAnd then when he brought me back to my living room\nHe changed my life if you got to show me how it's all explained to tell revealed and Bible prophecy because the prophecies of scripture are sealed until the time at the end all the men who tried to get the proper interpretation\nMaybe they made their best guesses but they\nDidn't understand you slow but they're all probably should wait for the second half of our program we\nReally need to get back to Russia and the road to World War three couple of minutes we have been\nTraveling got now how did I find out so much about the Russians strategies for World War three well back in two thousand and one my book the death lord of the hand became fairly popular I'd been a national tour a man named Jeffrey ... has had\nRead my book had contacted me and we'd be kind of dialogue by email and this was in the summer of two thousand and one and I had a dream and woke me up in the middle of the night I saw the United states attack\nBy commercial aircraft from United in American Airlines and I thought we were hacked by four points to from United to from American and then I saw the nuclear war and I in this dream George I was catching the fall out of my hand I was in North of LA all of Southern California basically been destroyed\nA nuclear attack and I woke up and Jeff was on line and what a nightmare that is yeah\nI knew it was a prophetic dream for the he gave me it's on every call me and we got on the phone for the first time and I play in the dream and I asked him could Russia disguise or bombers to look like United in American Airlines and he said no that that that can happen and I said well I don't understand it but we're about to be attacked by United Airlines\nWill start the next war and he said Benjamin that sounds rather crazy\nI Know it does but it's going to happen in and then I he asked me if you ever seen far before no well you described it perfectly I had no idea what fault looked like but I seen the real followed in my dream\nGeorge jak miss my dreams lots of people have dreams you know six weeks later on the morning and nine eleven the first plane hit he remembered I told him for aircraft to from United to from American and there you go\nAt a course my credibility with Jeff when we became very good friend here twelve years later\nI'm after we both on a number of things trying to wake up the American people I called jumping the pilots Jeff we need to do book but tell the American people exactly what's going to happen to them for the people that don't understand Bible prophecy or are\nPerhaps they're skeptical and couldn't ... there's a lot of Charlotte and paddling ticket and most of them are looking for money or you know whatever their that their own agenda and so there's a lot of fraud there's a lot of errors there's a lot of garbage and a lot of scare as\nThe Bible so I understand people saying you know that's all in opinion we can dismiss this let's talk about the reality on the ground what's really happening inside Russia and what is ahead for America and let's get them to prove you get to\nThe evidence of this book it's all geopolitical analysis\nAnd it's I mean it's frightening if you're an American\nBenjamin we're gonna come

can be absolutely change what's going to happen to the nation states into the world cannot be changed but on a personal level yes it can be changed so there's a reason to hope for the individual but\nThere's no hope for the nation\nBiblical process see in your opinion which again is not religion\nBut what is it who put it there why\nWell biblical\nProphecy the revelation of word of God in which God in effect is revealing the truth of Jesus Christ and revealing the truth\nOf what will call upon a world that has rejected his love and righteous [noise] and it also contains a warning to mankind on an individual level\nTo turn and receive his salvation without which none of us will find the turn of life\nSo it's got proving that he is God because he's revealed the end of human history

the United states which of\nThe whole world George although they number one you know they should ever right\nWe're proud of the fact that we're number one and we know it so you know in many ways God starts\nWith a country on the top of the good old USA Today which in turn ... ours was a great country\nWe've sort of lost our way out and we\nWish him you know if you don't mind I'd like to take maybe two minutes and just put a rap on on Russia to caution of the global the new tactics of global war okay and it leads us right into the prophecies of Russia and you've got to go\nTo a brief excerpt short of that\nThe spirit of the book the Cold War officially ended in Nineteen Ninety One with the collapse of the Soviet Union the experts in the west were convinced\nThat America's economic might had exhausted the Soviets\nAnd the resolve of the Reagan Era had broken their will to fight capitalism had proved to the world both freedom and prosperity could be delivered\nAmerica had withstood the challenge of communism and prevailed the lights of the shining city on a hill never glowed brighter\nThe west was exuberant in those days capitalism and the American way of life had triumph and the spoils of war would be divided among us all in the form of a peace dividend\nThe media joined the chorus fanning on national celebration we were told it was the end of history and the beginning of a new era of permanent peace and prosperity there were dissenting voices that had warned all is not well\nBut these warnings were marginalized and simply ignored the west was told a fake collapse of the Soviet Union had been planned for years\nBut mainstream media discredited these warnings is merely conspiracy theory no one seemed to care the communists had given up the rotten little empire\nAnd that was all the west needed to know the thought that the collapse of Russia was a clever chest move in a much larger strategic game seemed impossible\nBus the idea was simply derided educated\nOpinion in the west accepted the collapse of the Soviet Union as spontaneous and authentic what was going to happen at the end of this chess game could not be prevented\nOver twenty five years have passed since the fall of the Berlin Wall the vacuum of power which was created by the collapse of the Soviet Union has led our world rather than to an era of permanent peace and prosperity but to the brink of actual World War\nRussia [laughter] merely appeared to embrace democracy but nothing of the sword ever really occurred instead Russia has developed an entirely new class of weapons\nWhich no other nation on earth possesses today and his arming itself to the teeth the reports of the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the communist threat\nAppear now at best have been greatly exaggerated but\nIn truth they weren't intentional deception or the west although the intelligence services of the Soviet era the KGB was renamed the federal security service or FSB\nIt facilitated the rise of power a lot of ... former KGB officer proving the security service from is very much in power\nIn the new Russia the new tactics of global war presents the truth of what really happened in Russia\nAnd the grand strategy of its leaders taking them inside the mind of the men who play this chess game of lives and deception and it's so doing revealing for you the mind of the beast and behold another piece the second like a bear raised itself up\nAnd it was set up into it a rise and devour much flash and George that is exactly the communist have done and what they're planning to do it is a brutal evil empire as Ronald Reagan said\nThis is an evil empire and they've relied primarily on lies and deception which have been very successful\nThey seem to be having Americans very sympathetic to them that's just my impression\nWhy it it's part of the propaganda because they need to win the political war at this point the Russian communists alliance can defeat the United states in\nAn all out conventional war because we are basically vulnerable to a surprise attack\nOur land base ICBMs or not even armed with active warheads most Americans don't study military bounce power we stopped producing nuclear warheads back in the early Nineteen nineties because the Cold War was over and George we won or sold the Russians told us\nAnd so for almost Twenty years we didn't produce new nuclear warhead in this country well they have a shelf life and they're no longer reliable after Fifteen to Twenty years so we don't have enough nuclear warheads for all our delivery systems today all of our best stuff is on the tried and submarines\nOur strategic air command bombers George they're all on three air bases\nThat can be liquidated in a matter of minutes are treading submarines don't even have the launch codes\nThose clothes have to be transmitted either the sub surface or we have to use extreme long wave radio transmissions set of bounce off the ionosphere the airplanes to broadcast that frequency are all on one island in the Indian Ocean\nThose planes are taken out those subs have to surface to air their fleet can be eliminated by three airbases the Glenn based ICBMs are sitting ducks and the tried and don't have a trigger mechanism\nWe we don't get off a shot George and they can launch cruise missiles off our coast there will be detonating over our coastal cities in a matter of minutes\nThey have an X ray weapons that can detonate in space they will blackout our early distant warning satellite system all will know is new or at will see their computer screens go dark we won't know if it was a sunspot technical malfunction\nFor the next twenty two minutes there'll be scrambling annoyed at trying to figure out what happened\nUntil the centers will register at ground based detonation inside the continental United States\nThey won't know if it was another act of Arab terrorism because the previous nuclear detonation on our soil using suitcase bombs we lived in blamed on Arab terrorists\nThey'll be trying to figure out who detonated the latest ground burst when new around we'll be vaporized\nSobel all the other remaining military assets of this country\nThe host the United states is going to be defeated but the American people will survive\nAnd following the defeat of the United states which is

form of a gun grabbing some form of a national vaccination\nProgram that will be resisted in various regions will have something similar to civil war occurring we may see several states attempt to heat from the union the dollar will begin to waver our ability to project economic and military power will begin to road\nAnd then the WorldCom [noise] and then the final phase George there's going to be a period known as great terror in which there would be a worry of\nTerrorist incidents in a two to three maybe four week window of time\nThat will culminate in attacks against our communication infrastructure satellite up links will be disrupted the folks who go down the TV won't work power will be out and it's not going to come back on for several days\nI've had a chance to meet and talk to an interview a lot of high level people to of which are astrophysicist who are experts in climate change and I was introduced to them through a mutual friend and we got on the phone\nAnd I began to speak with him on the telephone asking questions about climate change and George they kept answering me by saying I really can't discuss head on the telephone I about a thirty minute phone call with this PHD in which for the most part he told me he can't talk on this\nAwful I finally in frustration said look is there any way we can meet in person are you ever in Southern California because I have business and in Southern California reaching we ended up meeting in Los Angeles we spent ten hours in a conference room in downtown LA\nStarted at nine in the morning broke for lunch and dinner we finished nine at night I took pages and pages them notes they went through the detail of climate change this classified science\nData here's basically what's happening George\nThere is an ex journal energy source outside of our solar system\nIt has a neutron star it is in the vicinity of the Ryan constellation it is Thirteen hundred light years from our earth\nAnd its radiating our solar system with both cosmic can gamma radiation the highest forms of radiation that radiation has weaken the heliosphere which has a protective\nShield around the entire solar system the heliosphere has shrunk about twenty five percent\nAllowing all of this X. journal radiation into the solar system the effect of which is destabilizing the sun and impacting every planet on the solar system every planet is experiencing a warming in its core\nThis radiation is actually heating up the core of our her\nAs the core of the earth heats up the magma fields expand\nIt's the magnetic fields expand the pressure on the Titanic play is increasing as that pressure increases there's\nMore and more volcanic activity\nAnd greater and greater earthquakes at the same time the molten core the liquid iron in the core of our earth which is spinning creating the magnetic field around our earth which has a magnetic shield\nThat she'll is weakening allowing even greater amounts of energy both solar energy from our son an extra energy from outside the solar system even greater amounts are being absorbed into the ecosystem the earth causing a positive feedback mechanism\nChina should during the Winter Olympics don't worry about the weather folks we can change that we can all through that wasn't that a governmental admission that they're playing around with the weather\nThe the major world powers all have climate change technology I mean it's not that complicated when you can project high intensity beam energy we can you know it's like turning up the heat in the do the climate system is a\nSystem that operates on storm all exchange\nYou build a huge microwave generators\nYou can increase the heat\nAnd increase the volatility of the climate system yeah but at the same time there is access journal energy that is affecting the solar system [noise] George our moon is developing an atmosphere right now they don't tell us these things but scientific\nFact the moon is developing is sodium based atmosphere sodium gases accumulating around them here on earth\nThe changes on our planet are simply incredible from the magnetic field weakening and there are actual breaches in the magnetic field\nThat over the African continent and and at times over the very south of South America there's gaping hole opening up in the magnetic field where\nDangerous amounts of radiation are now coming through the sun itself it's your radiance level is noticeably increasing being measured\nBy our scientific community it's just not being shared with the general public this change in our ecosystem is so profound George\nThere is a new type of lightening that is now beginning to her on the earth known as red spreads or blue jet lightning and this lightning is occurring during thunderstorms\nWhen conventional lightning is generated by the thunder clouds and goes down to the earth\nAt the same time the Sprite and the blue jet lightning emanates from the top of the thunder clouds and goes all the way up to the ionosphere cooperating with the cosmic gamma radiation that is emanating from our son\nWas were playing around with whether you're Russia's doing is China's doing it in the ... and maybe a few other countries right it's affecting the entire planet\nYes it is it's kind of like um [noise] you know a a while they're mad really I mean it's like Russian roulette with the ecosystem because really\nIn the end it becomes Pandora's box I mean these systems are so complex how do we know what we're going to unlock\nThe exact you on a leash all kinds of things that worry\nAnd indeed we are we have that sort of weather systems being changed by external energy and\nThe mad scientist you know or various governments are there during their own which is brew not a very comforting scenario

to your calls Benjamin on the back of the book the day of the lord is at hand you write about prophecy in nine eleven was September eleventh that tragedy the catalyst for ... times do you think\nUh yes it was it was a it was a mystical date it was a symbolic date in terms of ... and it was the beginning of the takedown of our country if you will you\nKnow it's interesting George because eleven years prior on nine eleven in Nineteen Ninety then President George Bush stood\nUp and this was in the context of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait\nAnd he declared a new world order was coming and these actions were part of a mystical mystery religion\nWhere they needed to act out the symbolic she of the new the temple of Hercules tell of an aircraft which will be built in following the war and the ... that they represent the three mystical numbers of eleven twenty two in thirty three\nAnd the first number represents\nThe unveiling of what's hidden in the darkness and that's what President Bush did on September eleventh Nineteen Ninety nine eleven years later to the day of September eleventh two thousand and one flight eleven hit the twin towers and in in New inaugurated the event\nThat was the beginning of the action representing the number twenty two and they're looking for their completion the calving of the cornerstone following twenty twelve and that work must be completed by twenty six team and\nSo we're headed right into it it's these days really are about to come upon us\nI Wish we could change it stopped\nWell we can change we can change it in terms of the effect on our own lives there will be people that are gonna be in a sense immune if you will or protected or we can't change what's going to happen because the Bible prophecy will come at the appointed time according to scripture and\nLeast time have been appointed they've been fixed this there is fixed as the rotation of the stars\nWell they sure are okay let's take some calls your for your Benjamin they are lining up for you Scott as the first time caller Columbus, Montana Hi Scott thanks for calling go ahead\nOh thank you Mr ... or um stir broke I got to tell you I got into a a card and I'd come home from work and I heard the end of the signs that you were saying to watch for\nA before the ICBMs coming I'm shaking and I've been telling people about this for years as the erosion from within and nobody seems to want to notice it\nAnd I personally live in Columbus, Montana which is about Ninety miles from Yellowstone so you know I'll have enough time to get on the front porch to watch the pirate class to cloud come in if you know what I mean [noise]\nBut um I Want to know what it is we can do in the meantime what can we do to protect ourselves that I got I think most of it's out of our hands as far as preventing but what can we do to help our own selves\nWell the more people wake up and the more people who take action\nThe better prepared our families in our communities will be the events that are coming are going to change the world as we know it and in many ways the the normal\nAmerican lifestyle will be over the we live in the days of ease they are ending soon so in the natural we can prepare by\nProvision ing and by by getting ready for a time of of national crisis of food shortages of water shortages and ultimately of war\nBut in the spiritual realm these events are in fact the judgment of almighty God so to ultimately prepared properly\nWe have to turn to the lord people have got to wake up to the reality we live in a spiritual world it's not just the material world there is a God in heaven who created this university created this planet and he created mankind\nAnd we will all given account to him and the day of accounting is coming upon the earth the great day of God's\nJudgment and says in the book of revelation whoa under the inhabitants of the earth for the day of God's judgment is come but there's still a chance\nGod still hold out the offer of peace and mercy and forgiveness to mankind provided were willing to repetitive arson and turn to the lord and call in the name of Jesus Christ which is the one name whereby we may be safe\nYou know I've always told people you know put some ... way too for the future I don't know how long you can do it when you got to have some water food just enough to hold on in case just in case\nA lot of this has to be prepared I just it's so here's another question Benjamin in may be the big one ...\nWhy is this such a hateful Maureen planet\nBecause of sin because of the evil of men because men would rather pleased themselves and love their neighbor\nAnd greed and greed yes absolutely because of the evil that's in the heart of men I mean people prey upon each other\nPeople who are filled with darkness joins speak blacks of wicked in his and a lot of it is done in the name of God look at Islam and he ISIS and the rest of this darkness claimed to serve their God Allah who in reality is the moon God\nHe's not the God of having a is a God of how you know what God would sanction the murder of innocent children only God filled with evil\nAre gone to the back in the days of the uh Israel lights remember the lambs blood around your door\nWell the sacrifice was was to\nPresent to reveal to us that that are sitting require to sacrifice and it it was a foreshadowed to the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross but he never required the murder of innocent children\nSee I think all religions probably are skewed somewhat where they forgot I mean I don't think God is as evil\nAs the early Bible depicted in terms of things that happened to me in time\nWell I Would agree that religion and all religious institutions end up under the control of men who seek to use these organizations for the protection of their own power George and so in the end\nAnd that's really all become corrupted the religious leadership of Israel when Jesus first came was corrupt\nAnd look at the Vatican bank right now they talk about corruption I mean the Vatican bank ... is is loaded encourage\nMakes no sense doesn't\nWell the the rule of man brings nothing but tyranny and sorrow and pain and that's why we really look for a return to the kingdom of God because gods the only one that can really rule the earth and\nAnd do so righteously all the men that have tried it ended up coming death spots power corrupts men\nYou know do you believe that some higher power will step in and bail us all out\nI Believe that at the very end of these days Jesus Christ will return but I don't know that will be bailed out a remnant will be saved the world will have demonstrated itself\nESPN Plus your college football coverage\nThe American advertising federation present at week DC an annual

tweeted is there a second Spanx\nLike on my news website over a ... street there there are elusive papers on the right hand side the current neighbor is the one that is on the town\nNow with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an allegation which is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone that take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid you you start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and\nUm ah the review or a who was it was very well known a job for a job here who don't we reviewed my paper or he calls his waves um and I call it sort of a federal effect um and so when you look at the details of that which\nPublished by fitness petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course\nAs a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get dinner but\nEvery once in a while there is a jump so you have a much thicker course and then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another sudden jump in sickness and just keeps on going and going for\nTwenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jumps petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks child around\nFraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty two or three ...\nSo he found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for interpret it what does it mean a it was just noted but uh it just sat there until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story Great Pyramid how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and ah originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have to have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not\nCompleted there was a they say that there was a virtual top so it was actually flat at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know one of the the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... butter jump off of all and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb uh his brother vote to apparently sees in the back of the book where he explains\nThis theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek\nA and of course other people say it was and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred ten courses\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating of the thicker layers\nUm\nIs it every ten steps is it every twelve is there some kind of ... you\nKnow I that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but\nUnfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of what you know to me it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nOr because you know you would you just you know simple mindedly I thought each step they weren't just a applied the ah the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians design the appearance with or something called they called it set at which is the pyramid and go\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward and that's how they conceptualize a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same\nAnd and it's not and and ah and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's no regularity even to fat thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that uh after the break but what is the most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen veteran decker\nYeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors well that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension that\nWhich which to me I Want it to correct something I said in the fate to block interview I think I said that\nA bill ... to ... um shot a shop to ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing or during the twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't an arcade into big tipper it was a star Iraq\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country\nAnd because of that because that constellation big tipper was so important to Egypt shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big tipper and we buy a pair of it ended up in that in the north south uh orientation\nI got to jump in right there this is coast to coast

Saturday and we're talking about his paper that was published last week\nAnd again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is a Chiapas pyramid dot com the links are at coast to coast am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of publish papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that ...\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you strike three hundred ... a a scrawled on page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers and with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber in Queens chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery and so working from the bottom the first layer up\nA voyage we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for\nThese must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this but these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing mole and you're right I'm I'm I'm this thing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a worse the civically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty fifty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractious tend to run\nA over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber and\nBased on this ... this observation that there seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know those courses that have a surface area that is around ... number fraction of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces\nAnd work but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that ... exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right then you have to have some basis for this and clearly\nWe have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example correspond a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth from Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... that ah that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier with a feeling than than than the one that we just talked about is a question I'm thirty four also it has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round fracture the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight or we have eight twenty fifth\nOr and that goes across the feeling of the um off the ground at tower I'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and and twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a\nTwo of relieving chambers in fact the tower um and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here\nUm that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the\nPossible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be row eighty four\nNo row eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the ... the big boys I got it yes of course we don't\nKnow exactly we just it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give a rough guy\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does my news see any connection between a dynastic Egyptian use of the lion and the use of the lion at go badly tabby\nAnd everybody's talking about go back to be today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shark we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd we constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we

it's still a crime scene um and and of course I'm you know I don't know all the details so I I Can't really comment on it but I I'm I'm being told by people there that it's completely off limits nobody can get in there\nLet's let's get one more call and maybe to be for the top of the hour they are completely ah jammed up your looks kind of Thomas ... Thomas Manu\nJeremy thank you for taking my call Manu ... search you know my question as we have the supplies into and the pyramids the banks have there been any\nIntention to reconstruct the original pouring off key subplot to do and I know that sounds radical but for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties sub remote viewing\nHim to an intuition and actually reconstruct the temples repair the temples have spent discussed\n... yes and as it was a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the minister of antiquities is trying to partially restored a monument so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern\nReconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do affection\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched so that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard or it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter\nMy new alien um they are basically recreating he's a a a ... in in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to ah descend into a virtual world and it will be exactly like the way it looked or the the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the scriptures and it'll feel like you know a real thing and they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid where did you come up with the number six or eight\nWhite so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform\nTo this uh you know just a simple rule that the surface\nArea is around fraction of twenty fifth and so\nAnd I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that\nOne more phone call before the break let's go to let's go out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the\nUh selling he'll watch uh I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or the pyramids and for research and just general public access\nAnd I had heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned what is your access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better access for research in the general public and I'll take my answer off the air\nGreat question Daniel my new what's it like there now with that I saw you\nRegarding talked about so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as as the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person and he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study of Robert Robert shock and I are\nUm and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed\nMessages so on the one hand it solves like investigators are being invited to come on and on the other hand I'm hearing is that they ah they become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they've won research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and stuff and you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... one research would be ongoing like it is it ... was was still the director there\nHe I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors\nThat reviews the data so he is involved or at least not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he's involved they asking for is at by a is input\nUm you know I think they're sort of mixed\nBack here you know there is the public's eye of us who you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then probably there's the the scientists the archeologists who loves what he does\nUm you know it's difficult to kind of saw it all out but I think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research done and\nI to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects that ah you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being saved them political right now and I understand that I knew it and I respect that yeah I mean there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved to from that stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that's why are they gonna have to open ... are they going to have to back pedal\nYeah so it to the to the listeners question I think I forgot and was Daniel I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you you said two thousand eleven so I think that has something has changed or this sort of a you know people are even Egypt causes that talked to some of some of the scholars they have the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nA say and they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right there I knew I going to take a quick network break this is coast to coast am more minute when we come back

Kush language which is of course ... ... to ... years ago\nOr ... or ... or ... the you know we're talking about a quarter of three ... for ... years ago it's been ... older than any other language you can put on a full of parliament show ... which was\nOf people who is just speak well it's a cush people still you know rich in the bag loans which are from the push\nWhich just do things like who does a little late it was a little people of all the pilot or the ... ... you know heighten or somewhere in the ...\nI'm going to I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thanks for the phone call a minute the origins of the word pharaoh and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't quite some thanks for interpret I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so so he chipped colleges are saying that uh in the old kingdom a that term was not use\nSo the term pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the kings of the old king them I think the first ah I'm I and I can't remember if it's middle kingdom or new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appears and that's\nAll I Know about it offhand I said what I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here uh when we were when we're going back\nTo a man as\nA um and in the\nFirst and now I'm going to say the word they were referred to as kings\nYeah right right like in armor and men is\nUh the first uh kings of Egypt could be some are saying that the the same a menace ... may be the same or they could be two different teams they weren't called pharaohs back\nThen right and now there's another ah\nAh I have research that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egyptians and the the ... that are there now\nI'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\nYeah um yeah I Can't really comment on it because I don't know enough about it um I I it regarding what the king was called I can tell you that uh\nBy the fifth dynasty the king had five different titles um and in the very beginning um you know the kings were called horse came so it was ...\nAnd Horace ... so uh so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after I came you know the designation a net soon that which is basically referring to operate in Egypt and then came the two ladies there and ah you know and then came to cartoonish name later\nUm but uh the as you just set yourself so Farrow came later I I just looked it up if I was like twelve hundred BC is the first time it was used\nThere you go let's go east of the Rockies let's go to Jay out here in Los Angeles Jay you're up next on coast [noise]\nHello hello J. lo J.\nHow you guys doing I don't know how high is there a first time caller long time long time listener\nI'm I Am actually um Egypt and I'm On my mom's side and I'm growing up as a kid I Would always hear\nMy grandmother said at least they tell me a lot of stories that there was always passages from here there there's always secrets to the great pyramid has secrets to there's tunnels here so they're you know there's always stories that Graham you know grandkids hear their ah grandparents say the\nOne that always stuck with me that I really wanted to get clarification on I've seen stuff like on line but\nI Try to take it with a grain of salt um I really am glad that you're on the show a ... I really wanted to ask you for your um [noise] uh expertise on this if you guys have ever heard is there an opening or any access\nBehind the scenes skier or on top of their head or anywhere along in that area or maybe the bottom of the paw and the back somewhere like that that has been\nSuccess to an insight chamber of this of the things that I'm holds or something very dear to humanity that we are uh [noise] we're not being told 'em all the details of have you have you guys heard any anything like that\nWell gee you're in luck because men who's been researching some ... paper about it so I I'm a ... now my new before we get to what's underneath the the ball on the left front to love from Paul\nUh there has been photographs of the top of the banks fried in the ground up or what appears to be I had\nTo wear a whole lot and I have also read a lot of research about uh the right here uh an entrance behind the right ear that Jay is referencing year so let's talk about uh the head of this thing's first and possible entrances\nYes so there is a there is a space or in inside the head of the things and it's been a basically locked up there's a ... there was a little hatch\nAnd I'm I'm I think Roberts ah ... was telling me about this I think uh you can there's you can't stand in there if maybe six foot deep\nI'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but\nUm but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that um\nI can tell you that the uh you know the world to cruise ships um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth\nCharted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it um there is a a there's another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves\nBecause you know maybe just or you say it's structured spaces be are filled with ... ... ... and uh everything arches inside the comedy is like a temple\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's exactly\nThe conclusions are that my new is presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and voids could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been I have to mention shop here will do so of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this these on the ... basis basically to get the stores up the pyramid and the scan from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is that I think it's possible that the scandal was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm saying they could be theological and chop you're dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know if you have to pay for a but he still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know beat out as it may so we agree there are probably space is up there\nAnd um I just want to ask you a quick uh because the pyramid of course who it's it's as high spaces inside research is in the sixties went to Congress pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know corporate pyramid buddy ... all we have is built on each chamber\nWell let me jump in I've got to take a break right there but it's just something we need to talk about when we come back or gas my new stateside eight this is all the great

morning\nHere in Southern California my new uh the phones have been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to let's go to Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique welcome\nAnd some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid\nYou can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know and you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website\nGo check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website\nAnd one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino and do you know says are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTraits meaning\nThat's just what it says in the winter\nWe don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things that do you knows referencing here one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological ah within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched a documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain that\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master\nPlan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock or has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but\nSpecifically some of the trades I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it well\nLet me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras 'em and believes at the tops of these pyramids there's always something there\nWhat about the top of the great pyramid is and what do not not the top top but could there be a chamber\nOr something at the at the upper levels\n... as well I think so I think that could be that there could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a drop off ... has proposed that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a\nAnd it would have been a you know as sphere and it's interesting that the diameter of that here is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory a and others have proposed similar things\nThere's even a hero cliff I think I'm a this was first mentioned by a state Jeannie in a night in uh Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great fear of it so not up to your media and by the sphere\nSo yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in a a and one is clearly defined edge row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so\nHow big would it be way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that height um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be\nMaybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by in height I'm saying rising oh maybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... and especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you'd have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph guns and bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not all be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that ah who Don environments\nIt it it's up on the south it's on the north east but\nYeah the northeast corner right in the\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable states you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up to a place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers to me it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just seeing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know if you have to pay the people to experiment I'm guessing multiple million dollars I think maybe ten million or something like that you do this project um and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I I think if you do any kind of invasive\nA project or the project like this spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the strings and hope things that's a kind of money that will need for a project like\nThis is coast to coast am host
