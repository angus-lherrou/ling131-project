I Know you might consider consolidating cause I've left when former employees employers actually she and we both are stuff over and go right so I was just wondering what your thoughts were on\nEvery different four O. one K. will be a different IRA when you roll it but you could have five I our age that we're all rollovers from previous\nFor a one case or previous IRAs and they could all be at one investment broker and one person won't watching over it with you um and that's advisable\nUh so uh yeah I I Would get with one of those smart Mr burrows I was just talking about right before I picked up a call ... ... dot com and they can show you how to do those rollovers or shouldn't be any taxes involved if he'd roll over a\nTraditional i._r._a. to a tradition our traditional four O. one K. to a traditional i._r._a. there's no taxes on that if you're doing direct transfer roll over\nAnd I'm Don we're always recommend and I personally invest with recommendations that I use oddly enough [noise]\nAh too that we put your in retirement and my retirement in four types of growth stocks mutual funds\nGross growth in income aggressive growth and international and spread the total of their nest egg across those four and a evenly twenty five percent H Kathy is with us in Wisconsin I Cathy how're you\nI'm good how are you there aren't any better than I deserve what's up\nUh my husband and I are looking for higher than the next two to three years I hadn't been for sure [noise] now we have a third of our income on earth are their cameras have been\nWhere a financial advice you currently and I'm Wondering like your opinion is having more than my financial advisor\nWhy would you need more than ... [noise]\nI'm the only reason that I'm I Am gory ended up the air that you'd have all of you are your retirement fading whiny and\nIt's not with them they're just advising you know you're on where to put it you're not with them I'm older they're the\nI mean it's like saying I'm you know I've got four different cars and so I'm worried about the mechanic already own cars and the mechanic is just helping me manage all before cars\n\nIt doesn't change the mix there'd be a two of the cars one mechanic and do the guards but the other McKenna you've still got the same for cars and you still have to manage all four of them\nSo it makes sense\nYeah I Do I don't I don't know now like the\nGuy well it's not connecting them because it's perfect but uh it added up to the ... the idea is this the investments that you have are not owned and operated by your financial adviser\nYou owned them your advisor is just telling you what to do with what things you own\nAnd so you could own mutual funds in three different mutual for different mutual funds\nAnd a half two of them was one advisor and two of them more than other advisor or you could have all four of them was one advisor in either case you're still own for mutual funds the exact same for by the way because\nYou're you should be making the decision about where your money goes the advisor teaches you and advisors you but you should be making the money the decision about where your money go you're not blindly turning over a block of money and go just doing it whenever you want\nYou know no that's just dangerous as cried you need to know everything about where the money's going and understand everything about it\nAnd so if that's the case then the financial advisors simply the conduit\nAnd an information source and if you don't trust the information to shore so they shouldn't be your advisor\nThat's why you don't need to you need one that their information aligns with your value system and what you are planning to do with your investments and then they walk you through that\nI have one and there's twenty five accounts with this one guy in my case and and so but the twenty five counts are mine they're not his and\nHe just advisors me on whether I Want to put more and more I'm more than one open another one whether I Want them to them together we just talk through what these funds are doing with these investments are doing I understand what they're doing based on his advice and based on that then I make the decision of what's going to happen with my money and that's what I Want you doing\nAnd if you do it that way then there's no benefit whatsoever to having to financial advisors\nAnd the only reason you do that is if you didn't trust one of them which means you shouldn't even have them\nAnd so that that's the idea that is what the analogy was trying to get to but I guess I missed it sorry about that Sean is with us in Tucson, Arizona Hi Shaun how are you\nA better than that they're good how can I help you might call 'em I'll give you some numbers here real quick um I have fifty five thousand dollars in liquid cache of about forty a modern Roth are already\nAnd I make Seventy two down here\nI'm I'm

coast it\nGoes Alan welcome back my front yard it's great to be with you\nHave things changed since the last time we talked about student loans that they've gotten worse I bet\n[laughter] well yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we're probably at it and I think I was about a year ago as we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab\nWhich is now sitting officially it about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still there's a lot of loans to the don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm gonna walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell these agents I get a sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus ... it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nCheese and the these agents or collection companies\nWell yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] ah and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also owned guarantor so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than\nUh than alone there remains it's good that I could probably say here George to all the people listening out there to rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate they default again three to four\nTimes and they just keep growing oh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan defaults again\nAnd that happens something like eighty percent of the time then the whole process starts again\nTo stay with us Allan let's talk about if there's any recourse here and again we'll take calls

I should add so that's uh something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fair\nDebt collections actress laws federal um a fruit in lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of\nThis really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cup ball of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits\nYes served on the board of Sally\nStay back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise] uh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for a parent to use child has a ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give up at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow do not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans\nDon't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices treated lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank get a private line of credit and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type of loan whatever\nHappened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices just so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee\nYou now you're per year that's tuition room board books um for a four year course for a four\nYear college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad and is now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the cat burglar seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raised their prices but also really straining to students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently we're\nLosing a guy walked out of dental school with a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know were seen comments from people like Jamie diamond a gp Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how this student loan problem is\nReally affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off that's Ninety billion dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses it's killing entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be filled\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with Alan Collins when we come back\nIf you've got a student

trusted for over Twenty years\nVan is news radio Ninety seven point seven ... twelve Ninety am double duty chaos\n[noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was it outlet that made you get involved in this\n[noise] [noise] oh well I had a um I graduated I found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nBut what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there was too long just falling into\nA is a lineage system that actually want you to default so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboo ... and ... your loans to default which is\nWhat happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with Leslie stall yeah a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might add a and so it was sort of ...\nA ball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have rough credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick in by that I mean you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared marked for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy or these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said\nWant to ... so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars\nKeeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... if not more and with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you\nBuy it online and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car and you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know this car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks\nYou know uh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans in particularly is used as you rightly say\nFor lower income people um you know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education's just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because they're credited shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the landing system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs crazy eat greasy once once the tuition like Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse earliest probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way\nUm but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple of three four\nYears I should have pushed my kids and the sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know\nUnless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy so this has just\nGotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job in a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge Allen good thank you\nGeorge I got good news for you too man a throw rally over there and laugh at it on the other day yeah there was a big signs they throw support sealed their he left right after you hold that thought\n[laughter] I Love it but uh anyway I I I wanted to drive a little bit of a trade school to a\n... a former cub there used to work or I got on egg wildly and when a company when I go to the owners of the night and a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but ah it pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people so I helped her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too well and I think also for a couple of years you know\nYou probably more than ... you had more experience than most people\nThere and I looked at the local school there and they were to court houses dollars just to go for oh I think it was a two month course just on ... well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going now unless the thousand dollars on the grades little are learning to drive semi thrive\nAnd then I felt like I got shafted on that I found out that it's not up for about half the price of\nA let's get your reaction to this Ellen what do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly thank Allen he's the one pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protecting encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I our already knew that the more you said for dies the lungs especially the taxpayer on her on an aircraft a dollar by the way because almost ... percent of total debt is

they in the unit around consolidation ... action program and how can I can turn and right now I'm On a ... fan base repayment program\nAnd I have no idea what that is that that was going to ask if it hurt at this company or and\n... again to me Allen doesn't it do you have student loans off their genes\nI Do I Do I got my first time you know trying to work on my bachelors\n... well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the list or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't they scammers\nYes there are a lot of ... cameras out there and I haven't heard of this you ds company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and so we consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger alone or and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nHow they're George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of up growling pose a health\nHealth law that job thank you and I'm hoping to hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and all for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nI Hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information is a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the ah the costs that I've ever heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with the the oh he tried to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would\nNever deal with a third party collection company you\nKnow unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for H. are twenty three sixty six and getting our bankruptcy writes back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third and third party collection companies I'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department\nOf education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education so I mean if you can make an offer to them about a hundred and twenty percent of the lake it alone no faulted you know that's something you you can do but certainly dealing with a question of like like what you describe\nIt and they get the information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the new rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again well you\nHave to be very careful these are some be loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and union\nLeaders down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they all they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having such limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent particularly for older loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original sign\nPromise not at all that one once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens in the Pentagon or more what's that all of a\nDefined were George Norris speaking ... scroll down to the bottom including Georgia's calendar\n\n\nDay I remember a theme today on the free eye on radio\nDays they'll Halloween kind of scary\nLittle things mean everything's getting tired and I said family I think\nHe's a van is news radio Ninety seven ... seven ... well ... am when you see chaos\n[noise]\nLet me tell you a little bit about Nick Pope those viewer news show Nick worked for the United kingdom ministry of defense does to getting your photos and other mysteries\nHe's been called the real ... has been working as a consultant or spokesperson numerous easily in the movies TV shows video games as well and tonight we're going to be talking about aliens at the Pentagon and Nick welcome back it's always great to be\nGreat to be back on the shirt how ya doing these days yeah good thing [noise]\nWhere do we last see each other contacted the desert we were there\nAnd I'm now what's that before off to your life event in full like city which we did\nA that was right around that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job there thank you for job indeed\nAliens at the Pentagon I Love this title so many more\nOkay it's a essentially it is my new documentary that I put out to tell the story all off certainly the Pentagon's\nUFO credit Graham a tip but she can take July it's that story and and really to to try in one human tree to tell as as best as I can the entire story of the U.S government thorny relationship with this\nPhenomenon or watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single revelation in the UFO community for I think decades I the only story that I think comes\nClose and I would say this wouldn't I is the de classification and release of the British Government files but the the revelation\nThat off to decades have to know the U.S government did have a UFO program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm from an agency of the day and and like I say for years they said no no since project to close down we haven't been doing this the snowy ... or no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try\nTo train on tango the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of of mistreatment pulls the all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this that role but they get low a Senator Harry Reid\nCharmed along I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up in honey you track all this stuff because it's coming from a whole different directions these days\nI think the answer to that one is is very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with this story in one sense for years\nPeople have said the problem is the particularly with ... we have two little information about what's\nGoing on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we almost have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's just about a case for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing man if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on December sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to a than a than a third one\nBut now the public has been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this strong guy and then this is a millionaire businessman and and the struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's\nThat's what I've tried to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this\nFrom my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nTold me a little bit more about the film will get a lot into it of course tonight it leans at the Pentagon but tell us specifically about\nWell I took a logs on on on that one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seat and then you've done this of course civilian time yourself you know you sit in the ... said\nA direct to kind of talks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I've\nGot edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd put it in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon ... did they fight teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so I scripted the entire movie I ... the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio ... you know you had it often headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did it parts of it too to camera and in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all a together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can well I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure\nFrom a it's a completely new role to me I I there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing uh people like Jeremy ... was just made a\nA a great movie but um you know I I it was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish would they will use at the Pentagon\n[noise] firstly I as I say really to try to\nGo through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that\nField has is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand we go ahead on to the platforms that the young people the watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but to young people and\nAnd another thing is you know it's been a year since ... had his press conference where he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon don't want to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization now like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel is meant to what do you\n... when when you say the organization um he right\nYes um well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has had what he'd always says in these sorts of\nSituations only as little as possible and we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he\nHe says it's still going now other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nIn the book if ... if I think it is where it refers to say as being the print the power of the air and I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious\nPeople the idea that you might be on it\nAnd there were a lot of religious ... that believe that\n[noise] yeah and it's frustrating you know than because and and the most I mean clearly ironic in another way that\nYou know you have a bunch of people in the the the the the IRA elsewhere and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people for this we're dealing with a real phenomenon and\nWe should be investigating it researching it in a proper scientific manner and we come up again skepticism you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect\nUm skepticism is sort of [noise]\nNicole or intellectual\nA human it kept the system but I think most people\nI associate with that concept it's actually it's a ... probably trying to be driven skepticism itself I mean it to have effectively the so called us skeptics in the end um\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things at the mall well it's just in one sense it's paying one on your plea fringe belief for another ... these ... these people were skeptics are told they would\nBelieve that they would you believe in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back in ... more right here on

grappled with a lot at the ministry of defense and and they fight the I'm lost to files in in the what's now being a ten year program to the class find release them\nWell are you exactly but what do you think about the late president Ronald Reagan's attempt to get the star wars technology going some people thought it was to protect us from some kind of alien intervention\nYes and he certainly made of course those remarks\nAre very famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I occasionally saying how quickly we we would set aside differences down here on it if if we\nFace some alien threat and and of course people read an awful lot into those remarks and then they saw the star wars program and they read read a law into that to my own personal view is that that was much more about just trying to\nWin the Cold War and find crop the Soviet Union which to be fair is exactly the way it pretty much\nPlayed out I'll Try ... there's been new still talk of disclosure are you you know I I'm\nArguing Steven bass and all the time I don't think there's going to be the kind of disclosure he expects do you think that the things that are happening now governmental ways trying to soften us up for governmental disclosure or do you think it's never going to happen as I\nYeah I I agree with you I don't think that kind of Steve pass it um disclosure with the big the my fellow Americans people at the world we are not alone I don't think that\nIn in here they are bringing them yeah\nUm and and we've discussed this before one of the big problems of course is is not saying that there extraterrestrial spot if it turns out that we've known about this or Seventy years they can be awful lot of questions\nTo answer about that no I I think what's more likely and I don't believe either this is a kind of softening up in a climate ... program but I Do think that through\nThrough the revelations about how you tip them through the the classification and release of the British Government UFO your files we are seeing government say effectively will lick here is\nAlligator or as much of it as we can release\nYou know without compromising certain classified information I'm ... and and the ultimate irony of all this might be ... genuinely governments don't really know what they're dealing with either and which takes me back to the mountain we\nQuote what if we all dealing with some things so above and beyond\nComprehension that it would be an allergist to explaining quantum mechanics to a chimpanzee\nYou never know you you never know when you look at Leonardo

travel\n[laughter] well I'm not sure about that but um I guess there are there are a handful of physicists working on that Ronald Merrill it comes to mind yeah\nBut I think there are some some others or you know I mean I had a job and the ministry defense where I was paid to sing the unsinkable so I I don't really things out\nDid you get involved in remote viewing or anything like that like you work with the ministry you did\nYes absolutely we had you can't run\nA UFO program without finding yourself the the focal point for anything\nWe saw that any in any one kind of comes to to government about and of course we had we had people who said that they will psychics and they wanted to volunteer their services to the intelligence community to help us well you know like Kay\nSoviet ballistic missile submarines are on mosques by some ... that sort of thing\nSo we looked at this as a classic low probability high impact scenario probably one what but if it does the payoff is so big wine on
