robots\nWell it's the bail blamed bookstores and also on Amazon and an online bookseller\nSuper super now we were talking about right before the break about the emotional robots robots that would show emotion anger frustration happiness love crying is that all going to be possible\nWell there there's a lot of research in two entity area of social and emotional robots and motivated geared in terms of\nYou know building robots or machines are outward them that can interact with people in different ways um we were just talking about the example of the robotic pet the the and\nAs I said in in Japan they're often used to heat elderly people company you know people that would otherwise be lonely and and basically they're machine to do that then you know there's something of a debate about that on on the one hand it may be a positive thing for a person that would otherwise be lonely to have a\nRobotic pet but many people see that it kind of appalling the idea that\nWe would take an elderly person and and dumped them into the hands of a machine because there are no actual human being that have you know the time or or\nOr interest in in in you know getting that come that person company I'm so that you know there there are issues there in terms of whether or not that's really the right thing to do\nA another good example of a social robots is in the area of ... which are becoming\nMore popular especially in China and these are just software that would interact with you through your phone it and people are basically having conversations with the robotic entities even developing relationship um and again you have that is that a healthy thing and\nYou know it may it may not be um but it's something that again is going to get better and better definitely\nThere's a lot of research into this a Facebook for example it's got an artificial intelligence lab where they're specifically looking at\nBuilding them that are capable of carrying on conversation so robots and artificial intelligence are going to get more and more social more and more capable of interacting with people are in terms of conversation and also in terms of emotion\nWell with a motion to I mean uh did not to get the\nUm very graphic here but I I mean people have looked at robots for companionship a in more ways than one reading between the lines here and as these robots get more and more sophisticated this is weird stuff Martin but people going to be doing this\n[noise] yeah I mean that you know they're definitely going to be people that you know have physical relationships with robots and so I mean I suppose that's already happened and definitely they're they're you know an industry that's going to emerge there no no doubt about it and again there's um\n[noise] a debate about that you know many people think that it objectify toward women for example to build robots that you know\nI mean I could see die taken a robotic woman out to dinner yeah he'll hotter down and [laughter] yeah so that\nThere are a lot of friends here that many people will find disturbing um\nIt's going to happen yeah and it's going to happen and you know we're totally not\nEven prepared for the debate that probably needs to have it about all of this and all the different ramifications up another kind of related area to robotics virtual reality where you're going to have\nYou seen emergency I did hear these devices like the Oculus Rift where people will\nBe able to do with them to enter a virtual environment that might in many ways the almost real um [noise] so a lot of these technologies are going to hit kind of in parallel over the next few years and you know right now they're really it they're ... they're just taking off and and we're going to see just dramatic progress and I\nThink it's going to raise a whole bunch of issues are open a real can of worms in terms of uh what all this means for individual also fourth I well\nI ... you know about virtual reality ... years ago when we just started talking about virtual reality and we we thought of those possibilities and concepts I mean I really can see the day where you go to some maybe even do it at home but you go to some virtual reality a store\nAnd maybe you want to put yourself in a setting in the jungle or maybe you want to be on Mars or you want to be in a war zone or whatever but you're literally going to be as if you're there and I I see that happening really soon\nYeah I mean that definitely that's what they're working on with with um the products that are now coming out I mean like you said this is something you know virtual reality\nAnd he has been around for a long time but\nWhat's really happening now both in terms of virtual reality and robotics and artificial intelligence is this stuff is really arriving now you know it's happening I mean it's really becoming practical we're really going to start to see it\nIn our everyday lives that's that's what's different and it's it's coming at it and nobody's really sure what what the implications of all of this is going to be\nAll right let's take some calls here with Martin for the summer is going to go by fast as we talk about robotics and again the subtitle of his book the name of the tunnel is rise of the robots but the subtitle\nTechnology and the threat of a jobless future think about that let's go to mark his truck driving in Kentucky one day Marcus they'll have robots driving trucks who knows right\nUm I was calling because I'm I have three young kids and I'm always have a problem with the school system because\nI Believe we're headed for the new economy and the fear of our future being jobless I can understand the lie to me\nWhy aren't the school was using the computer technology\nThey're trying to do double speak and say that our kids work with computers every day but those are basically virtual classrooms and not actually teaching our kids out of program or how to ... um use robotic or how to be engineers because they're really the only thing that might be left\nAs people who are good engineering and you know what I mean\nWell I agree go ahead Martin right I mean I think\nThe real challenge in terms of adapting to all of this I mean part of it you know realistically teachers that have been trained in traditional areas are not going to be equipped to teach robotics I mean you know schools are not going to be able to find enough people to teach all the kids\nUm these technologies and and you know broader than that it's also important to note that not everyone is going to be a computer programmer and this is not you know something that everyone is going to have that particular talent so [noise]\nUm well I think it's definitely important to do everything we can in terms of making our education system better so that you know kids can can have better prospects um we also need to think the bigger picture as a society how are we going to adapt to all of this as well\nWho is ahead country wide in terms of robotics China U.S India Pakistan who's the leader\nWell you know the United states is probably in general the leader because a lot a lot of this is not specifically robotic but it's artificial intelligence and I think that in that specific area we're certainly the leader I mean the companies like Google for example that are really on the leading edge of this uh\nBut there's tremendous competition I mean China is God by do for example a huge company that that very very into this there have there they've got an emerging robotics industry or Japan and Germany are also very very advanced in robotics so I mean you know\nThey're just going to be terrific competition between all kinds of countries to really be on the leading edge of this and that's one of the things that's going to make it happen and that's one of the reasons that it it's going to really begin to unfold and very rapid rate\nExplain the difference of a AI to robotics\nWell in general when we think of a robot we think of a mechanical thing something that can move the physical world you know machine or artificial intelligence is you know the ability of computers and software to to begin to approach the kind of thinking that human beings can to to solve problems and learn and\nUm you know basically to figure things out and and you know computers are beginning to do that in a very limited specialize sense but artificial intelligence is of course the thing that powers the robotic it's what gives the the robot its brain so he can\nYou know it has very broad based at application it may it may turn up in a robot you know in terms of a machine that can act actually manipulating its environment or in other cases it may be just running on a computer and doing you know intellectual type work you know solving information problems\nWho is the leader you know I'm always looking at the companies that will become the next apple who is the leader in terms of companies public or otherwise that you know is really ahead of the game in terms of robotics were were you'll get the robotic soldier and things like that\nWell there are a number of of companies especially one morning here a lot it's simply in terms of robotic soldiers is Boston Dynamics which is actually owned by Google um so I mean I Would say that in terms of this overall trend including both robotics and artificial intelligence\nHooking all these smaller chip together into massive networks and things like that in order to\nBuild entirely new architecture so uh this is something that's going to stop it she's going to keep getting more and more dramatic\nHave you seen that movie um ex ... is that the name of that movie\n[noise] right yeah yeah I've seen it um and you know there are lots and lots of science fiction movie that deal with many issues I I don't know any of them really get it right a lot of them are still far in the future in terms of what they portray but\nWe're beginning to see and the real world some of these issues come up and this is this is you know how it's going to play out eventually over the next twenty thirty forty years eventually going to the technologies like that I think\nI think so too what's ah get one more call in before the break a Westland or again Hey Tom go ahead walking to the show\nA church I Love your show thank you um if you took a smart phone

robotics there's less of a paradigm shift actually than what you're talking about previously with trans humanism\nA particularly with the melding of humans with robotic technology artificial intelligence for any combination of the two\nUm you know just imagine if the the ruling elite and America have the capability\nTo integrate robotics and and I just I'm a not only to increase their mental and physical capabilities off so their longevity in power\nA you know my big reader with Ray Kurzweil and I know that's something that he's talked about a lot in ... in his book but you know I'd love to hear your insight in the trends humanism and what you think the implications are for the future\n[noise] well I you know it's potentially something that could happen I I'm a bit of my car note of not not take on it I mean\nI think that some of the idea is put forth by people like Ray Kurzweil makes a lot of sense especially in terms of his analysis of how things are accelerating and getting faster and faster and and some of his other ideas are pretty far out there pretty far fetched\nI'm but again there are certainly here in Silicon valley where I Lived there are a lot of people who are very into that I'm really believe that that\nUm you know what the teacher was ultimately going to bring I Would say that\nWe're really in the ... the right now we're seeing some of that stuff now but not not a lot I mean it it's going to take a lot of progress before we really have um the kinds of things that Ray Kurzweil was talking about but I you know I Would never say never at\nThat

books including encounters what's line humanoid monsters of Texas and big bird in Erie is back on coast to coast been a while but can't it's good to have you with us so are you\nI'm George it's an honor to be on here with you tonight\nWhat are you going over the last couple of years are you still been doing a lot of research with these scripted seven to\n[noise] uh yeah a very blessed and a lot of a really cool an amazing opportunity to investigate the whole idea of mysterious creatures\nAnd most recently I I'm a co hosting a new series on the History Channel called missing Alaska yup and we're actually up there in the state of Alaska investigating these fabulous creatures among other things\nKind of reminds me a little bit of that movie the fourth ... what do you think\n[noise] yeah it's kind of the same premise of um you know what's really fascinating and I I didn't really notice George how many people actually do go missing in Alaska um her cabinet has\nA twice as many missing persons cases a second a closest state um for example is Nineteen eighty eight there have been I I think more than fifty three thousand missing person cases\nAnd in two thousand seven statewide clearing house lifted two thousand three hundred missing person cases just for that year\nSo it it varies but on average we have you know anywhere from five hundred to a few thousand cases of people in Alaska a which is pretty remarkable when you consider that the entire state only both a population of about six hundred thousand people that's about four and every thousand people that go missing without a trace\nThat ... that's huge in theories about this Ken what do you think what the what did they come up with\nWell of course you have to acknowledge the obvious which is a you know he's a free for voting places I learnt myself you know six hundred thousand square miles of a pretty intense wilderness area um\nYou know there's obviously dangerous animals and all kinds of people might die of hypothermia get lost in the wilderness and so forth so you know you certainly have to take that into consideration but what I didn't know is that Alaska does both a number of um\nJust fabulous legends a that relate to all manner of really strange and and somewhat menacing creatures some of those that we investigated in the field trip is ... and all of those are acknowledged in the different native legends up there you know you have different for different a major native groups the Athabaskan\nYou picks the you know it's and so forth and they all have legends of these kind of horrible creatures are so we investigated some of those and in addition to that um Alaska apparently also has a lot of UFO activity I'm sure you've probably heard that here on your show\nA lot of UFOs sightings up there as well and I guess that kinda ties to the to the the fourth kind a little bit\nUm you know so they're they're all kinds of a foreboding mysteries kind of a feeling of the the great state of Alaska\nDoes Alaska can have its own Bermuda Triangle\nIt does ah\nIt's known as the Alaska try and go\nAnd it's a large swath of land that ranges all the way from the very northern part of the state\nOr in a Barrow which is right up there in the Arctic Circle all the way down cutting through the city of Anchorage and all the way down to a Juno and it it it is an actual trying all um you can find some pretty cool diagrams of it on line and so forth and it is within this triangle area of the\nMost of these disappearances have occurred so very similar to the Bermuda Triangle in that respect\nPeople picked up any strange readings in this triangle any kind of more Texas anything like that\nWell that's you know one of the ... one of the first episodes we investigated the vortex theory um there are in addition to missing people cases are actually some cases of missing aircraft\nAnd we're not talking about just small flow planes here in Georgia and there's a there's a famous case from Nineteen fifty where a military they craft with forty four people on board went missing completely vanished last transmission was over the town of snack Yukon right after it passed over the border from Alaska\nAnd I'm despite an intensive search that included like three hundred military planes hundreds of personnel spam thirty nine days they to this day and we're talking you know sixty five years later they've still not found a trace of this\nIs pretty sizable aircraft and that's just one example are there are other cases on record that's\nBizarre yeah I'm In the early seventies and Nineteen Seventy two I Believe the speaker\nOf the house of representatives Hale Boggs was playing and he disappeared along with a state senator Nick baggage and and the pilot\nAnd the same thing they did an intensive search they use the you know the uh\nStyle spy with up with their version of the ... I guess that they had in the early seventies and uh\nUh you know they still never found any sign of that plane either so you know the theory comes up that perhaps\nUm if you buy into the theory that there are these for taxes and I'm a voter says I guess would be the the the proper for old for that um you know I even Sanderson or the great forty and researcher had this theory that there are actually a series of a dozen border says\nFor what he called ... says all over the world including to Bermuda Triangle and eleven others that actually are lined up in different lines of latitude and longitude and these particular areas window areas had increased numbers of disappearances of you know people aircraft ships and so forth [noise]\nUm so you know you certainly have to recognize the possibility\nYou know if you look at a hyper spatial hyper dimension no realities that there are these perhaps more taxes are windows portals whatever you want to call them and ah you know perhaps that is how these are people that are disappearing\nRaleigh now let's say alien craft duct people are and we'll get into that of course or taking craft\nThese more taxes that could be these energy forces that are like the Bermuda Triangle mhm how do you think if they exist Ken how did they how did they work how did they function\nWell um I think the best theory is that there they they have to do it has to do with electromagnetic geo magnetic uh anomalies\nUm you know of course the the earth itself is a giant magnet and you know that it's a a you have the magnetized polls you have the ah the molten core and it it essentially acts as as a giant magnet but you have a magnetic fields all over the planet and you know\nThe magnetic fields affect everything particularly life forces you know we have for example uh many animal species use these magnetic fields in order to navigate and travel thousands of miles\nUm we as humans have a a ... minute amount of magnetic uh matter within our bodies\nAre so you know magnetic energy really is kind of a life force of this planet any ways ah so the theory is that we explore in the in this particular episode is that you know you have these vortex areas that are somehow tied into these a magnetic\nAnomalies and that I occasionally these vortex is for whatever reason to will actually open up and that these massive amounts of magnetic energy will pass through and um you know essentially that you know the obviously you have to say of the you know they would call a\nQuitting into malfunction if you were flying a plane for example you could imagine your compass going haywire and other things like that that would possibly cause you to crash but you know a more um I think dubious\nAnd the ferry is a possibility is that these vortex is our wormholes\nTo other dimensions ah you know two other realities in our in our hyper dimensional universe and that this magnetic energy works is kind of a proportion system that sucks things out of this world and and [noise] [noise] to God Knows where\nAre you know that's that's true and so craft or planes or ... or even people that may stumble into this war ... or more tax they get sucked into it\nAnd now let's assume there is there some place else there are there in another dimension another another world I mean\nMy gosh could they be alive now just wandering around\nPretty scary stuff to consider a now admittedly Georgia I'm certainly I'm not a quantum physicist so um I learned quite a bit about this uh particular theory but uh you know Einstein did um you know prove that the the the string theory\nIs possible that the universe is somehow connected with these\nA string like objects not just standard matter but these these string like particles that essentially vibrate and resonate in connecting in ways that are far beyond dark are comprehension and understanding [noise]\nUm so theoretically we could be surrounded by other dimensions of reality that we are not able to

gearheart he's a television program is called missing in Alaska it's on the History Channel talking about these various things we're talking about right now specifically around the Alaska triangle and we've talked about to extraterrestrials or for tax\nNow we're talking about big put how have people can described big foot in Alaska\n\nGeorgia as an investigator one of the most compelling things to me is that descriptions of big foot or soft watch or you know yesterday over in Asia snowman\nThey're all very very similar very consistent that's very compelling to me as as a researcher but in Alaska specifically ah they describe a big foot or Harry man is scanning about seven or eight feet tall a very broad and mosquito or completely covered in here from head to foot I'm\nVery broad shoulders no neck\nI'm leaving footprints about Fifteen to sixteen inches long um so it kinda fits the archetype of the traditional saw squash your big foot a that is recorded in Washington state California and elsewhere but what's interesting too that we picked up on and I was\nFortunate to hook up with a lot is a pre eminent expert on big foot a man named Jay Robert alley and he's collected a number of sightings from the state of Alaska and actually told me that he has some descriptions that actually characterize these creatures is standing anywhere from twelve to Fifteen feet\nOh wow which is oh yeah so I was pretty blown away by that now you don't really hear about that here in the lower forty\nI think we would to ... you really you really would be frightening were you there's nothing you can do to stop something\nAnd again going back to Alaska because of the remoteness of solve these villages and communities in Alaska you know there's not a really good system of working roads there\nA lot of people that are living in coastal areas have to get around by boat ah you know a lot of people flying in small airplanes and so forth but uh theoretically if extraterrestrials were abducted humans uh it it would make sense that they would go to a place like Alaska where they could perhaps a operate a under oath veil of secrecy\nLet's talk about what are your books encounters with flying humanoid what the heck could they be\nWell flying humanizes name implies is a a a creature that combines the characteristics of a human with wings and and uh you know essentially flies\nAnd ... and his airborne um the most famous of these of course is ma man I'm the mosque man of West Virginia which is a kind of become an iconic creature um [noise]\nUh had the great honor and pleasure of being up at the uh the ... festival in point pleasant West Virginia earlier this year or last year I should say and uh you know ma man is this\nStrange creature that's been reported a by hundreds of eyewitnesses standing about six and a half feet tall a bat like wings sturdy man like legs and and the most shocking and chilling feature of them off manner these giant red\nHypnotic eyes everyone says that you know all the eyewitnesses claimed this creature has these giant red glowing eyes and certainly doesn't sound like anything of this earth\nUm but um my book encounters with flying humanoid I'm kind of chronicles the mosque man a history of it in addition to that I kind of took a global look at similar\nCreatures around the world and I found that uh there are in fact creatures like them off man that have been reporting from from every continent from different cultures all over the world and that these descriptions literally date back thousands of years if you look at the ancient\nA ... and the Syrians and some of these really old cultures they actually are how depictions and portrayals of these flying humanoid types of creatures in their artwork and so forth [noise]\nAh so as far as what they are uh you know I Would really be speculating George but ah I certainly don't think that they were [noise] ah I don't think that they evolved on this planet as natural living creatures I think there will probably dealing with something inner dimensional or or spectral in nature\nYou even have tossed gargoyles into this batch ...\nYes I did I did a chapter on gargoyles I wanted to\nUh [noise] I Want to read the book to encompass some of these other weird flying creatures like the Jersey devil of course which is very well known or a or urban American legend I'm I have collected accounts of\nSeemingly gargoyles creatures not humanoid in nature or on some people have described them as looking like a\nKind of like creatures I guess about like wings and and more animal lipstick type of characteristics as opposed to human\nAh some people have described them as looking like flying dogs or or Griffin's from Greek mythology I'm so that the descriptions very to some extent but there again we're not talking about a bird we're not talking about a giant bad here we're definitely talking about something that combines characteristics from different animals\nAre and you know wing creatures as well\n[noise] of all the creatures you investigated yet from Alaska to Texas to all the places you've been which is the one creature that's still battles shoot the most\n[noise] wow that's tough I mean they're they're the field trip is ... is actually\nPretty darn vast inch wide open isn't yeah people\nOften talk about Bigfoot and the the lock this monstrous over and I guess um I've done a lot of investigations into the cheaper Cabrera which ah courses vampire like creature that's been reported from Latin America and in fact last year I travel down to Mexico to the state of ...\nWhere there had been literally hundreds of goats killed by some unseen predator in one night a we're talking about an entire pan of goats about a hundred votes eviscerated in one night\nAnd the uh according to the livestock owners I didn't get to examine the bodies of fortune because it's happened back in two thousand ten\nBut according to the livestock owners of ranchers that I interviewed these these goats were essentially rendered bloodless uh they were completely ah X. sanguine aided of all their blood and the only tell tale find left behind virtue puncture wound in the neck\nOr so in essence you're talking about a modern day a vampire if you will and uh the descriptions of the troop of copper vary but in Mexico they describe it often is looking kind of like a reptilian type of creature a a similar to mop man and that has these glowing red eyes\nVery sharp teeth of course and and fangs and claws um but in some cases they also describe it as kind of being a wing creature as well almost like a giant vampire\nBat there is so much on this planet can that we just don't understand or half full knowledge of yet so much but with these creatures [noise] either everybody's line\nOr they're all telling the truth and that is what keeps me push sheen and driving a in investigating issue do because I think people are experiencing something I think they're seen something that they cannot explain there are things out there\n[noise] yeah and you know skeptics will often count her that I witnessed testimony for example is is not tangible physical evidence it's anecdotal evidence which is true in some respects\nBut when you look at the consistency of the descriptions from people that are seemingly unrelated\nUm you know it it becomes a very compelling when you have these kind of a consistent themes in motifs popping up from different eye witnesses that have encountered these things and I got to tell you George I've interviewed many people and I've I'm always very skeptical going in particularly up the story doesn't ring true right off the bat\nBut when you look in someone's eyes you can actually see the emotional impact he's experienced\nYou're absolutely right Ken stay with us we're going to come back with a fine law were to go with Ken Gary Hart and we're going to take phone calls as well about all

get to your calls in just a second as soon as you were taping and filming can the missing in Alaska series season one did you encounter any weird stuff any stories you want to talk about\nWell I'm actually the ah probably the most dramatic thing that happened is I fractured\nMy ankle ouch yeah\nAnd this was actually and within a location where we're investigating an evil spirit known as the ...\nKind of a a demonic spirit that said to haunt this particular area a particularly those who go prospecting for gold and so forth so we were in this little isolated area a near a creek in a waterfall and I I you know\nGeorge I got to tell you man I'm I you know I'm happy I'll happily take on big foot lockers sponsorship recovers none of that stuff really bothers me but when it's when you start dealing with ghosts and spirits and stuff\nThat ah it's pretty unnerving so uh it was kind of a kind of a weird ah how how I kind of happened it was a kind of a silly accident\nAnd it put the whole production on hiatus for three months but the fact that I fractured my ankle or when we were essentially in this protected kind of sacred area where we weren't supposed to be intruding a that was pretty\nUnnerving or how they get you out of there it was a it was quite an experience actually God\nThey had to build a they built they made a splint out of a drift would kind of keep my ankle in place they had to build a makeshift stretcher out of all of their jak gets in several\nGuys had to carry me down the side of a mountain a to a rescue boat so that was quite an ordeal and I feel very fortunate that I had the uh uh the guys there that were capable of doing that and getting out of their\nSurgeons will say orthopedic surgeons fracture is worse than a clean break have you healed\nYeah I've I've I appreciate it man I I feel a it was a pretty bad ah it was it was pretty badly separated so three months of a sense of being off my feet I had an excellent\nSurgeon in Alaska who are kind of put some hardware in there a couple of days after the incident and a half for about nine months away from that a particular incident now so I still have a lot of pain still very painful I have a painful reminder of my\nUh you're you're sure welcome to television guinea let's go west of the Rockies bill is and is it called Washington Welcome to the program bill good to have you with us\nThank you Mr ... pleasure and great gifts and a great show tonight that you are listening to you know almost every night you shit\nI'm Sorry about your father or just something to try and very quickly probably tell you that won't take more than ... but he got out of World War two are not injured in basic training pretty bad he had a medical discharge Connor honorable discharge medical conditions\nAt a nervous breakdown hospital for he was a hospital for about six months covering from the accent that he hadn't in boot camp\nUm so uh that was like forty fourth Nineteen forty eight forty nine I think it was the winner forty nine I was a baby that and I was a year old ... actually\nWe had a neighbor or an old man this is on the planes of western Nebraska farm country in the middle of nowhere and those times farmed for quite a ways apart and ah this old neighbor was a guy that used to write to town on a tractor there's\nStill some old fellows out there that do that they don't have a car and they just sit in the tractor seat and they cover themselves up with big blankets and I live in a town well there was this guy was one of those one of the neighbors and we had that big blizzard that hit the western us back and forty nine and it was huge\nAnyways my dad was outside watching his cows that point he was a a farmer as we're most all of his family time\nAnd bringing in taking care of the cattle that were inside the corral and Barnes and everything else that he could keep them in close to the house any thoughts on that distance on a large main water Dutch bank a main water supply ditch the supply a lot of the farms are in that area you solve figure\nA looked like his old member of the old sweet are out there in the distance covered up with the wind gets you couldn't see us had though\nAnalysts look like he's describing like I'm I'm I'm a Native American you would see with large blankets on them and to be walking but it was quite a ways away so it was a couple of three hundred yards away\nAny er God has been offers that was not so hard he couldn't really see any detail so I'm\nTold my mom about it and he says I think that's all men are the old man I won't name names you know my own son so you should go check on him and she sent us a blizzard out but you can't be going across the farm country out there to find him or take care of and just keep an eye on him\nNo telephones at that point in time call anybody so I watched him for just a moment after went back outside and still didn't see his head and it's like his back was to him and then he said his arms went out kind of like he was going to reach shuffle those\nYou know place it looked like a big bear rug that he had around them and uh he said it went out and was just a large we span and he said he couldn't swallow he couldn't believe what he was saying he still couldn't see it yet but he said it was like a large wingspan\nAnd then it took off just to barely above ground level like a bird\nIn was flying in the blizzard went away from it and leave him back in the house and he says you know I Can't tell anybody about what I just saw I Want to tell you but you know based on my history nobody in the family or believe what I'm just about to tell you\nThree told my mom that and he kept that inside him for probably a good a five to ten years before he told his next oldest brother wow look at him with a critical why it is and why didn't you say something a long time ago and they have to wrestle with us they should well no one wouldn't believe me\nAnd said what does it look like he said look like a giant black bird you know you're going to San Diego or or something with a very defined wingspan but I couldn't say I had on it it it flew away from me where it was perched on a bitch bank\nAnd ah the best he could describe but he sent a a you know one looking at ten to twenty feet of wing span and he said I thought it was going to go climbing up and now the two but it got just high enough\nAnd then it moved its wings and then I flew away in the opposite direction and he said he watched it in the ... for a few seconds and then ... of the day he died um passed away a ten years ago or so he uh\nHe's still never resolve that in his mind as he tried to figure it out and there was nobody back then that would listen to him anyway and they thought he was accused in the same things so that's the story long and short and he used to tell me and my younger sisters about that all the time\nAnd every time we would be outside as youngsters in ... in the farm area especially when we lived up there at that time\nEven watch the surrounding area constantly bothered him so he gave up farming that's one of those\nThat is the story that he walked away from a kind of fearful in a way a buddy said he was awestruck by what he saw any that's the best way you could describe it that's about all I can tell you about it\nI Love that story and hearing typical Thunderbird story\nYeah you know most people would be shocked by that story George but I'm not I've interviewed dozens and dozens of people many of them farmers through the years that I've seen almost something identical to that\nI don't we know they're not con doors\nWell I'm con doors are very ah they're adapted to a very specific environment charged they obviously they they need those high craggy pie they're very heavy birds\nAnd are they need a lot of elevation in order to become airborne and they've kind of adapted to that environment and if there's you know obviously when you're talking about chief species of Congress to California contours or a you know been endangered for a number of years now and they're very very closely monitored there is a very small population\n\nA\n\nPiece of news

menagerie of mysterious speech\nAnd it encompasses a whole variety of scripted that I've investigate it all over the world\nAnd it also include dozens of never before published firsthand accounts of everything ranging from big foot the thunderbirds to Black Panthers lake monsters giant spiders giant and\nHow big are the spiders skin\nOh this is a great story so I I was contacted by a fireman and EMS worker in Georgia who swore to me that he was out mowing his backyard and he saw a spy spider as big as a house cat he said it looked like a wolf spider but it was about as big as a house cat with about a twelve inch\nSpan ah and ah it\nBasically crawled up a tree in his backyard and he didn't know whether to\nUh to run away 'cause he was afraid that might jump on him or or to you know running grab a camera and he ultimately went for a camera but by the time he got back to thing was gone but uh this guy was pretty credible George I mean this is a guy or he saves people's lives for a living and he uh he swore to me up and down at this this really happened\nEverybody who's listening to us in bed right now there is a huge spider on your\nA deep kind of\nIntricate networks of caverns in caves and so forth so yeah I I think the potential is there a one one quick thing George you know uh people always want to ask me about the inter dimensional possibility which are hard to\nA big fight why is there no physical evidence of big for why have we found a body well you know I'm not necessarily a big proponent of that per se but uh you know it certainly is a strong question you know the the the fact that we don't have physical remains where are these things going where are they disappear into\nDoes it uh were you when you hear stories about people wanting to go out and shoot big foot\n[noise] um yes absolutely it does because you know I Believe that these are sent you an beams that\nThey are a hominid form a pre human form if you will um\nBut I have to admit it back in the day many years ago I when I first started in research I I was kind of\nA I I understood\nWhy people were attempting to issue one because a science really does demand physical hard physical evidence or nothing else will be accepted know photograph\nUh I Know I witnessed citing so I mean it really does you know that that's an archetype a whole type something that can be examined is what science so you know early on I kind of understood that promise but uh now that I've been doing it for years I I feel that these things are highly intelligent\nUh and I think honestly to shoot one would be you know tantamount to murder\nI think so to Paula in Kansas Hi Paula\nHi Hi George I have we can now that all my life here on now and I'll be looking spiders\n[laughter] ruined the night that the\nOnly thing I can hear the questions you ask you um [noise] I investigated anything like ... so in your lines at all what you think that's a\nYeah actually there have been a times are connections between um well I mentioned the cheaper copper earlier of course all of those cases involve a mutilation is a small farm animals\nUm but moreover or some of the Thunderbird sightings and accounts or for example here in Texas we have a Thunderbird known as the big bird there were a number of sightings back in the in the Nineteen Seventy six\nI write about this time of year and right before high things that this enormous bird like creature began to ... make newspapers there were a number of cattle relations that were taking place in that same exact area we're talking about the Rio Grande valley of taxes so\nI've I've never personally examined the remains of a mutilated animal\nAh but I have collected a anecdotal accounts of mutilated animal carcasses and in fact I've had people tell me that they

about a minute left shark so I Want you to wrap up your guinea but the fact that there's really never any hard evidence that can is baffling\nAnd that's why I always tell people that I'm not a hundred

like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's\nAlways been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know what I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last say seven eight years and focused on missing people but\nWhen you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like they were when you read the articles but when you read the title of it\nLike Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago when your first year can you be kept the project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight uh I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and to the guys I was working with that were super wealthy\nTo me and they sent me in this room and they tell the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big foot encounter in the mountains of the fear of\nAnd they found each other later in business\nYou know we're sort of set a coincidence they started talking about Bigfoot and they've found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter\nAnd they said you know if we have Twenty years of police officer ... years investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look well financed there you go about it at your own pace me know your your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out\nAnd initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approach them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot studied year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever\nBut we have Howard while or giant human bones found\nAnd that's that really makes you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit\nBecause the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining it must have been old Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\n\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on us and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation [noise]\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat does that maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter it's a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you really not going to find that you have to dig really deep and and find out what maybe some explores wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so\nBut again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where and explore from the Watergate church was coming across country on a horse\nAnd he wrote in his explore notes\nThat this thing came up to him while he's on his worst and looked him I die and actually spoke to one large hairy bypass said he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with ... church butter de saint church and it's in there\nSo to say that these things haven't happened ridiculous\nOr the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from\nSeptember Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wildlife mass landed in a field releasing a huge here are covered being that we're seeing briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive\nUm big what people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on a about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm a fell over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this\nAnd uh his book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on the speak for topic it\nWas a starter I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and it's a tremendous book and people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking\nWith Dave ... about his latest work big foot Wildman and giants

all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nThese look like human faces these are individual basis that he has drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are they looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\n\nNo I I think that's a general consensus\nA sort of matches what other tribes have stated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to see the find a group that says they're an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson ... film and it's you know if people can argue about all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but that that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up in this and the beings that are described in in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nSo when I did with ah the gambling film it and one thing Harvey has the ability yet is let's say somebody goes into a bank robbed the bank has a beard on has a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving\nHarvey has this innate ability to take the beard off the face she can see the face looks like so you can identify the suspect\nSo apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by Ted it's in tribal ... and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made in probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your ... accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentations at conferences they sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members of people from northern Ukraine of people from China\nAnd I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different humans look if they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows what what was what we understand about our own people\nYeah fewer ... came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ...\nYou know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from 'cause we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's campfire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were sure they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed up playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California uh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seeing them awake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be young kids\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him\nBut they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to\nChase them off a and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big foot that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but in the near term\nI've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on it for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and since the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened\nThe myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and some people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people did not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep them clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious\nIf it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who shot and why aren't the names there and if somebody is writing about it since it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at

I Want everyone to think about what was the percentage of people in the wilderness in Nineteen sixty seven that had the ability to take film\nOr anything while they were in the wilderness it was my new\nNow think about today nobody has ever come close to taking video or film of a ... foot in the wilderness for a minute to have like they got on a PG film yet today there's probably close to a hundred percent of everybody in the wilderness carrying a smartphone\nWhich has the ability to catch that so I Want everyone to understand that I Do believe the person film is real\nWhy haven't we caught despite that on film\nThat quality of a location and segment like they did in sixty seven\nThere was something phenomenal about that event that caused that female big foot to stay there because every other time they immediately run they won't look at the camera like this one did they won't hang around and lingering knowing that people are watching him something unusual happened\nWell again not to take everything back to the skin Walker day but it the the comparison is pretty clear is that ... there was a loose if there are cameras all over the place\nAnd if you uh had activity in one area and set a camera up it would move somewhere else and it goes back to sort of the question that one of the callers asked about drones say you had a drone that had heat seeking technology it attached to it\nUm the description from the tribes that you mentioned in your books suggest this thing has camouflage abilities that it can hook itself the change of shapes and he can hide\nCorrect that's again one of the reasons that makes us I'm tired different topic difficult research\nYeah I mean we see it when it wants to be seen I guess yeah trying to get one more call in Tom in Vancouver up there in big what country Hey Tom how're you doing\n\nIs Tom on the ... are lined yellow\nI think Tom has gone ah okay so we're about out of time to have a great work or the title being sixteen

Ninety seven points to have an image twelve Ninety am double duty chaos\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWelcome back Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history the two authors are Sarah black and acclaim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis he became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching the story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\n\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on this story at age Thirteen or most teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carry the bomb in stock and\nAdd to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library imagine that and you know\nThey're looking to what was available at the library I still couldn't find anything someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it though I\nKnow I thought out what I could I thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it and you fast forward graduated from college and no one told the story you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who is chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to me that the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean yeah I was\nA kid who was meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so they have a couple of years later after I spent time with them and visit them at their homes they asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and great misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was very ... project from either way I got involved when\nI had actually been praying I'm I pray that my work and I had didn't have an opportunity to work on an iconic ... story\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven additive get this email from this young man they're flat it well what they're saying that her journey with Indianapolis with that I'm going and going after the storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay\nAnd she actually did that she wrote a part of it too and major production company and they have the best thing we found\nRather that we only the area and\nSo you're kind of stuff and the same writer I don't know how to raise a family friend she reached out and and they contact with and I'm no number one that I made a veteran now that I had then\nPraying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise] and my only problem was is that all she was wanting was advice\nAnd I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] [laughter] so uh my joke\nIs is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or into letting helper but uh eventually over the course of several months we finally met\nAnd then uh we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we did as sick as the project pick a three and a half years\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the the story had been wrong that a lot of the people that were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I ... I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story\nAnd no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprints commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that he participated in from her deck\nOr that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise you know us acting president ever left the country on so there was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did\nA besides being sunk [noise]\nI'll tell you grab me ... my father was an open and he ... he drove a landing craft from those ships took us troops on the shores so of course you know the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to ah give us the version that you guys are uncovered\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flagship and I'm\nA small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of us can our where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent for on the faithful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theater I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five when general Leslie grows and the other leaders of Manhattan Project including President Truman\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nRight one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back and land on an apple story really man uh before I could actually not as it is you know circle back and then\nVery the atomic bomb aboard the Annapolis was an army Robert a major name Robert burning and spent the last couple of years of war running down all the material that they hear the Germans were you try to develop their own atomic bomb\nOn the continent of Europe one and then\nBurn and very little boy in island\nUm that final breathing yet or a year and conflict and so in writing the book we try to pull back that man can bring in a lot of other uh characters and world leaders and figure\nIncluding the Japanese point of additions to hash amount overhead and for the call and tell me if I'm\nManner and what we tried to do or where you have to recognize it even though men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and fiction and doing well\nI'll tell you what are we I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break into a will come back

... lieutenant commander ... as I was saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way I'm meaning that\nThey were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great ... um\nWell it was it and then more sort that he's had wished after the war who first published in Nineteen fifty two Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English and it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but\nWritten from men or ... point of view and there was a chapter on his devoted to Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War and and as the as World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality alive he was a commander who cared for his men\nHe was a commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around banging on doors asking for radar and more technology for his submarine because Japanese submarines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of his brother says commanders\nYeah tend to stories of just men and you know having their buddy right next to them taken you know and they they didn't know who the sharks were going to attack it was not a real rhyme or reason to it and so they were always in fear\nAnd one of those harrowing stories was where you know there were about Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers accounts because by the time that the rescue arrived\nThe men were really in ... they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks realized things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from\nThe water the shirts um the attacks increased\nAnd you know this is I Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported there were so sick they could walk on their backs you know from shark to shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould others stand on them there's one account you have the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking things drugs like oh there's mood I'll just reached grabs a boot right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young ... and by the name of John Ralston he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to lure of the sharks and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized\nOh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing all the worst things some of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here\nYou know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah the everyone knows it's almost\nThe end of the war they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippine see 'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but as Sarah mentioned there were only a sixteen rats between there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rats\nOr three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's\nRight so so there were so any water that was available was only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know the second day in and the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to\nLose their faculties lose their ability to reason that some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up the torn piece of his shirt\nOr while the other one poured the water through it into this into his now and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't and then others would you know take small for it is that the sea water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it that then\nEventually they would just begin hoping it like they were hoping it out of the mountain stream and what happened with this is a condition called hyper ... and\nBlood for\nBlood cell ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander um who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself something else has to be around you that or it without a site all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nHe couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it'd sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who winds up testifying at the court marshal later\nA un American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention uh we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a bart Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who wanted and you know that the general death in the cockpit within minutes late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see the you know kind of explosion coming from Milo and there is no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is true or something of that nature but yeah I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe you know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in the area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son\nWho you know this gentleman Richard ... to have passed away but his son carried on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and at the ... father and it didn't line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when were released about it that he would\nWe're talking about ... about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment

thing that is\nA ... it's a combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well he wasn't the brightest guy in the world and as a matter of fact had received a fitness report saying as match that he thought well\nIf I don't have to report arrival of that shit I guess that means I don't have to report on Iran will be there\nAnd then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus
