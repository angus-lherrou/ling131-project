Knoxville Hi Linda how are you\nHeard him that how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] you know I ... my I call fair to the company that he may be happy ... well I I've never seen that well that interested in it by hand what facts I make sure I fully understand hit my head after he had a question it is it appropriate I can see that well and you have any suggestions on how the fact that conversation\nOr it's more than appropriate as a matter of fact it's just flat out strange he made you the executor without first talking to you\nThat's like weird [laughter] yeah that's a very presumptive\nTo say the least show a let's re start the conversation ... ...\nAh I didn't sign up for this and I am willing to consider helping you in this way and I think you thought you were honoring me with this and I appreciate the honor I think uh but there's a couple of things that are going to go along with me agreeing to be your executor\nUm otherwise I Can't be your exact number one is I have to know what every detail of your situation is\nAnd that includes reading the will and understanding the wheel and going over it with your lawyer number two is all of those affected by the will have to be informed before your death what the will says\n'cause I'm not going to implement stuff that I get blamed for and everybody's pissed at me and it was you that did it\nYou follow me ... ...\nYeah 'cause you're going to have like your cousins or whoever it is that he's asking you to not give money to that thinks they're getting money they're not going to be mad at him he's dead they're going to be mad at you and all you are allowed to do by the law\nIs exactly what the wheel says\nAnd yet you're going to get all the relational blame\nAnd all the emotional blame and I'm not set myself up until that no way we're going to have a lot of reading of the deal with the parties that are involved they're all going to know what it says ... junior boys getting cut out because he's doing heroin we need to go and tell him while he's alive he gets no money\nWell I'm Still alive if he won't do that and he won't let you see everything in advance just say honey I understand you don't have to do that at your stuff but you need to take me off of the executor ship\nBecause those are my terms for serving as executive does that sound unreasonable you\nNot at all I I appreciate that's how I was feeling as well ...\nYeah that's exactly what I Would do and by the way if he won't take you off as soon as he dies you step before the judge and say I refuse it I'm not going to take it I told him while he's alive I'm not going to do it and I'm not going to do it after ... don't get guilt into it\nOkay thanks for the call open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five by white folks

enforcement and an automated Lee and first responders that's more a\nTo the goings on in the world it's increasingly obvious that were already under a new world order and it's being brought to you by the global industrial deep state which is a powerful ... made up of international government agencies in corporations and I don't know how you defined that divide that this worldwide fascism\nAnd it's something that uh I think we need to we need to be aware of as a country together agreed with the enemy is out there too and that we shouldn't be fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this order and wants to take over to go to Jackie in California Hi Jack you're on ground zero\n[noise] Oh hi Clyde yeah this is an interesting story but there's a couple of things that just didn't ring true to me about how you pronounce his name ...\nLike Amazon gift show gets ...\n... you know so\nYou had the Turks came out ... showed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the team coming in\n[noise] well if they knew that these guys were there to put a hit on somebody why didn't they stopped them so I think you have a the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen but what does it ring true to me is\nHave you ever heard of a of any nation states sending Fifteen people to do it hit I mean if you're\nIf you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill more people you have in the price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong\nSo the stories from the beginning didn't ring true but Trump is a between a rock and a hard spot now because you're coming up on the mid term elections\nAnd they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you can see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly and the price of gasoline would skyrocket would have an immediate effect on the economy\nAnd it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy and the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that something like this is a foot this hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was that like I said this is an example of worldwide deep state manipulation it is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump it's about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence\nWith this is this happening and and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go bust well it's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy ... look at\nAnother indicators the price of gold\nGold spin going up stock market's been going down oil is going to start going up I think to moral could be a very bad day in the stock market if if this thing some now\nStarts to escalate now how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when ... is a Saudi citizens\nAnd he was actually in a Saudi embassy which\nMakes him on Saudi territory\nWe have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states is of no consequence the president United States has really no authority to retaliate against Saudi Arabia but you know watch him get pressured to do something and you know it's interesting\nUpstate the number one prostate formula are introducing a new wonder pill super beta prostate piece three advanced\nWith three key ingredients

wanting to come forward and say that yes they killed him but I mean I I just don't this is one of those situations Peter where I Would just have to wait and see how it all plays out\n'cause right now it's ... my my my feelings are that this is the deep state up a gladiator type operation where they've got they've done this because it puts President Trump at a very bad position especially before the election\nAnd the fact that I said before and I said I think it's it on the all the junk show I said that I think our next step is to destroy the economy and secure a war footing and that's our next phase so I mean this could do it\nLooking at I think we have to look at turkey airborne the and the and the shaky footing or to wall is on with his\n... dropping like a raw right and and he got ties to the hardliners in Saudi Arabia yeah and and it's possible that this is a a a\nForm of a coup attempt was in Saudi Arabia that we build interest serve to ah serve to help a turkey get back in

anybody either had either and I wonder how\nI hadn't either until I found that they said if it has to be a group of people they believe are trying to undermine down\nWhich is ridiculous because no one

something interesting to see the writing me and telling me that\nWe're supposed to be independent now of oil we produce more oil than Saudi Arabia well the question I had been as it were that were that division why is gas so damn\nHigh right now I don't get it I mean we've we've seen it you know low before we've seen it in the you know down to you know to maybe even a two oh five two fifty a gallon but now we're pushing four dollars a gallon\nAnd uh I I really think though that would have an effect probably not as much of the fact is maybe you know\nTen dollars at the pump by me but I always get into this fear that some somebody would wake up see ten dollars a pop because it's something we've done or something that's happening\nYeah I don't know the the the the world down anything is possible anything that we speculate about the past is coming true it it's just weird how you know and and it can you imagine how much division would happen if we found ourselves in it\nA in a moment of scarcity what did I talk about weeks ago with what a hundred Kissinger was talking about scarcity we must bore scarcity in order to demonstrate what it would mean to\nRedistribute the wealth redistribute goods and services in and and make everything uh a happy global family see this is what they're pushing for an outside interest and outside interest that it's not\nAmerican Constitution republic not democracy it's something else they want and they they they need to make their dance and trauma they need traumatized enough to be ready because they're ... they're due date is twenty thirty\nThat's where they would say that due date is twenty thirty and then from there who knows but the the beginnings of what they want to establish and what they want to put forward a in that is a a conspiracy to destabilize the United\nStates of America to go to George in Kentucky Hi George you're on ground zero\nHey I how about your scenario a little bit I think you're right that each state but what about the situation with with Trump we've never seen a president for that does rallies way Trump has to ignite public on both\nDirections good and bad or we have and\nIt sure we have George George do these are like my life but you\nKnow you need to acknowledge the fact that there are other presidents have had the ability to do with Trump does\nAnd what he's doing now if we destabilize the country when these elections come up and I don't think this election is going to be\nMajor but I think the next one coming up is it well said would be stabilized with this deep state airing it bothers all Trump himself in a situation where he's going to say we're going to hold off on election and we'll just carrying the truth\nIll we stabilize country\nWar so this is what they thought Obama was going to do this where they thought George Bush was going to do they didn't do it so you think the Trump would be stupid enough to suspend election so the president\nYou know it's not stupid if you think about it well they get tired of way that most you got lost in American public\nI can hear Hitler Hitler Hitler I give you a Hitler chanted in the streets about happened\nYet but that's what we think about what the point is between the neo Nazis clans everything that's going on think about all the uproar what's going on and what this is setting up for an Emmy again if you look at it in a respect the law is not going on and it's not happening\nBut then you go okay well that can't happen but it is happening look at all the diversity or I mean like that's happening with every bite up or you got all these\nBut see that that the situation but if he does that again why would not me to tell you to do\nRight now will not be the time to make any rash decision about Saudi Arabia but he's gonna have to 'cause he's being pressure to do it\nAnd then they know that we may see with the gas pump we may see some problems with inflation and the economy we may or may see some stuff go down and this is why I say this is the deep state move it to the deep state movement a worldwide on the world wide scale\n... you're you're thinking it's all you know give him no I don't get any it again Larry it's against the United states it's against it and it set up a lot of different things and he's part of that set up\nI don't buy it I don't buy the trumps the part of it not because I like Trump I

November it'll be an incredibly busy month for space 'cause that'll be placing some thirty of these small cube set satellites about the size of a shoe box into space\nAnd one of them George that stands out in my mind is a little space craft cold the orbital reflect or get a little ... it's a small ... satellite which will then unfurl itself in space looking like about maybe the size of a

coast you know exactly where to go because there's many of these public viewing areas\nBut maybe this one will not be a spectacular because you need that near sunset launch\nBut George going back

the reason I bought the island these really freaky and bizarre first of all don't think that this is some kind of a multimillion\nDollar I Know it's a tiny kind of a a little island of north Barry which is very near ... and\nThe reason I bought it is a\nSemi reason but here it is way in England played Scotland and I'm Talking about football now soccer\nSoccer soccer here yeah\nYeah England were concerned although there are better than Scott and they were concerned that they might lose to Scotland so what they did these they called me up they put me in a helicopter and I flew around when Billy ... is a huge stadium it's a national stadium of of the ... [noise]\nAnd um I could hardly see the players when they the ... started the England played Scotland but I heard the match in my headphones and then suddenly I hear that Gary McAllister who was the the strike her you know the guy who strike who puts in goals most\nGets a penalty which means that Ninety percent there would score Scotland would score a goal and from the helicopter believe it or not I move the ball away from his foot\nOff the ball down ice cream in the helicopter one two three move and the bold moves away he's has been documented by the BBC filmed\nAnd if you get on my Web site go to those those Eighteen most fascinating moments in ... in British history or football you'll see the ball moving away [noise]\nSo you can imagine the next day I received thousands and thousands of hate letters and emails from Scott\nHe helps corps yeah they want and they wanted you on this one [laughter]\nYeah you know it's okay to inspire and motivate the team but tuned to fear and move it boiled away with the power of their mind isn't no no it's actually illegal\nSo I had to give back something to do the Scottish people so I decided to buy a Scottish islands which makes me kind of parts ...\nAll right have they have they welcomed with open arms again\nOh yes yes yes now listen\nThis this island it's called ... island\nAnd it's it's ... it's very mysterious in any magic it's it's um it's first first of all I don't even know how to start but it it's the island is a like a volcanic out quote in their first in forth which is north of Denver\nAnd um it is of of scientific interest this is why it was quite surprised and actually shocked that scope and sold me the island that I could buy the island because\nIt's a it mirrors not listened to this it mirrors the great pyramids of Scotland which mirror they lay out of the pyramids of Giza\nWhile Cairo and I'm fascinated by the connection between the pyramids in these islands you know that the connection has been known for centuries George you can read about teeth in them in a book pizza fifteenth century manuscript called the score to crawl on its by an ad but\nSo like you said if you think positive and

Mitch has also oh an award winning historian longtime friend the coast to coast am of courts and Mitch has a very popular Boyz sub audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nA today is the launch day of the miracle club which is\nPretty exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and ah it's a big bridge that I've crossed with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City and the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do\nOn your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group ah their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my informal motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members some of that club\n[laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little group outside of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting with finances and\nMedium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with their sense of just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not was a member of the original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan Doubleday ah we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written\nAnd I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experimented with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts are cause of death I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this\nAnd I wanted to write a book that we give people concrete hands on math and\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nAnd the subtitle of the book in which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're a very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long interval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a fought in the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives\nThey will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found that people who dabbled with the dark side tend to\nSome of the similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities\nThat responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that however we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in advance\nMentally and and often the shows up in ways that we don't suspect so my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives of other\n... before you came on and he's he was in Israel and of course great mental list and it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland and over the stadium they put him in a helicopter in ... he was supposed to influence\nThe ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved in and the guy missed it or something like\nThat [laughter] now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I've and when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor arrive and go into your bedroom and drop picture and so I haven't went in his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I have and was shocked and said that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know where you're Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program was talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class in the ... or or type pin\nAnd he lost and he couldn't find it and he was telling me about it in and out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping and it\nWas the tight class that that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the other part of it the the part that class ... into the the pointed at the end of it yeah was in ... ice cream [laughter] yellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing villa in there for that [laughter] just amazing but\nBack to these miracles and we take calls next hour I'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but\nBack to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but you know not be too but you know people dabble in the dark side the curse other people they put ... on other people\nIn in a lot of cases those things happen to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum\nAnd my contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect however one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind power tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project a negative spell or thought on to another person\nIs if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else if he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection against evil forces and I want people to listen to that\nCarefully because we are apt to overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook simple things if you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there is an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of scientists from cyclical research to quantify the arising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nAnd fought has to be something that extra that goes beyond the brand\nWoodward's human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't eat wreck if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that an extremely important point because people will sometimes try 'em out that it works real they try it again it doesn't work another project one of the things that I read about on the book\nIs that we live kind of cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws for the last minute counts as a law but so is the law of gravity which you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you weren't on the corner on Jupiter doesn't mean gravity in their gravity and an operative would have affected by math the minder same way circumstances\nAre going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're working\nWe experiment very clearly and very carefully\nRich we're gonna come back and talk

them again my monitor is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positive mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals and I don't mean on a computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it because once you do that you've\nActually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the things that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life\nAnd you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential\nLife goals take that list\nPut it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night think about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and over time they will come to you and they may come to you quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all don't\nTell anyone what you're doing remain silent but sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes are those say it's nonsense and they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it and when the results\nArrive express things that's a method we can all do\nAnd it's easy isn't it once you get into it\nIt is easy ... the the important thing is to do it with consistency\nIs to do it with silence and has to do it with total stark honesty arriving at a definite aim in life or a ... a small number of things that coalesce around one aim has enormous power an aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass were prism\nThey become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light natural laws are consistent your\nMind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing the idea that you have to really nail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's we're focused comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions\nThat I never could have expected I've done television narrating\nAnd and and and written many books and articles including in places that are not known for their cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times\nI never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these\nMethods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that I've wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know ... it's a dream come true and the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes the gestation period has also necessary\nIt is amazing work how people get this membership into the miracle\nGlide the miracle club I used to say that anybody can join the miracle ... he didn't have to\nSign your name up any where there was no magic decoder ring in anything and of course that is true everybody who's listening is automatically a member of the ... of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun if people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in America club and anybody who emails me and I'm super easy to find throw my name into Google it'll take you to my website and my email\nEmail me and I will send you your own membership card to be in the miracle club you can sign that you can fold it laminated Carey in your wallet just something fun to have with you\nTo sort of keep you on course throughout the day to keep your thoughts\nSteady and productive so I I thought it would be fun for people to have an official card a designating their membership and the miracle club so send me an email you get America club membership card\nWe're going to take calls next hour with Mitch or which of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising how many people have miracle stories it it is overwhelming\nYou know we have to understand that life is made up of of of joys and and sometimes great tragedies but in as much as we do experience catastrophes in life and let's face it that's part of life\nWe also experienced extraordinary absurdly unexpected moments of good news there are in fact times George\nAre we get what we're looking for and I would say that's more than just the turn of the roulette wheel our mind play a role in\nThat again a miracle is a departure from all expected

A. R. D. I. A. dot com\nDisadvantages news radio Ninety seven points to have an F. M. and twelve ... am Devon Eugene chaos [noise]\n[noise]\nThat might come back to the coast to coast George ... with you along with Mitch Horwitz Mitch told me about the power behind writing down the goal women going for it\nYou know it's interesting when we write down a goal in really demand that we pull something out of us that's authentic and that's kind of magic key to all of this material I Would say that absolute passionate intensity is the one the hidden he behind every health health program with it or something will work without it nothing happens\nNow one of my contention is\nThat we really need to have one absolutely definite chief aim in life and that could be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over a course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend in one direction and my challenge to the listener\nIs whether you can come up with one overarching goal that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim you have arrived at mental focus and mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\n[noise] interesting work Mitch or what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put those together or did you do this all on your own\nDo all on my own you know this is really my tribute to the thought of my own heroes and the mental healing tradition or things that they've thought about things that I have experimented with ideas that I came up with myself\nA you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who were drivers all of us who are experimenter as we are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our mind\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles through that I've heard about was a financial miracle I had a friend in New England who was recovering from a very\nSerious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left to his name and he was on the brink of losing his health insurance one night I challenged people like challenged people to make a marathon reading a book George that I Know you love very deeply the magic of believe\nYou know and love though yeah\nAnd my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happen to narrate he listened to it over and over and over for about five days on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss\nWho said to him you know he left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that you know you can carry thought it was a few dollars and cents\nIs old boss had to have you looked at it there's over fifty thousand\nDollars in ... yeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend it truly felt like a miracle that is a miracle it really is yeah it's exactly what he experienced and it was quite recent that when you least expect it you know yes\nYes that's why I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of Hackney to say never give up at these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what
