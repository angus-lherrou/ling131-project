I just think of asking for a lot and I have come back after I left that they will probably die\nAnd it all but I Would have to go I think that for four hundred and fifty thousand dollars mhm [noise] and at the table at a temperature down fat and now I can also find my own age for thirty thousand dollar pay that cash cash so that whole thing\nUm but I'm just wondering if it's something that it's just better to buy it rather than start out because I Know that's a start up but they feel like they don't want to get your opinion on it\n[noise] well um what I have found is the number one calls a small business failure is cash flow and cash flow is restricted by primarily to things that cause businesses to fail that don't take care of their tax bill and they get bombed on their taxes and they go into debt number two\nAnd so um you you increase your probability of failure ten ...\nIf you go into debt and do this and\nI have to tell ya I personally don't borrow money for anything and I have never in Thirty years of doing the show advised anyone to go into debt to buy a business ever and so I'm not going to do that because you have to pay this bill wasn't all those clients leave the next month or not\nAnd that could bankrupt you\nCan ... fairly easily actually\nDoes you basically don't have any money and so I don't know what the value of an insurance agency is they are valued you know you've got a a you know you've got a book of business the book of business has a value and it has a um a persistence rate limiting the number of people you lose two attrition or don't lose too attrition each year\nUm and that persistence rate and the size of the book business creates a certain amount of cash flow generally speaking the net profit after everyone including the owner that's operating ... a business have been paid the net profit the taxable income of the business\nTimes for or maybe times five is a small business equation on insurance industry might be different than that I don't know but what what is the net profit if you were running this thing after you pay you a salary\nCap for what I haven't got you know can you would make three hundred ten thousand dollars in the first year apparently a profit\nI don't have access to the book yeah profit\nAfter after the rent is paid the secretary is paid\nEvery body I paint at their payroll\nAfter ... after ... after insurance I don't know\nWell that's not a bad price on a business if you can pay it all back in two years in\nA\nWar that we can check it came out here\nWell if you if you're only paying six fifty four it was sixty five thousand down and you make three ten\nYou live on nothing you pay it all back not drink at your ten\nOh okay well then it takes three years yeah All right but uh uh that's that's about what I'm Talking about then it sounds like it sounds like about four times the net profit because that does not include having paid you\nAnd so there are about four factor that's a fairly normal appraisal Rachel they're not ripping you off on the price of a but I Would not go into to do it I Would start your own\nOkay and then when you go make a bunch of money in your own if you want to add to your own by buying out another practice you could save up the money and do that is if you are making two ten in through every three years you could save up and buy a business is worth six hundred right\nRight and so I mean that's pretty cool we can do that later and add to your book of business by buying out other agencies are buying out other stand alone but I I Can't recommend I personally wouldn't do it if I was twenty five years old and so I was forty five years older but I was fifty voters will I personally wouldn't do that\nUm I Would start my own and got it out I did that with this business we started on a card table my living room we've never borrowed a dime there's just under eight hundred of us working here and it's a two hundred million dollar business in seven buildings\nSo um but we started on a car type on my living room and all the bumps and bruises along the way I'm really glad I didn't have any debt Vicky is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Vicky how are you\nHot day and it's like if they clicking you to what's up\n[noise] okay I Am trying to not have a law with getting his credit report prepared and claimed that he is currently deployed in the military and Kuwait\nAnd um he had found a bad bet on and a collection agency has taken that\nWe're dealing with one town and we offer they sat on the line I sat on that amount with his head on my editor\nThey responded and agree to one count fat on my offer and they sent me back a form letter that just fed one time shot on the off I only have a great shadow which you put it back and now we had asked for some more stimulation like\nCan you can leave them behind a face your not going to fail there for ... party\nNo longer says ... also says settled in full and they're the owner of the day you're fine\nIf they were geared to pay it I I was just a little wary of accounting they faced guy they're kinda that they are not\nTerrible there are bottom feeders that's who you're dealing with her probably debt by ... what kind of debt is it ...\nIt was a medical back about Hillary about three or four years old\nYou know they paid a nickel to three cents on the dollar for it and their debt buyers and they are but there are bottom feeders you're dealing with that you're dealing with a guy to phone room that couldn't get a good job\nOf course that anything will be okay with with paint on that money and wealth\nThey don't have it yeah if you got it in writing and your staple a copy of the check or the cashier's check\nTo that and you keep it the rest of your life in Casey's Cooper's

going to get something signed out to people like that there\nThat you you are a wage it on a conveyor belt and you're just you know ... ... you're just going along getting stamped that's all it is and you're not going to get much more than you got\nThere wanting to some money you're willing to give them the amount of money you got it in writing it\nSays it settles it in full it just says no more dead as do after this has settled info that has that phrase on it I'm fine with it if it were me\nI Would I Would go forward and I think you're fine but make sure you keep up that paperwork because it

in those future ideas\nThey'd been around since the time of Jules Verne it's like I said the other night it was Jules Verne\nBid started most of this uh\nThese ideas of going to the moon banned in the

passed a law and from there we have all the rumors about what tested was involved with and then we have John Trump who got all of those artifacts from Tesla and was involved with X ray machines and a

is is that um what's really interesting\nI was doing some research on um I was doing some research on this and believe it or not and I couldn't get a hold of her today Tracy ... wrote about this too [laughter] and the funny thing about Tracy twenty minute that she was one of my producers at one time but I used to always love her writing\nAnd so I get I get the feeling sometimes we all figure that they're going to the same together we think of the same things together for some reason and that's a that's why I'm a ... that's why you know it's it's it's amazing that she was ready by ... all of us just been taking down that's what's really weird is it all of her material has been\nTaken down about this subject and what does that tell us don't know but I I haven't I haven't been able to get a hold of her and that's what's really scary but from what I understand all this stuff about the the the uh this program I'm Talking about 'cause I got my research just looking around uh the Internet finding the connections\nThat like the plot soldier thing is something that I also ah didn't realize until I I read about plus ultra beat being uh uh what was written on the pillars are at your browser it was Hercules had it inscribed on these pillars in Gibraltar basically would be\nA where the end of the world was in the new world was to be unknown I knew that it's so writing it altogether and figuring it out but then I wanted to see if anyone else do about plus ultra and sure enough Tracy ... had been writing about plus ultra\nBut then all of her stuff was removed from the Internet and people are saying what happened to the plus ultra stories on the Internet so\nWhen I when I hear stories like that I immediately think those that are being persecuted on social media and their

believe in coincidence as a you know and especially in this case when you have so much I'm\nA synchronous cities there that I mean that that just blows me away about the John Jay a Trump die from the\nOther thing is I was there was a Newsweek article about it on in twenty Seventeen that's were I mean I read about it a long time ago even before you know Trump was president I read about the John Gee the Trump connection to Nikola Tesla and somebody had said well why don't you do a show about you know Donald Trump\nBeing time traveler well I didn't want to just do that you know during the election because I was thinking to myself no so I held on to for a long time [noise] but then when I saw this plus ultra thing on this tomorrow and movies I saw the other night\nI saw that I talked about this movie a long time ago but I didn't make the connection to mar a Lago and then it came back to me oh my God there was an article about Donald Trump's relationship with John Trump and his uncle who had a relationship with the test\nBut in a way where he took his papers [noise] and then I was reminded the Baron from story I mean a lot of people who are barely read it read about on the

A. dot com\nIs news radio Ninety seven points ... twelve Ninety am Devon Eugene chaos\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your phone calls next ours we talk about the high technology artificial intelligence Byron Reese with us his book the fourth age if I were on the line mosques delete Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers\nOf artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine and your mind as a machine than it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time\nThat will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um I find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley\nUm my pod cast about a I I I find maybe one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nA that that may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine\nWould do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a you had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the ... and opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you\nHad a um you could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane for John you got the co pilot right there you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack look that\nYeah that may that may propagate through our systems may be much much more brittle much one that they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the growth in the ... and just really the incredible growth of this kind of technology\nYou mean is it the humane\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working a\nI even the term was coined in Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that was very interesting reason which was\nNew and you know three laws of planetary motion laws of magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did that being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took a nap for ten years\nThen there was a breakthrough more funding everybody\nNeither a winter they kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up the space of space up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it it can if if you out of business you can make probably any department in your business ten ten percent cost ten percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things he couldn't do before until we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some\nThings if there were no more advances and I ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense has a ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers lied to millions sending them into warfare in battle\nIt's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something\nWeighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary very rudimentary a A R if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said ah there's a camera\nAnd it can make sure it's somebody wearing a T ... or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it was up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder and\nYou know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to\nIf you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of people um there there is a quote debate about whether we're gonna make autonomy Skilling systems I think it's disingenuous the\nDebate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I'll let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nUm could could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot 'em and it now requires a person to\nApprove it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so uh it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions you can always disabled them so I think it's inevitable\nBut we're going to for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a weapon systems it's good to have it\nWell for various reasons you can argue that\nThe the better the more effective it their mission\nAnd there'll be less collateral damage wherever they are you argue that you will be said in large the soldiers ... uh what in in whatever country you are and and\nThe third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost going to war which is there's not not necessarily a good thing\nWhile it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like\nOh well it's just these weapons systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if there's no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean do you see the day though by run that now we're coming up to the top of the hour ... finishes up when we come back next hour but you know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial our cars with driverless cars you see the day that the you know all the entire\nOr call one eight five five nine for nine radio that's one eighty five five nine for nine seven two three four\nSean Hannity today and three on news radio Ninety seven ... seven Devin UT chaos [noise]\n\nWelcome back by Ron Reese with us survivor and do you think technology will ever replace pulse still people who deliver the mail to our houses\nYou know um I I have a I have a feeling that any job at a machine can do we really want machines to do it I mean 'cause if if the machine can do a job to make a human do that job there's a word for that that's called the\nHumanizing mhm because if if you just use the person\nFor stand in for a machine\nThen you're saying nothing about you that makes us human are we interested in we only need you to be a machine that that we invented a is delivering the mail or or delivering packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine that washes windows I can imagine young machine that automatically\nMost my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if you take a step back these technologies\nThis country for two hundred and fifty years as ... as high unemployment between five and ten percent\nAll the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ... percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years off of the jobs vanish and so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years right and we had rising wages and because so why are we able to do it it's we're\nAble to do it because a new piece of technology comes out of everybody sees as it and says I'm going to use this to increase my own productivity so whatever if you can self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city if you are I mean like\nIt it's hard it's hard to necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if it went back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's gonna be this ... billion people are going to use it what do you think that's going to do their jobs you could have seen all the jobs that were going to bed and she would say well that's going to be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you when you see at the Arabic and be ... a Google\nAmazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see a better job that's created and what happens is\nEverybody every time technology makes a great job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip it I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do a what a way to do you know\nYou still a drink you know the robot cat a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThat you have a special order and you want you want to send your foot back or something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone and an adult yeah so well correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that power these things for very long\nSo right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come uh people are going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of moving there are going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over figures out where to punch you're all out\nTo run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells\nMe you know say your number I'm happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm not like you said that you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer can ... it may be that that you have to experience the world\nOrder to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines are which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm you've got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer just make a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so\nThere are so many we we are so spectacularly\nAmazing uh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\nSo you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it to overcome scarcity because for law of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause\n'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and not actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor and the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize and we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened\nOr you invented the nation state and that's why five thousand years ago you kind of shut your clock by it all over the world a giant civilizations emerge ... America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that\nUm that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude if you if you actually can take human thought and put it in a machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we're the smartest thing on it\nImagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter [noise] I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast uh you're you're right\nIs already officially intelligent you it is to be\nFrightening if if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and said that was a bad thing did we\nNo not at all not at all and it has a displaced workers probably you\nCan't have a million workers are filling up bottles by hand\n[noise] right\nAnd yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it to Nineteen\nEighty color maybe forty in Nineteen Seventy you had a million women entered the workforce every year\nSo that's another thing that finally just walking remotely I was thinking about that movie late do say veto weather guy with\nThe stall was working on the beach and they had the boy helping them one of those papers ... ... you know if they're really a reason to be at an off if most of the time and truck to an office one when he could just get on the computer and do the work or on a beach [noise]\n[noise] wow that's that's great stuff I'd like to I'd like to talk to all three of those things I'm to the first one you know you mentioned corporations that he's been correct It's very interesting to me the large companies don't usually make you sleep the of the original doll companies are\nAre used to say only ones left and then it was just listed GE and so none of the companies around the Dow originally the big powerhouses or they're\nYou know sometimes of new technology comes along and they just don't adopt at blockbuster you know a streaming video came along and they were like yeah we'll we'll just wait and see and you mentioned them and I'm\nA Polaroid the same story which was digital photography\nAnd they didn't they didn't catch on it already right blockbuster has another one\nExactly with regard to drugs I agree with you we're we're going to have to work that out and you know where where in such early days but uh\nBut yeah there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like customs is going to have to be laws is going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't have because ah that's very real working remote\nYou know I I kind of hope so I don't know that I Would say a blanket thing for for every single person on the planet like because you can just ...\nCareers that you you can't like the electrician or a ballet dancer or you know anything that requires a psychiatrist or anything to require a a kindergarten teacher requires you to be president in any in any way but for people who are the information industry then yeah there was just\nThere was a series of commercials on I don't know if you remember it in the nineties that someday you will you know send a box from the beach someday you will and all of the things in those commercials kind of thing for\nThe army did stay with us by run your just come back and take some calls in a final chat next on coast to coast than\nThe ... website is now streamline for mobile devices Greek news if you're ... the one who enjoy our website on your moon visit goes to ... dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or\nThat is news radio Ninety seven points down at the end that twelve Ninety am telling you the chaos [laughter]\nThis audio is for your review for ...

just to better ourselves as human beings 'cause\nWorking alongside with technology\nI oh I Love that question you know you don't Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours and so you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did go up
