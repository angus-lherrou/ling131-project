{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "I'm so I'm calling because I have just started to look into the Dave Ramsey program and I've\nCreated my budget and I'm trying to get my fiance on board with it out he's somewhat on board but he's not all the way but my my question is is how do we work on baby step to pay off all of our debt while also trying to cash flow a wedding\nOkay cool so how much debt do you have personally\n[noise] um well our\nFinances are together now they're not together you're not married okay gets me I have about eleven thousand in credit card debt okay and that's it\nI Know how I have a five thousand dollar car ... and I have about forty four thousand seven hundred in student loan okay cool and what does he have he has only a car a ... eleven thousand four hundred okay\nAnd what is his income his income is about thirty eight thousand like what is your income about thirty three thousand out on winter you wanting to get married when's the wedding in September twenty ninth next year we'll crush you got twelve much good\nOkay so you are not going to be a hundred percent that free and pay cash for a wedding between the two of you with that income [noise] those deaths yeah math but I think he would like to do our best\nExactly oh I didn't want you to do poorly on your mind you're just just observing that mathematically we're not going to knock all of that out yet so given that that's the situation we need to have a modest wedding would you agree\nWith that yes okay so we do have help from his parents my parents oh good how much are they chipping in a while his\nParents are paying for that catering and the reception many which is a huge chunk of it\nYeah and then um now than us free and we're getting married at the Capitol Grounds for free good and then um we my parents paid for the draft and then they are paying off though for um the limited free alcohol that will be there\nOkay phenomenal good and so uh what do you guys need to put in to add to this\nI'm I'm hoping to stay around eight thousand for what for decoration I'm renting things like for the went in and stuff like that and flowers you think that's too much\nYeah I've done to really really nice weddings with two daughters are like really nice things and um I mean you've got the big dog in the wedding is the reception usually the typical wedding mhm it's at least fifty percent of your budget usually the dress and the you know the the camera and the venue is usually aren't hiring the preachers not usually that much\nSell our friend is actually doing it\nRight so so we've got you know we generally speaking really you've got the big things covered here [noise] um yeah you're probably a little rich just for ... linens a lot of people have really nice wedding the whole wedding for ten grand okay and the national average is less than thirty\nOkay for and that includes ... Princess Diana type weddings okay I mean you know yeah [laughter] right so um\nMy mom always says I have a champagne taste with a beer budget\nYeah well I kind of let me too that that's how I Want broke so [laughter] so if I'm you know it's not a big deal but I'm going to back that down in the spirit of we want to get out of that so I I'm going to just make up a number of you guys can adjust it your adults you and your ... you and your fiance talk about it okay we're both handy I liked him\nMaking one thing I'm going to say I'm going to say let them cover the stuff they're covering and you put in five K. duck and cover up OK okay you you could change it you could get for you could make it eight you can change it later okay but whatever we do I'm going to put that in the bank first\nOkay before you start your total money might go okay I'm going to go ahead and bank five grand between the two of you and I want you to do that and you know it\nSaid to save up for the wedding and then hey you know and I want you to do that in like too much okay perfect and then two months I Want it passed by Christmas yeah we can do that\nOkay and then we're going to start the debt snowball each individual late\nDo not run your money together until you're married\nI Know you said you were a bad idea it's bad for your budding uh engaged relationship it's really bad legally because if something God Forbid happens and I believe me I've been coaching folks for Thirty years and I see things happen that aren't nice okay and it's stuff like a car wreck or something weird okay\nAnd you just all kinds of stuff happens and if he has paid off a bunch of your debt and you're not married it's it's it's a problem and that's really what setting up here\nSo um the the other way you could do this since you've got a lot more than ... you could just attack your debt snowball and he could build up to five grand\nOkay I just don't want to make him pay for that oh well\nIn a sense he's not because of the day we get married at ... combined mhm and so he's not paying for we're paying for it okay if as long as it combines on September twenty ninth there's no you paid for it I paid for it okay this is our money at that point right yeah because here's the thing if if he\nUm pays off eleven thousand dollars he should be debt free\nYeah and you guys ought to have the wedding\nAnd then we got you to deal with when you get to come home from the Huntington okay the actual go have Sallie Mae moving in your spare bedroom right well we already do yeah I Know but I mean she's still going to be there when you get the honeymoon yes got to get rid of VIX you'll notice over the next year or two but we're hoping yeah the thing is just lay out a plan that both of you agree to\nOkay but please don't I don't want him paying your debt ... okay it gets weird okay I I absolutely I didn't see it like that\nYeah it's just possible downside is all there and the upshot is very little if you get to the point that he has extra money the weddings covered in huge debt free and he wants to pay on you that's just ... big pile of cash in on September the thirtieth write checks towards your dad okay\nBut then if something God Forbid happen that everything's still separated between now and then okay and I'm\nSo cool cool congratulations must send your wedding gift is called the book the total money

company quarterback and the company um but we never borrow money which means that some things we wanted to do we weren't able to do\nAnd you know what I did it protected us from going some stupid stuff cause some stuff we wanted to do that we didn't have the money do stupid stuff and if you do something stupid\nAnd you pay cash for it it doesn't hurt near as much as if you do something stupid

that come across the border illegally on the backbone of the un skilled workforce in the United states and every economic factor that you can imagine\nSo you're you're talking about a hotel and

O. two which is a greenhouse gas and that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... there is a North American\nOceans fall I bet well\nPlanet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um\nBut yes the waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain and then you could start spreading plants around now\nIf we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent deficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to breathe the all\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent deficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be terrified and within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do a thorough what country but the Martians\nAre they're going to do with themselves\nNo when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watch us through the ... are you assess and they bring us back a well most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people um I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia both facing a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy [noise]\nUm but Russia [noise] the the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise] and uh the the uh and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing [noise] um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they sign up

to calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\nWhat I say China right now I'm is about where the U.S was around\nNineteen sixty seven [noise] um I mean in terms of manned space flight a you know they've been to earth orbit I mean there are a bit\nBeyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they didn't launch a small space station which we did not have do\nThey have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon mhm um they can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay once again um\nThere's a new paradigm now and that these are ... space companies which have shown that can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can to you in one there at the time at one tenth the cost\nAnd if uh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with understanding that they're going to need to have rule of law there that they cannot have a government it's simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so once Russia to remain a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity a if you're going to be a first class power a trade\nYou have to be first class in space um Russia's going to have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a reason is still coming in a certain I mean the reason why the\nUm the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was in the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that a ... for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they tried to launch a weapon or something like that\nWell I'm I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us we hire them to do that\nWell yeah well the ... states that one weapons okay I mean because what after all is a state but\nIt is a military force that exists well ah the presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just be the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise]\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um and also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it\nWill get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiffs walk to go and um\nYou know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody doesn't\nWhat about propulsion we're we're going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now that there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets [noise]\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds\nOr they launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not feel if you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows or\nThe you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah you know knocking on mosque office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion too are but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because\nYou know there's always something new and then in terms of space\nTravel [noise] um [noise] well um we could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm\nFinished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so it sounds like what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen\nTo your show like\nAnyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show the ... and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering I'm going to get there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade like America do like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a okay All right ah well here's the thing um\n[noise]\nThere there is an intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say ah for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because uh\nWhat we get to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and\nYou can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we happier now now I actually believe\nThat while we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not undo the settlement of America but\nOn Mars there are new Indians there are no\nBuys in herds there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks or nobody be picketing Columbus Day parade today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen you know how far out into the future ten years going to Mars can we get to that fast\n[noise] yeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point uh I think though that if we have laws that allow people\nTo state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail\nOr that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions are being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because of mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value\nAnd uh and and and the exchange for those claims to people could get a exploration missions finance\nMine asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable

Braun and some of those incredible mine's\nWell they had some pretty good wants to uh they had ... a who was a great rocket engineer\nSo is German technology that help the Soviets to\nWell they they captured some of the two so but uh as did we but I I got to tell you well I mean you know I mean there's no question that von Braun and his team were top notch and and we actually got\nReal rocket engineers Soviets captured a lot of the two rockets but\nThey they mostly caught the second tier kind of people we we got\nWe got the cream of the crop as they say\nYeah we did um but um you know by the sixties we had developed our own rocket engineers although the German team continued to play a role through about the early seventies um I met a few of them\nWhat's amazing to his people who are born in the eighties for example Robert or even the nineties\nNever had a chance to experience what a lot of us went through a lot of people who are listening to the program right now during those incredible time periods I mean the moon landing spot neck all that stuff was just so historical ah we really live and we have lived through some incredible time several we\nYes but I'd I'd like to see America once again to become a country whose Creigh Deeds are to be found in newspapers and not in museums\nJust a you know and so you know like the Apollo Thirteen movie or just now the moody last man for not last man first fan\nFirst myth here while they may be the last of them now wouldn't\nCare here well I think it's a pretty good movie by the way I just saw it um\nWhat'd you think about the lack of the American flag being in that movie\nWell no they do show the American flag on more on the moon they just don't show them planting it ah I'm OK okay the\nThis movie some people found it a bit slow 'cause it was a lot in there about you know Neil Armstrong relationship with his kids and his wife and so forth but I thought it was pretty strong especially you know the scenes with the exit teen and the Gemini in Chino flight\nAnd uh the actual moon landing itself I thought were absolutely riveting and they really gave you a sense of of the risks that were taken the courage that was needed and just the and the spectacular nature of of of this thing and this this this\nAnd the daring of America at that time and um but anyway I mean that's that's that's who we are that's who we have to be we can't be these people who you know\nSay well we don't know how to go to the moon I'm you know I mean that'd be like them in the sixties saying we don't know how to fly airplanes so\nLet's go to David the Salem ... said David go ahead sir\nI didn't mean to you both and thanks for taking my call George sure thing\nUm okay so um it's interesting to me how what you what you're talking about a few minutes ago it was really played into my question we you know we've talked about you know how life could be sustained and things on Mars and already my life but do we have any plans are there any theories on\nPossibly can be leading an atmosphere stimulating of life's just learning environment um drilling holes that were trapped gases or you can be the atmosphere with everything we have or is there any serious her plans\nFor that what\nWe discuss that earlier in the show but yes terra forming Mars the idea would be if you warm the planet with greenhouse gases she could form a lot of the costs a lot of atmosphere to out gas out of the soil\nI've got a book called the case for Mars which um you can get on Amazon and it talks about how we can send people to Mars how we can settle Mars and how we can terra forming Mars that transform it in the way that you're a suggesting because marshals wants a warming planet which means by the way it had a thick atmosphere\nAnd um it could be made so again\nAnd you believe we must go to Mars don't you\n[noise] well I\nMust I I I Believe we should uh I Believe that it's going to be much better future if we do I believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting over this one because there's an infinite number of world out there for us if we work together\nThe port Arnie in Roseville, California go ahead Arnie\nYeah Hi I'm ... and ah I just have a question on your thought it'd be leaning towards privatization but are you in Anchorage privatization on the colonization of the ... of the Mars\nOr the planet I mean are you looking at just about to be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can or are you are you ... the government should be more involved in\nThe dating how a possession of real poverty as it was would be nice if we ever got a point where travel was easy [noise]\nAll right go ahead and rubber minute left her\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of ... so we could see which kind of government works the best\nBecause that's how we make progress on earth you know America was a noble experiment we proved the value of democracy and human rights and\nPeople all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copied us because it was better\nWell if if it if you have people go to Mars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government to the Russian government or the Chinese government that they formed their own governments\nThey'll go there with their own ideas of how government should be in some will be good ideas and some would be bad ideas and the ones with bad ideas that are not workable those counties will fail but the ones with good ideas\nImmigrants will flock there those places will grow and they'll become an example to the rest of humanity\nRobert thank you again my front always great talking to you Robert ...

K.\n\nWelcome back to ... ... with you and our desk Brenda ... with us Brandon is a clinical therapist\nAuthor purists psychologist residing in the north eastern section of while\nHe has a graduate degree in clinical counseling from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on EMS environmental sensitivity and grossly donors\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his more gold the dos studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this will come to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy guy shot in a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a goes in Paris psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so it it actually\nI actually got a day job and then I studied a pair of psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way it's not very well\nThat's good well let's see they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when apple was at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies for what he was an overview of what you've been doing brand\n[noise] well um you know I uh I have a degree in psychology or when I was at the University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically ... the environmental sensitivity and goats counters um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the clinical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kinda got me going and and I'm interested in and writing a book and that's when I came out with it goes studies\nAnd you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's it's um it's no mystery that scientists sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes my encounters a oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as elusive nation interpretations are\nOveractive imagination which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experiences\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just ghost stories tales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective\nAnd insights and the cause of these throwing encounters um it's the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know and you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years and if and I think we're at the point where there's becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several first hand account of ghostly encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting first hand account of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes all the conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's what I came up with some of these maybe theories\nAre and that's where I came out with a book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nTook elements from psychological research clinical interviews I witnessed the cows and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories of thoughts and I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghostly encounters with a book well\nThen you bring a dose of real science to the picture you know I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you just\nGot to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology of fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm entanglement and non locality and how electricity affects us and um and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just\nYou know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but\nI'm a lot of great research is out there are just a matter of finding it\nWould it be concluded today Brandon about what the ... experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think a majority of that goes they encountered that that are out there I Believe are there are some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to counter it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever\nBut I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them what do they help\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take the more by ... view on goes so that's a inside is basically um ... the extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of goes lane counters that happen out there\nUm the base of it has to do with um telepathy\nOr I'm sort of 'em are coming in or being sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment that other people on my main theories in the book go over um what I call a uh tell a path that distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's collapse of the uh is a real it was a real important part of it goes way and count\nHow important then is the person as opposed to the vet to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghosts encounters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death or life threatening events or some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters\nOr so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of there's a lot of things that happen after that\nAnd one of those things is um you know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress\nI'm a life threatening or going to have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these bio energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens\nI think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to send\nA distress signal to somebody else and and the great classic example of this is that the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these this is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an operation of my aunt and she says\nYou know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying\nYou know my aunt passed away right on\nTime that I had that and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying\nAnd somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distressing though things are to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm\nChip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is I'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population so if you think about this\nAs humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways but the physical environment affects certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nGet Daily Show up dates right to your inbox for free with the coast

back to coast to coast random ... with us we'll get your calls as well as we talk about his work the scientific work the ghost studies what are your colleagues say about your work branded if anything\n[noise] um [noise] you know most people actually when they find out that you wrote a book about goes are interested in what the than most people will tell me a story\n[laughter] and they've all got one don't they do and I was really shocked you know you gotta sit back and\nGot away when you put yourself out there publicly but it's really been positive you know there's\nThere's still some colleagues you'll come up to go you know I don't tell me a story but then they follow it up with you can't do any water or anything like that\nBut there was a pretty positive it's something that's really fascinating and it I mean it's a mystery and intriguing for human you know the dawn of time you know that's true\nSo you know it's not that out of context\nAnd listen I mean parents psychology is a subset of psychology it's a legitimate discipline just like social psychology and neuro psychology it's an academic field you know the University of Edinburgh where I studied as a top twenty five university\nThey're the ones that clone sheep and the nineties Charles Darwin went there and they have a whole department dedicated to studying pair of psychology or paranormal phenomenon which is for those of us in the field it's you know that's a great thing it's taken seriously for a lotta people\nWhat's out there that has baffled ... you don't have the answer you wish you\nA while I'll be honest with you I think or any type of um\nHold your guys activity or recurrent spontaneous psycho ... says we're objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on in those types of cases\nYou know the do humans have the ability to move objects if they're um in distress um you know to me it's hard to fathom you have the ability of like when the poultry guys I'm\nA you know we'll call it a ghost moving objects when they can physically touch them and things like that I really don't know the answers to that um so you know it's it's something I always read about and I go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nMore new rules seem to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMission to give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours\nI could not fall asleep and I could not understand why\nI was very anxious and felt as if something was not right\nWithout warning a soft glowing light appeared next to my bed the light gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband he did not say anything and appear to be just staring at me\nWhat was bizarre was that I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious the next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child stating my accent died the night before unexpectedly\nHis death occurred around the same time I saw the image in my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time so\nThis is a case of a crisis operation that we talked about\nEarlier so we've all heard of these but it it illustrates the role of pull up at the or a sigh phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing a tense emotional shifts related to the process of dying in a in a way sent a\nHell of Patrick distress message to his ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witness I'm the typical soft glow in the white operation or those types of things um and what's really fascinating is since his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or telepathy or ... phenomenon\nMy suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of\nA in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment like a message ... if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the wife may know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well\nBut this is a great example of a crisis aberration sigh phenomenon but also bags that question you know was this did this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment 'cause obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do well\nOh yeah yeah I\nIt's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal and I'm a ghostly encounters electricity and it seems to be you know was the most prevalent things\nBut the the idea is I mean listen we're we all think the electricity comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but you know electricity electrical fields comes\nFrom humans as well an animals' she does so you know any involvement of\nHumans also includes the involvement of electricity because like just that he is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nFrom people who walked by street lights and the lights go wild as they get on a on a range the lights go back on it\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone is walking around in a way\nSo it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only constant in all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being president to sort of experience that operation a poetry guy so an eerie feeling a temperature change an uneasiness or whatever\nSo for humans always present electricity electrical fields magnetic fields are always present as well\nSince since the first go counter ever\nUm you know ... and that's an important thing to think about you know we're always immersed in electromagnetic fields we can avoid them you know as as part of earth that's what it is\nYou know and the Mets have always been linked you know there's some research saying that you know abnormal or fluctuating maps can actually cause a ghostly encounters um you know sort of trick the brain into thinking you're having a ghostly encounter on the other side of that\nThere was this idea that you know electromagnetic fields have to do with with ghosts and ghostly encounters and you know every TV show and paranormal investigator team uses a EMS meter and that's an important part of the for them indicating that a ghost is president\nYou know for the EMS as moving haphazardly through the house like a person walking the belief is obviously that that's it goes\nUh whereas if you have a fluctuating EMS next to a dishwasher or you can probably say well that's a dishwasher\n[laughter] um so you know energy electricity electromagnetic fields\nVery ... very entangled with ghostly encounters even when I hear these real life goes to encounter some people will say you know\nUh I just felt like you know my hair was standing up or I felt the room felt Energizer like there was it felt like a of electricity in the air or you know I reached towards the operation in my hand felt like it was shot you know those types of things are always comment as well\nGo to Jason in St Louis Missouri to get things started hey Jay\nMorning George yeah Brian question or do you believe that you're [laughter] hide you in walls and listen and watch what we're seeing in and do we\nDo they hide in war you\nKnow I I don't think so you you know and then and this is obviously just my opinion um there's no way to definitely prove this but but I don't see it goes that sort of I'm\nHanging around all day watching us you know like a TV um I I see the the ghostly encounters and paranormal experiences happening at certain times and certain events for certain reasons like the the\nHalloween thing we talked about before there is some sort of need for that interaction\nAnd and sometimes when people have interaction where there isn't a need it's more people sort of like we talked about linking up to the environment and having an experience of some ... you know there's that intelligent haunting that's sort of like the cream of the crop you know those types of things are harder to explain in and sometimes that falls into an earth balance spirit\nBut I don't necessarily think they hang around in the walls and kind of watch us and way um you know just like\nWhen we walk into a hunting building it's not like a zoo where we have to you know call out for the goes to come out and you know try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them you know it's it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that\nThere's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environments resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling ghost come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nWe got pizza in Rochester New York Yankees\nPolitical building that dream home\nNow perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find
