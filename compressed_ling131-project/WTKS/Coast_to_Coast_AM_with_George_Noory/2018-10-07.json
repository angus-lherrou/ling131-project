all for it\nBut then on the other hand we all of those people out there remote viewing maybe even influencing\nThey're going to be a lot of mistakes made\nA lot of mistakes will be paid and couldn't there'll be assertive virtual anarchy that would develop\nThat's my fear I Do believe very strongly in the show direct effect and I know that the more people who learned to remote view correctly the easier it is to learn to remote you correctly\nThe more who learn to remote view incorrectly the easier it will be to learn incorrect excuse me incorrectly ...\nAnd ah this is my big fear with so many

thinking folk or point of view\nAnd so one so partly the answer question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that ... been looking at goes again\nAll right you know they're like we're going to we're going to go to the beach and like that's really cool I hear the monster there so I'm Wondering over

there anyway and so I turned into investigation when I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean it just is what it is you just can't help but it's it's in your mind and that's what you do you you would if you were at that beach hanging out there with them you would just be you're just dying\nUm and there would be a proxy and often times of the process he uh was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was often times there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would be with a white a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection\nAnd so all these sorts of another one example is a bobbing for Apple you know if you're not new apple bobbing and there was there was a particular holiday tradition\nThat if you cut a pie if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAny talk to her shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and pass me credit coming together\nOn my way man I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] actually I Do I Do it at midnight\nRight on that willfully night that's right will swing in [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own

as fun I see it as I\nI mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think a fall whether I think of orange and black collars yeah I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins\nAnd and the response funds things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they kicked the fun out of it and the traditions out of that and\nAnd uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break

M. and twelve Ninety am double duty chaos\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on ... talking with Ben Radford then so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and gets the panic in gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that time the Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know it it they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\n... and ... when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you Zach\nZach we I was just such an offensive I was like the first of all ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I wanted for but I wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray your candy I mean really do you do people really go to\nThe emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist off and actually the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't yeah I don't need to wander\nWhether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think it's dubious you don't need to make just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nYeah my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy makers that came when he did it yes so that he can steal stuff that he want to\nPoint where the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people are ... for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restricts with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second waves of ... of the ah the immigrants to the United states\n... and in fact the you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials they have they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... hand so that for for so certainly for for for many years um of course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff\nUm you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy the\nRight you'd actually yeah family is coming together\nTo make a kids' costumes [noise] um and what you find is that the first the first record that I found of Halloween masks\nAre really emerging about the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm a they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid in your past the molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it it's ... it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who are you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know [noise] the the sexy police officer or a drag\nYeah and of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you know and they're all you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know ... that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for\nHomemade caution that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we now basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much and you really continue to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell a an estimate your question you know I think that um you know ... ...\n... mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we we each\nInteract with each you know ... a couple of generations changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known as el night I mean there's there's like ... and stuff it's like\nScary scary stuff going on [noise] um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that that there's a certain innocence about it\nThat I think it really peeling again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum ... who knows like a dress up like a dress up right I mean eight year old kids left eighty year old kid like dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still gonna be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years\nOr ... you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual go you know where you\nGot like holographic oh you've got to that because he had that he was this giant thing that'd be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door and that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we are going to are asking about this the panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm ... and this is really ... tonight\nNever missed a detail on a show or a guest sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com\n[noise]\nA lifetime job begins I'm rich Dennison Fox News the Senate on Saturday confirming bread Kevin onto a seat on the Supreme Court followed by and swearing in Republicans and Democrats still reeling from a long process ...\n[noise] got a great story for the war in the house\nDavid your guy that has overcome a severe issue\nA light bulb went on and I started to research is why I was going through capsules it made me feel so much I can tell you one thing\nThe product war and not only works in one way it works for a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy measures me ...\nOr how to better way carnivores filter everything back into my body in a while but you know what us better and I agree with him and all\nThis is Richard off thrown off a carnival or research international call one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five\nOr there's a carnival or a dot com C.

W T chaos\n[noise]\nCounty will appear on coast to coast am our gas tonight on Willis wean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great things great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes tiny stuff so\nLet's I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it it works with the will of saline theme of ghost hunting so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you\nTo say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the witches and the you know and the Frankenstein and the Dracula kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like 'em but then there's this deep darkness\nPanic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one of those things where I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted houses you know reach out and grabs her grow somebody or whatever I mean it's there's always some of that but\nBut you know that's you know for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not ... there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause damage because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything resembling the Christian devil at all I mean they\n... if if he drinks are when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the paid hear what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nAnd and again you know it was the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there is that there's tradition of course I mean you look at Texas is twenty two Eighteen\nYou know thou shalt not suffer which to live on and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this was fine uh and this is of course not just Halloween that's that's one of the more\nUh obviously comes up every every year so it's coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there doing investigation and looking to go in and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is that ah when did you boards are strictly prohibited anyone using a word you board will be kicked off the property and it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so\nSo concerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know the ... or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rules you know sign this don't use it and so you know typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat's when because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was ... motion that a kid the dresses up as a which are of goal will become interested in\nWitchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the ... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party\nSo the the the the they make a case to distinguish it from Halloween this is not always as a harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that do have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you know darker scaring\nExcel interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in that like I said again you know black lights and uh\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and\nIt got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was a wacky haunted house\nThere was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy\nWhen it came to Christmas just lay lies write that down there a\nMarathon bars mine either right away I Am doing those\nHuge freeze those have you ever had um frozen\n... they were great oh I'm sure you're just taking you back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop to because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ... around the back oh man I Googled after we're done here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was lost USC McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching\nThe fight there you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup never on all the producers were were watching that sell our hey you guys are going on the air now still well knowing all the origins\nOf Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future in the same kinda part and all that good stuff\nNow another element is is some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff\nAnd now what they do is they go into cemeteries are they going to the woods or they go into you know the um um houses down the street that nobody ... the abandoned homes or\nAnd crazy cheesy thing reality\nYou know in in scare quotes um and I and I've I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a soft I've done you know on both sides of the camera on this and you know and my my point of view is always\nYou know I I don't make fun of ghost hundred 'cause I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do it and do it right you know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem that I often see\nIs that go centers on TV you and and not actually just across the board is is are you surprised even you know amateur groups across the country if they typically engage what's called the anomaly hunting\nThat is they're they're looking for they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know ... or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops whatever it is and they're they're they're they're sampling the environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around a little ... things and then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and\nThey try and look for anything we're all look at this at at three oh eight PM I Am you know we saw this thing and the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate\nThe original claims they're the ... the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are you need to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the infrared cameras on we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that that in almost all cases they don't\nThey don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample location so for example you'll see a ghost hundred go into location maybe there's team of them and they'll they'll take readings for three hours or sick or wherever else they'll go home and analyze them\nThe problem is that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal rap normally need to know what's normal and you whatever readings you get\nYour walking around with the M. F. detector magnetometer whatever it is with readings you get over that six hours that there could be normal variation that that you want to do this you know only happens once a week or something\nIt's his Benjamin rhetoric that we're talking we're learning about how he's describing investigating his theory side and we've got more of that coming up with because than celebrating Willis\nNews radio that he's going to have an image will ... am when you see\nThe biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to the scene you'll use radio you\nMiss the iconic\n\nKnow he's he's a man is news radio will not\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] you\nKnow we\n[noise] man\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nIs coast to coast am now here's your guest host ... cranberries\nAnd zombies on the coast to coast am county well let's hear on the wheel is because we knew oh\nMan I don't like hearing that when it's dark blue\n... candle or something nice for them and spooky more a great spooky stuff to come here of course and by the way I Want to remind you of our annual goes to go shell that we will have here on Halloween Night on coast to coast that's a Wednesday night by the way October thirty first okay\nSend us your best go story and we just might choose used to tell a lie on coast to coast\nThat is so fun George Nora gets all the good shows darn it [laughter]\nIt it's a you know I think this is a fun night so email your name your phone number and your bass\nGo story to Halloween story at coast to coast am dot com Halloween story at coast to coast am dot com give us your best stuff\nAnd if we like it then you get to tell it on the air with George sorry that I Love this it's an annual thing that we do it goes to show instead of coast to coast\nSo fun it's so fun so few deed more into the forgotten about that if you think oh I I'm kind of like you know it's late I'm not going to remember this I don't have anywhere write it down simply tomorrow I'll go back to our website and there's the information it's coast to coast H M dot com [noise]\nAre you considering of safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it shapes are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet\nWouldn't it be great if there was a seat that had to look up a beautiful empty so you could display it in your living space as an ... while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino iron works at ... dot com\nAmerican Made an antique styled our Shapes Our part art part furniture and all security and if you like the classic all of our ... states we also feature beautiful matching tool chess and furniture with hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers and a huge network\nAcross the U.S we've built our reputation on having the best built best looking and most convenient strikes what great service and orange trees and you can get online financing so go with the best\nAnd get style convenience security and true peace of mind with rhino safe dot com today that's rental shape dot com rhino shape dot com\nDo you know someone with a drug or alcohol problem did help right now insurance may cover everything stop the drug and alcohol nightmare or drug and alcohol problems getting huge too close to home get help right now insurance may cover everything\nPoverty talks infrequent help one eight hundred two nine six one three to five eight hundred two nine six one three to five that's eight to nine six Thirteen twenty five\nDoes your dog itch scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die by pro order and Ninety Days supply of dynamite\nEverything we tried to\nPick up two bottles of super bigger fish oil get the third bottle free packed with a ... three D.

V. I. T.\nV. savannah is news radio Ninety seven points ... twelve ... am double duty chaos\n[noise]\nIt's coast to coast am county Willis here\nWill is wean is what's going on right now and we're talking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator of mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating ghost and it's um\nThen that means that by definition their their material because you know sound is audio waves and and you know hitting the eardrum and stuff and so you can pressing Adia waves and so\nSo that's that means that they they can be recorded um on on you know audio taping and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used as a tack ghost\nFor the most part they are ones that the replicate what we can experience right we we all we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghosts because people do report seeing them people record you know say they're recording them\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... electric field detectors\nAnd the problem is that there's no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation\nBut ... but no one has ever proved the you know the location with high EMS um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person or a who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it uh\nAnd that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science\nAnd goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think it was awesome [laughter] they're real and I want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one reason I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want to you know we could talk about this forever but just for time's sake I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but why why why what is it\nWell you know um I I don't know what goes or I mean that that's you know that's a million dollar question right I mean even even among the hundreds and believers\nAre across the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their residual events that are you going to have a theory that there is something that's going on and\nIt was some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and treat the the three played other people think that goes in a ... beans or other people say that they're you know the spirit that that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions is problematic for groceries search right because goats can't be both in our dimensional spirit\nAnd you know a a an emotional recording into a tree or house of murder and you know the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomenal has such a widely disparate range of explanations that the problems so I\nI don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not they have meant Scientifically Proven I think that my my best guess if they're real would be basically Couric explanation that would be there some sort of fears of a debt that we were we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nMm good stuff for windows for Willis weaned so thank you for giving us the\nInformation you have in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can go to you but are coming up so we're going to be talking the werewolf in London so you'll want to stick around Benjamin 'cause all Sinclair he somebody you want to me out in the case and time\nDefinitely thank you yeah yeah well tell us where we can

K. and what's interesting is in the research it turns out that the archeologists also found a red the skull caps are they like a head dress\nWith holes and for our eyes and and leather straps to all the mumble they believe that these early people or shame on them they practice the ship and I practice\nUh now I'm not saying that is the reason we have the stories of the flexed and well we'll put it is interesting that when you sort of cast your mind to was that transformation into other animals and other based as they started combing through\nFrom these people I mean I think we have to consider these things as I say I don't particularly think there's a person running rounding ... palms howling at the moon but I'm One hundred percent believe that the people who've come forward and told me the stories of ...\nA telling the truth I mean if you like a refuge was built county in the ... century I took place called spiritual Kona inflicts than it was built by a king all this can be research listeners you know it's not just things that poll is made up\nIn the king was ... he ... he gave a night the job of building the refuge undeniable is a fabulous name was called a home so he built his refuge to protect Trump travel is from an infestation of Savage base\nThat's the interesting thing\nYeah it's fabulous some spots where the name spit till ... hospital comes from so it was was built to that's why they call it spits O'Connor\nOr at least they be devoured I I was lucky enough to contact the people in our own ... what is now the ... in ... after they've been stopped faced being a refugee hundreds of years ago because they supposed to nine\nFifty seven but this refuge was built so we're going back a long way obviously not far back as the early settlers of stock or\nA bill ... but he was due to protect\nTravelers from an infestation of Savage beast\nLease they be devoured it said now I looked at that dates and the ... some of the patch and that's what he says I'm the documentation on the line that you'll find that it says that we must also not forget Coney of the you know during this time we will divide wolves prevalent in\nThe u._k. and bad so you know we don't necessarily an entirely talking about ... this these stories that are quite incredible because when you look at the lion you and you're going to the research you discovered the flakes than\nWas once called ... which is interesting and I it's now ... old ... on old maps those areas afflicts than depicted as well and\nAnd just a few ... as soon as somebody\nChanged the name ... to to make it like like maybe be seen safer something or they didn't want people to think of the old miss maybe or you know why would someone changed the name I mean that sounds like ooh there's a reason why it was a name that\nYeah well there's a reason and we'd go connotations to the wolf for you know in any case it is true with proper research this that it can be sort of ... took if anyone else wanted to look into it sure\nYou know there's a there's a small village just a few miles away called ... and if you break down the name\n... and then go back in history and look do some sort of research and housing

when you see it coming to life\n... while someone's you know drawn it it's a it really adds so much to the story from the witnesses now Paul wonderful artist uh sketching that you did I Know that you're an artist as well and a former carpenter\nAnd so now what you do is you like to ... year retired and you enjoy going and checking out all these mysteries correct\nA ... you know that that is the story I mean the the ... ... this\nCattle grazing it's looks along with it being the old so to lake but around much in the sediments and everything is produced sort of fertile ground very fertile ground\nOh yeah yeah I don't think that that's why the cows and not race or says ... you know the first thing\nIn the Nineteen seventies once again now spoke to this guy numerous times and recorded if I think that you know\nAnd he did a bit of poaching in the Nineteen seventies you know catching has been ... some places that he shouldn't have been on private land and um\nIt was a place called Fox ... in grading Dale which is eight miles from flicks than and he still lives in Britain Dale I mean it's an interesting story\nHe said it was with a friend they suddenly noted for the past week or two weeks that something was ripping the prey out to be snazzy what might it might snow to catch the rub it in their heads and the other game small game\nAn ... ice is proper so it's a ... born and bred and he's with Iraqi and I'm Out too much snow as\nYou said but we couldn't ... he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing a sudden there was still a bit of snow on the ground you could see such a rose or the town is he looking over towards the uh the the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us it's friend who was doing the poaching in the daytime so\nThere's a large hedge hole forms and things about he said he probably eight to ten ... so I\nMean well you sort of turned round to speak to his friend and call this thing and is peripheral vision and then looked and saw it on the left over the head ... he said\nWhat he thought he was a U hauls it meant holes so ... H O to bless you could have probably want to go off the first\n... believe what I was looking at so what we're saying is this thing was as big as a small town it or you know ... it's an interesting thing was he left over the edge and just landed he said wait expert to host a London move forward because the the momentum this thing just limited I'm stuck like American it\nSudden something not to be made to look at that\nHe said he was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he said he led them before they run away he said what he was on all fours\nAnd he said if it to the store do consider being over seven foot and looked like a body builder he said you know it's a tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of the top of a boom\nAnd ... and he said he was almost sort of Britain billing cooler you know like a box that dog all the stuff that you both terriers\nAnd\nNot what he ... he says well he said I went to him to the edge of them to try and get fence stave it's just to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covert crossing the field and into the world or\nWhat quite incredible um you know ... miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast county and if you if you go further down the coast was whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was a beast of bumps than train that was featured in the u._k. papers quite often\nAnd ... such as supposed to be aware of that was such a going the bombs to drain rooms into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we got this where we'll type creature reported but moving along the coast and if you go further up the coast you got\nOld folklore and old legend old legends of dogs with glowing red eyes the ... bay and raven scout I spoke to them they tend to ...\nAnd you know these stories have to have that they've come down to being hunted down in time ... there's just I think there's grains of truth in the stories so that was the site thing\nIn the Nineteen seventies and he lived in Britain do all his life and he's never seen it since\nHe's never seen it before that and he'd never seen it after that which is quite incredible if this thing I Believe his story if this thing was native to that Saturday you would think that they'd be more evidence of it so why are we only seeing small glimpses of it Connie\nWas made\nYeah and that's what you're saying that they pop in and they pop out along the way kind of like\nWhen I talked to people before we had\nA friend of mine Laurie Williams she's a remote viewer in I Would have or target Bigfoot and and she target she mentioned how they they are actually didn't know what it was you know she was looking at the national territory that I gave her and she's talking about how they had these portals\nAnd they were in time warp and they would just go through one time or another and you just see them when they pop into that particular one you know we're we're a human would see him um I find I find it also interesting\nWhen you were saying that Ari yeah is there the world's oldest operational read our base is right there and all this area where all this crazy stuff happens and I think I remember seeing a funny\nThat might be my phone about a coats out people just\nIt's just it's cutting in and out\nNo well

do that at the break for sure but yeah but I can hear you but again I think it I think it's very strange it is operational radar base the oldest one is in the midst of all of these happening now you're talking about\nThat is correct Tony ... and Joe ... briefly jumping to them to the animal mutilation is taking place but then there's a radar based there which is eleven miles from stocks the world as the crow flies and that one's close not one closed about Seventy two are officially said sixty eight but he was still operational up ... to Seventy two\nAnd that's on the edge of the north sea audio ... and all the ... the ...\nOkay now he's gone [laughter]\nSo we'll definitely contacting back on one of his phone and he has there isn't that crazy brand new song a brand new batteries Andy goes out\nStrange isn't it when we talk about some of these things that I don't know I don't know\nYou all those stories Willis wean continues here I Am I'm Connie Willis and we got our guess

we talk about strange subjects um thank\nYou very much [laughter] yeah yeah that was kind of funky for sure\nWell Ghani honestly they what brand new batteries but I'm On a wire phone now so what we should be fine\nUm you know when we were jumping into the store is now trying to give listeners a breakdown of why they why the area's special and how the stories that come through and\nA little bit of history about the area and everything's quite close to the coast as well Tony you know in most instances where only like four miles away from the coast to the point [noise]\nAnd the and the this coastline around red linked to a slum rip them to speak to the rookie clips with\nAbsolute massive network at sea caves some of them have never been never beat entered I mean if if we romance with the

where these things in ... it's just an angle to look at [noise]\nBoats I'm staying it quite close to flex than Connie and twelve miles away there's a huge area of would love to know if you're in off your trickled ... Dale [noise]\nAnd we can sort of accurately they to the summer of two thousand and six and three young men or mountain bikes sets of setting the trailers and doing what oh well all you guys are women and girls as well when I got such a ride around the woodland pots\nAnd this one may fall into the big for type ... is nevertheless an interesting story or late evening but still light on the ... the ... about fall for high end result trees all around them as they cycling down these parts\nOf the ... mountain became aware and shouted which makes this can you see that they said about four to ... away from them that on the path in the Bracken moving that going down quite fast down the hills\nIs what they described as an upright gorilla now they described it says up right because they didn't appear to be ruining [noise]\nAnd that they that black\nFur covered very big uh you know I think we're talking like over eight feet tall a while to get the ... before I saw in the city for for trouble that's at least\nAnd the things they described it says like it was on a track your ... you know they couldn't see legs\nAnd they said they were living up around ... Dale they were familiar with most of the\nThe ... the phone or on rocks and an ally of the ... there's no way that it wouldn't have been jumping over fall and branches and rocks for this thing was just smooth and gliding over the top of the Bracken as though it was just fixed ... she says and we were going as fast as we could\nCause it said that it frightened you said hell yeah they said we were actually chided fired\nBecause he well keeping pace with us and it was all cancers that was the strange thing as well ... well it didn't seem to have to look forward\nIt was look it was fixed on them so\nIs it eventually we go to the ... which for tough to the left and to the right they said and we went right to choose in the past that were taken farthest away from this thing and they left it that's all the scene of it [noise]\nIt yes these two friends if they wanted to talk about it I got the story of one of the guys that they still tobacco the story but they they didn't want to they didn't want to come forward\nWith the amounts of detail that this this month so if they're given my book I think probably looking up more something big foot relate to that but once again there's a mystical element to it in the he's\nNot running in the way the conventional way we would expect some things to ruin all moving should I say you know\n... you know it's it's\nWe've just got this bill for a little bit you know we we talk a little bit before we did this\nAnd that just to say Hi to each other and one of the things\nThat that is tough for both of them is there's no words that really work in our language for what this is it's so hard to describe\nThese things and uh these events as well as the beans in the creatures themselves but you just can't put into words whatever's\nOn that whatever it is it's beyond what we know and what we're supposed to know or see or what is supposed to be real and it's so hard to describe these things\nPaul Sinclair wholesome clear\nOf the u._k. and he's got some incredible stories I mean that's why I was so hard what do we talk about well definitely let's talk about the rules because Halloween is coming up but he has so many other things going on where he's at so\nMore to come here as we celebrate Willis lean on coast to coast county Willis [noise]\nMom\n\nReally lost not by your radio grab your smartphone or computer and listen to all your hard radio pick up the ...
