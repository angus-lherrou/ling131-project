I have to work and I know the house to house and and you know we feel like we're getting thrown away Ninety dollars a month this year\nYou may be but it's just a house and six hundred and Ninety dollars nature problem you're getting ready to make a multi hundred thousand dollar problem and then if your house doesn't sell over back in Iowa for two years you're up a creek\nAnd houses here in any any um Longmont, Colorado where the manufactured home\nIn all the manufactured home that didn't that the kids not closing on\nYeah his mind oh okay not a lot of cash deal okay and we just found out yesterday\nFor our realtor what she had shared if the kid had already put this application for weeks ago when he put the offer an a ha and we didn't find out he didn't you know\nYou just need to sit there and you're manufacturing home manufactured home until you get it so when you get it sold in when it closes only then can you close on another purchase and if that me and if that means you rent for a little while in between it means you rent for a little while in between you know we're going to end up with two houses\nYeah I Know I don't know I needed to be honest I don't do it how about ... brother appreciate\nThat but don't do it you know what happens is is you get caught everybody does issue I'd do it do you've done it you get caught up in the the the narrative of this the story of this and it starts to feel like you're stuck and you have to do things but you don't have to do anything\nUntil my husband and I said we don't have to do anything it's just a house\nI Know it's just that how do you remember when\nYou remember how your heart so big an open when you move to Colorado When you were going to try new adventure I Know everybody called of this ... this is the opposite\nOf that I Know your heart I feel like it's in a cage\nAt it yeah I told my husband I feel cornered right now in a quiet evening we had\nYou know why you feel cornered is 'cause you're cornered wondering why you would feel court so you're on your eyes you here's what you do when you're cornered you throw up your hands and you walk out\nYep I did that last night I walked out with my husband was probably the real fear I said I Can't even get the more\nI it's not a matter of not dealing with it I'm not talking about a voice on TALK I Know I mean I don't know if I'm a bit of Neal crash I'll be happy to close on this deal\nWhen my trailer cells yeah when my trailer is so my trailer has and so I Can't close until that happens and so you guys need to dump us in the street dump us in the street and go on to the next guy\nAnd that's probably what's gonna happen oh well there's a house on every corner in Denver\nYou'll get you another house and don't get desperate\n'cause as soon as you feel cornered as soon as you feel desperate as soon as you feel forced\nThat's when you do stupid stuff and there's realtors feeling desperate they're trying to get your clothes on something you shouldn't clothes on\nThey should've been a contingency to start with but now we're going to make it one because you're just not going to close\nTo see if you do you're going to regret it you're going to end up on in both of these houses for ten years\nAnd then you're going to have a real problem\nIt's going to damage your finances is going to take a decade to recover from a bad decision walk away or tell them just we're gonna have to break boys and girls until this thing closes if we can get this closed and we'll close if we can't then we're not going to be able to oh we're gonna go to the next guy well\nI'm I understand you have the right to do that 'cause I'm not closing on Thursday\nAnd then but if you want to wait on us we'll be happy to close on it will keep our word but it's got to be based on this thing selling and um I Would walk that's exactly what I'd do calm down\nMark is with us in Indianapolis mark welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThank you for your service sir thank you how can I help\nWhile I'm sixty and I have six little properties three that are free and clear and three that have small mortgages and I just always assumed that we would probably sell one of the time of basically about now they'll start now and then that would be for your retirement and a friend of mine said well wait a minute you've ... have you with the\nUh the reason I thought we needed to sell them I thought that to Social Security at a limit of around fourteen thousand or so that you can make for a year before they uh\nThey like you and he says wait and exit on law held investments I don't know that that applies\nOutside or not and I think I think there's just passive income and doesn't apply you need to check that out I agree with him I'm not positive but I wouldn't keep I wouldn't sell a good investment just to change my Social Security stuff\nSocial Security on that big a part of the equation these properties or two if they're good properties I'd keep them even if it does mess up Social Security where\nThey're profitable hey you know we've we've been I guess you'd say successful with it but they're not the you know\nIt's bread and butter rose tree bedroom one bath houses that's best gun\nI stay read there's a big market for 'em right\n[noise] uh yeah yeah but as you know you know which way it's I mean when you're sixteen fifty five on the thing is I Would say you've been through with Reuters and\nIf you don't want for renters lots of different equation but I'm not selling them to get out of Social Security problem\nI may or may not causes so scared of probably maybe passive income might not come up with Social Security but you might want to sell them anyway if you just don't like being on the runners and on but overall is real estate a good investment to carry all the way through retirement if you don't mess around with it that's that's a good investment and this is that Iran\n[noise] um\nBelieve confident she production officer for

very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form at a moment's notice\nCan you see them I can you see I was\nBorn with the ability to see spirits I thought everybody could it was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school and grade school\nThought I saw spirits in the classroom some were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help from schoolwork and some are looking at me like how can you see me\nWhat are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for and they'd actually come and start walking towards me in the classroom and I was very uncomfortable\nStay with us Jeffrey we're going to hit a break and we're gonna come back and talk

spot of the carousel it's about an eight year old girl in Sweden who was skipping Roxanne stones and sticks across the lake and reached out to grab another stick\nAnd and pulled out of three foot long

stabbing I have a nine hand for unions began your favorite ... make a fifty dollar on my duty and frankly I Can't and you get a free make up the tree out and then I think I never mind the you can help to breast cancer research by making an insect any sense skinny\nLittle things mean everything getting tired and I said family I think the\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there were there they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nAnd work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time\nPeople who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative\nEmotional energy drugs or something I practice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea\nWhen I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that homes because people have lived in there they generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel them\nAnd they accumulate in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them you wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies\nAnd so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments and generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy\nHatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is sick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why\nIs this happening and so modern exercises and it deals with the idea of that first negative emotional energy has to be removed by somebody like me\nFrom the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent trees\nSay Sean and freeze exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because where I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic atheist\nEverybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything anyways personal things I wasn't touching anybody anyway it's really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it and it it it has to be done you know we we moved into apartments like I said and there's\nLots of emotional energy from maybe people living there for Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes they're already in the homes from time to come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack\nAnd so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it where it all at once and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having your carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nA qualified extra assistance just about every religion but the but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not\nYou know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong in the religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives\nUm I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around the stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which haunt me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for more at the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to

on news radio Ninety seven point seven double duty chaos [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd welcome back Jeffrey shaman with us we'll get to your calls as well as we talk about demons demonic possessions what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOh a just a few years ago um I did a free night a\nAnd a century or the agenda that haunted mansion very famous I won't mention the name but it's something I was\nAgain three years and years and years you all invitation I finally\nThey talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just beautiful you know\nAnd so uh it was actually set up for a ghost hunters to go in and uh with are quitting and and take a look around and everybody everybody found something people didn't believe in goes had you know\nOn a couple of ... their hair dryer went flying across one of the rooms and I was staying and most haunting room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nA first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get business cards people on it and I was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called\nThe bachelor but very heavy oh she was called the golden rule and it went up to get my business card and then she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast\nRight in front of me just would not stop\nI just said you know I just you know forget it I went to get my card and no attention I said you know this place has really on it and third night I was there\nUm I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night to go with hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't\nBite me yeah they'll follow people home negative spirit yes they will\nKnow that gets you later so I was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and I'm Out four feet above me with them is shaping the spirit terrible looking now I'm used to fear it's going to sue many shape they want I don't really\nAct the ... you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately ... what this thing was doing was it was singing and ... song that I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's strange possible to describe it was\nNot any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil lullaby and it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in in the bed woke up\nAnd the spirit was was singing hello Patrick ... and I could hear it loud and clear just horrific song slowly\nAnd I just I you know ... shot up immediately got up out of my bed at ... kind of went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I wanted to change me a from being very happy\nAnd sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick I sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room\nYou know you you just learn\nAn extra sisters not safe I don't go into homes and uh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits in somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely beyond the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know times\nImmediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clearly not do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nUh you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments and they need a clearing and and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and\nThey call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting I feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drained\nBecause I'm not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always noted subconscious and so people don't know they're getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them run\nNegative spirit and so you know people call me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot\nJeffrey really really helped you know\nVery very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last almost three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute ... different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common\nUh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around\nReally on a business or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family lore arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits and so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well\nAnd also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people\nEmotional energy schools people go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to its old very beautiful but I mean\nThink of the moon energy just\nLaid it and so people become uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks\nUp emotional energy we generated we don't know how to release it\nTeach people how to do that you know and and so sometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nNot so good at all costs just for you know\nMarshall energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to Jay in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time\nThank you thanks

attack people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems [noise] a depression anger issues unhappiness ah overconfidence\nAll sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that\nFighting line and being able to reach into the physical around and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy and the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is it's not so much of an immediate death but actually\nWorking on them for a long time\nAnd they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up one morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work out doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power\nSuddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back and it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and tried to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some light medication for it is it the\nDemonic spirit had pulled muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself\nSo all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be a physical because demonic spirits study how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark dramas that are negative very negative what we might call help and and especially\nThat is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the trust of the bread and heaven and the other side to being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know a good\nTrip pan turtle like I go to the other side gets off drugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say no I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steal your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for these spirits\nOut there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are hopeless but the idea of negative spirits negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who\nHire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields\nI don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore to a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's possessed or anything we just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or condo condo or Republican pub whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual the safe this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm a mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kind of stuff at first it was real scary but\nActually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past life helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so drained\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it you know and it\nIt's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is Jeffrey

your ... than a tweak questions for Tom and he'll pass them on to us and we'll get going with that too but let's go to the phones let's pick it up I'm going to keep in Virginia to get things started Hi Keith welcome good morning\nHi George ... morning thank you sure\nAnd or on your topic I Can't believe that actually want to talk about a related to that kind of places in which people who do believe that they do believe that they saw that\nBut actually did not and uh perhaps for just why that couldn't beat 'em some possibilities [laughter] um I I Want to talk about a an example of that including I'm\nA doctor a Christine Blasey Ford and I'm Brett Kavanaugh who both\nAppear to be very certain insincere and their claims they did a they did and in many people yeah many people uh\nI felt like Dr Ford was very credible\nAnd she said she was a hundred percent certain of her accusations against him and uh I Want to mention um several years ago the late ... cold time magazine regarding Prozac\nI'm alarmed at the monster that I created she joined the board of the international coalition for drug awareness which was founded by a coast to coast am guest and like Tracy\nWho wrote the book Prozac panacea or or I Am for Thirty years his research government approved prescription\nMind altering drugs regarding your previous guest she actually says that ah\nAnother name for sorcery which has been shown in the holy Bible or pharmacology\nI Believe and [noise]\nAnd she said that that actually among some of the bad effects of\nThese government approved prescription mind altering drugs including ss her eyes and the average person so that they create\nActual portal sworn negative dark and he'd been demonic spirits but they also a interfere with\nPeople's ability to have a spiritual thing positive spiritual experiences including belief in God some people when they go on the drugs they stopped believing in God [noise]\nThere is a boy who uh is featured in a Youtube video with and like Tracey and I hope everybody could watch why it took them to school\nAnd in that he is uh basically described is when he went on these medications um\nWas you know waking dream state\nAnd uh he he didn't know the difference between reality and um you know his delusions and what he was doing and it almost ended up very tragically he ended up going to jail for this this this boy\nLots of people do\nYeah but he he later you know God out or because the people knew that there is really something wrong this this boy didn't belong there didn't believe that he really was responsible for that and sure enough you know that it was going to the medications that he he made but they believed him\nBut the people believed him yeah and and what I'm what I Want to talk about is what he believed that he was experiencing in this waking dream state\nWhich is common and like Tracey says about all these cases and David which include suicide and domestic violence workplace alive and she said only suitcases of the school shootings are\nInvolved for kids that were not on on these drugs and so the bottom line is what I'm suggesting is that it's possible\nThat because some of the side effects are a dilution hallucinations and\nI Am black Tracy has a false memory syndrome article about Roseanne Barr who accused her parents of\nMolesting her and later and that was after she was on the medication and then later she she realized that that was not correct at all and she was really certain that it had happened but uh but but then you know she\nAnd she would only ask one off of that you would have passed a lie detector test because she believed it\nExactly and so this is what a I think it's important for people to know and and who has a documented thousands of cases over the thirty years of the things and what I'm saying you know in in my previous call it I I didn't get to\nInclude all of this but I but basically I had a dream in which it\nWas very vivid I had mentioned that you know I was told by somebody who I Am twenty five days before that he would feed me and Thirteen months and I said how do you know and he said the holy ghost told me [laughter] and\nAnd I I you know I knew it was a dream\nAnd but the ...\nI didn't I didn't know when I was dream that it was a dream and was on the loose a tree but afterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has and consuming use drugs\nWe don't we don't know that I don't know but but what I'm saying is\nThat it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream\nSoon she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's not something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on any mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in in that case\nThat never came up but I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that when we got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nYou know and you'll okay where you are\nI'm engaged hanging um I had a um a thing you could do believe that I saw before I had a I had done a little bit of the ... and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know and um and I was in a bone in my life where I didn't really know\nIf God was real or if they do all this you know and I started reading the Bible and everything and then I'm\nGoing back to the point when I was out and do you want to live in a a a gun and I was like ... ... you know your real angels on everything Israel you know show me 'cause I Would like to know I Would like to believe I so I\nIt started at ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later what happened when\nI started seeing these little things like with people like a Beagle like these little spirits and stuff\nAnd I'm a well I I think this one guy had\nThree of them right when it seemed like everybody in when he had frenzy everything he did he touch with no I mean you have a one my you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's monkey you didn't have none okay now these kids that you know\nOh it's a glass of water without knocking over some breaking it up and told me that he was going to get an angel [laughter]\nBut he didn't have one at the time\nAnd um I Believe that it was kind of me just to show me\nThat you know how it works warning or you know men so [laughter] so I bought a church you know I tell my uncle buddy told me you know you get to go to church you know and I'm so we go to church but what was going to church I won't eat them and I started the ...\nWell one of the angels like\nIn our early on to church all over the place\nAll of them around it you know a new like there was a state of behind the Greek and um [noise] they get all the way around it and I had never seen anything like that no like real real big I mean I was like oh the ... foot tall seemed like\nGreen
