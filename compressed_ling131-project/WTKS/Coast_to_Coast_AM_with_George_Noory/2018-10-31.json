{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "That I've never heard of it I was ... the pain is unbelievable how much are you still over white then as an associate it with obesity\nWell not the only [laughter] so they had I had him in high school and I didn't have them for Nineteen years and the only thing that happened after Nineteen years was that gain weight and that's when I started again so I'm I'm trying not to open up that might be it\nYeah okay so what do you why now so I weigh about two sixty now okay and you lost forty pounds she said for what\nYou have about forty three pound them and I'm Still going I'm Still doing going strong\n... okay good news is good for you well done thank you yeah I mean with that kind of pain no you can learn to do a lot of different things that are out\nThere um so I you know 'cause I I'm I'm not only mildly curious about this um in terms of bless your heart the pain you've got but the uh the truth is is that the financial troubles are going to continue as long as you continue having a ten thousand dollar bill every three months right\nExactly and um I assume you've got health insurance I Do so when you have a kidney stone event what is your out of pocket cost between two and six thousand dollars per yeah okay and what is your household income\nOr about sixty sixty sixty five I\nYou know and so if your budget twelve thousand a year for medical ... out of that it does make it hard to get some traction\nRight well especially with our credit card debt that we're that we've we we paid off twenty five thousand we still have about thirty left so we're we're making headway but you know the the hospital bills are going up at the same time\nYou know why I Would just give you permission to look let's win this medical battle and not expect huge headway until you do yeah\nTake sixty thousand modest twelve thousand you don't and then by the way you want to eat out of that too I'm a you're not going to make mega mega headway on this debt until you solve this medical problem\nBut if you can stay even not going to hold or and or make some progress while you solve this bigger issue then as soon as that's gone um you know you're going to be a new man in\nIn many ways right\nSo I mean I I just cannot see this\nBeing something that you go oh twice a year I have a kidney stone for the next forty years I I just that that just does not uh that's not tenable scenario to me so I I think something is figure it out here along the way\nIn the process I I just can't ... maybe there are people that do that I don't know I've never heard of that but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist I'm not a medical professional by any stretch\nSo um but let's say that it takes two years to solve this and you know that's twenty four thousand dollars out of pocket the ... coming up you know well that's just going to be\nThat's what you're fighting you know you just got this thing you're fighting in and it's going to slow down your progress it's not going to keep you from making progress but it's going to slow it down and just give yourself permission to do that and let's let's win the battle that you're fighting and that's the battle for your health\nTo get your health back on Bush's er wow ouch ow Brooke is with us in Tampa, Florida Hi Brooke how're you\nGuys have cable either but I said I already know the answer here that\nI was actually calling I was wondering um\nI don't I mean you mentioned you know you were a lot of school and I had crashed it even more so on that Taiwan is an aspect mhm like I'm twenty four I took a little bit of ... well that aren't bad habit I charge money they're getting like\nA lot more and grant fact probably won't even have to look at them again and I won't be any idea what\nI'm trying to work as much as I Know yeah but you have any advice for time magazine like trying to ... to have someone trying to get like some of it is also calm about it and I want to try to have a ...\nA little longer on school side but you know well\nThe first thing you do is your budget obviously your time for ... for your classes\nAnd a new budget your time for your study around your classes and in the new budget work I'm social comes after that I'm older than I Am most people if they throw a brick through their television they found about thirty hours a week\nAnd um that's pretty amazing right there I mean\nPeople ask me how I read so many books a year I just don't watch a lot of TV anymore and I'm not mad about television I don't think the levels and their although he probably is having a pretty good time there but um it's not like it's something like that it's not like a spiritual thing it's just a matter of what do I want to spend my time on\nThat gives me my best life I'll spend my time on grandbabies children wife\nMe work reading\nThese or do you know a long time before I spend my time she'll just being intentional with your time\nYou'll be amazed how much time I mean you know how many ... you'd be made so many people spend two hours a day on Facebook\nAnd you talk about a colossal freaking waste of time there's one\nSo um if you just stayed off social media completely or virtually ... almost completely and he turned off your television you can make a pretty good living with that time\nThe second thing I Would do other than that is other than getting away from time oysters and budgeting my time is\nYour best income production things at your age wall in school when you need to control your time are typically some kind of self employed or straight commission slash self employed idea\nAt twenty four years old you can make more money ... and babysitting\nYou make Fifteen twenty bucks an hour doing that\nYou can make more money cleaning people's houses you can make twenty five or thirty dollars an hour doing math and neither one of these things require extremes levels of skill\nI mean yes you obviously know something about children and it would be good if you had CPR at the Y. you've taken the clash and got certified and so All right\nBut and\nYou know those those sorts of things but you can make really good money and control your time or book the times that you're willing to do those things around her classroom time\nDoing that so do away with the time oysters intentionally budget your time and look for self employed and or straight commission ideas where when you work you get paid very well and you control when you work\nAnd work a lot\nI was selling real estate in college now that's a very unusual
