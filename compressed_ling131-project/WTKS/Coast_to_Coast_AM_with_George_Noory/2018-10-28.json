get to this ... this was this is a very unusual place in America but it hasn't even more extraordinary place in the timeline\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people to come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\nAll right a city of about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people come um and of course the months it's in the quarter million so it's a massive amount of people for that small city to have to the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked Halloween in say about the subject so it should have you use that as it is a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the er the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really important I mean we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about uh the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I it you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that a ... that there are other places around the world outside of the Salem\nThat had massive\nHanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that film wasn't the first ever which wasn't the last one the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for the you know there are you know the first for trout America you'll victim was in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that lives but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nIt isn't it honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still being being executed for being with us but the strange thing about that to me of course all the things that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's Salem, Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween and the way um I like to rub zombie story there in the book to\nAnd then coming up next our on coast to coast am I'm a truly amazing saga of the most elusive serial killer in American history and you've never heard of that

it would be Halloween bumper but it is for anybody who's seen the Netflix series the hunting of hill house [laughter] because that's been the theme\nThey play a kind of a slowdown spooky version of it in the promos let me tell you what a great show that was on Stephen King praised it a ... it's been getting you know terrific reviews from every corner ended deserves it just a great great story and it's told really well has nothing to do with the book\nRight has very little to do with any of the other versions of the hunting appeal house that I've ever seen I think I've seen every version they've ever made even the bootleg versions where these slightly changed the title\nA but it was it was just ... it was great and I was skeptical of it going into it a ... and I wasn't really ready to commit to ten episodes I had a lot of moving stuff to do but it just it's not good so if you're looking for something to be a little bit spooky\nMore in the area of terror than horror\nVery suspenseful the hunting of he'll house on Netflix\nUm is is just one of the rare a Netflix series that lives up to all of its building I think everybody I've talked to watch is loved it I'll just tell you that much and I think what's even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with\nWith the original book and perhaps the original British version of the movie is that\nThey they make a point to do a lot of stuff off just slightly off camera was a little bit out of frame\nSo it there's there's plenty to you know give you a ... and ... but I mean there were some moments there where\nSome of the coolest stuff you can't see and that's what it was like in the first one I remember that as a kid when I went to go see it it was like I couldn't see it but it was it would almost scared me more than I could see and I I don't know if I could have handled it if I had seen it so take a look it up and you're going to join up for Halloween you're going to join the show to for

I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who are protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... let out of jail that is kind of you if you can test instead yet was really sorry about that then you let go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get ... and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying but for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them didn't anyway\nThat right I Am a nuanced the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their belief all the things you're told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible such a great works of literature in place is because he kept right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or the end the population you said under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumps like that or is it just it just it just I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist and not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurants than they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their\nHost or too cold tourist and still happens their biggest one is October which will never go well\nI Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a boots at a state there they can make their entire year in the week that the state fair is open and I I Would never have guessed shops are open for one month in in ...\nYeah but but other than realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nThat now is certainly open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museums so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round at film grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are the rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are ... you know ... or to or how they want ... just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring that it's actually a ... year round here on the other time of year there's not that many curbs\nBut in October for instance the er the burial ground which was the old seventeenth century a graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting overrun and people were like using the grave as you know picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nBut that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar or inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of tell people hey the nights over start start heading to the train and start having your cars so there that's\nReally ... in ... at ten pm\nYeah I Believe it the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to shut it kept pushing this a hundred thousand people to the train you take some time so by midnight nobody around on Halloween of\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the wishing our\nYeah yeah it was it just gets bad really bad that\nThey got to get them up before the ... or maybe they're doing the real wishing happens after all the tourists plea GW locker or and or Edgar Award winning author thank you so much a season with the which\nThe magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts is now on my bucket list thinks do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list of things are and have a great night in fact I'm checking off one when I go to ... in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that coming up later on in November\nWhen I'll be back on Halloween sorry on Thanksgiving weekend on coast to coast day I'm All right so the story you're going to want to hear the story you're never going to forget the men from the train next and coast to coast am\nEwing the drug Enforcement Administration celebrating written from October twenty third rude there in\nThe lab and counts of murder I'm Del Walters Fox News just some of the twenty nine charges Rob Bowers faces the forty six year old charged with opening fire inside a synagogue in Pittsburgh this\nAnd one of the things I learned that such true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression\nOf sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\nThis is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged in allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflame the senses right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks rattling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time coal\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the tree\nUh but this was the same reason I Love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime\nIs allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime\nBefore death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric\nThe focus on the acts of the killer or to satisfies the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these\nTrue crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn right they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the ...\nAnd not run for your life\n[noise] uh all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell in the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalist need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up towards bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate but who is responsible\nFor today's mass shooting clearly the majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up\nOnly a small percentage of such things I've ever happened not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about in fact the media would be focused on what isn't a conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about up people who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years

of doubles in running around these days including son devils getting a big way into the kind of fun job so the we were just a hated the interrupt you because you were doing such a great job with the\nExplanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I I had to cut you off because we had the heartbreaking but I'm In the stricter\nInterrupted by because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to find\nThe heart of everything that's like a little bit more of the murder what's that like thirty four of them aren't there or something yeah\nSomething like that they um they uh the crime you normally Kurt on Sunday night for you to hurt on the weekends\nUp until Nineteen pan the crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was blogging or one of the primary under stress was logging\nThe or doors doors and windows logjam shot I think I mentioned that they um\nThe fingerprints and blood and it meant nothing to them a mutt typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight by Nineteen ten Nineteen twelve blood the night in Eighteen Ninety eight no one knew that there were these for blood group say a B o and whatever it is the um uh\nThe uh by Nineteen twelve people didn't know that uh and and breakthroughs hadn't had had\nBeen achieved and had begun to make their way into courtrooms but uh it was it was a very slow process and it is a very infant tile stage\nMentioned the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer tracking this story then required you to go through a lot of newspaper aren't kinds of things to try to find\nA lot of these stories which as you point out had been a they had the Dodgers had human conduct connected then so you you may have been the very first person that ever started putting this this case together in this way\n... well yes we were ... except for the end of the the the the last year the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was on the loose\nFrom in Nineteen eleven uh Nineteen twelve which would runner and he was killing a lot of people but the earlier crime we what we did was say\nLook this this this murderer is way too experienced to have started this in Nineteen ... eleven there have to be earlier crime so let's try to find them\nNow getting ordered walking back toward the first crime\nThat's when I got into that nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year so successfully\nDumb luck and it is\nNot all of them are heavy I had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back when you when you commit the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is\nI told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime bucks but very often the serial murder when he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes\nAnd he would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\nBut we would just fantastically lucky and it is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston is first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York\nAnd because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it\nAnd it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the eye out with uh with with all the last last murders and the series so ah we\nIt's just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Pam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype ... he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime then excessively after that it is is the years went forward\nAnd yet there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times there were guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five the uh I think that he while he used an axe to\nCommit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his\nBelt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and could front of him but um it was not what he was trying to do but his wife would do if you had to do\n[noise] to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next door but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... lead all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general answer the question is the crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our of ourselves that we don't like to talk about a\nAll crime stories are about lost and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are a part of you and me I don't know you but they're\nThey're part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves

things I learned from reading that is the ... block of\nEr was a an avid reader of crime stories uh Charles Dickens was going to have them at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding was it's it's very common among writers to be avid readers Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because the ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the or if you don't get from\nSports I mean uh I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what who we are and what we're trying to do with positive people trying to do positive things\nHang on hang on to that thought on crime stories as this world picking up the men from the train discovering most Americans most elusive serial killer and there's one story or two here you need to know about before you go to bed and goes to goes day in\nTime for my gas you get the recognition they deserve their role influencing pop culture and public opinion and you decide which broadcasts reducing the IRA ... percent capital one major wars where your vote\nAround people involved doing positive community things and writing demands from the train because he likes to write about crime so do you want to finish that\nYou're you're fading out there and I was not able to hear a lot of them\nI'm fading out no Ken of that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world by day in writing crime at night\nYeah they are saying that crime stories are fascinating too it's because they they uh come from the parts of ourselves but we don't like to talk about and don't normally talk about in the case of the man the train I didn't make a deliberate thoughtful entry into the subject\nI just got hooked like a fish\nUh I was I was I saw a documentary about the murders and ... called ... living with a mystery it's an extremely well done a documentary and far above them mama levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing which is that it's relatively ...\n... murders are a part of a serious so I started\nI was just going to put an hour and to and to trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a weak the weak eventually became five or six years or so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a a true crime book sure yes it is\nYeah you know and that's the interesting thing is to is that true crime you know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the ... circuit riding preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution and\nThey would do a sermon just before the execution then we try to provide the context for why this person was being executed and wide to community overall would benefit from his or her desk and it became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their execution sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime narratives it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in it even though it's a hundred plus years leader in some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of I'm a ... a kind of healing anyway not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved\nBut for these communities maybe this this lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened maybe some closure\nI'm On my own exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were just they have it happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was a a a ... his great great aunt had been was one of the victims of the crime\nEngine and he had always believed that uh uh the man who uh was accused of murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released always believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book back\nIn our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief to it yeah it was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that\nBut it was it was a show he said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was this other fellow\nI I don't know why it was important to him\nToo well I understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it I'm ... I've I've I don't know that there's a lot of different but it still didn't have that reaction to it\nYou can go ahead go ahead no please no a lot of the book and a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all all good books for church for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago\nAnd I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these\nThat these murders occur to him and I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's it's sort of equal distance from me and them\nAnd that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive at was whether they are what how people lived\nThat they they lived rich meaningful live a ... people\nIn urban areas today think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nAll of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happen to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment that they went to literally every night\nAll of the things that that happened who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they let die terrible Beth I'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid\nOf journalism and you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the tone for the um the things that people age\nOr the way the houses were constructed around your communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThey are and then there's ... there's what is it that always sticks with me that trait that point you're just back there and that has to do with the the taco in the case of soccer in bands that it uh one of them I think it would suck oh we had an alibi for the time of one of the crime what are the crime was committed on December twenty four\nOf I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a\nWitnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors and Italian community um a pickle deal because pickled ... were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflict in testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty second or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nSee a ... it's it's a tiny detail that you would write with not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian as a way that the tally in American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important in a crime story ... that's what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that eliminates the details of of a or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know that I think that brings us very effectively ...\nIowa I'm ended the crime story which\nAs you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a ... a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nOn an item of Jim nine Nineteen twelve\nOh the lights were out in Alaska due to a um\nAuthorities and I would say that still true today the people the the chamber of commerce tribes parks in Politico wished that ... was known for something else right right the ah ... there is a house where the crime occurred\nIs still standing of his operated as a kind of a more tourism or it's the it's a shows up on paranormal ... TV shows and people have to take tours of the house\nThe um uh but if you drive around but let's go there is no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors houses but that but ah whether what looks good knowing for is not mentioned anywhere\nWe um [noise] uh that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial but yeah uh I don't know that\nYou raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper memorial to the victims victims were mostly poor people most people without\nA without one in the family was very well why they are and the community\nUh thought well I Am the vigorous efforts to solve the crime was a kind of memorial to them uh but I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers\n... or there's an effort to try to just enough to be like a statue\nBut it is interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics peace not explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um one of his maps of trades crimes with the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder to families and what not an adjoining out the ah ah but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell yeah oh that's a house right there um but it still has not forgotten or many places\nMany places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally and absolutely forgotten but at some of it it's still quite well remember [noise]\nSo I Want to you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because [noise]\nIt was really hoping to finish the book before the interview but I really want to get to the part about how you think you would have narrowed down this suspect so let's let's go through that\nLet's go through that process Ninety victims [noise]\nStarting in the late Nineteen century going up to the early twentieth century of one men the men and the train [noise] does he have a name [noise]\nNext coast to coast am this is Ian punted [noise]\nNews radio\n[noise]\n\nThree years ago making a murderer became less a TV show of\nForce of nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice it was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm ... and Brendan daffy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too hard to re budding Myrtle\nReminding a murderer is now on the free I our radio as to when the ...\n\nThe disadvantages news radio Ninety seven point seven FEMA twelve ... am to have a duty chaos [noise]\n\nThem\n\n\n\n...

community sometimes the best way for us to understand ourselves\nOr the ... is to look at the the stories of the dead\nAnd that's what the that's what the with Bill James did the men from the train and he took a a sin optic view this giant looks from thirty thousand feet at a series of crimes Ninety murders that happened\nAnd started to see the patterns and went back to the earliest one and

carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so\nSo it goes wrong [laughter] um but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nA ... or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to how many unsolved murders\nThat we we we have a tendency to replicate\nUm circumstances that are defining experiences in our life because that's how we know ourselves best [noise]\nSo somebody who might have grown up in a very dysfunctional household\nTends to cleave toward dysfunctional relationships not go the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship they know how to act and so they keep re creating that until they break the habit I'm so fractals theory often explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and you said\nYou know somebody from being destroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so did you spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment kind of thing so I Wonder what\nThis this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate by recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\nWell ... that\nThere is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was or his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that has ever happened to them and that he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more\nAnd some variation but more specimens specificity as it got went along so that you know the ... the early patterns or not that type but the the later patterns get closer and closer to the first ... that's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that\nThat's who he was a that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt\nThat Mr bell or had been the victim of terrible abuse says young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh he had tiny widely spaced teeth or he was not clean\nAnd I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look and he said he had suffered terrible abuse and it's a terrible abuse replicated itself in his\nAnger and his outrages not that isn't any sense of justification for what he did but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] you know the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the corps if that's what happened um speaks to the age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've done and this\nCould have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know just some barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation in the book has a lot of things we don't know about you how are you you're going to have no after you're gonna have speculated of answer it's up to you I wouldn't speculate\nThat he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newton family and ... in Eighteen Ninety eight I I Would I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because there's an obvious lack of planning and\nI'm preparation for the of at ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I was very much would suspect that he had been\nAdding inappropriate interactions with young girls that he had a a while you have if he had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy and then he says he ... is his the documentation\nOf his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was um it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carry to carry the sangre pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents through and about his life\nThe um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that's that's a great point what year had he gone into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which she grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year\nThere have been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who is the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm a nurse associates\nWhich is what this guy's sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm sociopaths ... are often rage killers and they they just you know they it it's a ... thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of relief and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse's there's a ... because it was not it didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... generally as a charming\nRight motor often well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that maybe he was he was a true psychopathic\nOr psychopathic have no fear ever known norm I Do not have normal fear and one thing that's apparent about this the ... and the trade is that from his crime that he it was not not acting and fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that\nAre horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with it so I just probably not that I should have made this this other point first the story of a Paul Miller andme after the training is much larger than our book\nAnd and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in\nTen years or Fifteen\nAnd going to say well here's what the James's miss I miss this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed the whole story about a crime and it when that guy Illinois\nAnd uh the I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research\nStudies so we moved on and printed book but various still more story to be discovered there\nYeah it's very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions as sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers you're coming up just a second demand from the train discovering

can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get a way for so many years just\nAs it you know his

didn't he didn't read all ... it would create some crimes up north when it was warm weather but not never been happier limited to the south the um\nThe that area is a interesting because it it it's always been a hotbed of um\nA reformist motion or a movement or it's as you no doubt no a a\nA a one of the foundation areas of the women's rights movement the ah ah is is that the exact area upstate New York but also many um\nReligious movements from the banking century actually I'm a native from that part of the country I don't know what it has to do with my book but uh it it is a very interesting area and I I'd like to know more about it\nYou know there's an argument in true crime that the the ... the ... murders on unjust unsolved\nCrimes like that seep into the soil and then did they tend to also then grow back out of it again which I was from a ton of its poetic but they're interesting Doug is in New Jersey coast to coast am east of the Rockies for Bill James go ahead\nYes

different a show about among solve something or other\nAnd I'm not sure but the date sounds pretty familiar war or the arrow but this one this was going on\nThere was a hobo camp a in a train yard in Chicago\nAnd a along the shore on this one particular train ride like came in and out of this yard\nUm they had four or five of these ah ... degenerate hobo is that stayed there in the yard that were actually killed and they found out that they were all killed by actresses they were they were chopped up the axes were supposedly taken off of the trains\nAnd there was I Believe a total of five bodies found and um I Believe at one point Eliot Ness when he was first getting in to his position he was asked to go ahead and looked at this and this was one of the things that he had never solved and they said it bothered him greatly\nTill he white you know till he retired do you know if that has anything to do it or are you familiar with that case at all yeah\nThey um uh\nI I I Know exactly what it is not Chicago it's actually a Cleveland the\nNineteen thirties I I'm sure that's the case you're referring to it it's a Eliot Ness a after the uh what was hired to try to solve a series of er\nAnd I'm blanking out all the name by which the yet right is crime\nSeries is known but they actually started in a Newcastle Pennsylvania Nineteen twenty two and then spread the Cleveland in the Nineteen thirties I wrote about that period of crimes at some length in in a popular crime but that is it's not it's not ... they were\nThey were acts murders they were connected to train the but it's it's twenty or the or it's twenty five thirty years after\nThe crimes that I wrote about it and I it's not connected\nYou know I'm not sure about that he was with um I I I I knew the case you speaking

that\nUh and I just real quick about a Lizzie Borden she killed her ... she if she did a choose the blade or the acts and you said the other guy use the little boy on hand so that would be I guess that'd be something else against the bowl want to ask you real quick\nDid they ever have a picture of this guy somebody could have had to if you're given a description of 'em that you know we had newspapers\nBack then you know we had a you know we had a Morse code and tell a type of stuff like that I mean there had been some sort of a picture circulated or something of this guy right to the people knew about him later you're just moving into and out of town and do whatever I Want to know who he was you know when you when you buy\nBut that's a really big or it the first right\nEverybody knew everybody knew what he looked like and he was a very unusual looking man\nBut for some reason that we can't figure out\nNo one ever did that we can fine no newspaper that we can fine ever did a drawing of and posted it and I don't know why they didn't do it it was common practice and and the wild west in the same era the it was ... it was common to do drawings of criminal\nIn that case there are drawings of the a police inspector in charge of the cave drawings\nOf the house and he's tried to use it oil can set the house on fire and there's a drawing of the oil and gas\nBut none of them

couple of news stories to get to this morning I I don't know if you heard about a ... ... if you go to coast to coast am dot com there's there is a really ... is a great piece about the experiments that inspired Frankenstein\nSo as you're heading into the holiday weekend a and getting up to a Halloween on the way this is a it's a fun story to read because it it goes to show you the science behind what was this since ... science fiction story\nNot people don't think of Frankenstein as science fiction that you know sometimes it's sort of like a big morality play\nBut it really is in many respects ... one of the first major big selling science fiction works and that's because\nUm if you really if you think about the ... like it was like a I robot both the ... version and then the robot that came before as most they're all kind of play on the same themes that are that are explored in Frankenstein\nBetween you know the creator and the creation or and in fact in that very first\nVersion of a robot before the asthma version of a robot um the robot that has created\nIn the very first version of I robot which was in the late Nineteen thirties or sits down and read Frankenstein and then has a better understanding of life\nAfterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot coms a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun\nAbout eight or a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to a defense insider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada\nUm and what they had recently uncovered but\nBut if they did well then you know they would it would become the new Roswell\nThey do about a quarter of a million people to come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\nAll right a city of about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how in itself it's about a hundred thousand people um and of course the months it's in the quarter million so it's a massive amount of people for that small city to have to the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked Halloween in say about the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the er the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really important to be we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that a ... that there are other places around the world outside the Salem\nThat had massive\nHanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that film wasn't the first ever which wasn't the last ... into a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for the you know there are you know the first for trout America you'll victim was in Connecticut and\nIn Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep it alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which you killed\nThe honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still being being executed for being with us but the strange thing about that to me of course all of a seasonal planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's still a Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that and she's with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween\nAnd the way um I like to rub zombie story there in the book to\nAnd then coming up next our on coast to coast am I'm a truly amazing saga of the most elusive serial killer in American history and you've never heard of that either that's coming up next our coast to coast am this is the input\n\nReally settling is\nRushing didn't loan payments\nBut you know people have your green from nova save you a ton of ... it's college and I\nDon't think you're

corner ... deserves it just your great great story and it's told really well has nothing to do with the book\nRight [laughter] there's very little to do with any of the other versions\nOf the ... house that I've ever seen I think I've seen every version they've ever made even the bootleg versions where they slightly changed the title\nA but it was just ... it was great and I was skeptical of it going into it a ... and I wasn't really ready to commit to ten episodes I had a lot of moving stuff to do but it just it's that good so if you're looking for something to be a little bit spooky\nMore in the area of terror than horror\nVery suspenseful the hunting of he'll how so Netflix is a is just one of the rare\nA Netflix series that lives up to all of its billing and everybody I've talked to watch is loved it I'll just tell you that much and I think what's even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with with the original book and perhaps the original British version of the movie\nIs that they they make a point to do a lot of stuff off just slightly off camera was a little bit out of frame\nSo it it there's there's plenty to you know give you a ... and ... but I mean there were some moments there where\nSome of the coolest stuff you can't see and that's what it was like in the first one I remember that as a kid when I went to go see it it was
