what that does is if you turn that money into investing rather than consumption meaning you don't blowout Raymond every month you invested instead than the answer is you know you haven't you haven't

...\nHow much that I Am in a ... the one down and what kind of did is\nUm loan and credit cards I had um a major medical several making medical issues happen mhm and I had this ability and place and the insurance company is fighting the ... the year and a half and he still had to give me my money and I wouldn't be in that situation at him and they gave me my money\nMhm um so I just got a lawyer and um it just write a letter basically right now 'cause I Can't afford the care rarely I found it on it like prepaid legal mhm\n\nAnd so that's the situation a man and it really hard because of all we have had things in place law are you currently disabled and he asked I Am what's the nature of the network which the nature of your disability\nIs a several things going on right now travel medical issues so five allow gay it found out I just had a test on August twenty twenty and and that's how I handled the condition [noise] Mm\nWell so what kind of it is the fifty one doesn't usually credit cards I'm not sure which credit cards\n[noise] um [noise] and um\nThe way\nMost of it as a credit card and a half percent alone so for instance one credit card company is Thirteen thousand ain't the ladder and if I paid twenty five thousand and they would you know I just told me calling them all and the animals the hardship to have a lower how much I\nDon't know what I'm doing good for them lower you don't have the money\nWell not have the income I was thinking but it's still not enough [noise]\nOh well that's part of the picture when what does he make\nAbout twenty eight now and the and that much that he lost his job when I first got hurt mhm I'm an actress\nAre you not Anderson John long receiving disability\nNo I'm a plant down the shore and and to tell me to apply for a permanent disability to state but I'm In and out of work so much they're now going to be really really low and I didn't want to be when I cook it became you know go matter and credit here in in and out in and out of where\nI'm at this point I went to the lawyer so I'm trying to find out he said he came on the economy is really going to have I should go with that and on it I could do with that and\nWhat every team and then they did it their team he didn't know how much they wouldn't want to pay that they want to get in and out of that out\nAnd then I might have to wind up paying I\nMean you know they'll only landmark understand\nGave him Eighteen hundred dollars to file bankruptcy and give them anything oh I don't get anything so you're not paying on these credit cards or these loans today right\nNow not right now on on that and we're so ... where are you\nGoing to be look let's pretend you're just didn't pay those loans for a year and they just sit there the worst cases would suit you're right\nYeah and what are they going to get you don't have anything you don't have an income and you don't have the assets do can do you own something as valuable\nWhile I have yeah I own a home that living at home and I looked at the equity and now I'm at home um I have about eight hours a day and now I Can't sell the house though because if I tried to sell it if I did that algae either go\nMarket yourself and then because they found out and then I get like six seven eight out and now I Am I mean you know I'm Ari how are you all for like one of a like a hundred thousand\nMhm but why can't you sell your home a lot of them in the argument that are again\nWhy can't you know your house\nThen why no doubt that I don't live in one I'm speaking out and about fifty thousand ... why can't you smell it because you have a lot of for it and people are telling them for ... and you are what\nUm Ninety eight\nOkay so sell it and get out much you can out of it and pay somebody will\nSay oh my dad but that\nYeah definitely for you go bankrupt\nYou when you file bankruptcy they don't let you keep investment property with equity and then not pay your bills bankruptcy law works so the Trump bankruptcy trustee will force the sale of that property and it'll be forced to be paid against your bills\nAnd I think you can get enough out of that to go to each one of these and you can probably shuttle fifty thousand in your situation for around thirty five if you negotiate with them but you need the money in your hand to do that and you know what I mean money\nSo this is a way to get those all cleared up and then in the process of course we've got to figure out how to get your income back up and get your household income working again 'cause that's the root cause of all of this\nAnd so long term where are you going to be in two years where are you going to be in a year where are you gonna be in three years which are long term game plan and what are you doing about getting there\nThat's got to be your next steps because you've got to get either disability income coming in um you know if you're the workers' comp if it if you were hurt you said on the job or you or I can tell from what you're saying that which way it was but you know any money that is do you or any money you can create you used to create your future kiddo\nAnd that's what we want you to do we want you to have a future\nAnd and so you start looking out there and the into the future and saying how am I going to take the next step is to get there but as far as filing bankruptcy I don't think that's going to be advantageous to you when you got this much older when you've got this much equity in a property and I think you can clear up the debt by selling it\nSelling it taking the equity using that money that thirty thirty five thousand dollars it's they're forty thousand whatever you\nGet out of it and subtle that fifty one thousand deaths by negotiating with them get that in writing before you send them any money but\nI think you can work your way through this fall by ruptured be one finally there's I'm like you sell the house or your way suppose this hour of the day Ramsey showing the bugs

on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sure\nIt does feel that way um well you know part of it\nMight be as well and one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know how the media is always there they're they're amazed because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information and so from the political realm it when people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports and need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they are being reported like liquor these split hour after hour\nAnd I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like this whole thing about social networking we're you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there\nAnd so it's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere and I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nCan you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me back in July and you're always popping in on New Year's day with us right can you check out you know charge the rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one\nAnd you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you could take a look at the whole month of November by looking at the same midnight in in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nAll be on the air with everybody\nYeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always rising\nAnd the son is in Capricorn at the bottom of the chart because it's midnight and so there you have to feed and all the other plants like for instance midnight New Year's\nComing up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional positive war will go into its own sign actually laid on dissent\nThirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars\nAnd um exercise and engineering and different kind of projects that are more martial but suddenly Saturn at the beginning of year is often you know too many frustrations a lot of blocks coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world\nWhy does it work mark why does astrology war\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets are throwing down raise this is what the old idea\nExactly what and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words\nIf everything depends on something being born in a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb\nIf the village of course still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that history they taking in the first spread like the declaration of independence is usually used to leave America's chart because it was a first\nBreath we're we're saying get sweaty when we're independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that chart but most of them do\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon and the various on if it's not that they're making things happen from outer space\nIt's that whatever is born a person\nA president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time uh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what does that say about the potential\nOf my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers website the new one great bear enterprises

from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month they in near earth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time they get more accurate you are you\nWell look\nI could if somebody said to me I Know when I'm bored ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month staying here I could do anything for that person not as exactly ...\nDo it because timing allows us all kinds of things is sunrise birth is is it your noon his son said is it a midnight we're or the planets falling at that point because in twenty four hours most of the planet are going to be in the ... they're going to be in the same lines but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go\nHalf of the time and so the moon has a lot to do with our instinct or mood even reincarnation and looking back at who we may have been the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has a lot to do with personality the sun is more of a character and kind of the life force\nAnd a connection a little bit more just spirituality but so polarizing find which is fine rise in the east\nThat is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nAnd uh and telling me this march since you've been doing this we have thirty seconds before the break your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done\nEver

this one AM savannah as we bring you news you can use an on memorial wellness Wednesday we give you all sorts of medical advice people like Craig will turn of the certified hands therapist we had a chat about arthritis of the hands\nOf a couple of different types of arthritis that basically it's inflammation of of the joints we hear about arthritis we are talking about a osteoarthritis which is just sort of the mechanical wearing down to the joint surfaces you also have rheumatoid arthritis which is more of a disease process how\nCommon is very common in fact a lot of people will say that if you live long enough you're going to have it you know you put enough wear and tear on your joints and again especially in the hands through the years those joint surfaces they wear down they become a little unstable and it's painful yeah it's it's extremely common\nCars in the hands specifically most common uh the base of the sun and also at the fingertips and we have to make sure the patients understand we're not going to cure their arthritis we can't cure it but we can help them in the symptoms we try and get started on the program and the clinic says that hopefully they can take home with them and continue on home\nSo we like to use them on Delhi's heat\nHe feels really good to to join that er nurse or from osteoarthritis and sometimes we recommend folks\nGet up Harrison bathroom ... some bath and they use at home relatively inexpensive than they can do every single day gentle exercise is making sure we keeps enough the strain their their joints that I I think that probably some people are a little bit that tend to have a little bit more problem with arthritis and others I think that at the first signs that's when it's time to start kind of looking at how\nYou use your body and making sure you avoid activities that sort of ... joins down just a simple ringing out of a lost cause it puts a lot of pressure on your joints in your hands and fingers and you notice something painful when you do it it's a good idea to not do it may be quite so much for quite some ...\nPrevent that from getting worse certified hand therapist critical attorney delivers ... six to

new cars aid supplies are only now just trickling in eight hundred forty four people so far known did\n\nAnd Jordan already back would you hear more Lerner the astrologer with us mark how long would it take someone just study astrology if they wanted to become an astrologer\nWill I\nOkay it took me one year it was kind of like my graduate school where I was twenty two I was studying metaphysics people like Rudolph Steiner George grungy of a a ... ... the Alice Bailey teachings and so on\n'em and I found my mentor Dane Roger who is one of the great astrologers of twenty century and he had studied not just the strategy but philosophy psychology and metaphysics of thought\nSo I read all of his books and kind of memorize everything and the reason which if their students out there\nOf the planet mercury which rules mind thinking communication at the time of his birth and Pisces was exactly at the same spot where mine was and I knew what his chart was and when I started reading this book that you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and off and underrated was on the same spot but anyways I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City\nAnd but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much more than just an astrology charts they ... they have to learn what's called transits of regressions with a plan to keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince since you've been doing this and what was it that got you interested in it and then something happened\nUm I started going medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have\nStudied medicine in college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into ah all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of a psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first day of the first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home\nAnd just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned to before astrology the space age science\nAnd it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people had studied\nA more of astronomy telescopes Galileo and so on\nThey were all astrologers but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault the world went to that phony thing of astrology because they biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand you know why why was the greatest scientist before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nNow how could that possibly be what what's wrong with a guy\nWith what they didn't realize is who was the science it was taught in the University of Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt\nRome greet you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's burned the December\nTwenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay more than one forty two in the afternoon in\nJersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know am I what I'm doing is just for people out there are not putting on my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of get that information pretty quickly\nAnd you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean uh if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell them we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\nYou're\nWelcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah I did that you hope\nTo grade you you're on with mark Lerner of given mark your birth date you know your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say ah of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon and tourists rising and he's born very close to a first quarter moon I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour\nPeople don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an areas moon coming from other lives and like instinctively this individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive\nAnd that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in other lives particularly in the last life and now with the sun and Capricorn kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so it's an extra kind of\nA this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and\nHe should be make sure he's strengthens his immune system and stays healthy\nThat um he doesn't become pessimistic about things um but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this on another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\nA lot you have a question to\nUh yeah what what if I'm not help you now [laughter] well if you're not held on now again you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on another people didn't good on um go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics\nAstrology the power of numbers numerology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you a ... inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I've studied that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people and mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study

really being able to come into the world of north ... time to take advantage of astrological\nVibrations they're to me absolutely in other words the sold the spirit comes in and chooses\nParents and family based on family karma Dharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing when to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI

I've been saying a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are definitely in that camp because then you're going to have once in a lifetime Pluto\nA movement toward your son and the next like year or two and Saturn which rules Capricorn is heading is already in that sign and Saturn will then contact your son and then between two thousand nine to in two thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force kind of linked to higher spirit so what the universe is saying is\nDo some big time study psychology philosophy authors or ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be hard it could be music anything a hobby a craft an activity though that has deep and significant\nSo that you don't get down on yourself are worried we're stressed out and so on that you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo and on the line and called the

passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can move around from like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere in the planet's understand what's good and what isn't a California is\nAnd this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology every state of the union as a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as a son signed Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a tourist son signed tourists\nThat's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where your earth fine in California's earth fine\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you have mercury with Vesta which is one of the four main asteroids that says a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what you know something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that and you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a a moon\nTrying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationary in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lyman to NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously okay in in the

those ten thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars and what stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWow that's quite a pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight bitcoin is a little tricky to buying holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the work\nKevin is bitcoin or currency\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people want to own it\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your IRA talk about that\nGeorge we do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell it for you any proceed you accumulate will be retained tax deferred until you take a distribution\nKevin any of our listeners want to learn more about the bitcoin are re what can they do\nI think is there some wherever with probably four thousand other UFO books\nOr do you covered pretty sensibly Romney yeah\nYeah yeah have you ever seen a youth who Gordon three of them do me much\nOkay well the the first um was in the summer in Nineteen fifty five now I Lived on the Chesapeake Bay the little town of Solomon's Marilyn and uh\nI was when I walked out into the there was a long half mile peer out from the uh belong to the Chesapeake biological laboratory where the protection early meets the Chesapeake Bay\nI was sitting there late at night when I saw a larger light heading toward me that was coming from the mouth of the Chesapeake then I noticed the outline of a large disc shaped object which suddenly dove into the water then rose back into the sky and headed straight for me\nAs it flew over me I saw a bottom panel open and New York post spray me with what I called in the book but tux and shower many row straight up and disappeared and frankly the things scare the hell out of me\nAnd then the second citing occurred on April second Nineteen fifty eight I was returning home from Baltimore because I was a student at the Peabody Conservatory of music\nWhen I saw a large white light harboring over a barn and a few minutes later began blinking on and off and following my car for most of the remaining miles Solomon's oh and\nThen it stopped and whole Harvard over another barn than a minute or so later started to perform some fantastic maneuvers in an instant it appeared in one end of the sky than a split second later it would appear at the other hand\nIt does it did this for about half a dozen or so times\nThen it stopped and then suddenly I saw a brilliant large red light that came out of the sky and merged with the larger light at this point in my car radio admitted allowed screeching Sam as I approached the protection wherever the light cross the river headed headed south and disappeared and then\nUh that same that same year on November twenty of Nineteen fifty eight I was standing outside my father's oyster house that faced tucked river at about five o'clock when I saw a a a red street lights hanging over the river\nAnd there were about Fifteen or the co workers with when we saw three slender shake are shaped objects that we're moving slowly over the river to St Mary's\nCounty on the opposite side that for much larger object to coach seem to come out of nowhere and it dwarfs the other three UFOs as we watched the large out began expanding from both ends once\nAnd it quickly rose up into the sky at an estimated what I estimate of about a twenty thousand feet altitude and it changed to a silvery desk and disappeared tremendous speed and the other obvious followed suit and I had all these reports in the night cap and\nAll like now it's ... their um their existence they're\nNineteen fifty eight we didn't have any aircraft that could do that that's correct\nAnd we sure did\n... did you you some people think that these are demonic and I'm\nDavid Jacobs believes

a\n... a lot of people were what people are demonic themselves you know if that were the case now no I don't believe that I I I I really believe that I Hope the ghost of KO isn't because maybe it doesn't but uh I really believe that we\nHaven't been in contact with them for a even before the um [noise]\nA candidate Arnold case in Nineteen forty seven\nAnd a wave in ... exchanging perhaps even technologies ... ... if you saw the movie independence day you know it may be a little bit of that in there as well\nWhere they have these saucers that may be hidden away at Wright Patterson air force

there was a very good movie called the UFO etched and James Earl Jones and\nI loved that movie yeah I Know it's hard to find these days but uh\nI Love to have a copy of that\nWhat's amazing stuff I argued interview John ... was mentioning Benjamin Simon back in Seventy one uh and I asked him what he thought that the case and he said\nWell let me tell you they're not lying because what happened to them they believe it on our hypnotized them\nBoth separately they told the same story\nSomething happened to them whatever they think happened to them they're telling the truth\nThat's right well you know I was on the Joe Simon's show with John for the first book\nThe interrupted journey writer\nUp there and we just got a matter of fact Simon Oakland the actor who played in so many movies uh uh what is going to vote segment on the show and when John and I started talking with Joe Frank about anybody case it says I've got to be on with these guys I don't\nI don't care about my own segment
