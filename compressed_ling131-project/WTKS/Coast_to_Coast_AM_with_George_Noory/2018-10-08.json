course and it could be the beginning of a series of books you know David every time I meet\nSomeone from China in this country they they love it they love our way of life they love the United states they loved coming over here many of whom would love to stay some of them do dishes government to government because I think people the people nobody wants a war\nWorld War is a disaster for everyone ... ...\nI think the I think everybody realizes that and I think even the ruling elites I'm real lives that war is a disaster but unfortunately preparing for war and skirting war I'm there can be profit on that sometimes\nI think so too are you my father was in World War two my daddy and I remember stories of the war effort David uh-huh that you we literally changed the manufacturing structure in this country\nFrom whatever we were doing before to the war machine to get things for World War two do we have the might end the capability of doing that today\nWow that's that's the real question um the question has enough real infrastructure and the question also as do we need to feel the same kinds of things that we used to build a I remember my mother worked or during World War two\nIn a factory there was converted to make bomber acts are picking may catch aware before but she made bomber acts were fighter planes [noise]\nUm my dad was off at war a but everybody was working in war industry is usually a in factories that were built to build something else well okay so we don't really have that many factories anymore so how do we convert factories where you don't have factories\nThat's the question\nGeneral Dynamics are used to build all kinds of tanks I assume they're still out there doing what they do building tanks they moved out of St Louis their headquarters were in St Louis\nAnd are there are right now they are there in Virginia but I guess there's still a huge tank manufacture I just don't know if they build them in this country anymore\nWell I mean my my information about taxes not up to date about ten years ago\nI understood that we could not cast tank Kirk from this country anymore we had to buy all the Kurds in Israel ship them over and then work on them here I'm not sure that's still true today but ah definitely our infrastructure has atrophied terribly\nSo as we look at these possibilities these strong possibilities of another war this time was China I'm over ... all the nations that are out there that we've had tensions with North Korea Iran Russia China\nDo you think it's China that has the strongest possibility of of us going to war with\n[noise] um I Would say that right now it's probably the highest on my personal list at the same time I don't think we'll go to war with it has one single nation I think it'll be blocks of nation stressors has been in every major war in the past\nIt might work a it's a lineup of North Korea China Iran\nPakistan and Myanmar um and\nA lot of the nation as our in China's orbit already or the United states as Japan on its side South Korea the Philippines well the Philippines are kind of ... at the moment in this book a and oddly enough a Vietnam is firmly in the United states camp\n[noise] what would the United nations do with anything\nI don't really have them as a major player\nNo no I I there's a weakness there in a now China when you look at manpower far outnumber us we we can't put together the kind of just you know foot soldier military the ... that they have\nNowhere to be pretty crazy to try to find another land or in Asia they they pretty much part of to expand the spill and Korea Nineteen fifty three\nAnd a and a and their their capabilities of increased tenfold shows that\nThere is also willpower the guts to want to do something like this with the American people support another more if it didn't hit the homeland here it didn't hit the country\nWell that's a good question um we've supported a war in the middle east for how many years now\nAnd half the country um it's we're\nAlmost immune to that is in a sad way\nWell you know war if not war like it used to be a well there's like wars on the periphery of empire sort of like the Roman empire you Star Wars all the time at the periphery of empire that were and they they were bought by legionnaires but really the people of Rome didn't have much to do with that\nShow would there be a strategic area that the war would break out in the end be contained in that is not in China not in the United states but it would be someplace else\nWell I see a horizontal escalation has the danger let's say that we're talking about the same Kaku this earlier let's say that war breaks out around the same cockatoos around Taiwan\nUm the temptation for both sides as horizontal escalation and I know you know what that means but I can elaborate on that for audience please that\nMeans both sides would want if there's a stalemate in the central theater for they will start a an offensive in another theater of war in order to occupy the enemy elsewhere for example the Chinese could go the north Koreans to attack across the DMZ\nOr they could also attack India they could attack Vietnam and other words they could attack our allies or countries that might be our allies all around their periphery that\nWould be horizontal escalating and that's a possibility\nThat what we would be doing at the same time of course is clamping a blockade on I have the envy and um the Indian Navy as one of our allies and we could completely cut off all of China's our energy supplies most of which come through the south China Sea if\nWe cut off their energy supplies they either have to find their own supplies\nOr they have to build a pipeline to Central Asia or they have to do without\nWell and that's what concerns me too because when you uh paint a tiger into a corner it's going to come lashing out at you and what did not do it with nukes\nWell I think first they would do it with conventional armies because that's where their main superiority live we have escalation dominance\nAnd you know what that means but I'll explain that a little bit that means that we have the more bigger nuclear weapons or the Chinese to throw it would not be because their best advantage to say OK let's start loving mood cook the United states because we've got more and better and it wouldn't be very ... them to do that\nHowever they can start land fanfare was that we can't we can't respond to\nNo not at all\nYou know let's say they um they unleash the Chinese army on the east coast of South Korea at the same time the north Koreans attack um what would we do could we reinforce are very small contingent of us troops in South Korea what would happen would just lose them\nWhat do we have thirty five thousand people there\nUm your guess is probably about right I Would say\nLet's take some calls and go to Jacksonville, Florida the get things started Greg you are on the air with us go ahead Greg\nMorning gentleman I Greg and look at all costs\nThe United states there are more Chinese restaurants hey gals that any other type in the ah you know food prices around ... and I think a lot of them will probably stay low China so I think there is a small Chinese army already in United States\nAnd in one restaurant I was looking around and looked to me like I could see three of the new Chinese well up weapons back here you can't get them in the United states so I Know they're here\nThe thing I gotta say people is a be ready yet are against the UN is I think there is a small Chinese sport's already in the United states and when they got the word they would come out are you guys have a good day\nWell there's always that possibility I guess David that a a Maureen nation would infiltrate a much because wars is different these days I mean we see what ISIS is doing\nOh Jacque from space him in Jacksonville met my wife in Jacksonville I Am great town great memories of Jacksonville green navy town\nThat we have the same concerns about the German restaurants in World War one Japanese uh farmers in Hawaii and World War two there were very few are traders as I recall historically but there were some\nBut they have no claim to these Ireland and difficult for us to say you guys are not complying with the law to see what\nWe haven't signed the law to see right\nWe need to find that because if we're going to enforce the law we need to be party so I can understand their reluctance to find some un agreements but I think this one would be in our after\nThat's a

I have an extra\nFondness for China because my sixth grade teacher named Asher lived in China with her husband her husband her husband was an admiral stationed in China for a lot of years\nSo I learned a lot about China and the sixth grade [noise] um I learned that she had a great fondness for the Chinese people mhm we need to distinguish between the Chinese people and then the government the rules are dominated\nSyria we talked about that\nThere's another there's another type of power this program is about power but there was a there was another type of power that\nA candidate can win the day and that's the power of love Oh absolutely what it'll just talked about uh go ahead David\nIf it's if it's surreal saying oh yeah I think the power of the power of love can overcome and I hope nothing that I said here remains or is taken that I don't wish Wilder China or\nTo the Chinese people or that I don't wish for peace because I really do and I hope that my book is taken as a warning dislike um other writers who've written about possible wars they rode they wrote about them as a says warnings and I hope that's the way mine is taking\nYeah I mean there's no question nobody wants war nobody wants or what could be looming there let's go to St Paul Minnesota hello Kevin let's squeeze you in that time for a few more callers go ahead\nYou guys thank you very much it's very interesting I'm kind of a almost fifty backing on the last caller I I don't see any practical reason the United states or China would want to go to war with\nOne another you know they're our biggest supplier and what were their very best customer and they own a boatload of art that I just can't see that it would be\nBeneficial for either one of us I can see them trying to as you guys have said take control of their a region\nAnd the thing that worries me just like the last caller sort of implied is if there's a certain group of people and the Chinese government and our own government who see a few hundred million dead people as not that big of a deal and\nA winnable situation and I think um I think that's where the danger of or he would come in\n[noise] okay let me I think that's with two part question and I'll ... first ... have you heard of a book called the great illusion [noise]\nIt was written just before World War one and it's given was that because there was so much trade between Germany and Great Britain and because the people were so friendly it was impossible for their ever could be a war between Germany and Great Britain\nAnd that was published just before World War one I don't think that the fact that there is a a lot of trade means that war cannot occur uh the second part of your question I think you're going to have to rephrase because I forgot what it was\nYeah I I think I think what your answer brings up really the the issue which is that there's a certain sector\nOf people in our own government and probably in the Chinese government probably in the Russian government as well really don't regard\nOf the welfare of the average person in their country as being the paramount importance or who they they see vying for power ...\nAnd uh their own you know their own glory as excusable or taking entire countries to war and killing hundreds of millions of people and you know that that's just a little bit of a clip from the accounting ... it's not to be worried about\nI I think you're talking about the military industrial complex in federal or President Eisenhower once route\nAnd ah of the question is you know who put these people in power and I think the ultimate answer is we did and if a if we're going to acquiesce in what they do have if we don't like it or we need to remove them\nI think one reason why it appears that Donald Trump is so a popular right now even is that he is so off the beaten path um like mainstream America you you spent up with everything he touches a nerve this you're going to be an interesting election\nOh yeah well you know Trump or listen to a few times and the guy speaks his mind and that really like you say that touches a nerve and it's kind of refreshing in a way I'm not one of is a big supporter of but it's refreshing to see somebody speak his mind and even if you disagree with what he says\nHe claims that he loves the Chinese and he knows how to negotiate with them I Hope he's right\nWell you know you sit down with a with somebody like that and are you may come away feeling like you got the better part of the deal and\nYou may find out who your ... your debt you didn't exactly because they're\nThinking you know somebody like Trump is used to thinking for the next quarter to show a profit attorneys are used to thinking two generations down the road yeah\nThat's right they've always done that David we're on a time have yourself a great Christmas you and your family in a thank you captain for everything you've done\nLike Georgia becka all your listeners\nDavid ... the name of the

[noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\nSunday October seventh what's new today on the three hour radio I hardly over\nTim Barkley is that hypnotists de certified in quantum healing\nHypnosis therapies also certified in what it's called the accelerated resolution therapy we'll talk about that which of course as the eye movements thirty therapy timbers created the the state therapy\nAnd it's a therapeutic and spiritual breakthrough he has ten years of experience in this conducted thousands of sessions helping people eliminate\nEmotional habitual and physical disorders as well and here he is on the coast to coast I'm looking forward to this Tim welcome to the show\nHave you so much George it's good to be here\nHow what got you involved in the hypnotism\n[noise] well my father actually was a pretty overweight and unfortunately he passed away a due to a second a heart attack that in Nineteen eighty five and that kind of prompted me to walk to put together like I'm kind of a product\nThat would help people lose weight you know and get their health back mhm what I did is I have this idea to put together\nLike a weight loss product based on a little messaging and hypnosis huh and a friend of mine said well you know if you're going to do that you should really become certified and hypnosis you know to add some credence to cheer product that's right\nThat's a you know I thought that was a good idea so that's what I did I went out and I are I research we all the best schools around the country\nAnd I went through a lot of those schools and I tell you why walks I learned that I was just blown away I was so I I literally through eight hundred copies of that program in the garbage and I started to practice and uh that's what I've been doing ever since\nWhen people knew Shirley went to you Tim as a certified hypnotists would they you know doing it for a way to smoking and anxiety and all these other things\nOver yeah ah it's it's you know emotional problems like a you know like self esteem or post traumatic stress here's you know could be simple fears like I I Can't cross the British out in the United states\nA depression anxiety things like that and then also habitual types of things like alcoholism and the abuse I kind of place weight loss into that category as well\nAnd then um a lot of physical types of things\nLike ah in especially ones that that are syndromes like fibromyalgia\nChronic fatigue honorable bottles restless leg syndrome or\nPeople ... people mentioned that were syndrome\nWhat that really is it's like when you go to the doctor and they check you out you know they do blood work they do X rays MRIs and if they come up with nothing\nThat's why they created this word civil girl because they want to give you some kind of diagnosis you know so you can go back to your family and the people at work and you can say well you know I Do have you know your ... syndrome\nYet they can't really find anything at all inside your body so I'm\nUsing hypnosis you can clear those away really very quickly others in many many times\nI've worked with people that have had like let's say fibromyalgia and fibromyalgia as like pain points in the body also usually people that I have that they also have chronic fatigue or they have a really hard time you know functioning throughout the day 'cause they have like no energy\nAnd get 'em you know using hypnosis I've worked with people that have have that for like you know Twenty years Thirty years and their life is really pretty difficult in within even as short as one session but oh it's gone\nThat is it is I mean I've always heard Tim that people who can't people can't be told what to do if they don't want to do it under hypnosis but is is that true or can you really you know if somebody doesn't want to lose weight hypnosis might not help him is that true\nWell regular hypnosis um yeah you really can't control people uh you know like if you ... where women or whatever he says hypnosis is pushing that thinking conscious mind to the side\nAnd then speaking or directly with the subconscious mind in regular hypnosis the thinking analytical conscious minds it's still there so like if you know I put you into hypnosis\nAnd let's say you're a Democrat and I'm going to try to make you a Republican or per se or I could do this big case you know and then when we're done and I urge you you're you're really not going to switch over because the conscious mind is still there\nHowever this new type of hypnosis\nThat I created it's called the the state there the that's what I call it a its roots are based on something called sleep hypnosis for what that really is and we can talk about a little them a little later 'cause it sure is\nReally a um a breakthrough to be honest with you what it is it's guiding that thinking analytical conscious mind blower Italy away I mean it's gone so it's sleeping them or you can do is talk\nExactly what the subconscious mind and your client is actually talking to you while they're sleeping now in that state honestly it is possible to control the ball\nWhat a ... I'm Sorry what's\nThat ... that's a breakthrough that to be able to help them do that\n[noise] yeah actually the roots of that go back to the Nineteen fifties a there is a very famous hypnotists his name was Dave element and what he did his his son had I was asthma where it was a breathing disorder\nWhat he did is he snuck into his son's room while his son was sleeping and he could see the hand of his out you know his son's hand and he went in there and very quietly he said this is dead you can hear me but\nYou can't wake up Mrs dead you can hear me\nBut you can't wake up and we kept repeating that very quietly and then he said when you can hear me raise your index finger and after a couple of minutes his son's index finger pointing it went out\nSo what he did he conducted a full blown hypnosis session going after this breathing problems and he did that a couple of nights in a row\nLo and behold his son's breathing problem disappeared also his son had no idea that he had done that\nSo he started doing that in his practice um in some other people have tried to do that through the years unfortunately it's like really really difficult to get somebody into that state and I've spent the last\n... I mean I'm Talking solid three years working on this and I'm I've developed a in a way where it's actually pretty easy and I get you know nine out of ten people into that state\nThat's amazing when they're that thinking conscious mind is sleeping it's not there at all so when a person is in that state you actually um you know could make them a Democrat or Republican\nOr something like what you say\nThat's the secret that's the secret that's what we need to do to all of them change him\nYeah exactly like like conducting a weight loss sessions I don't know if you've ever heard of this it was a pretty big deal about six or seven years ago I had something called a virtual gastric bands\nSo like a a regular person can go you know to the doctor they can go through surgery and they can get you know their stomach fitted with a\nBand we're right on their clothes off the stomach\nAlmost like these little ... smaller or something like that\n... exactly exactly so so that person now instead of the stomach thing really large it's the size of like like a like a golf ball it's really small and they get fall very quickly therefore they lose a lot of weight off well\nYou can do that with hypnosis or even regular hypnosis but with this new way the south Asia state way or sleep hypnosis way\nWhat you say is fact so you put somebody into that state\nAnd you basically build the story up saying hey you know what your stomach is the size of a golf ball\nYou just simply cannot eat more than five bites the food in what's cool about it is then you can tell them how happy they are to do it because uh George I'm telling you through the years I probably had at least\nI also always have the spirit guide to like a body scan\nNow do you communicate with Tim do you communicate with the spirit guide to the person who's been hypnotized\n[noise] yeah that's the way it works um I I basically that spirit used the voice of the person\nThen hit while while you're talking to that spirit guide yeah that was amazing oh\nI'm I guess technically that's called channeling your channeling that spirit and they're talking through the eyes of the person in hip now\nHow do you know that when you're doing this because I'm looking at the hip to entice person almost like a ... G board how do you know that that spirit that's coming through is legit and not some demon for example trying to trick you\nYeah good point when I was always do\nPrefer aren't getting them to traveling any spirit is wasted a protection so like I actually set up protection before the session\nAnd then into session before we get to that point um they're they're still techniques that you can do to ...

I actually not too long ago worked with a high school student who had an altercation at school and for some reason I couldn't remember the details of that\nOkay and and why why would they want you to hypnotize person to pull out the details the police or the parents who who wanted that done\nYeah actually actually the child wanted that done really okay yeah that I worked with but\nUm or or I was once in a while to get someone that like they lost something mhm occurring are there and watch or something and uh you can trace reach trace their steps\nYou know what's really call is your self conscious remembers have raised I Am retired I'm yeah like I\nCan regress people back to the womb you know and and they they they share people talking in the room um their own for obviously past lives\nI'm convinced him if you're at in a band speaking before two hundred people\nAnd you look out over the crowd your physical mind you're not going to remember a lot of people but your subconscious literally takes have photographic picture of that entire room and it's in there you just need to pull it out but it would recollect everybody who's in that room\nYeah exactly you know I've worked with a couple of people that have had multiple strokes and their short term memory which is in the conscious mind was horrible I mean they couldn't remember what what they did an hour ago and\nThen you put them in hypnosis and they can remember absolutely everything\nSo that's really or is that you know your subconscious mind is really really powerful and your conscious mind is kind of Mr stupid that's really kind of what did acquaintance too and um\nYou know the the the hypnotic state what you can do with it is so powerful I I really do believe as as time progressive um especially with\nWe know says there's so many applications for it\nYou know I'm you know like if if someone gets cancer instead of going in for chemotherapy first\nGuess what you should pull out your spirit

duty to make things good for you\nIt is what they do is they're talking to you all the time\nMost people are ignoring now so what they'll them do the ramped it up and moving in to the body so you might like some kind of physical disorder and then if you ignore that then they ramp that at all and it gets worse and worse\nOr it might go to the point where you died I mean the ... and their perspective is different than ours because\nThey're on the other side of life and well there really is no doubt or we're just here down here you know down here on earth school to learn a lesson that's why we're here so um they're trying to get your attention and what's interesting is when you talk to spirit guide\nUm I always ask them a couple of questions to see what the heck's going on I'm like let's say let's say somebody don't care answer\nAll right so I'll ask them out they\nAre they sign up for this is this in their life ... you know like before they came here did they say hey I Would like to experience cancer\nWho would say that though to me what's there who would want to say that\nWell you have to think of it from the perspective of us here because you're coming down here to start with\nSo working through cancer or something that's really difficult you're it's it's a left and it's a learning so you might you might sign up for that you might sign up for a couple of horrible air you know you sign up for stuff\nSo I'll ask them if they sign up for it and they might say no\nAnd then I'll ask them if anything to do what harm no karma is\nHey that yeah I Know yeah so so do they have to pay back anything because it has anything to do with carbon\nWe've heard that phrase or we can't repeat on the radio yeah\nYeah so they might say yes or no and then I asked is this related choice past life\nAnd um oh I don't know maybe thirty forty percent of the time and then all of that well we need to go there and and look at anything and if they say yeah then we will then I'll take them back into the past flight into a specific\nTeam that has everything to do with today's problem um or a lotta times they'll say yeah it has something to do with the past why\nAnd then I'll say well does this person to hang on to that any longer and they'll say no and then I said well do you think you could go ahead and break that for them now and mostly most of the time they'll just say we've already done that we just did that\nOrange stay with us Tim we're gonna come back and take some phone calls and talk more about ... if you've been hypnotized definitely check in with

can't\nGo ahead\nYeah sure um yeah basically\nI'm your spirit guys actually love you they're not really trying to hurt you or anything but they are trying to get your attention so in order to get connected with them the best way\nYou could meditate um but just you know maybe once a day or once in awhile quieter mind\nAnd just see what pops up because they were very very very quickly there vibration of state is way faster than ours so what you want to do is pay attention to those trade off\nAnd also like maybe you're walking outside\nAnd something happens maybe like a butterfly like flies in front of you were some some kind of animal or some kind of song comes on the radio and it's like oh well that's interesting\nThose are the ways that they communicate with you and if you if you learn to pay attention to that then it's it's like trusting your intuition\nIt's not like they're going to come down and say\nYou know you need to do with the\nYou know it's not bad direct that's not the way it works or they also come to you in dream\nSo if you wake up and you and it's like oh that was kind of a funny and dream kind of kind of think about what it was how does it relate to your life and your began to get those messages coming through\n'em and the other the other question you had about about demons ... they're going to get you\nWell I'm I'll be honest with you demons searches energy is like you and I I've actually got rid of a whole bunch of those off of people and um\nThe way I Do that it's it's kind of interesting I tell them to look inside themselves and take a close look at themselves and once they always noticed there was a speck of life\nAnd then I say just keep focusing on that light all you have to do is recognize that they don't wait about ten seconds and the light basically begins to enveloped them\nAnd after it takes like two minutes so I mean it's real quick and all of a sudden they go from being like this nasty demonic I'm going to hurt you kind of\nTo being like the the most friendly person you could ever talk to just just fat queer seriously so\nLike when you watch those go shows and you know you get a priest in the house and they're

helping that energy you know there are still operating under a bunch of lives really and\nIt's so easy to change him into a nice city it's so simple they just have to recognize what they're really

so forth\nThe confusion gets even worse when um the vaccine last year was only thirty four percent effective\nAnd now they've come out with a Lebanon flu vaccines on the market\nAnd the CDC has picked up the shop\nGun and fired a way way too many hey use any one of these vaccines I don't like that do you\nOh no not at all because your drugstore may be offering a vaccine would should be the cheapest one they can get a hold of that is true\nThere is no ... no one vaccine for everybody the nasal spray is back again after being denied for two years by the CDC and my confusion and it's you know as a doctor is I have to tell my patrons the risks and let them\nDecide because I'm I'm not a you know I Can't push this the like this but you know the Cleveland Browns one today and maybe I'll get a shot and get lucky\nYou never know thanks Gary Dr John Curtis online columnist dot com is back with us from his reaction on the Brett Kavanaugh's appointments go ahead John\nWell you know you know the most interesting thing about this is how the Democrats pushed and pushed and finally played perpetually or to\nYou know for an FBI probe but guess what George have there been no FBI probe Susan Collins probably would have voted now and so it's like right so the Democrats kind of a you know have this one on their own had even though Cory Booker today it's calling for the impeachment of cabinet\nAnd they're now they're calling for that you give the guy a chance now that he's in for crying out\nLoud yeah I mean you know but again he's he's he's\nPreaching to the choir in Iowa you know as a potential uh twenty twenty presidential candidate but I think one of the things that they tried to turn this into war\nWe want to really investigate is drinking behavior in high school and in college and this is where they think they have an ... an impeachable offense where nobody interested\nIn his drinking behavior they were making an allegation of sexual assault if there was no corroborating evidence even among the witness she named\nBen this is over and Susan calling gauge very uh it was and comprehensive explanation of why she voted for him because of the presumptive the presumption of innocence and our constitution gr innocent until proven guilty they have no proof\nWhen will this pass John\n[noise] no it won't ... this particular issue or house but the bitterness and the rancor between the two party system will not pass you know looking at\nA government that is at loggerheads there's almost nothing on which that can agree and I think that we we really have to begin to rethink the two party system or certainly watching it grind to a halt like this and he uh watching you know Democrats and Republicans at each other's throats\nOr and my friend John Curtis online

with him about time warps in UFOs and you will you stumbled into a time warp for several months ago did you\nI did in fact I broke this story on coast to coast am shooting them but before I even did it [laughter] and I know that that that\nSounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology I'm going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said where of course that place turned out to be ...\nLas Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in\nA the defense of earth against other earthlings\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them\nThat are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would have destroyed is already\nIf you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country\nThen why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do with ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nYou need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving them to be safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah I'll I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are beings out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but on you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a a logical point of view\nWhat if George ... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien\nA theorists talk about [noise]\nAbout this kind of thing many times on the History Channel um if they they come back and they want to enslave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever if their goal is to come back here and in slave us it might be a better fate for\nUs to commit global suicide\nIn other words and again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments\nActually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back and put you know collars on us and and work like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and going back to Ronald Reagan\nI'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might have been before the un said what if there was an alien threat [laughter] you know\nWhat did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to raw as well and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who go snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep\nI mean there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially\nA some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some ah beings that we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do\nAnd so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps present thing that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them a few little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings have run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah thank you it's it's this Saturday it's October the thirteenth this is going to be my final wishing

seven double duty chaos\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast George ... what's your I'm going to give you a little Halloween trivia here Halloween is an annual holiday ... celebrated each year on October thirty first it originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Saddam Hussein when people would light bonfires and work costumes to ward off ghosts\nAnd the evening before was known as all Hallows eve and then later Halloween is an interesting Josh [noise] yeah\nIt absolutely is I mean that it goes back thousands of years and um I I think Fallon was the original pronunciation and they would talk about this being a period of time when of course they were you know reaping the rewards of service but for parents\nBefore the cold dead months of winter and so they believe that as the world was sort of transitioning\nInto the cold dead time that there was a period where the the bill was so thin in fact the Europeans often talk about what they call thin places the boundary was so thin between where we are and where the spirits are that we could encounter each other\nFor at least one or two nights and ... and interact with each other and the good part was well some of your loved ones might come through but then they're also all of these creepy evil beings to come through and so you'd you'd wear a mask\nSo do you blend in with the evil ones and they'd be like oh you're one of us you know and and they they wouldn't harm you but from a more um I I think updated point of view George this also happens to be the time of year when\nA here in our part of the world the earth is shifting away from the sun and so uh that means not only does it get colder and darker as we built in to that mysterious back a black void of space\nBut further more are we are not being as a strongly bombarded\nBy the the radiation coming from the sun\nAnd therefore subtle things that might otherwise have been sort of drowned out in the noise of the sons radiation could pop a little more so for example let's say a eyes shine a flashlight at towards you outside on a bright sunny day\nWell you're not going to notice that as much as you would if I did it on a dark night right and so what happens in general\nIs still there but it's still there it's still there but it's just not as prominent and noticeable so this\nIs the time of year when we shift away from the sun and a lot of these subtle energies electromagnetic electro static and otherwise that are associated with these spirits another paranormal entities are suddenly more distinctive\nAnd a play more of a significant role in in our awareness and of course we're we're also in Hampton this because\nWe're we're paying more attention and we're looking out for more\nLet's take some calls here with Josh as we continue chatting I Want to ask you about Robert ... to ... in a moment\nGo to Charles first time caller in Asheville North Carolina hey Charles\nGo ahead you're with us no\nHe's not let's get John in Virginia Beach Virginia try John go ahead\nGeorge Guy but I Want to tell a story that happy they like in the nineties\nNow I I never believed in ... spirits UFOs eighties and things of that ... however that Nineteen I'm leaders Middle East I had an uncle had passed away and they were having a memorial service when the church\nAnd I wasn't that close to him but I just said you know anyway I ah I went I was late getting have so I had to sit in the black church was packed and services going on and all of a sudden I\nFelt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the ... to check and I looked up\nAnd it was my uncle had just passed away and and he\nTold me he said John ... your car and I was shocked at it and what to do it again you said John don't value car when\nI was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up late and what he was gone but\nStill I was a new assembly and so I got her at home with a friend of mine and the next morning\nI called my cousin which was the son and it has to wait and ask him if he wouldn't mind bringing my collectively and I get invited back home he shouldn't matter though so he and his girlfriend got my car and the kids learn the full ... anyway he a guy in my car when they pull that that ...\n... and they were hit by a truck and they they weren't killed but they were extremely you know you're a threat I mean they had ... votes and but I never told me like this or that was really a lot to say anything that is what it till\nTwo of my close friends and um I don't let it way than not that I was sure they have the I guess you know up until now I hadn't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the car\nYou know well I didn't want to do that and he told me down and\nWhat you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no that was the idea\nThat they would be and you get my car like they were ... they weren't killed but that was the only time I have a ... like a safe ... you get all the same thing as for CNN\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in more than you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks among us right now who are uh you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future are all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like the song by the police\nAnd so when you are a spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presidents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm that person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see the future to a degree that you cannot\nOr it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle\nAh they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms\nThat are coming that the aunt can't see that there is more sensitive to what's happening I'm On a lower level so anyway all that said your relatives your friends your loved ones who Passover\nMight definitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this a case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Roberts onto dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point live like a king and and and this is very funny because he still does ...\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there\nThey were taking them out and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations on him\nAnd it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this guy here and you know\nRobert was winding back\nYeah and it's because of that\nAt um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how\nYou have to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace\nAnd I think it's in part\nThanks to people like you George you know you inspired me and gave me the opportunity to go down there to Key West and almost ten years ago and to do live reports and to really dig into\nAnd uh that's all they need to do when will they get notified Josh\nWhat you need to do is go to my website Joshua pie Warren dot com and I and sign up for my free a newsletter I'm going to end a newsletter out

shedding staff pitching stopped\nSince two thousand one we've held more than a quarter million dogs get over the nutritional deficiency misery and saved our customers zillions ...\nI how you doing okay go ahead\n[noise] right so I I just got off work at eleven thirty ... and I was in the ... and the Katie hospital logged in\nAnd I'm cleaning and I'm often it's called the ... you know where the ... people come they do that to this and all of a sudden I say this little nine year old boy I Would say\nMaybe ten alec home I couldn't seem directly straight you know the south Korean I perfectly and\nAnd I start 'em off and they continue mop like okay this kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering it seems like since I've been working there for about a month like he think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit to\nReally show theirselves and he wasn't supposed to be there was he\nI I don't think so I talked to see in a in a couple of the nurses and they told me that they everyone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people they feel like someone watching them and I was just wondering might huh Josh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me is October\n'cause it's not a full moon because of the full moon I can tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHow do you know a little boy died there\nYou know I I asked them and they sent from what we understand no owned died there but they said we don't know a full history\nHe tossed where do you think Josh\nWe'll call thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to when I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being magnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again and are part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder drier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet and touched the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating luminous life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro steady charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm\nAnd that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible field around that that creates a physical effect\nBut then the third and final point of course is that this time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together\nCertainly it means that it again at least here in the United states this is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something ghostly spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nAnd just don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people who've always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody is becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat ah I every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent in North Carolina then there are in Scotland and uh we should remember that the very first attempt\nAt an English Settlement was in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Roanoke Island and they all\nVanished so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mysteries the ah last calling me and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating Fallon and Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited it I'm sure contributed to the fact that uh I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your then again one more time\nOr I go to Joshua pie Warren dot com has no period after the beep Joshua ... dot com\nThis

supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard\nTalking about some haunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much thanks for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that way\nOn Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up yeah\nThank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't\nInterested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned ah I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter and uh every Halloween I Would try to write a\nOf a feature story a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or didn't Halloween cut into your birthday when you're you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday ex financial I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it I get off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell I after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already a and that people have compiled\nA numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area\nOf ah of ghost stories in the supernatural so I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and\nAnd sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple ghost stories with\nYou know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a haunted World War two uh it turned into be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and the vents from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to regular kind\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know most\nOf the stories that I wrote about before a university goes stories haunted rock and roll ghost stories of country music there was there sort of a light hearted aspect\nOf those stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower um and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of\nAnd World War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities\nSo there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know uh all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research haunted World War two was that um [noise]\nYou know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think go stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect in the history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nA you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops enormous during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went to the little big corn oh we're accustomed to less than was\nAnd you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg Reno was haunted right I'm sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting visit because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why\nBattlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're essentially two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists and they said that this in in one case\nHe's a they say that this violence and trauma of war ah causes these um\nAlmost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some a theorist and also say that you know the shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plant to the next that's\nThat's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal uh activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so hard and\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most ...\nI think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories\nAre especially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourists are documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications are seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found to a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of French for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy beaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker and when\nThe daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she saw these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff\nImmediately recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she ... he tried to keep that\nAway from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what could have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences\nIn Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and his name's Tom ... and he told me that uh he investigated the art dance battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany a and a site of the battle of the bulge\nMy parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they\nWere starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy a naked found a winner overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Erie\nThat watch it with my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any\nAny story similar and sure enough it's a it's not that happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handles hundreds on we're going to come back and talk more about how to World War two next hour

I didn't want to leave our our sailors\nOut no nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside\nWell yeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so the interesting thing about uh\nAfter World War two was you had these battleships you had ... or aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that ah the sailor served in that it was a shame to just got all them or to reduce them to scrap\nIt luckily for us a lot of\nPeople got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports they brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and\nAnd some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the one sitcom shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing the shadow creature around the uh the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship based a haunted sites\nAre there there is a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who are wanders around the deck some of the battle ship USS North Carolina\nI worked with um a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there um and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those ah and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah there are a lot of World War\nTwo ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved um and have him back here ghosts and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seemed to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy mhm for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\n[noise] yeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element\nOf uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but uh when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of of country these tragedies\nJust seem to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a\nInteraction between consciousness of reality or maybe they were just so primed um to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spiritual anger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew Swain we're gonna take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of your haunted rock and roll stories those are those are fantastic too\nI Love them that's one of my favorites\nAnd they just keep coming more and more and more they just never stopped like you know people like Michael Jackson who passed on now when prince and folks like that have they come back you up to a ... as a ghost\n... well there are definitely go stories about Michael Jackson uh there were a few a video anomalies\nWhen a when I Believe his brother I Believe it might have been germane was being interviewed people said they saw Michael Jackson walk up behind him there are stories from a neighbor's of a former home owned by Michael Jackson who claim to hear music coming out of it at odd times\nWhen there shouldn't be anybody at home so that definitely a\nMichael Jackson coasts have been seen\nThere are starting right now a lot more good stories

the dealt with that\nYou know I did and I I came away with a little bit of a different perspective about Hitler in the cold or you know initially I thought that Hitler was a a cult practitioner throughout his life\nBut what I found through my research and this is pretty controversial when I'm sure they're all people have have different ideas and I'd be glad to entertain those thoughts too but it sounds like Hitler's early\nA philosophy was influenced by\nA coal groups like the full society in the real society very prevalent\nIn a pre World War two Germany in that area but what I think happened was that Hitler was of all things are not in a coal theorists but more of an incredible sociopathic nurse assistant I don't think he could think\nThat there was any type of power a worthy of him I think he thought he was the ultimate power and that the state was the ultimate power\nAnd so what you see later is that a Hitler begin to purge a lot of it is a coat groups he starts to go after fortune tellers and astrologers so I came away with a little bit\nOf a different opinion on the cold in in Nazi Germany uh likewise I was sort of fascinated that the coal played a much bigger role in
