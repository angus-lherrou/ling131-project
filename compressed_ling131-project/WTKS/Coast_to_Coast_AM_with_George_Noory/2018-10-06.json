{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "Right okay so if you came a\nYou know you'd be in about a five year plan if you were a little under two hundred thousand right thirty six thousand divided into two hundred thousand right rather than it would be um six years roughly if you do the full two hundred a little over two hundred but\nSomewhere between one fifty in two hundred you could do it and about five years not counting getting raises and not counting saving even more that's the most I Would want to go\nOkay I don't want to wait much more than five years or to buy and I don't want to wait much more than five years\nOut of your retirement system so I mean whatever you're going to do I would try to do it in under that um but then so the point is you're sitting with a paid for property no payment in the world at that point right and you're making really good money and you're thirty something thirty one thirty two years old\nRight and so can you can you become a multi millionaire doing that absolutely you can\nOkay is that what you just pay yourself a house payment from age thirty to age sixty you'd be a multi millionaire\nRight okay okay great so we'll we'll go ahead and get what you ... if we did you think you'd be might be a good idea to get maybe I tend to retirement and say maybe a little bit less\nIt's up to you if you're going to go longer than five years I'm starting to get pretty nervous about it okay okay if you're going to be under five years and you want to do zero in your case you're still going to be very young and without our house payment when you pay cash for this house\nRight thirty one years old is very young was zero house payment you and you got the income for the rest of your life to build wealth with I mean if you will just keep paying attention again by yourself or house payment plus or minus a little you can be a multi millionaire\nOkay great aid you sound like they like create your life\nVery well done good job you're thinking Deborah is with us from Tampa, Florida Hi Deborah how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call I'm sure what's up\nWell I'm I Am working on that you know a a financial peace university and I have paid off forty thousand dollars in twelve month good for you and yes and I'm Down to just whining get\nWhich is a hospital bill that we've been paying for many years now mhm ah with very small payments mhm and uh it's been offended collection and we've been looking at our credit report just making sure that all these deaths have fallen off\nAnd um it it turns out that hospital bill has fallen off of our credit report\nAnd because of that my husband in a ... with the idea of just not adding that to the debt no ball and just continuing that men on payments or even not paying it at all and that scares me to death but I wanted to know from you what are the implications of doing something like that\nWhere there's two problems whether one is you actually owed them money so you should pay it\nYeah that's one problem the second problem is is that it's going to come back to haunt you just because they're not reporting it today doesn't mean they're not going to take an active outstanding account and reported that any time\nAnd so right what happened what's happened is is the collection a agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with is just not downloaded their files to credit bureau but they could do that at any time and then you've got a bad mark not just a mark what a bad mark because this is a defaulted this is a bad bill\nIt's not a current bill because they didn't offer you pay much at the start they only offered you payments because you couldn't pay them\nRight and you owe them the money and so ah how much is the bill\nI it's less than seven thousand at that point\nOkay what I Would do is continue to pay them I Would continue to pay them the minimum wage and I would build up a you know a lump sum up three or four thousand\nAnd offer them that a settlement and let's get it settled in full and get it in writing okay but in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees and late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore it because it's currently not showing up on your credit bureau is on was because it will end up showing up again\nAnd on top of that you owe the bill so clear the bail move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHello thank you for taking my phone call sure what I have I have a question I Am Seventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment options for tax shelter anybody [noise]\nUh and I wanted to know what would be something like the best option I when I took her a annuity out my thinking was take a lifetime monthly benefit and so then when I went to I ask about it they gave me a several other options and\nI'm going to the other options for to take effect\nAnd the monthly income which should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no neither one way to take another fixed anybody with a nursing care on policy no\nOr another option but to take a ten years certainly which would be lower premiums than on your lap and then it went right to be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above um so uh [laughter] the anytime you start weaving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra fees and gotcha is notice I didn't even ask what I'm not I didn't even ask what the numbers are\nWhen that's on the insurance world we call those bundling\nAnd there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance your homeowner's insurance together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of this stuff is gimmicky gotcha garbage and so far smelled a rat and you have a good you have a good nose on your ... [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you there's I Would tell you the check with an investment advisor like one of the smart vest her prose and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling an income off of that\nI think you'll end up with more money alive and dead doing that then you will\nMessing with this annuity because the other thing that you can be sure of with an insurance company or an investment firm anytime they give you a guarantee that means they're giving new to less than you could have made if you didn't have a guarantee\nOkay oh and so I you know it's like with your home you didn't get a guarantee when you bought your home\nNo guarantee it's going to go up in value we're down in value either one no no insurance backing your home no no FDIC insurance on the value of your home and yet you felt really comfortable taking that quote unquote risk\nWhy because well we can look at their track record of homes and be very comfortable with them and if I could find a mutual fund that I was comfortable with its track record it's volatility as I was with your home at Seventy years old or\nSomething like a growth in income pond or balanced fund that kind of a thing that's probably where I'm putting my money if I'm you at Seventy um and it wouldn't be anywhere near an insurance company so I'll be rolling this whole thing over into something else\nChecked smart faster at day Ramsey dot com put in your in probably drop down a list of the smart Mr frozen in your area\nThen they'll have the heart of a

tonight thank you same lady\nSo go ahead and ah you know the last\n... last hour they they they uh we went early and it was it was getting interested in the conversation you were finally introduced to the skull\nYeah and uh your reaction was what\nOh ... oh [laughter]\nGet it would've been in the meantime my ego it shut up to ... and I thought oh my goodness and if he you know the answer to all my questions and because they had told me that it was ...\nIt was magical and and I walked into the room and looked at it and it was just oh I mean it was a beautiful but uh I expected to grow a little legs and jump up and down and\nSay oh you should do [laughter] rather deflated\nAnd a very quickly they um I got to be friends with semi when she found out I was English will actually Welsh so that went over with a secretary and I'm right before actually going through a doorway that day they it's\nTurned to me the people it took me and said oh by the way don't say anything psychics it 'cause I'm am Smit you had just doesn't like psychics he's had some bad experiences and I wanted to get back in the car I thought why am I here\nAnyway I went in I said hello and she said oh you know English come in come in I said I stand Welsh and secretary said oh so am I coming from and\nSo from that moment on we with some friends but um my first reaction to the skull was oh okay\nVery beautiful but anyway she put it he said well\nDo you want to see this call I said it's OK she said well I'll bring it over and she set it on the table and the [noise] the people I was with with the kind that see things and everything\nAnd they were saying you see that the alien oh you see that ship you see this and I'm going uh-huh\n[laughter] you know we really well and I don't agree [laughter] property brought up and I I always say bless your heart\n[laughter] ha ha ha ha ha I\nSat with my I'm On the the rest of her chest to fail and put my head in my hand and I thought I close my eyes they'll think I'm doing something for found them they'll leave me alone because\nI don't see anything in this thing and I but you know just so the next thing I knew I so so I sleep because I had this noise snoring\nOh have you know how do I get out of this so slowly opened my eyes and they were saying that was wonderful that was terrific and I guess it was and they did you hear it said uh he was still on a tape recorder and I said\nWhat did that come from thinking I was definitely asleep and they said that she said no that's not me it's not even my voice\nAnd they said no it's definitely you and what has happened as I thought I had fallen asleep I'm\nSo much of this information to pull it out through a couple of tapes without stopping and um I was totally freaked out actually [laughter]\nI was you were to channeling your channeling a yes or no just go\nTo a that kind of situation I'm used to be sort of in control of the well semi in control are giving my permission and allowing\nA none of that has happened it was just boom and um that that was my first introduction and a semi seemed very happy\nBecause it started to give it its history and I was not happy and so okay it's goodbye and we won't do that again\nRight that again you know what I I remember I was surprised once when I went through a trembling session and it scared me so much like throw away the tapes of the recording I look back and regret that now because I remember was so amazing\nYou know some of the things that are my ... my body did they have on tape and ah I'd just be terrified me to the point where I didn't want want anybody to see it nor do I want to experience that again but now looking back I'm thinking if I matured\nUnderstand what this is and how would how would the operates are long back to the time when that happens to me and uh would which would have kept a recording of maybe somewhere out there somebody's got a recording of recording some of my old shows\nBut it was something definitely the traveling aspects are are are really amazing what can be done through the human body through your worst\nYes absolutely so that that was my first initial I'm meeting with the skull and um then they asked me to go back like two months later I said no no no no no no but and then\nSent me had started calling me which struck up a friendship and and she was saying oh if I wanted to see you Dale and to to come up and I went to send me cold you jumped [laughter]\nI did go back a second time and I said okay I Know what you're about so I didn't look at it I kept my eyes off it and everything and [noise] and Sammy said well let's see what the scholars say today puts it in front of\nMe and I'm not looking I don't get involved and um the people that have come what kind of expecting something and I said look I'm Sorry but I come to I don't know how to do you know\nThey won't be anything traveling on command and starting to do well even though I may ask you to do it later Sobhy wrote [laughter]\nExcept that I put my hand on this call and that's the last thing I remember [laughter] my [laughter] like [laughter]\nAnd so I said semi I you know I Can't do this and I can't do this anymore is is\nThis is a tricky for me\nAnd a look at all these things you said anyway it went on for many many years and\nI they are being me I I like to prove it and I don't know if I told you about the storms so they had this\nPanel of experts come there was a physicist a scientist a medical doctor and\nSomebody else and they what we all up and actually the machines and things and um\nTo see what happened you know basically it was fraud if it was ... and I think anyway they they during the session they said the instrument you're working with um you told us that this could be used to control the weather so we'd like to see that demonstration\nAnd it said oh my [noise] okay storm so within minutes they stormed a lot of really bad storm and then it said stop storm went away\nSo when I came back they told me I thought well that's good that's that's some kind of proof\nThe next time we were up there said well that could be coincidence have them do it again\nSo they asked for them you know to coach showed a storm again or do something\nAnd it said the yes control the weather\nRight and that led put my hand up didn't even say anything it started to rain really hot and we had some sun lightning and a pretty significant that they all took notes and everything all recorded and uh and the\nScarlet had enough of it it said stop and it did within you know unusual amount of time minutes with the ... time [laughter] it cuts Carroll said yeah that could be coincidence to you know this guy that\nI mean and that's one of the reasons why I Love you so much is because you know well

and then we'll look what you get back to what you were doing um could you kind of uh expound upon what you're traveling or was it just something that came through you and were you able to ascertain some definite things that the school was trying to tell us\n... you'd have to repeat give me what what ...\n[laughter] that's what I was thinking about is why I have a\nBoy I have to clear something out of the way because otherwise I I had a message for you and I realized the public and I'm trying to\n\nPut this trying to change that would because they\nDo they have a message strictly for me\nOh you really yes\nWell go ahead and tell me what the school bell game when\nYou were um age it's very difficult to to for me anyway but it something when you are about seven or eight you experience something\nThat you really have talked about everybody convinced you that it didn't happen and and it basically is that with you for these many years you have any\nI think vocal about it and I and to tell you this was not\nA whatever happens whatever you saw was real and it was given to you you\n... not the ... of your mind which obviously is it opened a greatly and that the fear that\nYou experienced\nIs only to do with your ego emotions egos and you should push ahead with your need to bring the truth\nI think I understand that the schools trying to tell me I Do\nAnd um yeah my wife tells me the same thing Janine of course my wife is very intuitive and sometimes she tells me I'm clouded than I Do it on purpose and she wonders why do this maybe it's\nBecause I'm afraid of are

and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in James them at stake and one of the cameraman said who is\nIn James mistake of saying some old time movie actor\nOh no oh yeah you know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going I literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the light and go into it\nAnd she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's it going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I said and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead and she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went to the light\nAnd she said huh and I said have you talked to other people like people she\nSaid no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go but you show up and talk about it and she went in the light so I Hope that one of the people that when I get up there she screamed [laughter]\nDo you remember that movie pulled guys in the the little ...\nMaybe little lady kept

person that would take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house\nAnd sell it turned out that they knew who\nThe Gulf was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't go right and so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was a person on the ... whore house he says\nAnd and uh and I helped you know work on that and I looked at him and I sort of squinting my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you and he looked at\nMe I says why did you put flies in the attic what that have to do with anything and he said we have Fifteen seconds to kill\nI said flies have nothing to do is go I you needed to exterminate or not a ghost person I says why did you even do

somebody's life Fifteen Years later you\nMaybe it depends on how powerful the individual is\nAnd then um as far as uh uh uh I don't know what it on the idea of energy shopping or something I've noticed that are in myself when I feel kinda awkward and uncomfortable or around people if I think of myself as sort of a White House generating not visible light but\nInfrared warm you know and you're not supposed to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this guy either way either ... direction I mean he was on or off when he was on a\nLot of people love to be around him when he was off a lot of people wanting to be away from it was amazing how that kind of energy works both ways positive negative next up\nWe're going to rolling in Springfield, Ohio we used to the Rockies hey Ronan thanks for calling\nMorning how are we today\nWe are fine thank you hope you are too\nOften Yes sir I had a weird experience at a local\nLike I'm not far from where I live probably within an hour\nHas friends come over the person I worked with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I had just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt\nThought well now he goes well you might as well get up and move around on it all as otherwise it's just a stove\nUp so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and\nHung out with people for a little while and uh they all want to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe another thirty miles from\nWhere we were there and uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar\nA they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with and it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar we're focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck ... about\nLike a bar full of empires or something yeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or at the slaughter bright and sign up on a rope or something\nYeah and and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go so\nThey they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean\nThis was an old dad gum CD bar yeah\nAnd I went in there with them and to this place and that was a bunch of old people that there\nAgain I felt that are in the in the air and uh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I've worked with him um and ah yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I had intended they know where they talk\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three is no warning\nWhich means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in the car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a were off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven of us in the car\nAnd uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum\nSo they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in a car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening\nAnd the more time went on time went on I've started getting nervous around these people and and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name police\nAre doing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer\nAnd it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was with this dude and I went up her where she looked at me and I was an eye out during a word she says are you pray him\nAnd I says yep and she goes we better\nShe knew one looming up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like\nWow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb where we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that thought it was the Lord Jesus in my heart\nWhat you have these dreams your mind about nothing\nIs going to be stronger than the the like it's in me\nWhat do you think that ... role in what do you think there are game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they were somebody and do um where they're going to kill you [laughter] I don't think so no I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to um\nWhen me over somehow or another 'em like they wanted your soul yeah it was weird I I had talked to this only to my therapist one other time but I definitely felt\nAn odd presence I'm I'm very uh intuitive anyway and uh it just something that struck me as odd\nI Hope you didn't hang around with them any other time [noise]\nUh no actually you know the only run into one of them since then and uh they're still around but I'm a while it was weird\nYou gotta you gotta be careful
