I heard um across income than in a time come clan\nUh-huh [laughter]\nSo am I have a twenty five thousand prey their front player in a retirement plan and I know you talk about pulling it out and putting it or not pulling it out but ... ... from good guy one guy in our church who worked for a drive in finance tell him hit our favorite holiday sales\nAnd and so I can let me every I Need that ... and the fact well even the fact that we put money other variable annuity mutual funds and I wasn't sure why or if that was okay our topic you're following\nYou and I did not following you know what is not following what I teach um I didn't have to answer that part of the quite variable Newt mutual fund or variable annuities are mutual funds inside of an annuity if you pretend like the mutual fund as an investment and the annuity is a coat that\nGoes around the investment to keep it warm from taxes\nOkay okay and you pay extra for the annuity portion of this discussion nor did you could buy those exact same mutual funds with less fees without the duty coat wrapping around them okay\nSo what is the annuity coke do for you the coat wrapping around it to keep it warm it does the same thing the fact that it's in an IRA already Josh so you're buying to coach for the same kid\nOkay okay you see what I'm saying you got it's already going to be kept out of the cold of taxes by the fact that you're rolling it into an IRA okay and then you move it into it and nobody inside of an IRA it's redundant\nBecause you've already got the protection now the only thing the annuity we'll give you is they'll give you some guarantees a along the lines of you know if it goes down in value you know they protect you on principle and it will give you at least a four percent or five percent of income but if you're invested in good mutual funds and you're young you don't need those guarantees\nSo I'm okay and truthfully not not trashing thrive in I mean driving or friends of ours are good people um but I Would not use that product there and the thing you need to remember about variable annuities versus a direct mutual funds sale\nIs there's two things going on usually usually if someone's trying to show you that because they don't have a securities license they only have a life insurance license\nOh okay and that it's a way they can make its way in insurance person can get you into mutual funds is through the variable annuity they cannot sell mutual funds directly unless they have a securities license\nThe second thing that you run into that region you run into this and it's less often for this and I don't think that would be the case with thrive in is that they're actually doing this because the commissions on a variable annuity are about four times what they are are on a regular mutual fund\nOkay so some people ... just because they make more on them\nAnd I would not accused\nThe chicken or guy of that and the situation I mean knowing his farm knowing the setting that you did this my guess is he's probably not security licensed that's my guess okay and and it really is if he is he still giving you a bad recommendation\nNow he did that I can do that neutral fan exactly as you recommend Sam Harris' new thing ham seat is really pushing the variable annuity and asked me to go home like all the member at my husband review and think about that\nBut I wanted to call you immediately I knew what you can file ready\nYou know so now we've got another problem OK okay if this piece of advice was bad and you knew it what about the next ... by ... that you don't know is bad\nI hereby that can go and I I had a referendum\nI got it right away I just felt bad 'cause he goes through our church that you know network yeah\nAnd that's okay I mean is that you don't have to do business with people or churches\nNecessary so and so I I\nI don't think I'm going to do business with this guy ah because I mean I I mean I I don't like his advice and I might not like it next time I might not understand next time so\nI just get a smart Russia pro and move the mind that way [noise] series of grossed me tremendous correct transfer\nAnd when I re\nThat is [noise]

more likely to reach your investment goals and the best place to start is by sitting down and talking with investing professional\n\nWe trust our system of government enough that we abide by its outcomes\nEven though we may disagree with them it's always been the case Americans even if they did lead with ... with the government\nOr a a form of government or something going on a government disagree they bring their differences to light they vote they use constitutional law we use law and order which is based on a constitution but solid\nFor centuries\nNearly centuries almost two centuries\nBut\nMore than two centuries actually yeah more than two centuries little over\nNow we've had disagreements in the past and that's something to this country does it we have a debate and we have conversations we talk we have dialogue hopefully dialogue with his balanced and ah\nAnd and that's something I think we're lacking right now I mean we're writing off people because we disagree with him and that's nonsense\nIt Eighteen sixty one\nThere's only one time in our history and Eighteen sixty one where we distrust of the system so much that we decided\nTo have a civil war or we had a civil war I don't know if we decided the civil war broke out because we didn't agree we had such a disagreement about how our system was run we have a ... we had a civil war\nThere was so much instability at that time the civil war broke out it wasn't declared it broke out there were divisions on on a on the front lines there were a\nYou know border divisions and things of that nature it was clear cut as to what a civil war was back in the Eighteen sixties were not living in the Eighteen sixties anymore America's instability\nIs increasingly an undercurrent in political discourse right now\nBut I Know it's difficult to see the civil war is happening because we always thought it would be an armed conflict then one day President Trump or whoever would step up to the pop and say what about your guns guys we're going to war here in this country\nBut he established with a battlefield America had already been proposed during the Obama administration is proposed by none other than John McCain\nWho now is a political hero of the left for some reason\n\nWe always thought it would be an armed conflict where we would be shooting other Americans every day with the police would be forced to shoot Americans every day we're martial law would be declared\nAnd all that can happen but at the moment the symptoms of civil war have not been diagnosed\nBy the majority of the people and most of the diagnosis you get about wars are from history not declared by the president but ... be declared the aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military had identified illustrated the point by point sign post\nAs to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on\nContemporary standards not the standards of Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there are major coups in the planning for Truman and for FDR major coup of course planned and and and uh actually executed by a those are the deep state against President Kennedy\n\nBut a new civil war in America look something like this according to military planners number one the country would be infringed in national polarization would no obvious meeting place for resolution\nNumber two\nThere would be increasingly divisive press coverage and information flows weaken institution notably a Congress and the judiciary\n\nNumber three there will be a sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership and the legitimacy and the illegitimate edition of violence to solve any and all disputes\n\nNow I Know that that's pretty damning\nTo actually point all these out\nAnd of course we have been analyzing and speculating about deep state\nManipulations it's a ... we've been told is conspiracy analyst said this is a an invention of Donald Trump would we know that the shadow government has not been in Ventura Donald Trump the shuttle governor has always been the dark command that leads from the shadows\nBut it needs to be clear here\nWhile we're looking under rocks for falsify proof while we're having these disputes and the symptoms of war here in the United states the effect is working in the left has made it a point to turn what happened today with the bombs it will moment where their persecution complex can be proven which makes it even more suspicious especially when\nThe media should be talking about how more than a week ago Senator Susan Collins a Republican from Maine\nReceived a suspicious letter and again early this month President Trump defense secretary James Mattis and chief of naval operations John Richardson were sent rice and more than a year ago there was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressmen during a charity baseball practice and yet since no one died\nThis doesn't indicate civil war does it no not at all just we're attacking officials\nBut this isn't registering in the media today\nThe only thing that's registries the persecution complex we see on the left because the left is all one sided in their pain\nBut continued attacks on ...\nOh go ah it seems to be a highly climbed written with guns going up and things happening like that but when we have bombs in the leadership where we have people who have to a planet around mob these are ... and parts\nTalking part designed post symptoms perhaps of what would be a civil war and as I say the

he's created an environment so somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict\nFrom our authorities and the intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one and the other's throats but\nWe have to understand that at the grassroots level America is best when we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that weigh in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this air that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wake up call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast [laughter] but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you've been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and is we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that set these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep those keeps their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nAnd our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals in institutions and in the intelligence community entire us an intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and who ever did this\nWhether somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag\nSomebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight shut out wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who'd done this\nThen we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but

I just recently heard veil that is that something you can do to yourself\nAbsolutely merging as always always good explains much\nOkay this is just um like you just you get the bundle of stage and you light the stage and I prefer just to stage when I'm naked so right out after a hot bath I should've said that before and I didn't\nUm you just said and between your legs and you'll see age all around your body mostly around your head and especially behind your head because that's where entities like two to hang out\nI'm so every crevice in your body you're just going to stage um and it works if you do it forty days in a row\nWell if you said your house and you say to yourself you definitely will fill a difference\nOh I Hope that works for your Charlotte Allen in Fresno, California is with us now ... go ahead\nOh I'm a a lot of the question of how you get rid of stairs in your how how do you get rid of their great question going to have to pay for that because it's going to be more lengthy\nUm I can give you um information on how to do a house exercises um now what kind of scary I mean are they pulling your covers [laughter] you know what do you wake up in the morning what how how serious are these\nWhat's happening there around it's like it's like a wake up in the night and ... you were talking and then when I go like into the closet no one's\nOkay so you probably have what what is known as I called in earth downstairs so it can be someone\nThat's like a mischievous spirit [laughter]\nIt's probably not like a Dame and it's just that maybe someone who lived there before and they passed on but they haven't really kept\nOn is it possible with her so that you cannot get rid of a certain spirit that just lingers forever\nWell it depends I think all spirits you can get rid of them because you can paint them as well so what happens in that case and that's a very good question Josh I'm Glad you after and there are some black magicians who will send an earth\nDown and what do you mean by black magicians I'm All right well it's already gone edition or a group that\nI Know sorry and clarify and so in addition and it can actually send you an earth down there and what they do is they will go and I'm looking for ... at the cemetery who have crossed over and they will\nMake the calls just Garret who are very disgruntled you know they either killed someone or they raped someone and then they're willing to do their bidding and so they can send us your tail\nAnd if that happens actually quite frequent\nAre they under the control of loose of her Satan\n[noise] the dark lord absolutely they are I I kind of a dark lord exist\nBecause when you said somebody sends them that's who I think is sending them\nWell it depends because it's always the the evil magicians are definitely being manipulated by the dark lord and and you know other demon so in a in a in a sense yes absolutely\nYou've got to watch out you got a raw Charles ... website is

welcome back to coast to coast George story with you while a couple of years ago as I was chatting with our executive producer Lisa lion on our senior producer Tom Dan Hi sir we kicked around the idea of\nDoing a show once in a while that was a little different so we can have some fun with him we came up with the idea of who's behind the secret doors senior producer Tom Dana ... or has been picking some guess how do you select who I'm going to try to guess who they might be tonight Tom\nUh I picked people that the audience will know in that you will know because the whole idea of the shows to have fun is in this particular door show is to have fun and people know who they are but the best part is when they try to tricky aren't really creative\nI remember when the late Roger leader came on and uh I could not gas him at all\nHe had you and I think in\nHoney and it was going to ... you wouldn't even was very good too so I'm looking forward to this we've got three guests will take phone calls with everybody up to half on each one\nA in this night will go by really quick and one more quick question for you goes to goes next Wednesday Halloween Night you're putting together a number of uh email ghost stories from people and will have the actual people on the year with me that night\nUh it of course we'll take calls from our listeners to what their ghost stories so we're ready to go there ready to go to ship out to be a fun show we're going to ... okay Thanks Tom okay so let's open up the first secret\nDoor\nGosh I tell them the oil that thing and they just haven't done that yet so come on in and let's see who you are hello there\nAnd I oh boy this is going to be tough I'm fine how are you\n[noise] well my my ... oh I Know I got older and get her\nIt's the attendance reading a mortgage stance in Friedman\nBoy am I allowed\nHeightened I you know what you've got that little tiny accent that I picked up stand how are you and how you're feeling\nWell it's in the middle of the night but I'm I'm a before I'm gonna limped on\nEr and yes you are we need we need you on this program my friend look I heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring I I'm a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagement in January November and December I Can't believe it too much about going anywhere\nAgainst my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you we love your stand that I'm going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter\nIn Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named stamped and Friedman I saw a little clip being in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before a group\nA at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who was ... you know nuclear physicists expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this you want to go up there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took by Sony tape recorder\nOut I went to interview Stanton Friedman had a great interview and I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis he was the gas and then what I replaced art on coast to coast stamp was a rush a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near ... big beer\nAnd I think so at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away and\nSo I stand telling me telling me what's going on in the field if you follow gee these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's\nA much wider acceptance I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there you said there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or were they going to be sending a signal\nWell the latest word begat but it looks like there was about one point six climates per star opera galaxy per star in our galaxy the Milky Way has ... billion star\nSo that means is one hundred and sixty billion planets so they're all over that darn plays and you know that changed as our picture we used to think ah we're pretty special you know there's only a few solution to the ... around and we're at the top of the heap well roll over the place\nAnd that changed our perception of how important we are of course from the most important things around because we haven't been around very long\nAnd leave plenty of room in other words for others and we come to realize that you know getting here from ... not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that the you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth now we realize I Would look we're fusion for example\nOr you can get ... hours\nWe also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop Russia and thought that the world was created and four thousand B. C. let's rent can't be too many beings around you know well it was off a little bit four billion be just\nLike just a little off the list uh our ...\nNatural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things the ultimate you know hurtful thing [noise]\nUm we're beginning to realize it's a busy place out there and there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here\nBecause apparently they seem to be all over the place now whether this is a result them\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization I mean people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying but the mirror throws a lot of that they put in incarcerated people\nYou know like yeah like a ... boy guy's been brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people it's it's it's you're saying that you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story\nNationwide yet but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of ... kind of the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that well we think there's one point six planets for stars so like like huge number of planets and\nYou know they're probably come in here uh I I'd have been left that\nThere's only a few thousand flights you know if there are life out there and we see it ... you know they would make contact and land on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think it's more like realizing that at North America has more than a few people on the east coast\nIs jammed full of people all over the place and we that makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old\nSource some big or were still slapped [laughter] and and so uh what\nMost of us all learned that if it's a more complex place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAnd much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of planning the stars and things like that\nAnd uh hey we're not number oh\nOh no [laughter] no ... and so what we\nAnd you can tell from another thing or the military budget on a blind and it's about a trillion dollars this year or so we haven't changed much have\nWe know that it'll be\nPeople don't get the goodies of our from their work or we take the leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill other people and it seems I I don't want to saying that's human nature\nA but it appears to be close to what it is and\nI'm not going to try to explain why or how what are we know enough to say that a\nIs an awful lot of energy available to men in the universe and you know come to the sequence of I Know huh how long does it take to get some place how ... person and all almost kind of stuff in\nDavid ... is a believer that whatever's happening here it's not a good thing that there's you know some evil evil ETs out there and do you what do you think of that\nWell I Can't prove to you but there are not she's up there on the other hand I have to point out\nOr you don't have to be much more advanced than we are to be capable of destroying walks are ripping on a planet if you put your mind to it and this isn't it amazing that we haven't done a couple of thousand nuclear warheads sitting around the world\nAnd none of them have been used that's remarkable\nNewt is shown restraint I'm not saying that makes us great guys\nBut it's the first step toward good senses to restrain from using all the killing tools you how how about helping to ...\nAnd ... so I I'm an optimist George are you always have been\nWhy not life is good to have to work at it are there are bad things in the world of course I'm sure we can do something of fat and so why shouldn't I be announced the um and\nLike I say restraint seems to be the word that's been uppermost than many leaders mine's recognition if I get them they'll get me and what could have I done\nWhy don't we hear too much about abduction cases anymore gosh you know in the seventies and sixties that's all we heard\nUs right now we I think we take it for granted but they're aliens or maybe we put your haven't talked to any leaders or maybe they ... yeah maybe they got all they leave a raccoon enough\nIs enough ah and might not be surprising people I I have a great deal of faith in humanity of humidity gets pushed a little bit and ...\nUsed to restrain as I said it two thousand nuclear weapons sitting around and nobody's using them and I'm pleased about it because it enables us to use her energy to move more constructive directions 'cause I think\nUh my grandson will grow up in an age where there is interaction with\nI I

stop\nComing to the fences and extra systems for people and I've just written this new book that does include big foot ... some ... stuff owning a ... a retired police officer\nIn white whole New York that back in Nineteen Seventy six\nHad a near face to face encounter with a a seven foot tall gigantic bipedal creature\nSaid he was thirty feet away from it and he'll never forget it and it has affected the rest of his life and I'm actually going to be going to see that individual NY whole New York very soon as names officer Ryan Gosling and so it's going to be an interesting book George I'll make sure that you have a copy\nAnd thank you for already endorsing the book yes or is it something that a little different for me because I'm used to writing about my own experiences that and I'm covering a broader spectrum and writing about some other folks\nI absolutely have to build this ... this officer of course has no reason to lie has nothing to gain these are the kinds of credible witness is you have to have Arthur\nI totally agree and I didn't know about this matter is Margaret from like super who also is a former police officer he lives in Carmel New York\nAnd he um somehow got connected with officer ... and went and actually interviewed him so that's how this all came about and and then I've had dialogue with officer Gosling since then he's very credible and it was not only him but seven other officers\nAre over two nights ban that actually solve this creature so it was the original two witnesses that reported hearing just God awful shrieking sounds coming out of the woods\nAnd they reported it to the local police and so the first night\nThere were I Believe five police officers present and then the second night there were two more present and had these I Witness accounts of this gigantic big foot creature in the area\nSome people believe that big bill might be dimensional other people believe it's tied to the U.S does ah I tend to think it's it's a creature of this planet ... what's your take\nWell I have to say you know again based on research and my feeling about it end dealing with this creature I'll I'll tell you a story and a second here but I Believe that it's both George I think [noise]\nBiblical a now or if you're reading things like uh of course you know if you're reading a knock which isn't in the Bible but if you read the book with the knock it talks about\nThe ... the thoughts of God coming down a taking human women which produced a hybrid offspring of giants called the ... those ... unnatural sex acts with the beast of the field now if this is true\nThen perhaps these big foot soft watch creatures are a part angel part human and then part a bear or whatever it is that you know that these now from a you know made it with\nMhm\nAnd I find anything can be to now think about this and a lot of these cases there seems to only be\nOne foot friends there's never really very rare that you hear about a lengthy trail of of these types of\nFriends and I've thought about that and I thought okay if if it's not a hoax then perhaps this\nCreature may take one step before it becomes invisible as crazy as that may sound but they're short seems to be a pattern here of investigators or eyewitnesses that only find one track\nThat's a good point what do you think in the old Paterson given so\n[noise] well I've seen it and I was kind of on the fence I thought [noise] I don't know it ... I'll say this though if that was a fake it was a darn good one\nA darn good one and it would have to be someone you would think that would be gargantuan to fit in to that type of a outfit to be able to make that come off as real and another thing George if you think about this\nAs you watch the creature walk away you see the arms swinging and the arms look very long they certainly look longer than ... in my opinion what human arms would look like\nSo it is very compelling\n... bean bills website is not linked up the coast to coast am dot com bill being dot net for you he was the second person behind the secret door I did not get it right so I'm One for one so far\n[noise] gosh I ...

confidence together we just didn't act lifetime\nEverything's good enough for people who need to know who you are Karen Doberman is the weed you board person is that fair to say\nI think that's fair to say yeah we we divorced tools I like to use and as you know I'm now director of the talking board it's\nDark will society ... so we diversify and all things talking ... board\nMarla ... a more moral Martinson believes the you're the greatest ... personnel to her\nWell she's very kind of say it that way is very ...\nNow Karen dome and maybe one of the only people we know who loves the ... board folks as you know I'm opposed to it I don't want to use it but Karen feels very secure with it I guess one could say ... it has to do with who the user right\nYour dad has to do with\nThe use your your intention that has to do with the reason why are you the number one and also what why do you forget it has to do with your own perceptions believe in what you think about and how you view yourself with in the world wide I mean if you have a lot of fears that you're going to drop to you but when you're you have common sense about yourself and uses tool for the place of love\nFor the place of light from a place of wanting to explore to discover than the whole the whole atmosphere around the world changes\nSome people believe that the ... board Karen opens up a portal to allow these evil spirits and entities to come through what's your thoughts on that\nSure ... and this goes back to what you believe or your perceptions of the world and so I don't believe in it that they're earning power that they are just the pond to their world\nAnd when my work really is about beyond the board it really is about teaching people to find their empowerment their core strength then and that is found by remembering recalling who they are the divine bean and that they are an extension of sorts incarnate when you come from a place of that kind of ... and beyond\nThat kind of belief system those kinds of intentions then you get what you desire you get you get a whole different a way of communicating and communion with the unseen dimensions I mean the work that I Do with this tool is no different at somebody who channel or\nWorks with a K. two meter and paranormal investigations or read stroke ... to name a few it's really a similar principle you have your attention that\nYou use it only as a tool you have there's no hidden spirits interviewed or power inside of these chunk of wood or cardboard or glass or whatever they're made out of\nIts within yourself the board is strictly a permission to allow yourself to access your own internal abilities to work in Israel\n[noise] have you ever had a bad we'd you board experience\n[noise] no I haven't had bad\nThe worst I've ever had with somebody cussing that and he wants to the board and this is many years ago this back in Nineteen\nEighty screw through the board they were costing or the board\nBut let me tell you this George I people write to me and asked this question all the time you don't continue to engage\nIf somebody in life if I'm if I'm standing in line you know maybe get a check out the grocery store and somebody gets really rude I'm going to not engage with that person I'm going to move away walk away or not engaged because you don't you just make it worse and some of the same thing with this tool you don't engage and all I did was say you can't talk to me that way I'm bored he might have board\nOn huh I'd go ahead go good and going\nAnd that's it and it works that way now it works that way because of my own beliefs about where the energy these efforts are coming from they're coming from me if I Believe everything negative and I'm fearful of everything\nThat that I'm a draw to me I mean there are lower energy is out there and once I realized I had the empowerment within me that I could really a strict in myself internally then everything changed from Nineteen eighty six on it than
