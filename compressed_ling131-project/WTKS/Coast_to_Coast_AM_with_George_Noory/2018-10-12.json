I talked to him about it and he's like oh I don't really I Dreamed that would be nice to have more money [laughter]\nHe acted\nHe is I'm always worked really hard we got married when he was Eighteen and he worked about sixty hours a week than I Am at the corner and held it he he gets a hard worker and he'd do anything for me\nMhm okay um\nI wasn't questioning how hard he works as questioning and making money\nYou see the difference yes I work real hard to you do yeah a lot\nLike this week already sixty hours and It's Wednesday so I'm a Thursday or whatever it is even forgot what that is are we go so anyway but I'm\nA I don't always do that every week but you know you've got to look at things and say for the labor I'm putting out on the time I have away from my family and the stress and the strain on my body in my mind and my emotions what am I getting paid in Europe the answer is not much\nAnd that's part of what you are facing as your income challenge\nIs that right okay\nAnd I'm so why why does that bring tears\nI feel like we've just been we've had to go on\nAnd you know like I Try to be we try to be financially responsible you know we we've never meant spenders\nYeah I don't think ... I don't think you're irresponsible thinking maybe I really I think you're doing really good because you don't have the money\nI feel like at this point I had hoped to be a little bit more had failed paycheck to paycheck yeah\nYeah but it there's two parts of the equation right the income side and the other side and you know have you noticed that didn't even ask you about the I'll go sat in your case yeah and that's because I think you're probably doing pretty good there\nReally aren't we should have babies that number you're down in about six months\nAnd I think you're right I I think you're stretching the few dollars that you have really well so I think you're I think you're very responsible people I don't think you're overspending I don't think you're crazy I don't think you're spoiled brats um and I think he's a hard worker\nYeah\nWell I think you've got all that stuff going for you and that's why I Want you to win better than your winning and so I really think you guys put the kids to bed and I turn off TV light a candle or two and just sit on back porch and talk and say\nWell we only makes them more money um and it's not 'cause money's everything it's because when you are or you know doing the best you can do with the dollars you're having their not stretch and then we've got to look at something well what are we going to do to create some additional income short short term and long term\nWell actually we did last night and I actually got a job in the local library but after I pay for childcare I only bring home about thirty to forty dollars a day\nOr so that's that's not that's not the answer then right after we got a better a better income coming into for child care if you're going to be working and he's got to have a game plan\nI don't know whether he opens his own butcher shop or whether he becomes the most famous butchering the world\nYou know on TV I don't care what he does [laughter] I'm not saying you could not be a butcher but uh you can't be a butcher their ten years from now and be anywhere but where you are right now\nThe accents\nAnd so I I you know what are we going to do with the skill or this thing or did he just fall into this because her parents were doing it or you know that's kind of exactly what happened yeah and so but I mean what if let's just kind of take the white board out and start over erase our life on the white border for second and say\nGosh if we can do anything we wanted to do what would we do\nYeah and then let's go about doing that\nAnd you know into it today and walk in and throw you know throw your knife down and walk out that's not what I'm saying but I Am saying we need a plan that takes us somewhere where we say okay this month I got a hundred bucks left over but it's not always going to be this way but it is always going to be that way if you don't change something agreed\nAgreed okay I think you can do it you're good people this is not a it's not a character issue and it's not a a lack of a effort issue and it's not an immaturity thing you guys just simply mathematically it's income minus outgoing or not much income\nYeah so and he told us\nWhat how do we go about that but my parents that is you know like it would really be\nWhen he's gone to drill here they always talk about how inconvenient for that and it's so hard on my dad got heart problems and they asked to take over all of the work that very very small operation\nOkay so let's kind of think about this for [laughter] this is not working for your bad\n'cause it's not working for has not working for you yeah so this whole thing and it working\nBut I don't know how may not the way I bring it up is we love your own we'd love to help you but we're starving to death over here yeah and we're not going to continue to do this anymore and you don't have to do it today but you you know you can say you know my husband we don't we're taking classes\nAnd he's going to be a an X or y or Z two years from now and that's what he's going to start doing because that's really his dream\nBecause here's the thing\nWith somebody is going to make some decisions to shut some stuff down or you're going to be sitting exactly where you see it\nOkay and I you know\nBut ... you know you cannot be in this thing of oh we have to starve to death because that's the only way my parents have a good life\nWithout a doubt that's not that's not logical\nThat doesn't make sense right yeah you're right and the truth is your dad if he's got a heart problem and your husband is not there he probably needs to sell this close right yeah and and so when you start thinking about that or does it make enough to support you guys if your dad was out of the picture\nDoes he need to go home [noise] [noise] well\nThere you go it's not like we divide but not a quake we're not like we're not at all part of the owners of it\nI Know but the owner cannot operate it without this particular employees what you're saying\nYeah oh well I guess I Need a new employee or then you talk about selling it to you or giving it to you or something I don't know y'all can talk about there's a lot of different ways out of this mess but continue into the same thing is not a way out of the ...\nAnd I'm so chance I'm going to change it led to change the day and I have to change turkey turkey and nobody's mad as sort of throw weight around or say anything unkind\nBut we just have to lay say you know five years from now are we doing something different ten years from now it'll be something doing something different and we're going to make more money there's almost all of them get um that's where all these fears are coming from stress and that one and I think your dad's good people too and I think your life with understanding\n[noise] this

I don't think anybody realized that they don't have a party they don't even have a left right there are a black bloc okay that I didn't call to talk about any phone what has been done\nBy Hillary\nIn the service of whoever's putting out the black lots and all the other thing is a lot more insidious than simply saying we cannot be violent anymore we have to be violent now that's not what she said remember that most you you prove this the other night when\nYou did your show that most Americans have no idea what the word civil war I mean it does not\nMean a civil war\nNo not necessarily all\nMeans no not necessarily not at all civil means states Sable civil means within the state or city or something else it it means it means within state instead of with other states that is what civil war means and that'd be a new civility\nNothing however Hillary said the exact opposite\nOf go go up the violence that the civil what she did no one is realizing is they use of the word civil\nSuggesting exactly the opposite of what she is saying she's\nCalling on all the people who don't understand what civil war means and using that word as a seed it's a dog whistle it's so subtle that you didn't pick up on it wow\nShe all she had it was dropped that word because it confuses too many people and that way she's not saying anything bad she's nine citing any violence she's just saying I'm don't be nice but\nShe's using that word because we don't understand it and it has a lot of connotations that we don't even understand\nBut in that case then she's going to have it backfire on her when you agree what do you mean well I mean if you do if it was a dog whistle and you've seen or how you know people have acted towards the conservatives you seem you know like Ted Cruz being harassed I'm not in ... you know\nI'm I'm not sure she knows what she did I'm not sure she goes to cheat I think somebody encouraged her to say that\nWell but he's obviously got the New York post printing out newspapers that are going to just declared civil war\nThat's right that Hillary doesn't doesn't control the post you know the post controls Hillary them media controls Hillary and media controls Trump because the media is controlled by those who want to civil war and the media doesn't know it\n... doesn't know it to be strapped doesn't know it to the deeds they basically are you is usually the media diminished doing civil war and they're using both Trump and Hillary as pawns in in in the whole matrix that's the mini me no I yeah I did this begin to hate the word hate or deep state but yes what you're saying well\nHe's real I mean come on what you want to go out and then I got to be on when it's when they were the other term for you may be a dark stayed a Machiavellian

came out November two thousand Seventeen zero hour Harry what is going on with the stock market\nOr you know George we'd been warning you know for years but especially in recent months that were coming into a top either right now and now we've seen signs of that in the last few days or a week and the whole from just like a ten to Fifteen Percent correction here which are already close to that\nUm we may make it you know in the next year but but this is the greatest bubble in modern history it has been extended by sixteen trillion dollars are free money printed\nSince two thousand nine and now a trillion and a half tax cuts from Trump two trillion repatriated from overseas this stuff just keeps piling in the stock market it's the most overvalued it's ever been even now more than early two thousand the greatest bubble we've seen in our lifetime which of course crashed a\nYou know it was Seventy eight percent for the tech stocks and stuff\nAnd and this could be the beginning I've got some signs I can talk about and stuff but but this could be the beginning of it and\nAnd this is not something you want to sit through ... you know most of the time stocks go up and then they correct ten or twenty percent that's fine most people should sit through that not I call this a great reset this only happens once in a generation and even more so every Ninety years like a clock and we're coming right on that clock\nIn stocks can be down Seventy eighty Ninety percent and take twenty to\nTwenty five years to get back there you do not hold through this and you do not listen to your stockbroker at this time\nYou buy back in when things at the bottom\nYou know that's the secret to George a lot of people say well what do I do it might well first of all you can be a high quality bonds and make money which she did all through the Nineteen thirties the great depression when everything else was down\nBut the biggest bonuses it'd be preserved your money or in high quality bonds making some money or or if you're really daring and just short the market a little bit\nYou got money to buy things when they're down I mean imagine if you could buy the best companies in the world like Amazon or apple or whatever or Coca Cola for eighty percent off or Ninety\nOff because they're gonna they're gonna comes out on our dollar\nYeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollars in next time it\nGoes to four thousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on well what did the indicators market the last two days is really taking it on the what's the cause is it just panic or ... what's happening\nLow interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kinda like went sideways and didn't elaborate Georgia emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy ... trillion more\nOn top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world [noise]\nAnd and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble China is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest that Bob ... of anybody in any time in history and when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so\nView is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and stock crash because they stopped at with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just filled the top backup with money that was draining this time more debt\nEverything's more stretch the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty percent\nOff absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that

I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality it was just political partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats\nHated the Republicans for defending him in and installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really I think that the social unrest and this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republican and say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff and the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate enough and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war\nOn the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south has read this time especially with Republicans in charge and I think there's going to be facts I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything that there is nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument and its arguments in hatred bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and I tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kind of like\nWatching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em back to 'cause we're familiar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price\nAnd and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her I suppose it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover and zero our\nIn our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened\nEvery Ninety years since the industrial revolution cause the greatest boom and global his\nLawn you know here we had a couple of guests on who say very similar things what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September lose one fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the meat\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and it didn't happen it didn't happen then but you could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position and we were coming into a\nTwo thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like in may that finally Tom and then Trump got elected I mean we turn boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprised when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a reversal\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nUm and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that's\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just going to even\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea\nWhich would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or best polls on and no disaster we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crashing history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble lasting pass\nNext to the end of next year but there there's a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you don't want to get hit by that\nForty pursue we know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what could happen when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes yes uh China went down a little bit in China made the biggest ... was the only stock market that violated a critical point yesterday it went down some more but came back up to even but it's still\nViolated but the U.S markets looked like the ... going to open up two to three hundred points Tamara now that's minor compared to fourteen hundred points over just the last\nThing we were going to come right back we'll talk more take phone

today\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nCome back to go to grocery done with us we'll get to your calls as well Harry within the can you predict dumped five years from now\n[noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know the trouble and the economy starting in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm\nJust from the baby boom generation when they would predictably spent and when they would stop spending so yes what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight will\nBe over a bout about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next global boom the differences George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states is kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spend much more of their money\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three\nIs going to be way more on the downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only on George is a\nReal estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan and places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people that the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and then of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so\nIn our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be best place to be the next year that that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two\nThe disruption a around the world that makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and and when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and ... and it's a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\n... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to give him too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but they're certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona to get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and and that's what happened to the great depression of course because\nPeople don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging now they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent\nSo so they're they're at risk to but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack\nAhead of ours this time is it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take\nYou know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're gonna take your deposits and we're going to vote them into equity in our dying bank who wants equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in even in Australia that people are realizing they're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so\nPeople have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money other than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I and I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen to people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about is exactly when it happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nAnd that's something we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nOr Mr ... I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars for the hurricanes struck him because of all the corruption there which is the real reason why the recovery has been slow\nThe former New York governor George Pataki is having to head a committee so that the bondholders\nGet their money back to questions I live in Rochester here where a lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or ending up they are lower skilled workers who are not finding work in us taxpayers are having to pay for their relief\nAnd the you're the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people last not happening up here uh in New York the former Empire State and secondly California which is not friendly to business when people bleed state they insist on taking their\nShort sighted left wing politics with them they go to places like Texas formerly all red state which is now only purple a to sum this up uh these people with their left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nUh anti five the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the officials there are letting\nAnti run the city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I Am saying flat out we're facing prove civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats\nAnd a starting with the Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas\nHave been struck dumb because of liberal\nDemocratic policies uh we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote in a herd instincts Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times\nAnd like hey let let let me are real quickly you're right about the Democratic thing there's no way that that Puerto Rico's going to become a state now with the Republicans in charge\nCompromise their differences and the global boardrooms\nThere was a shooting war just like World War one world war two Korea\nVietnam and on and on so don't you think I mean a limited nuclear exchange could turn the United states and to a third world country\nIn a day or two you know with ... or magnetic both etc what is the probability of a shooting war\n[noise] you know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan\nI'm there but but what we're saying and zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge into World War one people don't realize globalization global trade collapsed sixty percent\nBetween World War one and World War two with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising tariffs just like we're seeing now everything's happening like happened that this works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries loose\nAnd and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether it ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea they can definitely be stopped there there's no question there's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because\nNobody big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have it is there's there is no counter bailing power that can really take us on one on one\nSomebody hit us they would be dead long before we were so I think that's kind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundred no there were major countervailing power that's how you could have World War two but we're going to definitely have\nA political huge political jeez this trade war we said it's zero hour before this became obvious this is gonna last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical or but there's certainly\nGoing to be huge a political at trade wars and\nThings like rain here each day with us for coming back for final phone calls with you in just a moment on coast

E. R. dot com\nBut I I don't know I'm optimistic I'm going to stay on the line because I Know you're going to have questions and I want to get a few linked then because I Want to charge twenty three sixty thinks the path\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts [noise] they're\nGonna have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation is\nCome along so I I my bet is\nThat they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans then people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst\nAnd and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict and then change\nPolicies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nTo thousand a year in one way to bail out everything would be people like a hundred thousand dollars voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell well I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\nIn a ... you know permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and and the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place\nJust send you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but\nIt would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer as only benefitted corporation including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check you know he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend the red line them you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or they you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief\nAnd and have them spend that money to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron download very good that you\nKnow hello there George an area that question for you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I'm placing my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite and the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems was farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally a money center banks thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to procreate money\nOr pull ... they're going to do for the more fluent in towns and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union than you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with the ridden Hi Barbara in North Carolina\nYeah\nHey thank you and I think yeah I guess and take part in one of my question I asked\nA direct tonight I Wonder why am I I'm not quite at that point\nYou're out yup it's all about timing\nIt all of that time what am I going to say\nHey what I've heard of that you just answered my question like about smaller amount so my Social Security income that much um I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm at a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits of a larger\nAccounts and more fluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever scenario and bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that so what oh deposits are insured\nThey can ensure everything if you have a major class but the smaller account it'd be spread out a few accounts\nAnd you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get\nYes you're going to be less vulnerable and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course when when things go bad people going to hit for the positives more Iceland\nWent down and basically all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again I still say have as much as your money in a\nA protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans and business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account\nWith your stocks or bonds or cash in it\nThey can't they can't pledge doses reserves\nAnd well that's a good thing Harry thank you were at a time Harry's website at coast to coast

breed cognitive dreams out of body experiences encounters with message burying the operations is well welcome to the program Dr many may just on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders Norma first came out many people ask me it was based on stories with my patients had told me that my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential a doctor's bound by the Hippocratic Oath\nStates that are doctors should not be Pete anything he's told by patience and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nFive stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from I own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls for that so many veterans that [noise]\nUm you know it's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience mhm\n[noise] but the um term near death experience\nYou know it's going back to talk to women moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right I think he estimated at something like one thirty Americans that had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people\nBut it's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never would pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I look at how microbes precious staff affected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\n[noise] in other words I'm having had all these close cause of death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have over my fear of dying and I have found give myself a shift from materialism spirituality and then he and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual\nThe first um couple the paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything that might just kind of ... the ... yeah I just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would leave me and in those days no one talked about those experiences\nBecause there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and\nWhen I went to um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well yeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it that the the anonymous stem cells don't it it's called an aloe Jeanette ... ... it's more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nI just feel like I'm donor bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOr the super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I got leukemia oh gee I'm\nAnd I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital and I had\nNumerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you chemotherapy because it's doing too much damage to your body\nYou was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be in the mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that fight against that they gave me the transplant huh [noise] now is the person who gave me the transplant she lives in an anonymous donor that\nRule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them and I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was a member of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow so he was flown back\nInto the don't you send for Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThen have you still in touch with him did that happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you save your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and they\nHear altruism you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is itchy swab\n... that's it yeah that that she thought to get the DNA so that's when his name into the donor bank and then um years later my name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor [noise] but then once you know\nWe found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live\n... yes we've become friends and I just I'm not too long ago\nAnd Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic Rome has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to the psychiatrist [noise]\nHowever since I have that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's a psychic experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed to the last um spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that\nAnd these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post death contact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know atheist and they've not sticks have these experiences well as religious people\nYou see that everyone is psyche again I I tend to believe you can agree with you\nOK but uh when you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or the cognitive beams and other things you talk to both types of visions hundred voices and so on deathbed visions near death experiences\nSo certain types of fake experiences such as ESP\nAnd collapse of the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh you must be ... I was just thinking about\nYou right now is that's very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or the ... cents but a lot of people aren't interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic roam out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families\nFilled in their own oh I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show or no you that's terrible ...\nHow does he got so interested in philosophy\nShe just always was and there were so many things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nWell that's good well I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor these medical center in New York where they were getting into the the the ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming\nAnd in that study they had Sanders and receivers\nAnd the receiver it's we're in a sleep lab\nAnd they were hooked up to the G ... um the AG could measure what we call Graham sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the ... gene state the Centers for giving random images and they were told to concentrate on the images and try to send them to be the face and they found that people were more susceptible to ... to telepathy when they're asleep and it's also true that people are more\nSusceptible to collapse of the when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the ... more Dr ... is with us his book the borders of normal [noise]\n... the new version of the coast to coast am apple is now available for I don't know Android for not only listen live on demand anywhere anytime\nGood acoustic ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nSo Ben is news radio seven seven actually I'm In well ...

the borders of normal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize as paranormal phenomenon many let's talk a little bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he thought his late sister he mentioned oh they're so until you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWas dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm\nSaid someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors and as they got closer to death is visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these visions rent disturbing at all they were very comforting\nAnd who's giving them the mess\nThat's the question like where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've read or we could save coming from the spirit\nWorld you know but some of these messages\nFor example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that\nCould have been her fear you know um and maybe\nIt was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\n... ... there was a movie about a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government to leaders\nTo to assassinate them and you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that they mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor his medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to collapse of the\nI don't know when I was dreaming while they were the I don't know to the point of getting having making some and have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and how how did we know it's right you know so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable mhm\n[noise] yeah I was also talking about messages and dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't it pay cognitive gene which is the message and I didn't even know what to make of it\nThat I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up this is the message I got I I just saw these where it said this is\nA world of illusion ... and the biggest illusion time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march\n[noise] that fate in fact she dreamt the night before he just tells you that he was going to be assassinated she begged him not to go to the Senate ignored pleas also with his favorite told Julius Caesar it'd be where the march which is the fifteenth of march and he he north ... ignored his\nWife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong feminine premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their premonition stole Manny\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree\nBecause I don't think people believe them they don't leave their intuition\nAnd then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know\nThat said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they ... the guard things which could be dismissed that superstition is always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was about horse racing and ... one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spit on something else and lost\nIn ... in the movie screaming at you knew you knew you knew that's a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that it is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fair I think people are they don't believe that they don't\nBelieve in also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth will have another body experience during surgery and then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up to ... to tell the doctors and nurses\nUm what they thought and what they heard while they were out of their bodies is one patient with blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the patent on his\nDoctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded there was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no she was a he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on\nAnd then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put his statues\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right\nBack but then then they said I didn't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wild yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat ... what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related to the I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous\nOr mystical their mysterious Israel different words are being used to describe the same event so I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component\nYeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] oh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live our routine nine to five eight you know day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp

you know the cleanup of begins lung jak hello him Fox News this monster storm devastated the Gulf Coast enter panhandle orders governor Rick Scott the devastation caused by hurricane Michael so many families have lost everything\n[noise]\nOkay welcome back to our final hour with Dr many made us we're talking about his work the borders of normal\nAs a psychiatrist in you do have to decide whether a person is truly experiencing a psychic issue or is a psychotic how do you tell the difference Manny\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone hearing voices qualities that would distinguish psychic I must say\nExperience for example of someone who is the voice I'm a psychotic hallucination tends to be very very frightening it's also very frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices\nIt could be the sound of machinery and insect\nThere may be more than one voice to or the voices talking to each other about the person they the voices might be a accusatory or threatening whereas I'm psychic hallucinations and to be infrequent\nThey may occur only once or twice in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and calming the other thing is with psychosis\nYou can't just look at one symptoms such as hearing a voice you have to look at the whole person\nBecause psychosis is the major mental disorder which affects the person's ability to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work\nOr within the family if they if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other symptoms aside from the loose nation for example the thoughts disorder or paranoid id Asian\nOr you know feelings of reference\nThat people are talking about them this type of thing so there's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nCan you make a misdiagnosis ... conceivable\nYes in fact it has happened there is a psychologist that did it an experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had to each one of them go to a different emergency room and had different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patients while they were patients they were actors pretending to be patient\nAhah but they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... they're admitted to the word they were given medication they didn't take medication and once they got the where the patients knew that they were faking so\nThey were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to fool the other patients\nNations knew how do they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal aside from the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their appearance their behavior the conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else and both of them was completely normal so that's why I say you can make the diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come the doctors could do that\nWell unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes\nWell that's true but the patients that\nI think because well the patients live with it they they know the illness so well\nThey know the symptoms and everything that's right\nAll right let's take some calls him for your duty in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting and waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot about brain I have been a mistake and had visions all my life and I have that many many near death experiences where I have left my body\nBut I think one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me is when I went to London as an adult and I saw a picture of the war room where they did all the major planning for their European front ... well that's where I used to go as out of body experience when I was little\nAnd there were a whole bunch of us up up above kind of sitting like in the balcony and we were all in spirit that not who's ... and they were very upset because I was so young and they didn't\nThink I should be [laughter]\nBut you did that as a remote viewing huh\nNo I ... I was out of the body travel [noise] and when I saw the picture of the war room I realize that's where I had been as a child\nAbuse still been able to duplicate that\nWell not lately I usually go where there is a really intense suffering like when the Israeli people and we were hiding under ... along with sewage canal yeah what was that the fifty seven more\nNineteen sixty seven sixty seven\nYeah um I I go to places that are are really really bad why I don't know whether I'm there to help balance\nWhat do you what do you think of as many\nWell I'm curious to know do you have these experiences when you're sleeping or when you're away\nWhen I was little they were when I was sleeping out the other ones where I'd been out of body I'm just waking up okay\nBetween sleep in and awake but the most interesting experience I think I've ever had is what I was looking searching for meaning because I was very depressed because I'm In physical form and there is no we're on\nThe love that you feel when you are in that particular place of knowing what all the companies seem love is\nAnd when I was during meditation or we think and\nI could see if you know what glitter looks like in a in a like a a helmet for a motorcycle helmet yes how different angles\nWell this was alive light and the whole screen of my vision was filled with is glittering beautiful different colors of orange and yellow and I could hear the voice saying this is love and I was\n... totally engulfed in it and it was just a beautiful experience but\nI found listening to people talk about near death experiences my near death experiences aren't when they're just\nI'm Out of my body and I'm seeing what's going on and I the last time it happened I was in surgery and as I came back into my body I could hear the the anesthesiologist saying we're losing her and I thought\nYou know he's saying I'm back here yeah\nAll right [laughter] but ... you know that type of stuff and that's the reason I I called was the question about what is the difference between schizophrenia and having these types of visions because I'd been\nOr I don't know that's that's kind of a fine line isn't it many\nWell yes and no like I said with had study where these patients were misdiagnosed because they reported hearing voices but otherwise they were fine so the question is whether the person can carry on with their daily life\nOr whether they're able to function or whether there's an illness that's interfering with their life so you can make a diagnosis just on the basis of the fact that person is hearing voices are having other body experiences that would lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia because\nSomeone with a diagnosis schizophrenia has to have a thought disorder as well they have to have problems with their thinking and with their emotions and you know with their parents with their behavior it's all encompassing so the types of description the description of the types of experiences you you've had doesn't sound like schizophrenia to me\nWhat about ... nations computer to actual psychic things what's the person they're\nWell there again like police nations can be found in a lot of different medical conditions not just schizophrenia\nThey can also be released nations and also be found in people who are mentally and physically healthy so you know I guess ... each person has to be assessed you know in terms of you know what their symptoms are and and you know how how much they're affecting that person's ability to function [noise]\nBut I was just going to say about your caller I was thinking maybe one of the reasons she goes to places when she's out of her body she goes to places of\nPain in the dark\nAnd places that are dark maybe he's trying to help maybe in some way she's thinking on a on a spiritual level she can help these people\nYou think she's doing it on purpose\nI think so I think there must be a reason why she is going to those places\nTo go to Joe in Monterey, California Joseph go ahead\nA donkey George or knock the matters are you a breath of fresh air and let me tell you think um [noise] I have a a two questions and I have a really interesting\nBut we're
