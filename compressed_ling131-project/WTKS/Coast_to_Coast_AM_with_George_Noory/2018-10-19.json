that's what your budget is it tells you what you can spend if you want to get your goals and you have a goal of twenty thousand dollars in one year and so you know it's like Seventeen hundred fifty bucks a month you're going to be paying on his car\nOkay which means you're not going to be doing some of the stuff you're doing now\n[noise] because you want it because you want the car and you want it paid off true yeah\nI mean so it's just you you just punch it in the face hard and fast hard and fast and you know I I think you can pay it off in a year and I think you should commit to doing that and then save up your emergency fund of three to six months of expenses and save up your down payment for your house I think you can do it\nHold on I'm going to send you a copy of the book the total money make over it'll walk right through the baby steps of exactly how to do what I'm Talking about I think you can do this if you read that book it'll show you exactly how to not only get out of that not only get your house but also become wealthy okay\nToby is with us in Topeka, Kansas Hi Toby our you\nI'm All right how 'bout yourself\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nHaving a quick question me and my wife are on step to um we plan on being get free within six months in the ... our\nOur goal is within two years to move now will be on step three um and my question is if we come in about five to ten thousand dollar short of our emergency savings fine but yet we sell the house for a pretty good profit ... some of the money from that sell the house\nInto the into the emergency fund in order to bring that up to date and then put the rest toward the house or how would you want to go about doing that\nI'm confused why would you come in short\n[noise] um just because we need to save up for some other things or she needs a car before we move out of town um and just with the money we be cutting in there and we come up maybe just a little bit short before you want to move but we do need to\nKind of um well you can do what you want to do I mean you're grown up you're allowed to there's no law on any of this but um yes um what what I Do I think when you buy stuff that's not an emergency before you have an emergency fund you are inviting Murphy to move in your spare bedroom\nOkay I think you're asking for trouble when I got an emergency fund in place I quit having emergencies there was the weirdest thing\nBut as long as I was broke my life looked like a country song\nAnd I think you're asking for it I'm so no I don't think her bond buying her cars on emergency and so it does not supersede\nYour ah your need for emergency fun now if you want to say three to six months of expenses is your emergency bonding you want to say well we're going to get to the three mark and then we're going to do some purchases and we may be put up a little bit more later\nBut we're comfortable with the three months of expenses emergency funds at least until we get her a car or whatever these other things are that you're wanting to do that's fine but I bought her cars on emergency\nIt's not\nShe's got a car\nSo that's how we know we don't usually emergency funds or it mark is in Orlando, Florida hey mark how're you\nDoing good and you better than I deserve what's up\nOkay so my girlfriend and I have been together for about three years or very young and we would like to move on and move forward our lives and get married good move in together good ah we don't know over financially stable though and we all want to be smart about it financially ...\nHow old are you Twenty one okay and what do you make\nA about thirty thirty five year mhm and what your career uh right now I'm just a warehouse worker okay so what's your plan\nI sure I I don't know if we should go and no no it wasn't your career plan or replace our yard and\nPretend like some young man who's a sharp young guy who's working in a warehouse she's Twenty one just walked into your house and wanted to marry your\nDaughter yeah what would you tell him I don't want to know what his dad gummed plan is right Yes sir how are you going to take care of this girl\nI Would love to take care of her like\nHannah I'm giving you a hard time brother okay if you're if you think about it that way if forces you to think about your long term prospects which is as her dad that's what he'd be looking at right he'd be saying OK skies a sharp young to\nBe not making anything right now he's working in a warehouse but everybody's got really got a really good career path he's got a plan and it's going to work out I mean by the time he's thirty one what are you going to be doing you know so I'm more concerned about that I think you can make it on thirty five does she have a job\nUh she in school and doing a part time job at a restaurant when does she graduated from school she has about another year and a half years okay and what were her degree being ah she's teaching\nOkay and who's paying for her school\nRight now her and her parents okay\nAlright would they continue that and she could complete and be a teacher while you're married\nTo ask but hopefully I think it would be a critical within\nOkay that's good so you could go ahead and get married and you'd have her part time income and you're thirty five thousand dollar income knowing that in a year Eighteen months she's going to be a teacher and your household incomes going to more than double it'd be making over Seventy ... close to eighty thousand depending on what she's teaching where she's teaching and all that kinda stuff right\nBut with a teaching certificate in Florida she'll she'll make good money\nAnd then you've got better prospects 'cause you're going to start thinking about what you want to be when you're thirty one is for taking the steps to be that so that when you're forty one year also a better one\nAnd fifty one year rich one that makes sense okay there\nSo I think you got the stuff to get married uh but I I'm more concerned about where you're going and where you are in a day\nTo answer the question of are you ready for marriage and I think you are you're sharp young guy and I'm obviously she's doing she's got a great career correct there so you know what I Would want you to answer for your own satisfaction I was poking at you and saying let's pretend it's her dad right but for your own satisfaction\nWhat do you want to do where you go ... let me tell you if you ain't nothing you'll hear that every time\nYou'll be thirty one year old warehouse worker and you don't want to do that there's nothing wrong with no shame and be in a warehouse worker but you want to be growing involving right yeah you want to be something better\nYeah I Want you to own the freaking where okay okay yeah that's how I Would look at it and if you got all that kind of talk through and so forth and then you got a game plan C I my goal was I was going to be rich and real estate when I was just what I wanted to\nI was dating my wife I was Twenty one I'll show broke I couldn't pay attention I had a daughter sixteen and my checking account\nI'm driving all on our second day in a Monte Carlo that had two hundred and fifty thousand miles a third engine and the second transmission had been hit on every side this car was a piece of crap\nFor driving along on a second date and I'm telling her how I'm going to be a millionaire and real estate one day and as rich as I said that we went across the railroad track them up for fell off my car\n[noise] so where I was right then was not indicative of where I was going to cause if anybody looked at where I was right there and there was no evidence to say I was going to be anybody but you got to be a minute something that that's what you got to be doing this was a diver actually show [noise]\n\nHey guys this is James child producer of the day Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now carried on ... radio stations across the country to

is because end PCs non playing characters are easily programmed\nOrganics the ones that are that they use a good I'd say critical analysis of the ones that will not be programmed and they are the ones that are going to try and pull us out of whatever it is rent otherwise we'll be mesmerized by this online magic Chris geo will go back to ground zero it's good to have a year\n[noise] um let me finish up this point I was making real quick about the politics because here we have the mainstream media I'm putting out a program and the program has been racist racist racist racist thrown at the White House right and then all of a sudden Kanye West shows up\nAnd he has this meeting at the er at the White House and what I saw was the dissolved meant of the ... agenda\n'em to divide on race and then the mainstream media turns around and uses a derogatory term against ... that I Will not repeat on this broadcast via word but it\nIt goes a yes and ... to show how the script all of sudden changed

looking at going this guy's a white guy calling another guy a Whitey same with what happened with ... we have a a a black faceless and PC\nOn uh CNN calling Kanye n n word that can read\nIs what he said\nExactly and so all of a sudden what happens is that the script just changed on the PCs and they don't know how to handle this and it just goes to show they're just running a script or that they've been pre programmed to it so um you were talking about numbers and numbers so symbolism\nAnd a numbers play a big big role in this you were talking about the ... and PC means the way the means or ... and so on and so forth I mean there are so many different levels that we can take this to mom\nFrom what direction do we break this down in because well I just it's huge I just want to point

always sometimes yes if I'm stressed I probably will not see them the best way to learn to see or is this just look beyond the person or in a dimly lit room he'll say something and then over a period of time increase\nBut it's a very very important and understanding what they mean the colors and the\nShaped very very important charge so again the artist you\nKnow I I Can't do the do you remember the a K C story where he was getting on an elevator yes he could see or has and he looked at all these people in this elevator he couldn't see any or is it scared the heck out about how he didn't go in the elevator and the elevators the cable stamped on the people died\nYeah you gotta love Casey [laughter] oh my God [laughter] absolutely George Norris reminder as a psychic\nWhere do you get your I'll call it power where'd you get it from\nI don't think power I oh God that we're really trying to think a lot of people say that and I think on the God as the ultimate power but the rest of us tune in and I tried to help people I've had a radio show four more years and I can remember\nAnd it's actually afraid to call in I'm very happy to a ... and that's the question whether we have the power from we all get our energy from life for us we get it from God at the moment we take our first breath to retake last breath so\nThe energy for us to you and I chose to use to help people\nPeople people listen to the show love animals joys and many of them owned them what happens when that pet that animal passes on\nThat's a great question oh it's all connected to our animals [noise] well you know when my cat died we were so close they came to me that night and you know mom I'm fine\n[laughter] I don't want you to worry about me\nWhen I lost my dog he came to me and a little hospital bed the night he died he was lying on his side it's either I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I pass but I'm okay now I Know it's so crazy they called me mom they really think that your mother\nSo animals and that's your question try to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go\nBut they do have are really as we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but\nI I don't want people to think that two sides it right\nSupposed to go when you're supposed to go and you know so a suicides are a whole different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicides\nGeorge Burns\nYes don't do it [laughter]\nNo you'd asked me if I see ... and I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have them ... you also have\nA feeling is it's like ... are you a sense and you're feeling that's very intuitive so you can feel it presses or like when you're with and there are a field is that what you mean George\nYes oh wow that's impressive Sophia with depressive who is not that good you would just step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who what I call psyche\nVampires but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I tried to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories\nWhere they've changed and people begin to like them again in surround themselves are on the person but I get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of healing and that's terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary for that's a wonderful form of healing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates ... the mumps day in year and then if they want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate Joyce\nSure that'll be great however you run a judge I think that's\nThe one that started with Christian Tampa Bay Florida Chris are born on October ten on October sixteen Nineteen Seventy October sixteen Nineteen Seventy Hey Chris welcome\nOh thank you [laughter] happy birthday [laughter] I don't have much more than one\nOkay so ... tense exchange so you have a really wonderful new cycle beginning but it has to do with creativity you have a question Chris\nOh I'm very much a creature routine and I just wanted to give their routines and our break his routine you're boring after a while\nYeah but here in Tampa that area's not boring it all to shift their and Tampa is a terrific area and a team effort to any kind of painting or art work\nI'm I'm a I used to I I Do some writing now\nYes well you have Martin guard go at the time you were born and that tells me that you're you're extremely intuitive and you're very caught up details when you paint you shouldn't be painting again that's very therapeutic pie crust\nAnd that'll bring and wonderful spirit energy as well so you have a lot of intuitive ability is you have enough now in ... so I Know you can read people very quickly so I thank you very much for calling it did you have a question\nNo that was there but thank you very much\nAnd Thanks Chris in Russia last year and there's nothing wrong with being in a routine is their Joyce\nNo but you know I sometimes have become really really discouraged and you say they have to be something else so at that point you have to it's very very hard to get out of ... really difficult for the most difficult things on the planet at that point you have to force yourself to do something you really don't want it to like whatever that might be\nA ... you know just just do it and go out you fit your energy will change change your energy and so on and change your life and tried prayer and meditation they know what God I'm really stuck and bring me something fresh and something no spirit will work with you\nDo you work with people teaching them a psychic abilities\nSure uh not only that but with the new website was starting which I mentioned before which is on my website we're going to be training people going to be helping them and uh in in all my books I say the same thing you don't have to pay a psychic for anything you can do this yourself\nIt's a God given talent that we all have just pay attention to your feelings listen to what you're hearing and stop doubting yourself and stopped saying it's my imagination\nYou know when you get that late night phone number going you're going to get a lot of insomniacs calling you\n[laughter] well that's okay [laughter] I'm probably up\n[laughter] to me I Hope\nIt's twenty four seven line so you can call in\nTo the ... got a question for you in Canada and the international line I David go ahead\nYou're more than a third good lady um passed away last Monday of this thing all designers they lived ... Nineteen forty seven and then he was ... okay well good woman or if you might be able to\nHave to tell you she thought very highly of you and you know she puts her hand out on your Dave and she says Dave I'm fine and she's also thanking you did you help her to cross over to help her before she passed\nA law was not there three other than your friends or with Lou and she's a\nShe's a very generously had a very good heart and she said thank you for saying that she thinks she thanking your day so you must have been pretty pretty nice to her\nSaying she was the greatest one of the greatest I mean I can tell her energy is extraordinary very good heart interests\nKind you could ask for anything she would do anything for anyone but to have you not different from that yourself you very much like that you have a very good hurt yourself and don't create for her she's saying look Dave I'm fine\nYou know Jewish we're not going to escape that'll that'll probably not\nGoing to happen to all of us are hopefully later sooner [laughter] what a user anything people can do to kind of mentally prepare themselves for this this trip yeah\nDon't be afraid and know that you're never alone even if you go through the tunnel that\nFollows the physical death even then you're not alone you have always you always have an angel or a guide with you and then when you cross over to the other side it's fabulous you created by people you know it's a big party and those of us who left here are grieving somewhere probably you know feeling really bad about it\nBut it's a joyful for them and if you watch the movie defending your life one of my favorite movies I don't know if you've seen in George [noise]\nThey really don't care Meryl Streep is in it and it's terrific she says\nOh my five children she passed away\nAnd she lives on the other side and she had five children that she left here and she said oh there'll be fine and that's the attitude to have to have that too in grade on the other side and we need to do that to here don't grave now more than you have to\nOkay so she probably than super center I'll tell you that you are very honest forthright person and you're always speak your mind and you tell everyone exactly what you think they need to hear with her she's really a big baby she's super sensitive ... she's got to be very emotionally upset\nYou know what your honesty is great but in this particular case to be happy to her\nTone it down a little bit you know just say well maybe this is not the right thing to say to her at this time\nSo it's like seeing the dress looks great when it really does\n[laughter] I'm not asking him to lie down in the very honest person that's the problem uh so uh and where she's super sensitive so what do you understand what I'm saying right\nOne hundred percent you're spot on whether it's a bad dream me\nGod Bless you with that I think you'll be happy\nAnd I know sometimes a little lie that make somebody feel good choices\nThat we've all done it [laughter] I mean like\nLike to see you see somebody at a party and go oh you look great and maybe they do but at least you're doing it to make them feel that\nPoint they'll start looking better because you have done them a huge favor you have a voice that menu to them so that's a terrific thing George\nHow are you still finding out the children are very succinctly inclined as well\nUp until the age of six or seven we have great pass I recall we have extreme intuitive abilities and then we start school and then kind of the honeymoon end\nWith the ah intuition things kind of a clamp down you don't have that free reign and children who are autistic are very very psychic and a lot of kids coming in now they're stuffy children those kids are extraordinary\nSo I don't know if she could crush it I don't even know what the crash [laughter] I wanted to give you that message in any case\nJudge jealous website is linked up at ... dot com it's

the author has got a number of books the most recent mysterious realities Robert welcome back my friend\nDebate dream weaving with George toys\nAnd looking forward to this would this tragedy that happened when you were three would you tell us again what happened\nWell first of all my mother took me from Melbourne, Australia where we live in West a stray that to see her on the opera singer and the psychic medium of mean caliber\nShe looked in the tea leaves the old fashioned when she saw that she didn't tell us she went out room came back white face while she was right that went to in ... Maine yet when my father had been transferred to the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died in hospital the doctor told my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they looked together and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that\nThat is one of the first experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books I must tell you George I don't remember anything much from what happened when I was out of by buddy age three members rather hard living on this afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\nWas I died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions and this is an appendectomy in an operating room and that time I remember what happened it sounds like the classic empty to begin with I found that the ceiling looking at the the the the the scalp all of the surgeons not money to be around going down\nDown the beach down to loosen up talk of some pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the

goes straight maybe\nI'm drawn into another world and we're I'm deceived by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that rather than I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bed back eventually out this evening to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked\nTo find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding there will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk to about this she tried to talk the adults that the medication you're hallucinating or something the first person who could explain\nTo me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is that oh yeah we do that we get sick really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same and sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings like coal dissociation\nAbilities of travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily and an understanding that there will be on the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I'm not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army's that we're moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you one of the things that kept me going is amongst mine is a book companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was the big man and a lot of white hair and a face\nTo come and sit on my they didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through your survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and one day or that you can't tell your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat's invisible companion George was the older brother younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and helped him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe have time travel is in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious overactive treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in their own time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a why is the self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that\nOne of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nBut it will lead in parallel lives this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from what we're living right now on may be radically different so that's part of what dream traveling mainstream traveling Olson means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then in conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding so look consciousness survive physical tests isn't it pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious not sold that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who come cooling those people to come calling my employer include a loving family members around says to the spiritual guides has some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind that science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey I'd also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams are wild and writes them down will notice that they dream of events before they happen one function of time travel we see the possible future we\nCan reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead but we also traveled into the past from this life and her mother lives you learned about connections with drama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods in the multi dimensional universe\nSo this is the key to dust and understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experiences papa dreamed travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my own experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and they're giving me permission to use this story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense\nOf Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually beyond the old and remind this was one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history about dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with a God or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the high of ... so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our time is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions and attitudes from a death on a more objective is to stay active then we can manage for our cells in indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dreams sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience I've lost the sense of a deep up ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully a live human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding fun to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step process to sharing adrift\nYou more of a story that makes it sound you can get it done and minutes you\nGet some help feed back in your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our dreams I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it to be let out so the rushed out of sleep the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family\nWe think that we should lie in the church in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch a good time to talk on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dreams because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams shell sometimes this is very interesting\nOn the other side of a blind spot for example so that's one direction but time travel but time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact you understand what our relationship with time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of Libya time altogether we step into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time ... future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times all together in those parallel times we're leading a power like this come very interesting when you begin to look at gifts and lessons you might have been in power little life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not at all the power alone I\nThink it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost at that time\nWill be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives of situations that people in far flung places feel proud of you know multi dimensional family\nI'm a bit of an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience but we have connected to dramas being lived in other places in time and that from a certain point\nOf view it's all going on now I wouldn't be doing what I I'm not doing or not found myself connected with an Anglo Irish men who came to the American colonies\nSeventeen hundred ...

I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him yeah I was in a graveyard I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name on the head start is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it or what I call\nShe's never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to a head start he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story it's a very great story I mean not introduce his whole themes about you know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat and to sudden\nGoal is to a certain place might even be an agent of simplicity but as I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on the day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a news story\nToday I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and in the these examples proliferate so ...\nYou know what it how it works is that the the attitude and the energy you're carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nWanted waking for waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack check what you're saying to you so drop the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs and be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know you need the brain to dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no\nBarrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to not to into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter of reality as a dense conscious so\n... there's no hope of separating mind and that are there always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there's the phenomenon but used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot and maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize\nWhat is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time\nMy blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hits like gosh are my blood is though they're going to have\nYou lived in pants and after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen gamble the white queen screams\nBefore she ... her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the Fort took place\nOn the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific proof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating the symptoms but he says but I couldn't possibly reporter people think I was looted you\nWell you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know things\nWe know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough about it in all of a sudden medic response was we pick up things from a distance from other people we feel what they're feeling in our body as well so that's part of the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell I'd give dreaming is way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guidance in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of loosened dreaming you would call it shut medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of talking on the loose and dream adventure\nIs to start out looser didn't stay lose what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming and the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay there's some romance an adventure still in the stream let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean I Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's grandma or someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic looser dreamy another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try lied state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psyche can intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night relax\nInto that state and make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the scenes will come to you the full to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive premium the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we got the how to look at simplicity outlook for signs and symbols in the world around you so this is also a program on a method all attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams themselves and misleading I think that our spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams in themselves\nDeceptive I mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems that are floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up some of the other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias that that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to is that is truly are owed\nCan be worked in the service of hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront these two on the ground you might find the
