wondering if someone could give me this ... procedure to shut down a unit that it went into because it is now ... that's the last winter I ended up with a problem when I went to stand up in the spring so I thought perhaps I had not done something that maybe should have been done and I wasn't aware of\nNow probably just bad luck window you know when you have an outside a central air conditioning compressor there's really not much to be done in the winter except that will we generally recommend is that you turn the power off to it and then you covered the top of it one that you don't want to do is cover the sides of it because you have to wait moisture move in and move out\nCompletely wrap it up I've seen people completely wrap them up like a like a like a holiday package bad idea because of Trump's a lot of moisture and so I can cause compensation and corrosion you really just want to cover the top to kind of keep leaves out but other than that you just leave it exposed and and nothing should happen to it as a result of that\nOh very good well I certainly will follow that next year because I didn't exactly what you said I wrapped it up like a package\nThing was attacking

to put like a weird life on it and make sure you get into the end of grade it will help a little bit but I mean the best way to stop that post rotting is more about the installation and what I Would recommend is this\nI Would use oppose told digger to dig it the whole just slightly wider than the post itself I Would put about four inches of great gravel stone in the bottom of the whole set the posts on top of that stone and then use the rest of the stone to fill around the post in\nTampa down they use a camping aren't if you don't have a tipping are and you can use the end of a two by four

I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm\nIt went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings\nThat was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment with a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about the what I at first stepped into here\nAnd ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it\nYeah well it's it's it's exciting because you can finally your pain the answers for yourself ... ... that said\nI think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give me an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience them in other words once you leave your body\nNo you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhen I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA ... than at the ... of the universe\nIt's just one of them yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I only seeing you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all the information in me why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human and has\nTo be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want to do anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent\nAnd then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you you have these experiences and you know they're real because especially they heal meal you and you explained the because usually not a language to really clearly defined\nWhat an idiot mention is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died or I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to it passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by thought and there was no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by soft ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols\nAnd it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity\nTo experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself there was no\nUm when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow your classes you teach them and really tell us what does look like when you have people come and

it's important people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience\nOr as science has been part of that so many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and the norm all over or their vibrating\nOr they're hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them in our signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call him out of body experience now important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean ... these when you are when people are going to be travels the game he mapped the brain argue make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth that has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh ah at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nA matter of fact there was one in each a we have two centers and uh there's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's\nPut it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror\nAnd every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night at on this class and I talk about\nHow to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how the remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught\nHe's more interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nA mind mirror it's just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to\n[noise] but that that\nThat's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and talking\nTo someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with Sarah herself with are multi dimensional shelf right and have the kind of experiences that\nThat a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have the ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's

travel and he's been doing twenty five years of research at the mineral Institute\nSedative or sixteen thousand participants who have gone through the ... e training at than than real Institute in Virginia and\nHe's come up with a commonly reporting phenomenon associated with these obese believe it's money if you could explain this to our audience [noise]\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last\nEight years okay but I've been studying\nNursing practice you know for forty or just to go on my website ... dot org I included a over a period of ten years I did a\nA number of surveys and I receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way\nAnd it's it was amazing how similar kinds of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance um [noise]\nA floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally to the experience\nBecause normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nOf Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through colors dial it if you're seeing through your clothes diluted at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness\nTo your non physical body\nBecause you're having it doesn't mean you've actually that your body but it'd be injured in the process but most people don't notice because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated\nThese are common things at a for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is I find that\nMany people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a face with your body is your fell asleep\nSo that that's I see\nOn because then half each I'm retired I Will switch and I think his muscles ... are you saying that now the money you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have found and what many other um experiences have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving at a face from our body sets with sleep is ... we take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we\nKnow about this from a scientific standpoint but what happens for that one third of our life we're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches\nOut of the phase with her body at night as a sleep and you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nLook ... image you're looking at\nIt's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream the can or they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural was breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... bc it temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't have any biological ... machine and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay\nAnd most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game\nLife and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell that you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into and it will be and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how would you know the difference between an imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay and you can have multiple experiences\nFor instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies\nAnd I was still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and\nI also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us\nOr we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just a download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present and when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOr what's going on and I think\nThis is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives until I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's not needing to be validated ... anyone other than you are\nRight I and it's very important that self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nAn avid believer and anything like that especially a religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see\nWhat's real and look beyond the programming that we all share a cause and that's an important aspect of this\nBigger and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience it and then you suddenly oh my God now I got it and it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report that you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... and also\nThe average age of first out of money doing things ... years old people recruit recount their cancer and it's often heated experience it happens over and over again but he declines during early teenage years why do you think that is really get that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to\nI Am more than my body it really does help you and your level of consciousness and forget about tiny problem in life that you feel are so large because our brains make them that way but surely they are insignificant when you compare and he'll\nHow vast our universe really is I'm Talking about being beyond our body yeah yeah\nAnd what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nYou know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance a political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff could you realize it's a temporary drama and and you understand there was a bigger game at foot here\nThe big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer a pawn of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's and that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his inner circle news that we yeah\nHidden ridiculous that's and you realize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest problem\nWith humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ... that's\nThe core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of a suddenly awoke one day and knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars there'll be no no ... none of that would occur ... because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connect it but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly all be connected to only the ones who want to be connected to [laughter]\nWell we go beyond the

I was scared to death I truly was and but right there at the end it was like a a breath of fresh air came on me and\nI wasn't worried about anything anymore\nMm sounds peaceful peaceful and he's is what it\nWas exactly peaceful\nHave you been able to recreate than experience I'm not a heart attack that feeling that experience of peace\nNow I Wish I could ... yeah I Would actually be great\nWell maybe that's maybe you can blame could he\nAbsolutely one of the things that people do reports\nWhen they have and out of body experience um is that they have this immense feeling of a love and peace that fly that just flows through them mhm\nUh I've talked about this many times um it's like you're entering into a some people report it like their entry into a sea of of love\nAnd I'm an acceptance and it's and it's like it's difficult to even ... there was no words to even describe some of these things because they're beyond our um our verb itch but yes I mean that's one of the reasons that people do\nA explore these experiences so they can ah let's just say connect with those higher aspects of themselves\n... now and and thank you very much give some clients he said it I mean has there ever been reporting of that and not a good experience to be is that you can't not right\nYou know like there has been an end to ease and nightmares in Oh absolutely\nIf your fear based if you've been brought up with this concept that there's a devil\nOr Satan around every corner waiting for you to pounce on you you're going to have like you made likely have negative experience your own fear will create it\nWhen we leave our bodies were entering into a very thought responsive dimensional space and that's what people forget it I I I say this all the time you know we're not observers of non physical reality we're participants\nEach thought is a creative projection and we are influencing the energy is around us we do it in the physical but slowed down here\nBut when you leave your body through near death experiences\nSame applies to um if you're doing ... San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do she experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs\nAnd to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative energy if you are going to create it\nWhen your mind is going to mold the reality around you if you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever\nThen you're going to manifest that is well well your creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment\nAnd you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had lived long lines where I went it was a specific dream I guess I don't remember but he could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got in the recycling helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person you don't know when you when I'm\nBrian ... owns a motorcycle and it was and it looked me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't the protection of anything and it was the name was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nWhich looks pretty bleak the honest and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because we can't each other yeah\nI'd I don't know that an adult locked out of body travel most likely mhm\nWell it could have banned but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there's consensus what I call consensus realities and there's non consensus realities\nThere's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality and they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist and in our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to start to learn these what is essentially the rules of nonsensical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here we're used to linear time\nRight it's the gravity we're used to\nYou know when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity all the things we're used to have to ... you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm In my workshops but it's also in my books but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing existence yes so\nThat will be prepared for this transition of consciousness I understand\nI understand they want to thank you so much lean has been great if you go to his left sandwiches astro info dot org you'll find out about all of his book and his courses in classes and there's lots of free information there as well and when we come back we're going to talk about his Colorado and some of the great history\nWas forgotten town that's Colorado\nSylvie back I'm listening to cook and\n\nThe hacking into ... I'm Jerry Thomas Fox News President Trump on the campaign trail again this time in Richmond, Kentucky to campaign for congressman Andy bars reelection as he has done in other rallies he went after the Democratic challenger in this case military veteran Amy McGrath\nAdvantaged news radio Ninety seven point seven FM at twelve ... am WG chaos [noise]\n\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am so my guess today her website it's called ... two legends dot com and I love the beginning of it says welcome to the blue moon hunted history chores we've been probably scaring the public since two thousand two Stephanie waters is my guest welcome Stephanie\nLisa I'm Glad to be here and I love that proceeding commercial about pain because gold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan [laughter] I'm going to scare the pie that's lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial say can you really shape the original is is that this is Jay anyway [laughter] come to the [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nAs well you send me your book and we do are you constantly in Colorado during a guy as shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history\nAnd it's really unassuming you can find things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience where we are normal\nWell this this I've been seeing go since I was the ... high to a grasshopper is what I always say I'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago\nIt was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and the unite the paranormal can you ... community and to also do some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friends dory spins and she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirits out of Longmont, Colorado\nMhm and so the two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community now we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and uh we've we\nCall it a ... feast because every year we tried to sponsor it in a different community and by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go bump in the Knight supposedly this stuff really happened and I got particularly interested in this after I found out\nAbout a journalist named Charles for and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them\nTo see if it was possible that these things really happened and so that's what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to ship for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book\nGhosts legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through shut the ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through sure going to cyber cancer and how do you how you reconnected your life would go what were you doing before then\nWell before that\nI like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nWhat do you mean seeing it you you\n... I see it and I actually feel it\nI'm just really like humans examples\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things\nI'm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack\nAnd I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes and\nI saw where it was at and we went back in there it was so I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nIn managing Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nYou know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this\nWe are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true we were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company\nAnd he got laid off when the company changed hands so my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email\nUm and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this\nBig beautiful old a craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts by I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter]\nExtremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us\nThat they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for it and we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house in five years\nAfter five years we could do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house ... what have you\nWell after us you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and an artist you know and it's\nVery iffy that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going roe [laughter] yeah\nSo I actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps\nDo what you want he goes my mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest the state so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything\nLike that while I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you pull out we we everything\nIn the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter]\nI Can't wait\nTill the ghost of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only ...\nTrue north or south was gone and you know they have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain and it ... the he was he must be leading the

the blue moon hunted histories tours in Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about the ... we were talking about men are few springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there wherever else in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nUm I think another reason why I'm that\nPeople were drawn to manage it springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pact between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe out there where paint and put down their weapons and and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nI went up there to the theater and the ghost is gone it worked\nSo the manager confirmed that snow that\nAll of this worked up beautifully\n[laughter] than eating now had she seen the operation of this and\nNot since the book has come out it was amazing\nDuring the time before the book\nYes oh yes she knew it was on it but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand six team\nBecause the theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball\n... that's good was reaching out for at least trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their stories\nThat yes but you seem to be the you like the public is for the east coast today [laughter]\nHe liked to have made it is it's meant to be one you have a wave really connecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live go go under\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you'll always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's hard to buy the goals that likes the little girl that bounces a ball isn't she you I'm like no leave in ... but listen friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere is no devious funds spirited\nNo no absolutely not if they are they're just kicking you being you trick here they are\nIn prison here by their own their own their own mind that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during nighttime so yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the ... and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I absolutely get picked believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes to come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning but I find the best time to actually look for girls if he wants to see them with your eye\nIs at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nThere's a transition time why it's\nThe if the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter hitting lends itself to the shadows does that make sense\nYes that does it make straps when you see the shadows people and the light changes very fast and it\nOnly I call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks and the lead into the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the police that you're living in now haunted him did you met with non salute\nLead the gas the ghost follow you right yes they\nDo on like two words it's very funny it's the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten\n[laughter] just kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and manage who were on a timer because whenever I Would walk underneath ... lights they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know what these certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says well why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter] yeah that's true [laughter] so\nThey really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights flash this this town is very haunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing uh my show in the if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah that happened to you too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tripping of life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd the did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause I think you're psychotic they're like oh well\nHave you tried to say it's happening at well so\nThey're like oh Archie especially you know how to do all kinds of magic tricks I'm like no really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that are there\nAre there other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and managed to springs that you know we're also carry that type of energy and absolutely\nSs part rain there oh yeah but you know this family hotel right there on that a native ... very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a a there's a [noise]\nI have heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down\nOn managed to springs and bolder and even as to part with S. with the infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see it light up light up with the red energy\nI find that very interesting and you know the natives he used to call this the spine of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountains this very sacred land it's very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine as you're right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of the world the pikes peak they believe was the naval of the universe I find that fascinating because maybe it's a portal\nYou know that's what I was going to ask you know why is what we need to get into this this is very fascinating I Love this stuff pikes peak gets very popular and it has a lot\nOf um a lot of stories around and hopefully I Know that you've written a lot about this and you can tell us about it and um we're going to take a break in just a minute maybe you can tell us a little bit about it after the break okay now the name of your book again is called the ... latest one you have

...\nWhat's the website again homeless visor dot com or just do move ... around\nHis news radio Ninety seven point seven ... twelve ... am WG chaos\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am my guest is Stephanie waters and we're talking about Colorado legends and lower and when we were talking a little bit before the break about pikes peak now there's many places in the world that have lots of legends and lower but this particular one pikes peak has\nA lot it's considered one of the\nMore usual places in the world as well as um because of its kind of rich waters in mineral rich area in that particular region of the u._s. can you tell us a little bit about your experience as many ... you know to be\nWell I'm pikes peak I think it was called T. T. V. A. T. that are have a I think that's what the native youths\nUsed to call it but they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of\nThe universe I just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nWhy why we called that connected to the mother okay yeah it's connected\nTo the mother and think about the native is the way that they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get\nUm father sky Mother Earth ... and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThat and the natives knew that it said of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it um during the pikes peak gold fresh\nUh produced more goals than any place in the whole world I Hope I have that right but I'm sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well yeah\nAnd if you ... I Love the show ancient aliens and they talk about that that we have a lot of UFO sightings over pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the\nAll metal mining camp especially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers to fly over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHere and cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that saw us so when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon was cleared daylight\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships and they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards with other than it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is\nAmazing and they were hollering they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally before there was like\nYeah it just it just I I find that fascinating because today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brushed it off as being an airplane but before we had\nOr a governor ... experiment gone\nExactly exactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the the ... mhm theoretically white powder exactly up and down sideways hovering you know like a helicopter ... a fascinating and they didn't know what to they there was no explanation now\nSo what I did was I followed it I followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine you would not there weren't a lot of people yeah\nBut a lot of people for this I mean just outrageously crazy and he followed his story in Kansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing\nAnd the story was consistent very much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's\nThere was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the world Wide Web could possibly know farmers in Colorado where thing that I mean this was amazing back then you know um what we you know we've had the telegraph\nOf them do you think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals there it's a conduit for a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as the director of the paranormal conventions and one of my friends is named ... and he lives in green mountain falls Colorado and um which is right underneath pikes peak\nAnd um he saw a big foot at home to his back door opened his door actually um [noise] he um the big foot actually rubbed at the high neon his screen door and he actually had some big hair\n[laughter] and um then\nHas really committed his entire life to the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal and he does live above green mountain falls back in these rock formations and there's Patrick lessen the rocks and I've been back there with him and so all of this myself\nAnd I believe it's possible you know a lot to be and why not\nBut have you seen in the writing\nA he believes that my friend he only if it's um they you know it's like stick figures I find this fascinating because they are elongated just a straight line a stick you know with too little like a triangle at the bottom and then a triangle on the top\nAnd then these long arms with triangles on the bottom of it it's very geometric cooking it's it's fascinating and my friend actually believe that his property is a poor hole\nWhere big foot is traveling ... and I know it might sound outrageous but why not consider the possibility\nThat may be big foot is a missing link maybe and maybe ... maybe he's coming in and out or maybe we're seeing I'm mainly seen something that happened and another time a long time ago I don't know\nThat's the fascinating today and streams and this was the upcoming just didn't vote and weekly free audio clip it must have for coast fans look for the pre sign up on the coast to coast am

Institute in Virginia and William sounds as a suicide Hitler therapist and he guide you\nThrough these incredible states as consciousness and I personally know that things just from my experience it lemony him more civilian welcome\nTo the shadow [laughter] thanks for joining me William\nHi how are you feeling good side he'll\nTell me first of all what led you to even create this tendency I hang out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own ah I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer and then there should be impossible but I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and\nI decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him\nSo I began to investigate it and found that there was methods to self initiate and out of body experience so I explored them and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having the daily exercise um I initiated my first\nFully conscious out of body experience and it was it was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change or\nSomething you had to leave your entire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality has shifted\nOh yeah it is that now you had your out of body experience was South Indian state wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a hit in the\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to\nDeveloped other techniques to help or negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your hope he will get you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um\nI was actually in a dorm room are going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after a series of days went by\nA one day I was sleeping on my side not our when I become aware I've realized that was vibrating differently it's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached the arm now\nOh no I was not ... I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may um but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was ... at the moment with a little bit shocking\nI was a newbie I had no idea\nAbout what I had first stepped into here\nAnd uh over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's it's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... ... that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the doctrine\nIt'd society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional when I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them\nAnd you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all the information that the human being why would the universe just create one type of human being it doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and and not all human and it has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent than than we can that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and union or their meal because they feel real you know he was playing because usually not a language to really clearly defined what an idiot mention is\nUniversal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle\nWho to it passed and all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols\nAnd it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself there was no\nUm when I teach my classes I there was no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say\nTo go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow you're constantly eat teach them in ruins you tell us what to look like when you have people come and I called in after all tourism many [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great invasion him only\nTwenty four people can attend it's a world renowned\nAs being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm generally what I each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah these Akron as ... and\nUm what is that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in personal isolation both and I speak to them when we're doing a technique\nThat have died but they are law store for instance someone that may have died um quickly I never just disoriented and they may need some assistance I can do that that type of thing does happen quite a bit\nAnd job at at ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses\nOn that type of guy called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um [noise] and to let's just say a system to go to higher dimensional space\nMm mhm so to assist them in crossing over have you ever done this after\nA a\nTragic incident national tragic incident where ... pistol Reno one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven and myself and I received a lot of contact\nOr during that period of time um that was a that was one of the original facts where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way badge and you're having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body it's called ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people\nThat we're shifting those are people that died\nThis is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and it it's it's functions in different names and different cultures but nothing that I went\nTo ... we we presented in I think I'm more or let yourself very grounded in a scientific waves at least a scientific as we can ... that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented\nIn a very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really loud person to have their own experience with that I Want to find out a little bit more about what other cultures I got this and what it called the cops\nAre going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about what other countries just exist and and also a little bit more on how you can you do on your own and and we're like apple against million bum and I am ...
