{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "Because of the properties are actually owned by the ... you\nThe items are owned by the trust if you don't do that than the trust says no benefit that's called funding the trust re titled ... everything you own end of the name of the trust\nWhich is a bit expensive two and a lot cumbersome\nUm consequently I was reading in financial planning magazine the other day article that said Seventy eight percent of the trust that are formed a never fun to meeting people pay their stupid lawyer their financial advisor thirty five hundred bucks to build distress and then they never retired all the stuff into the name of trust which means that trust has absolutely nothing it's got nothing in it\nAnd so it's so it's absolutely no value\nSo I don't use living ... uh I don't personally use living trust and I have a substantial network with a lot of detailed estate planning\nNow I Do have some trust I have a couple of trust here or there but the they have different functions then what this guy is describing and she'll know I Would not build trust now you can set up and you have your attorney or a state planning attorney do this not your financial advisor I trust to a family trust to be formed upon your death\nAnd upon your desk the money if both of you die and yet minor children the money goes into a trust and then it's management to go to the children was talking about that and the first segment of the shower\nAnd um or a second second this hour I guess but you can do that that's that's not that hard to do and it doesn't really cost anything because there's no trust being formed in no trust happening unless both of you died I had that in my will when my children were minors\nAnd then of course my will has changed since the children are of age\nThey're no longer legally children\nEmotionally either for that matter but there we go\nSo I mean some of you have children that are emotionally still minors but of chronologically moved on like the guy [laughter] Thirty years old when he did it for a living is that I'm a stay at home son I'm a stay at our own sun what\nYour butt in the street [laughter] Mike is with us Mike since she got into my ...\nI'm good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I uh have a baby step too I have a kind of medical bills um and recently I was originally paying ten bucks a month for a medical bill that I had a they stopped it was an automatic withdrawal and they stopped taking out and they've sent my account to\nCollections and then to a lawyer and refinance film into court mhm I'm I'm just trying to figure out what my\nOptions are what if I Need to hire a lawyer or what I Need to do\nHow much is on that bill a Fifteen\nSixty one thousand five hundred and sixty okay and what's your household income\nOr about Seventy five thousand dollars for him and what ten dollars a month because of all the other bills\nYeah I got all campaign a hundred dollars in medical bills and a lot of credit card as well student loan so what's what's the total medical bill balance\nOf all the medical bills and I have are probably Fifteen thousand dollars mhm [noise] and my daughter just was diagnosed with a few other medical issues that more bills will be coming so\nHow old we get a dollar and a three okay and what were the medical issues\nOr she has a called ... syndrome a carry mail formation and then she was diagnosed with epilepsy ...\nOkay you gotta do you guys have a hard time with this little baby girl honey\nYeah yeah she's got a few ever since she was born to have a lot of things going on [noise] ...\nAnd how much credit card that do you have\nA we are probably at twenty five thousand dollars\nMhm and how much did in London you know\nThat one up there that's about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars ... who's a doctor [laughter] I'm just a teacher my wife has stayed on my\nCar [noise] All right\n[noise] um well what normally\nHappens if you have a heart and you're a good person and you have a baby that is sick you pay all of your attention to the baby and it drains every drop of emotion\nAnd love and concentration and focus out of your family your body and your life and it's all directed at this baby\nAnd that's just that's what's happened to you which just means you're a good dad and the good husband\nYou guys are not paid attention to the money at all and all that means is your human but his screwing up your life now and you're going to have to deal with it right yeah\nSo as tough as it is I'm your daughter is not going to get one hundred percent of your attention anymore I'm your money's going to have to get some percentage until you get this thing back under control so let's put the student loans if they're not already on hardship referral\nUm if you scrape together five to seven hundred dollars on offer it to the attorney on this Fifteen hundred dollars is a lump sum\nSettlement they'll take it okay because we call today or who ... federally call today and we said you know we ... what can we do and they just said um you either pay the full amount or cheese and attorney fees or hire a lawyer and when the when court okay\nYou're going to come back and say I've got five hundred bucks I can use that for a lawyer or I can give it to you to settle this debt which one do you want to\nBe okay and what if they don't take that and then you\nYou keep messing with Russian weather and messing with them\nBecause they're listening or you're dealing with an attorney you're probably not even dealing with a paralegal\nYou're dealing with a large law firm that runs medical collections through like a ... in a factory this is your life at your daughter is the illness and the struggles it's got a lot of emotion tied to it to them they have no soul there is nothing to this thing except you're just a number on a page\nAnd they have a whole bunch of numbers on a page they talk to her style thousand people like you every single day and they give everybody the exact same script\nOkay this is not like you owe me money and I called them we would actually talk about it yeah you're dealing with a robot in a factory and if you get that yeah duck in your head when you're talking on the person on the other line it's emotional to you it is not to them\nIt's a robot in a factory\nLike a movie okay and just keep that amount and just keep going well I don't have that so does that computer for you you know can you compute that I don't have Fifteen hundred dollars and that may go into court or you're taking me to court doesn't make me have Fifteen hundred dollars I simply do not have it I Do have five hundred and sixty two and you're going to have every bit of that\nOkay and if you have every bit of that you have to get a settlement in full no I Will not give it to you as a partial payment to get started no I'm not going to put this on payments that hasn't worked for me and it hasn't worked for you but I Will settle this with you\nFor pennies on the dollar and you're going to be lucky to get that 'cause I got so much debt coming out my ears from this little girl that I'm pretty sick or you people and I'm thinking about filing bankruptcy and giving you zero anyway\nAnd you are having these conversations with these idiots okay now you legitimately all the money so we got to work with them but you know you just keep it all ended\nUp its ... ended up going to court\nIt ended up going to court then they will take a judgment against you you don't need an attorney you're going to lose okay because you owe them money and they were in before the judge and the judge says might deal with the money and you say yes and he goes guilty [noise]\nRight oh it as a matter if we tell them you know my daughter's fifth grade I had all this year hair [noise] I don't I don't care if the industrial side of the medical world\nThey don't care I'm Sorry I Wish they did but I don't so I just try to satellites and then let's put together a system that worked out of this whole mess I'll help you put together the whole system in financial ... university and I'm going to put you through that for free\nYou and your wife are going to get your arms around the money thing so you put yourself in a position of strength to walk through the rest of the junior really

though there are two sides but liberal and conservative that are fighting against one another\nAnd that is that that is the main fight\nBut what we're seeing if somebody is asymmetrical we're seeing something that's a patchwork of affiliated in surgery or insurgency groups and we have counterparts engaging in fights in skirmishes along overlapping edges of other networks that are demanding your support your attention occasional\n... and then this leads to occasional high value terror attacks windows terror attacks happened there turned into political radicalization points about things like

there's no official word to be called the\nWars with it all of us were angry about everything what radicalized about everything we have an opinion about everything but it doesn't seem to be ... or or

let it happen\nYou know I Want to know why I Wonder if I Want to know why you know people I mean if you look at some of the videos I had them on my Facebook page and I said to myself why does this happen in my community why is this happening in my town\nAnd I said you know be prepared for anything I wasn't prepared to see I mean for the first time in my life I was angry about what I was seeing you saw this old man probably scared out of his wits\nBeing abused being yelled at having a baton ... she gets caught I mean it it's not just the mobs it's not just the anti fights it everybody everybody's pissed off everybody's radicalized drop something stop being so damn radicalized\n\nThat radicalized we might as well call it's a civil war in this country and and it's not because we have a union and Confederate see we have several groups that are pissed off but want to be heard to want to be known that will do anything in their power to do it\n\nGo to Jack in California hijacked or on ground zero\nYeah so right now we're in an unconventional so or at least that you\nKnow it's an unconventional all it's a civil war this is how civil wars are fought in in modern times it's not about dying it's about fragmenting it's about I mean some people will die and some people have died because we've had these terrorist attacks we've had shootings we had all these things going on and no one's going to call it it's a civil war I mean what what what I expected\nShow if you compare it to our first so\nOur civil war was the first civil war this is Don unconventional what you want a Confederate union you're not going to get it it's not going to conventional is the way civil wars are fought in the twenty first century\nWell I think a President Trump acknowledged it when he referred to the angry mobs and\nThat's another thing you know civil war President Trump has no power let's he wants to enforce a sedition what'd you haven't done so I mean he has the civil wars there are no power the president will now be ... to do what they want anyway\nAnd the argument with egg lady Klein at the doors that looked like a scene out of the walking dead ... exactly right\nBut you know what's interesting is some of the tactics that are being used like a giving out a personal phone numbers of people in their addresses yep and confront people at their whole set restaurants in the halls of Congress\nRight and this is this is ... this is conversion theories what it does is it can ... people over to be the same way it starts the domino effect if one person decides to harass another person or another person or another but it all happened\nBut it happens it happens I mean you know a ... Maxine Waters said to harass people she should have been taken in and she should have been talked too but she didn't she got away with it and now people are doing it\nWell Maxine Waters and uh what's the guy's name Corey Booker or something like that Cory\nLet her know but anybody who sit there and encourages this type of a yes\nThey've been encouraging this type yeah anger\nYou know immediate other to the media doesn't to encourage you to\nWell I I think it could lead to assassinations because if you look in our past oh we never we used to\nHave abortion doctors that were assassinated ... and and this is the level of hatred that we're at right now that the you know if you're confronting somebody in a restaurant or at their home who's to say that they don't have a gun and they're not going to assassinate somebody\nThat doesn't mean you have to act like an emotional zombie just because you don't like a certain individual that just wants to know you don't\nWant Argentina in the United states doing quiet and you don't do\nThat no we don't you try to tell people they can't believe that it actually happened and he did and it's happening again you're in the United states because the people are involved Henry Kissinger ladies and gentlemen Tony talked to a hundred already by by Tripoli except at three thirty seven hundred history really fix every three thirty seven hundred will be back\nThe sea savannah is news radio Ninety seven point seven am in twelve Ninety am double duty chaos [noise]\nThis online bank for closing on how they even have documents that I signed for home equity loan only I didn't want a nightmare\nShe's the victim of a devastating crime called mortgage fraud your ... title and mortgage are kept on line where thieves foreign and domestic hack them it's simple they forward your title and borrow every penny of equity you happen to your home like this police officer\nI Know about title fraud sore register with home title walk and discovered some things had already taken over title thank God I found out on time\nNo bank identity theft program or insurance protects you hope title lock will for pennies today hold tight to lock puts a barrier around your homes title and mortgage the instant it detects tampering there on it helping to shut down\nFind out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar shirt free with sign up this at home kind of luck dot com\nHome title luck dot com\nWhat happened you used to go hours without visiting the bathroom now it seems like you're constantly getting up to pay and you're even getting up at night to go this is not okay\nListen the makers of super ... to ... the number one prostate formula are introducing a new wonder pill super bay the prostate piece three advanced with three key ingredients that are great for your prostate if like picking free ... supplements and want\nTo celebrate we're sending free bottles to men who want to cut down on bathroom trips yes your first thirty days supply is free pay shipping and handling just dial hounded two fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word not OK\nEarly research suggests that an ingredient in ... three advanced may help support an normal prostate sauce combine that with a production and urges to pay and you have a formula you'd be crazy not to try try ... three advanced free dial pound to fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word not okay\nAgain dial pound to five zero and say the key word not okay because radio\nNinety seven points to have an ... ... am Kevin Eugene chaos not\nJohn in Oregon Hi John you're on ground zero inclined to go on\nA [noise] a a not a long time it was actually put a a big fan for some older I'm very sorry to hear about that the way\n[noise] ... that's terrible I Know my thinking\nOh I I see myself this weekend a roasted ...

I'm UN ambassador in part because she was a you know governor of his state to more of an executive function so\nShe certainly extremely opinionated in into the you know the Trump\nYou know kind of foreign policy line to AT T I mean I I think you know it's not surprising to the extent that Haley may want to follow the path of perhaps the person that will replace her who is Dina Powell Powell is resume reads like somebody a hundred years of age or even though she's forty\nFive she was with the administration now she's with Goldman Sachs investments\nWell I mean not only was she would this administration she was with the Bush administration ... you know she started off in turning with Kay Bailey Hutchinson and went to Dick Armey I mean this girl really knows how to move and shake and I think if they can wind and you know she's an extremely close associate of ... I think you can really\nUh uh uh ... uh diminish or discount the idea that that uh evocative Trump is going to take this position she says she's not going you\nKnow she's not a dog but I think if they can\nCan cook Joel or you know twist Dina Paulos arm to take this it would be far better than Margaret now here's the current ambassador to Germany I this girl has got you know she's got a ...

it's crazy but let me ask you this John because I Know you've been a staunch supporter of this administration have you ever seen more up ... in two years with members of the cabinets or his own staff\nNow I think it's pretty safe to say that ... there's the turnover rate here\nIs a you know a unprecedented on the other hand you know you want people when they are who are you know better and brighter type folks I think Haley was an outstanding UN ambassador ah and I think she just had enough of it I think that you know that's a really tough job especially today\nAnd you're just button have all the time so I think she wants to kind of move on to other things and pass the baton there was some speculation that she might even run against Trump but you know this is just absolutely hogwash\nThat likely scenario is that she'll probably be Trump's campaign manager in two thousand twenty I mean she completely back you know the Trump White house and we had a ... wouldn't mind seeing

least impactful social media platform on the Web to killing\nMugele has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus from so hopeless\nIs is a Google of a social networking platform and it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter in in the Google space that I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um there's going to be missed\nWas going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put in the ads on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy or his book\nSo there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got\nKind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have the as you got to have the sponsored post you got to have these things that are ... your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's been going on\nBut sizes everything was social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\nWell I'll say right at the top of they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't as they found that in a during a if I understand that during their on auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical possibility but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're a theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that law that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation\nAnd they cut us out on it and write and now of course it kind of makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but by the it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting a demotion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place um and uh it would've been a lot better all around if they had\nIn the meantime all of us who've and using Google Plus all these years of trying to find other places to go we're experimenting with other things that are mentioned that there that Google's commercial versions of cocoa puff\nWhich operates further Gees we the the the uh this the systems where you pay about five bucks a month or per head using us that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially [noise]\nUh and and we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf was probably not a good idea and the first place\nAnd that's a time at ... at the end at the time well it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that an enormous growth\nHas now trip them up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question I hear snapped ... where do you hear\nA apparently Snapchat having all kinds of all kinds of problems um I guess their stock has been a walloped yeah that's a very well uh their their founder has been sending out there you know kind of messages to the troops the kind of try to cheer them up\nUh it it it appears that some pretty serious mistakes were made along the way when they when they tried to grow a that's that can happen when you're trying to grow rapidly ... you can live off the ball and you're and you could really a\nFall flat later on whether or not snapshot ... step that will be able to pull out of this I I don't know but right now that they're not they're certainly not the uh uh the star of of the moment like they were some time ago\n... thanks Lorna appreciate it up next an end the upside down thinking

a number of phenomenon that suggests that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine or I talk about near death experiences and if you'd asked me a few years ago what your experience\nI Would if that isn't that just a nation that happens when someone that out to a guy like a evolutionary mechanism that allow people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple\nUh first of all what's described in near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness is not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain with either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as they ... out of body experience so the person out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body out near death experience and it accurately report what happens so that it suggests some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark Goldberg dot com is linked up for you it's coast to coast am dot com the name of his book we're talking about an end to upside down thinking on

the upside down thinking\nMarch ... what did your peers say in your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise them\nAnd it's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that uh but I think as I told people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up with the ... cycle ... he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research the new\n... absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled studies that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chose videotapes of various anchor people and ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in presents men experiments measuring the skin response\nAmazing work now psycho Comey says\nThe ability to move objects with your brain what did you uncover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the materials paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world\nWhat I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled or once again that show very subtle effects and they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies\nAnd he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and one's in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have if you present heroes and fifty percent ones over time\nWhat the experiment does is asked people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room so they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more once in a zero again what\nDo we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible response is during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators more just went ballistic\nAnd and people do people have that ability or have\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers\nAnd what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world around events that we know\nAre produced heightened emotions and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant ... basically at a at a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers\nBefore the event that\nBefore the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nOr a yellow her you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did\nFor psycho Comey says she had the ability to bend spoons keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who say dollars trickery its magic but the the ... believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nCandidate B. taught can cycle can ... be taught\nWell I've heard of of spoon bending parties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually\nBending metal for example and early ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw ... than the ones\nThat there are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gal are very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier there's another document that I include in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons ending\nWithin the context of remote viewing mhm bellies and what they say\nIs a direct quote from a classified document where he was he was put under very I mean they were watching it closely what the documents that is\nAs a result of Keller success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated paranormal perceptual ability and convincing and unambiguous matter\nSo yeah there has been a lot about him but the documents suggest that study it around and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the ability that maybe he was able to get things using his mind that down totally crazy\nMark would you give out your website and where people can get your book\nShore my website is my name mark over and they are gay G.

tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up short this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond his nation perhaps it gives us into a window into a reality that we typically do it with her eyes that I I think we should explore this went further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies\nSo this is where people have\nTheir in cardiac arrest ever sat the hate it and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than asking people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in cardiac arrest severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later I'm One example in particular is\nFrom doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room\nIt was later found to be that the federal later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the time were being stamped and we know when that April later went off and it made it very distinct it's down\nAnd yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard in boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experiencing memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia that division of perceptual study that the med school has looked at the very closely and Dr Bruce scraping as one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you described where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see but they're out there\nThat such an important point\nI think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems and show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you've learned a lot haven't you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist\nHey bill Hi George Hi Hi\nI Am a rational a fewer than a materialist however I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and he's in ah where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious as goes\nUh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious and she was like there is no God or no devil I Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe saliva new term for it I Would call it may be\nSeeing your Larry to you know space no time a dimension but my question do is to physically [noise] uh I like to\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded pins in X her aunt antidepressants or major tranquilizers neural ethics\nThat chemically the brain and their work they do affect chemical you the consciousness meaning of the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain is through the headaches\nGoing back to ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and in the mind and that's my first part my second part of the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious of the minds it does seem to show it here's my question for your doesn't that show that if\nThe mine in the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the mine is connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill\nAnd this is something I Do address in the book and I thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that\nCorrelation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another we can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's a simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise]\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire\nSo I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness damage the brain you you take psych med\nThe brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain and conscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhat ... what do you think mark reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence\nFor it we we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just does remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified my medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities\nThat are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life and in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from wanting to distance to another often simply\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nHi George and why I have a question for your gas sure how\nUm we were able to use what I understand the remote viewing from a section of yes three intelligent shop where there was a coal location for a boss and some buildings\nWere able to find that three UAB and the person I Believe who was the remote viewer there was brought in a was ball and I believe he was an albino which is I Know it sounds odd but\nUh he spoke broken English I Believe he was Israeli descent from what I can get\nUp who I dealt with over there mhm my question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in a remote viewing because of his I guess you would say non English or non American\n... uh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality is more than ... ...\nYou are\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\n\nI Would say that's consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trends or certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something with the mind around\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has our he's outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the whirlpool analogy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their ... and the access water that outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us\nYes sir so you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately it with me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I uh [noise]\nA

talks about Detroit was consciousness\nWilling to sound like you're open to the possibility that there's something very unusual going on\nYes I'm In my work it might work I've often not often but several times over my career I had the opportunity to accompany a rural folks farm folks on ... with water which\nIn yes okay I've seen it work see at work and then seeing the drillers calm and drill right to that same to adapt and there it is on\nThe water and there it is you know again I'm a scientist okay so it's not that that there is this something there that we don't fully understand\nThen can we say that it's the ... the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's pose that uh the Dow is er and I've seen it with three different methods brass rods willow sticks and ... over a map\nOkay I'll watch pendulum over a map which was the most strangest one of all that somebody could could could find water in yet\nThere it is up comes the water [laughter] so are is the Dow is there a particularly sensitive to the electromagnetic flocks in the earth caused by the water moving through various layers of conducting semi conducting insulating properties who knows\nWhat she has a scientist we need to we in science cannot ignore this cannot\nIgnore this going all the way back he your your guest mentioned William James okay all that whole period when all of this a lot of his early early research started into shall we say five ... ... and other other sorts of things and I I I\nNever seen a U.S I never see what I could call a UFO the night sky and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw when I never did before but I saw two\nYeah so I Can't I Kevin put up all this stuff that has to do for instance a desert tortoises will show up at the mud hole the desert tortoise in the southwest will show up at the mud hole prior to when the\nRain comes out within within you know maybe that's something to do with the change in the air pressure and they know that feeling yeah they can feel it it's it's they're reading comic but to the to the to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin say the things Steven just said we're on our way isn't it\nYet even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomena much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough\nAnd that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's\nA academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure so that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but\nHe's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field a physics\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counterintuitive there's a phenomenon known as entanglements and the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one\nYou affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect which suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance\nBecause he thought the speed of light what the faster than anything the travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between ... particles so there are things in the ... of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do it late\nThis it opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to think like altruism which if we're all connected and helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that it has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank

news radio Ninety seven point seven double duty chaos [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWell this is that time of year where we talk about those stories that we're going to talk about them now the name of the book by wrong collecting Maureen would more goes chronicles stories from the wrong with the unknown the unexplained the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic transfer medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe is communicated with the deceased at the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which upset with Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand but also control this gift at the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adults to say on says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more he has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nThank you so much for having me look good for to the next Fifteen Years old all this happened for you\nYeah I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know he's very wonderful one when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned and the city and she still is on it now and it's you\nKnow the high priest ... salmon and he'll often when I was younger you are walking around town you know dressed in her her guide and very regal looking very you know she ... ... ... and ... at\nThe time did people welcome or with open arms or did they go oh my God there's a which\nYeah that's a great question you know there are many people that welcoming her with open arms but\nLet's just say the town and family I'm not necessarily [laughter] so\nIt always seems to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town at Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did she really changed the whole way they look\nThat now you know obviously it's a big tourism right for the type of season and it's you know go to Salem um so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a few generations psyche trench medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family you said the bill will be what year did to start with\nNo my um [noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if she didn't want to scare me she just you know my poor father though he thought just those girls insane\nUm but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by\nUm and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just to you know she told my father she's normal um but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was with talking you know in their sixties she finally told me that she is you know what Marlene\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and\nDo readings for them and she said you know I hear the spirits but I just turn up the radio so\nWould you see that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so I never really knew her\nUm but my great grand right grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so\nIt's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever pass dome stories from one to the other but you could carry through\n\nKnow the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and uh she was maybe maybe\nFive years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her true self she was very unique because that's what she said so\nThat the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England new goes project Maureen since two thousand one would use that\n\nA well rounded do much better than me to tell the story but he started this story after on a near death experience\nUm and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took to try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he started cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing it on goes that his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus\nOn but it's a team of individual that you know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for the things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nTo want to look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain\nAnd people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations who people it's really going there to to just help on\nHow many people are just off the wall when you go to their house or just losing\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy you\nKnow show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred investigations\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that ... is a good reason why you don't see it\nUm so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat have you conclude about what this may be or be a lot of people have their thoughts about what goes your what do you think there are\n\nWell I think there are varying degrees\nOf what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to get before they pass\n'em but then you know you called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items and being tossed around the house\nUm there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs\nOn you know all these\nOut she'd have something go on in the oven and she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in oil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent knife\nIt's on Fox News

for it and I'm a member of the Mets came in and she told it all about uh\nHow that used to come in in the morning and sometimes they would find books in the middle of a floor and they couldn't understand why it happened so she finished to let us be on one side and then I get up and begin to talk it suicide began to speak for the books from behind me came flying\nInto the middle of the room

that your life was in danger\nOr ... did\nNot by the by the leaving me\nAnd I first book uh goes chronicles is ... is the second book on the series a marine and I did an investigation it was a daytime investigations jumped him call me up and asked me to check out his house so I get ... up and we went to his house and the places that mess it would look like it's been trashed and\nThis guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there and ah so anyways uh they were pretty big ... uh and the the kind of got us for a while after we did our thing and\nAh one of them moved separated from the other one and the other one talked marine we later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and uh so he wanted more rain and come back well but that didn't turn out so if there was any fear was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine that it's one that's left an impression with us I think so what kind of equipment Ron do you bring with you\nA very on on on the particular case uh\nThat you know the logic of the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people more a piece of equipment a small cage the lesser amount but you always want to um\nYou know try to bring the proper equipment that you wouldn't eat for instance\nIf you have reports of a ... and being seen you might bring more video equipment are like thermal or ... whatever\nThat you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by\nAudio than you would bring more audio cut me so it it it varies when you've gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization\nThat you've come across a I'm Sorry what was the worst in the visualization of a goal visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it or judges that\nThey weren't really well I was ghost hunting but more while I was just doing normal stuff yeah I work with a lot of White House history funds for him and we do you know public goes on and that type of stuff\nAnd there are two separate occasions or one that I Do these goes to his cause I'm On the board of directors of a portion of the White House that we do these haunted toys and one time we were in this um [noise] it's a like an observation tower where it's a square\nBuilding with glass all around you and ... windows all around and you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and his wife and daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them doing my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down to the side of the wall you know it's going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself and she came and then they didn't want her to miss anything so I stopped and waited for a night I saw her continually walk all the way to do it and I waited\nAnd waited and yet nobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the ... inches of snow this there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk it\nAnd yet there was no one there and oddly enough\nThat said vocation is where the coast got because it's on the coast guard base a coast guard reports and women walking on the wall in that same location so that was kind of intriguing um\nPerhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we did a public or goes typed on uh what island lighthouse in Bedford pool meals Maine we were in the White House ah keep U.S House it was on\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on the picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen they serve a dog will crush the or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the there was no\nThere's no sign out so I jumped up and meal you're into the kitchen and two in the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to the woman she says why would you see that's just that's our dog she says can you describe it sure absolutely as far as clear as day and I describe that she'd just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved them leave the island\nOr the dog wouldn't go so all the lighthouse keepers afterward took care of him until the dog eventually died and Ireland she says the dog you describe pretty much matches because of the dog that\nThat of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean his two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it certainly saw what appeared to me as a ...\nMinute still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back and both

never touched me in the morning there you go [laughter]\nSo how often do you get the calls Ron for ghost investigations\nYou know it it it's funny when we first started we we course it was quite common but there are so many groups so like when I first started I always say that was\nA twenty ... you have to do was knew there was like twenty four in the country knows like twenty four and a new city but the judge I did want to mention you mentioned the hurricane Michael there's just an image know of the the the sudden right now has scarlet ... I don't know if you've seen that yet or\nNo I haven't seen that yeah it has it's pretty that's your own it's our number ... ... dot com but it's pretty cool sorry about that\nMaybe we can concentrate and bring nothing down from a for doing nothing so that would be good [laughter] we've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do any because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to you\nKnow she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to know something about it for instance if you're going especially if you go to a big location you have to do a where to concentrate you're you're investigating for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of particular area you might want to concentrate you your audio recorders serve\nIf for a A R a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I tried to get too much into the details with tour of the crime is for\nLack of a better word are you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I I Am there for ... strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question because then that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know you know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you hear from people but\nYou know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know if they want help to move on and that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want the ghost out of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know basically a you know what you expect from us in a in a very of the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house Clinton's is something we're not going to do it without you know are we from someone else\nUm but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls for both of you let's go to brandy and granted big California walking to the program I brandy\nHuh hey thank you for taking my call but um yeah I had a question and I've had a really really rough year after year that's probably the worst year of my life and [noise]\nAnd I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me if you see the year next coming or being a lot better police things starting to go more my way\nMaureen this would be for you\nThat's for sure yes yes at what um okay so Brandi I did pull a couple\nOf cards for you um and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding on to a lot of hurt that have been happening around you right\nUm and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but you know and the other kind of poll is you know this was last year in our things that have been happening is like a pressure right so because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I wouldn't tell you is that for you can get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that I hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that is taking place it's a learning lesson right now for you\nUm and it's a time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust that it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but\nI'm calling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying um but you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day routines are really trying to put it on the mask but you're not feeling it is that\nCorrect or no right [noise] yeah okay right so\nPut ... think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a healing hand that you have and I used to me you up and go to person feels like a lot of people when they come to you and they have an issue is that correct\n\nThat you tend to be the ear that people talk to someone I was there\nYeah yeah [laughter] okay so you need to know that you know you have\nTo have patients with yourself and your situation okay um how many is coming so know that you you are coming to a breakthrough it is going to get better\nBut I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two right so you almost have to feel it feel that strength inside of you again which you're kind of like well how do I get that back\nUm and a lot of it is balance right is finding a balance in your life is what you really need to do at this moment\nAlright thanks good luck brand new hope everything works out for you during this time do you do you find Ron Maureen the these investigations are more prevalent during Halloween season or does it matter\n[laughter] [laughter] it it doesn't matter but you know what even Ron I'm sure would agree as early on I mean a lot of people have that and they think well it's October Halloween season right we need to be out there\nUm and I say over the years that might have started when I joined the group that was more it was his ear around that time of year but now I think Ron would say is probably isn't constantly\nMaureen what do you think of ...\n[laughter] funny you bring that up um\nYou know I think that they're a tool I don't think there's something to be afraid of them I just think it's it's the intention that you use when you're using that we'd be bored so if you're you know you're drinking you're using the way the broad then that's probably not a good idea\nUm because you're not open and you're not protecting yourself and um we had a actually a case of a woman who had some issues by using and we'd be bored and I believe she lives on having you know getting high at the time or whatever she was doing 'em and she invited the spirit end\nAnd her how her whole life rather went into chaos her home and burn down a she pretty much lost everything\nUh and we were actually called in an investigation on a different home she lives in that she was now losing that home\nUm so I don't know what do you think about it wrong\nKnow a a a a parish priest called in and asked me the same question what do you think about we do boards I says I've got a collection of the games [laughter] uh and uh\nShaun Hannity today at three o'clock news radio Matty seven point seven chaos\nFox News I'm Carmen Robert fear and dread in Florida as the strongest hurricane and panhandle
