{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "What's the what's the what's the car that you need to replace\n[noise] so the the car need that I Will need to replace the humpback Tucson if it's a good reliable but I Know that actually the miles of getting up there and\nOne of the normal normal but why can't you just save up between now and the time you replace the car and much longer you gonna grab the Hyundai for you replace it\nAll depends on how long it lasted about a hundred and Eighteen thousand miles\nBattle how long were you grab the Hyundai before you replace it\nProbably three to five years can't you save up a car price between now and then I think I could yes\nOkay then you don't have to sell the toy car for that the only question is do you want to keep the toy car or do you want to keep the brokerage account because one of them needs to go so you can have an emergency fund\nYeah yeah which one do you want to um [noise]\nSo now I guess the the second clip on a brokerage account most of its long term so I think if I sell it it's just a matter of you know it'd be additional income to my salary of the year that\nYou've been going on that we don't have any basis in that stock again no I don't know why you didn't pay anything do I\nKnow I'm Sorry yes I have a basis in there and so there's there's that um\nFar as taxes go on to the capital gains\nTerm exactly which one would you rather have a car or the brokerage account because one of them needs to sell when you decide that you'll know which one to sell and you'll know how to fund your emergency fund and keep the other one but now says with us in San Diego Hi Vanessa how are you\nI gave him gain great how are you know\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nI'm I just wanted to do that a bit of help on where to start um I'm making cheese start identity as like a full time business\nI down the line ... to um I had been mean and you're right at the ... and I'm already I'm already got a copy of the book\nYeah I had that I that child ... in the car yeah and I and I'm looking to move forward on my idea of a business plan that had it out a few years back now I'm trying to look forward to it on my plan and a sports camp um my\nQuestion is how do I start where do I do my problem me permit or local park\nUm I have ideas that ACT Alliance theatre ... it's basically um practice in a baseball or basketball but I Need locations it's not just plain park out Neal\nMhm mhm well I guess you could talk to the Y. and asked them if you could split revenues with them or something like that in order to use their stuff\nUm a lot of was do that with personal trainers and in a sense this was a a type of personal training I mean I guess if you're holding up I I Would suspect some of the yoga teachers or the aerobics teachers or whatever at the Y. probably just do a split revenue deal they'll say\nOkay I I Would I Do want to be contract or I didn't want to be owned by the why\nWas there that you're just you're just a teacher right now and what you get in there and you you work out all the kinks out of your system and you learn how to do it any developer reputation with people\nBut I and they may not let you necessarily have a business name on this they may just pay you as a teacher there to live for right now but that'll get some income coming in and get you in the field actually doing this and then the next step would be that you could actually rent\nPart time someone else's gym to do this with or part time someone else's ball fields to do this way and you know you could you could start there if you want if you got the money if you got a little bit of cash\nNow I Know I'm starting from scratch and you know basically a plan that I had gotten in that dream right age for the longest time and now that I've had the book and I they can be acquired cats I'm empowered I'm Josh Rogers thank you know where to go hat in art\nI think I might make some money kind of almost as a side job doing this exact thing at the Y. or at some place like a why first and as I said then you get the kinks out of your teaching methods and all that kind of stepped in the next step is you take that cash\nAnd that gives you the ability to rent the gym or rent the ball field on a per day basis but right now let's say you go rent a ball field and and you can't get anybody to sign up for your course\nOh my gosh you just lost all that money oh wait a minute you don't have any money oh my gosh you just got into that no we don't do that\nSee that's that's what I'm trying to avoid so let's create a little bit of money while learning a few things about how to talk to people how to teach people how to coach people and prove out some of your ah dreams and your theories that you've got here by just poking around on under somebody else a roof a little bit and then\nThen when we get a little bit of cash we can go rent the ball field or rent the gym by the day\nFor a little while and then um you know that way will break you if you don't get clients right off the bat ah when I started financial piece University Our a office building allowed us the people that were tenants in the office building they had a common conference room that you could book\nDoesn't cost anything but you had the book and you couldn't just keep it look good to just look at you know for a meeting you can you know other people go in there you should've meetings and it held like a hundred and thirty people is a nice size little conference room\nAnd all of meeting room kind of thing tables that moved round and all of that that's where a financial peace university started\nIs in that little conference room and I'm pretty cool if you think about it and so but I had to just look at as a part of renting the little office that I was in and so but it wasn't really my meeting room it was the office buildings meeting room\nAnd you could just use it and so I booked it in the evening and then I booked it in another evening that I've looked at it in another evening and then I was looking at so much they asked me to start paying a little bit and then I started paying a little bit but I had a lot of classes going by them but I just the first night I did that for people came\nThank goodness I didn't rent that thing for the month and therefore people come\nGoes we would have probably gone out of business that month [laughter] so that's what I'm saying it's OK to start it on a very piecemeal basis and started on the cheap\nThere's nothing wrong with that at all I'm really proud of you can do this when I said go do it go do it it's time to do it it's time to get off the dream and move into the actual action go do it you can do this promise you you can do this very well done good good good\nLaura follows me on Facebook dot com slash Dave Ramsey is it worth it to refinance a student loan to save on interest if you're saving on interest you can get a better interest rate it's okay to do that make sure\nThat alone is a fixed rate\nAnd make sure that it is a lower fixed rate\nSometimes people refinance student loans and just throw 'em all in one pile and end up paying a net rate that is higher because they'll make a four or five or six and a seven in there and get it all at six but the foreign the father wouldn't cheaper and they don't end up chief ... net net net right the aggregate\nIn other words so make sure that you are getting a better rate or don't refinance and make sure it is a fixed rate but then you got to do a lot of work to get out of deaths the interest

pool but he's certainly dictated most of his scripts and\nAnd honestly I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nWell let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in

welcome back to the coast to coast George nowhere with you with Nick Perri see with us a rod Serling in his life working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately you what was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even ... he's the one will probably pitched it to the network will I bring all the\n... after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and\nAnd he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow can we never wrote a book\nWell he never wrote a novel he did write in your collection of short stories\n... sure but I mean the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually the stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary um ... but\nHe never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy\nWith tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be removed the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out a is in charge of it he's going to be ...\nThis thing it and producing it and from what little like seeing so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for it where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise]\nYou know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to watch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be re injure reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't a rod surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it did he well he did get literally get credit for it on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling or so to get coal credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of\nYou know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a heat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own you never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time there were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed route certainly could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes\nYou know he he often a complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said they're so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so um you know I you know I\nHave a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype or you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know really this youth and go back to it and easier less stressful\nLife was on the Willoughby or it's just like well yeah it's kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to distance\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among my favorites and that was that was a big seemed to Serling was this idea of going back to his innocent youth in in Binghamton New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was a classic a\nMan is absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still know to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know they that's that's [laughter] ever [laughter]\nAnd they're just so many good the uh what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a average Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that he thinks is taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nAll right Nick stay with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with Nicholas per E.

rod surely and were alive today watching television what what do you say about the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama uh during the time the restrooms reading obviously we talked about some of the censorship but\nOn the issues but also the language and and just the ... the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there's so many shows that are that are are so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men in Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think it would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and\nHe does certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but um but I think in general he would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you I'm sure he he would hate reality television\nOn the um he and and I don't say that just you know that's not just me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television Ford's time a rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody\nOnto the show in the normal you know regular everyday person then you know a trot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just\nDespise the the show or you know he thought it was just an invasion of privacy and everything else so it's a reality TV he would hate but but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWill an old time television to knock a really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows way gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nThey were all older white guys you know in in I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm Talking the older white guys [laughter] where did the television\nYou know it would be difficult to get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you think of him he was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um the field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about now major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know yeah you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and how they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more [noise] more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to ah to writers and creators that you know I'd been his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS\nCBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I have some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nAnd it's amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of this sets which to me was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the cinematographer and the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was ordering from Nick if he knew how many cameras they used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with that it that's one of the striking things about the series is is that you know of course the production level in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest a set\nAnd the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make you know there's one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like eye of the beholder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kind of got the budget back under control\nHe jumped started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon\nTo be Robert Redford yay yay has read\nFor actually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was a very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to see what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah it was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show and Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered\nEpisodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spin person you know ha says a few things\nWe found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery\nOr because everybody thought she was ugly in she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there's a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above the fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was yes that was a terrifically a vote on episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know I'm an episode that's a very rare episode that it was finally or at least ... years later and it was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas ...\nRobert ... absolutely right another great you know a great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to the half hour I'll rarely yeah okay\nYeah and miniature was one of the hour long episode and it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nUh and so that was long long settled and um there was a special on pulled the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has horrible horrible incident hum yea helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA it was yeah you cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead yeah\nHigh like a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seems like it was very a scape is\nMore than maybe someone stay back in the sexes I'm just speculating if you had a job and he came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there any other shows really like that my second question would be about\nNick ... book of course is called rod Charlene is like Morgan imagination\nTo access the audio archives of coast to coast am logged on to ... dot
