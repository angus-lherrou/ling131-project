I think that's what he owed on the car at the time they report it you\nKnow I'll go out and he would later eight Seventy thousand yeah what was he driving and like I think it absolutely outraged [laughter]\nUh yeah any Roald some negative equity into that to get there\nAnd so the the forty five thousand is the difference okay they'll settle that for pennies on the dollar probably sell about for ten grand but the rest of the stuff I don't know I mean the ex wife thing I don't know what you're going to do with that how in the world ends up on her and these two attorneys\nUm [laughter] wow a you might be able to settle those would lump sum I mean you might walk up to her and say here's a check for thirty if you go away\nUm and uh she might take it you know but you'd have to have the thirty thousand dollars is what I'm Talking about it or not thirty dollars and so you know you've got to put some money together here and that means both of you were going to get your incomes up and you both have to have I I desire to get out of money\nOr to get out of debt and and to make more money to do that you have to both have this thing and it's still going to take you a few years I mean if you guys just go bananas it's going to take you a few years so um\nThat that's what you're facing and um but the the thing is folks I hear those will be dating out there it is not a deal breaker as far as I'm concerned that can be for you you decide what you want to do with your life but I don't tell people to not to get married over that\nI Do tell them to not get married over the decision to stay in that when you don't want to stay in that because that's going to be when you can't be an agreement on money before you get married when money is the number one cause of divorce we can highly predict that your marriage is not going to last\nIt's it's ... it's okay if the number one cause a divorce you don't agree on\nGuess what you're going to get divorced I mean that's a fairly simple equation here\nAnd so you have to be in agreement so I don't the two fifty doesn't scare me scares me but it doesn't terrify me to say this guy's not ... I don't know if he's a keeper not I can't tell he sure has a bad taste and lawyers and all that but as he got his way up\nBut um anyway man he ends up paying her lawyer his lawyer owes her Seventy grand and half of his income\nOff it's not a four that's a good gosh so uh wow\nYeah somebody so anyway yeah ... this was not an equitable outcome I have no idea what the situation was but wow what a mess\nAnyway so the all of that behind us now the question is are we committed to cleaning it up if we are then ready to go game on and that's fine thanks for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Alex is in Pittsburgh hey Alex our you\nHey Dave how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] very good hey we are newly married and looking to create a plan forward good see right away so yep newly a newly came onto your videos on YouTube so I'm as I'm going through it looks like we are on step six word that free we of six months of a savings\nBoth put about Fifteen or Seventeen percent into four one K. wow new ...\nNot ... run into a plan that you've already done all of it [laughter] yeah it doesn't happen all the time or a really good for you okay so what's your question\nUm yeah no kidding oh college fund so it's kind of like we're on step six hours have about ... ... mortgages are only to okay\nI Know and with that we have about Fifteen thousand extra on savings on top of our six month emergency fund her answer the question is uh still about forty eight on the house is worth about a hundred mhm um and it isn't a good rental area so our goal is to move in about two to four years\nAnd with that fourteen or Fifteen extra brand do we use that to start paying off the mortgage more uh right now I Do double payments so we're already actively trying to pay that off quicker but do we\nFully committed to paying off house early or do we split it and keep keep doing the uh the paying down of the mortgage and poking up for a um a down payment knowing that I don't want to\nI Love real estate and if you have a desire to home run real is that I really want you to get there I Do not personally buy real estate with that for investment

aircraft could a speed test aircraft could this be something that could be sent from space like a signal\nThese these real cosmic XO cosmic does signals coming through there are a lot of things to think about it especially when they're discovering some of these particles that don't exist there they go against the standard model and that's what blows me away as good a colonel went in Tennessee I crew and your ground zero\n[laughter] Hi Hi I'm\nA ... I found this topic very interesting and uh um so I did a little research on the ... because it was my understanding that you know neutrinos generally just came from the sun right during my research I found out they were getting you know from a number of sources\nOf boys are large metallic cloud of ...\nAnd and the supernova Nineteen eighty seven eight ... and and uh ... and the fact that neutrino or detectors have to be buried so very very deep and the crowd and they have to be extremely large\nOr what what where it came to my attention is this has been an Arctic ... where\nAre you know at the polls a media right in in ... they're all they're they're found very easily and and it's common place to find things just fall who stay\nIn in that and touch reaching a planet right um so you know it came to him are a lot of tension let what\nIf while they were building this neutrino detectors just has to be so deep in the ground so large\nThat they ran across something they found something that lady shouldn't have been fat you know ... and and and that may explain these new or a microorganism\nWell see that's it you know it might be if y'all out from from whatever they may have filed with building list detectors or the question is you know\nWhat is the fall out why does it go against the the uh what do you call the classic model beast go against everything the classic model opera see right not son particles\nCars aren't new parties aren't these are not neutrinos for the sun is not true notes from perhaps a quasar something else\nThese are neutrinos from or what we call break off from any kind of I guess nuclear fuel or anything it would be similar to nuclear fuel so this is it's just something that doesn't belong on this planet is being a ... for the Antarctic ... into space\nExactly because you know neutrinos generally follow one path and um the majority of them\nWas perpendicular throughout point and we're finding their detected large numbers of these are coming from the polls you know that that that's that's a that's\nOdd out you know make our magnetic field or or whatever even affect the trajectory of the atomic particles right and ... and you know it it is really concerns me 'cause well you know ... ... ... is detectors have to be very deep underground in filled with water\nAnd in in order to you know to protect the neutrino ... large numbers of it has to bounce off a particle right ... ... a heavy water molecule right and what we did it say heavy water molecule it creates a splash that the detector to protect\nAnd that's how they detected neutrinos\nNow while they're building their incredibly large apparatus this you know this is\nHe's the trainer detectors are quietly is not quite as why we know as the um had drunk a collider right and these bills things are lot out twenty mile law in in circumference that leads to take these tree or detectors\nThey're not quite as large right but they are in the vicinity of shark and she wouldn't nature and when they're taking down into the ice has not been disturbed\nOr hundreds of thousands of years I mean I'm we might they look they may have found a thing literally\nYeah like the movie yes the the thing is in it\nAnd and they could open a planet up to something we're not ready to him\nAnd they and that's why they had to bring down the Russian Orthodox patriarch a president in state\nAll the all these our not all all of these are\nPublic figures in and politicians in and scientists to before for what you know it it it's scary\nCome really come see what we discovered come see the alien that we've discovered come see the the creature that lives on practically nothing lives on Aaron sunshine doesn't live on any food lives in harsh conditions\nAnd look what he's putting up putting off neutrinos that are not the classic model sending a signal out into space and then we're getting a single back and this is why we're so concerned about tech technical signatures SETI\nThey could just eat the microorganisms or whatever they found Terry you know we carry microorganism bacteria\nIn our bodies are fine artist to live just for us to survive you know we have good bombing that part right now what ... wherever they found that lady there\nAnd it may be very first to our biological system\nSo they're keeping contained there obviously but they they they're they're certainly concerned\nAbout the signatures it's giving off there certainly concerned about what we're hearing what we're watching this the the fast radio burst the ... the the rumble in the horn sounds in the air they're concerned about these things because they just don't know how to identify it they can I did\nI not coincidence no it's not a coincidence that all this going out and said oh something's\nBeen found in an article or something it was a a actually sending a signal out from space I Believe was the more they traced the signals to an article the neutrino signals were also trace\nThis is definitely communication and they won't tell us it's communication until they most certainly habit pinpointed as to how the communication was set and what was done and what the what the result will be\nIn in this day and age that can't hide anything no and hide anything from the public I mean we're got to find out we are going to hope I hope we don't find out too late before we can

consciousness movement she's the author of several great books including the field and the intention experiment and her latest the power of eight\nLynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted\nMany Lynn walking back to the program hey George it's great to be back you two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we\nJust calculated the results that few months ago\nYou know I get an intention a bit when a several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas or they could hit as a category four or five and we did a little over let's bring it down and it the it hit a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens it works it\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep the uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it so there's something going on\nI mean now we've run about six piece intentioned experiments trying to lower violence\nUm last September we ran a six day experiment\nTo lower violence in the most violent place in America which is believe it or not a U.S a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri and we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked at and I had a professor of statistics look at this from University of California\nAnd she saw that crime went up in St Louis is a whole property crime went up in St Louis as a whole property crime went up went up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so something's going on\nHere what do you think this is one of the people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the feel of what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I liked I called it the field it's a quantum energy field and what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going\nOn with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our ... everything is energy\nAnd our thoughts are another kind of energy when there are worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I run thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds grow faster\nTo purify water to healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and\nYou know of those thirty three twenty nine have shown measurable positive significant effects\nDesigner trend the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug has his good record is that in terms of studies so\nSo as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power to change things\nNow he'll thing the experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis\nAnd then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k. and we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the deep pack of the middle east\nAnd also a very prominent Israeli ... a documentary producer so\nWe had eight and Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world so we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence\nWe chose it because it's you know the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together and what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know and just calling their screen and they can talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know\n... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was amazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nAnd it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play ... in the if you're a beach in positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we did an intention once for a kid cold Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide he threw himself off of forty foot structure\nAfter his he broke up\nWith this for a serious girlfriend and he'd broken everything he had brain damage she had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief and the power of intention was pretty stupid\nIt worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of of Arizona noted psychologist and a Jessica us who is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... I worked with people from from U. of Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable and then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up\nAnd with some of them you know we do it in the laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientists didn't know which ones who were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that\nThey really helped me set up because they're the scientists and then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be made out of my\nUh Internet site or YouTube or own Web TV or radio you and I did one together and um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results\nAnd the reason we wait a while is\nSafe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's going on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nAnd do you know losing the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group for the test why ... why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] will be really came about when I tried to scale this

she had been part of this again out of the blue\nSo this happens so often that it it has convinced me it's not just look it's not just happenstance\nAnd you know universities are studying the power of what are they doing\nWill we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all ... state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis one makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and granddaughter\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to\nOther um mystical states and its\nTo a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this hot largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nearest scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at the immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this [noise]\nUm but one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we we actually get healthier but\nThe other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis they found that when you do something compassionate and like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas and you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be ... that would be an interesting experiment\nWill you know we're doing one this at this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in\n... county in Florida um we're gonna do something about lowering violence but we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou were talking about a mirror of what is that\nWell the mirror affect me was the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing affects among the receivers of stuff and the receivers of the big intentioned experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened\nThe participants in these intentioned experiments so when\nWe started doing these peace experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and were they able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly I asked them how it was for them and I was getting answers back like this\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek and remember these are people who are participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives they were\nGetting along better with their partners that we're getting along better with their bosses in their co workers they were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nSo that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful [noise]\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment if not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but\nIt's more the active participation in what happens to those people need changes their lives being part of that\nWhen we're gonna come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for you as we talk about the power of aid but

community George\nAnd you know that is are are kind of birthright it's also are feeling of\nOf coming home in a way you know we were always meant to be in groups we were never and we were always part is supposed to be part of the greater home we've never supposed to be alone\nAnd I think there's something about that group support that group feeling that you know you got a load of people who are just wishing you well there you know intending for you for your health for your happiness or something\nThat's really powerful and you know in many cases wait in line master classes for instance when I put people in groups there total strangers\nAnd they don't meet in person they're meeting virtually you know they're meeting on Skype or zoo or conference call or something like that\nMany of them end up feeling like this is a badge of people who are closer to me than my own family never they never unless they've never actually met them in person and that the incredible thing about it but it's
