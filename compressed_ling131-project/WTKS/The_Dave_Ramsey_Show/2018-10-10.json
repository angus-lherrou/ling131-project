they've decided to rename the street and um they've been there for two weeks now and it's time to let the city have street back it's ridiculous\nHow is it possible that a few dozen antifa protesters can take over an intersection in the downtown area of the city for you're telling me weeks and the police do nothing about it\nBasically for the most part they let them go bell dogs all they're talking about and then they decide to grow up at the end of a workday I don't know what the what what what the motivation is they just pick and choose what they want to do something\nIs it covered in the news or people angry about what's going on\n... or ... or the or the left slant of it up here unfortunately we don't really have a non biased news network\nSo you don't have television condemning

Fox News hurricane Michael a dangerous category three storm it's now two hundred and fifty five miles south of Panama City Florida is\nUm\nUnbelievable world class skills one is you have an in depth knowledge of luxury motor homes and uh how they work and what makes them tick and how you can help somebody in a situation and so on there okay that is a very narrow set of a skills\nIt really has only one application in your city and you lost that job okay the second thing we know is is that you know how to sell large ticket items to wealthy people\nAnd you're very good at it\nAnd so were you for instance to sell\n'em Ashton Martin ... or ... you would be in a similar market and ... the\nIs you don't know much about how they work you've never worked on them\nOr so the curve would be but you know how to communicate serve closed the sale handle the service after the sale how a high end luxury buyer wants to be treated and needs to be treated in order to create repeat business you are an expert in that\nAnd I think that set of skills can be applied in other places would you agree\nGot her I don't care if you're selling a hundred thousand dollar watches if you want to do that that's fine I put so I just came I went to something what wheels on it because you had somewhat wheels in a motor before snow you're mechanically inclined as well so maybe that's it but\nYou know I talked to a guy the other day is selling the crowd out of high on cars and he used to be in the um recruiting business she used to sell a you know recruit people for jobs\nAnd it's just similar skill set because he was dealing with high on the executive placement and then he's dealing with a executive placement into cars and it it's the same set of people you're dealing with this thing they think the same way you know how to keep that kinda person moving unhappy\n[noise] and I think if you think you've you broaden that out that why do you have you back off your pan out with your camera angle you'll see that and I think you're going to be fine so I wouldn't panic I'm\nThe only other thing I could think of is if you can't kind of some kind of brokerage situation where you're brokering high end luxury RVs um for two hundred and fifty grand you can fly in and out of a city every so often and make a deal happen\nAnd so I mean you could go straight to manufacture or to a dealer of the same brand fired you but it is in a much larger metropolitan area and sell to people all over the nation and hand hold their hands in the process with a broker process I'm gone um\nI'm not sure where the leads come from not sure how big a deal happens but um when you're dealing with something as two or three hundred thousand dollars airplane tickets are cheap\nAnd that makes up the all happen you can't do that when you work and thirty five thousand but in your situation you there's a lot of stuff you can do um I mean you could be gone one night a week and jump around and really close some big deals you could sell a jets private jets\nThat's another thing that would fit perfectly in your scenario um and the job market's pretty hot right now because the economy's booming\nCouldn't give a jet away two years ago and now you can't find one so I'm you know that's another place you that you think of a luxury mechanical element that's all I'm doing I'm just brainstorming out wild here but I

twelve months ago they put you guys on this journey\nWell day that goes a little bit farther back then that emptied out of an eight hour we went to financial ... and we actually had about eighty thousand dollars and that at that time and we never added to the debt by we never really got intense not getting rid of it\nSo long I laughed and sorry she took the clash ten years ago and flunked

home for two hundred thousand or a hundred and Fifteen or banks offering an opportunity to refinance and take cash out to pay off all our dead it'd be great to be out of debt or don't want to run this by your first well you wouldn't be out of that you would have just move the debt over onto your house\nDumb idea eighty eight\nPercent of the term that people take debt Cohn ... loans out but don't change their habits and they're on their debts back up the only time I tell people moved up into a debt consolidation is to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure and you're not asking me about either one of those\nSo I think your bank wants to see you deeply in debt 'cause that's what banks do\nSo ... when a bank says\nHey I've got a great idea what they're really saying is hey I can make some money off of you\nI mean really like playing with a skunk and wondering why you got sprayed seriously it's not it's not a pet it's a skunk so don't pet it lets\nYou this is what you're dealing with with my show no ... no no no no no\nUm is to say what they have done in the past\nOver a long period of time is likely to be what they will do in the future over a long period of time plus or minus\nWonderful and tragic events\nOkay guy which we can't predict those so if the economy booms in other words you can't predict that exactly\nIf the economy tanks you can't predict that exactly if somebody fires missile at us and it changes the economy you can't predict somebody's last couple of airplanes into a couple of hours you can't predict that but it will affect the economy so\nWhat we have to just give our best shot on that but the old saying you've hurt you know a past our results are not indicative of future returns horseshoe crab which they are\nOtherwise you would buy and they buy a house in a ... crummy neighborhoods instead of a good neighborhood right yeah and so what we have here is what's known as a crummy neighborhood\nGold as as not got a good track record long term as a matter of fact it sucks as an investment over a long period of time and so you watch this gold and silver worth today if you catch it all in\nAround a hundred thousand so if we call a hundred thousand dollars in the military but would you buy gold and silver coins with it no no [laughter] okay so the same reason that you wouldn't buy them again you would sell them today\nNo let's decide what we're going to be a hundred thousand oh you'd like to pay down the mortgage sure I'll go with that but there are several of their separate decisions do you see what I'm saying\n[noise] kind of I mean to me the confusion as Matt I don't need the gold and silver like we can just plod along paying our mortgage and not be gotten three and a half years\nNo no no no no it's not about the more it's not about to ask one more time hundred\nThousand dollars cash hundred dollar bills laying in the middle of your kitchen table uh-huh are you going to buy gold with it I don't mean money but are we going to buy gold with it\nYou know\nIf you keep this by tomorrow it's like you bought it again do you understand that mathematically yeah making the decision to keep it as the same as making the decision to buy it\nI could tell other people that when it comes to things like I'm OK borrowing from that far away on the path of markets have no other implication like it's just sitting there okay\nDoes have an implication forget the mortgage\nMortgage tent pretend like we were going to go to Disneyland but the money All right I don't care what we're doing the money the point is the way you properly analyze whether to keep this goal is to say I have a hundred thousand dollar sitting in the middle of the table would I buy gold with it\n[noise] heck now [laughter]\nIf you keep it tomorrow you bought it again and if you keep it the next day you bought it again every day and keep something it's as if you made the decision to purchase it again for its current market value and there's nothing wrong with that as long as you don't mind boggling it so let me give you an example if you if you die\nThought or if you thought gold was going to double in the next year and you had evidence to make you actually believe that\nYeah we were going to turn a hundred thousand and the two hundred thousand and one year and you all and you and I both believe that are just you believe that and we had a hundred thousand dollars cash sitting in the middle of the table and I said would you buy goldie Hawn crap yes 'cause I could turn a hundred in the two hundred\nRight yeah but we're making the decision then not based on what we paid for it or making the decision based on what we think it's going to do in the future okay the\nDecision to buy or sell or hold theirs is based on the future not the past other than we use the past to project our future but then when we do that with gold it tells us to sell\nYeah ... sell it take your last take your lumps you might have dumb investment you lost a bunch of money that stupid tax now you got a pile of money in the military but what do you wanna do with that money well modeled path mortgage what the heck\nOkay therefore decisions are two different decisions are two different buckets to do proper proper critical thinking on this Jonah is in Dallas texas Hi Jonah how are you\nHey there how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm a college student uh I have about ... between eight and ten thousand dollars a year but it's coming in that I don't have anything to pay for with her for having um a merit scholarship so the ... I get a bunch of extra money\nOkay good for you very cool Mary merit based on what your your grades or your citizenship or what\nUm my national merit I Am a national merit scholar\nOK and can you do anything to mess up\n[noise] um I can but pretty and it'd be very hard\nWhat so what could you do that would mess it up if my GPA drops oh well that that's not that hard that's\nFairly easy okay yeah you can drop a GPA pretty easy okay so what what I Do if I were in your shoes I Would call up the money in a savings account as an insurance policy to ensure that I finished school with no debt you are your best investment no I Would not invest this money\nOkay\nAnd and um because you're you're the best investment mathematically what are you studying right\nEconomic oh yeah you're a great investment you're going to do really well and and you're right you got all these great bass scholarship so you're you're a smart guy so yeah I I don't need what the ... I don't need you to have the money that the eight thousand dollars would make you\nDuring the next two or three years I Do need you to graduate\nWith these honors in this wonderful degree field and pay cash for it with no debt\nThat is very very very important and that's exactly what I Would do in your situation thank you for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Dave I'm thinking about getting financial ... going in my local union you have to be at a baby a certain baby step to be a coordinator no\nWe try not to have perfect people being our coordinators and we would prefer you to be wherever you is\nIf you're just getting started and you won't be a coordinator you can coordinate a clash all we want you to tell the truth\nDon't go in there acting like some kind of dead gum rich financial person got all your act together if you don't just tell the truth I'm learning this with you people I don't know some people are out of me I even got my first baby step my first thousand dollars you can lead a clash\nIf you love people you can put chairs in a circle and lead a discussion and stick to a plan that somebody else gives you than you are welcome to lead\nAs a coordinator financial ... anywhere you want to lead it we'd love to have you\nGet in touch with our team and we'll help you get that set up Patrick\nAnd thank you thank you thank you for following us on Twitter\nYou can also follow us on Instagram we've got about a million folks there we got about four and a half million five million Facebook\nDot com ...

little bit of inheritance after losing my grandparents last year ... and\nI think we have a kid that\nWon being our mortgage and then the second thing our car ... and and my husband and wife\nAnd feels that that money should go towards the car and I am just\nLeaving it as a little bit more sentimental and wanting to go toward something a little bit more sentimental and I'm Wondering is that correct it kind of view that money is kind of like a final gift and just kind of take away the emotions and just go towards that\nSo you want to buy something with it\nWell yes like I needed a new uh a sweet as a appliances fall in line of kind of been around for way too long and I'm hardly working in the first place so and my grandmother someone that taught me how to cook so I mean for me that would be kind of a more final gift\nI guess I Would say [noise] ah but my husband it's like hey if we have the extra money let's put it towards the car and get that tape down\nOkay how much money's involved at just under nine grand right\nUm\nWell I analyze these things through those sentimental limbs as well and uh the way I Would\nAsk myself this is okay grandma was obviously good with their money mhm does she left her grandkid\nAnd kids nine\nThousand bucks okay maybe um show grandma sitting in heaven looking at her grandbaby what makes her smile because her granddaughter did this with the money and I'm not thinking a dishwasher does that\n[laughter]\nNow I get the tie into she taught you to cook and I might take a thousand dollars and buy some cooking utensils so that every time I use that set of\nPots and pans or knives or whatever that I thought a grandma and put the rest of it on my car but I think grandma probably with somebody that hated debt and she might be smiling have you paid off the debt I gotta agree with your husband\nOkay um but it's not that I'm not doing that through the lens of I'm calling your sentiments silly\nI'm just I'm I'm just saying you're sentiment you can actually use that to try to say okay this is a you know the the character of this woman she was a frugal person of saving person she was careful with their money my guess is she hated debt\nDoes that sound familiar I mean\n[noise] [noise] oh yeah yeah fail they paid off on that lounge real estate and made it pretty much as their retirement\nYeah so I mean I think she'd be smiling it'd be paid off your car but also think she'll be smiling if you've spent you know a grand on some stuff to using the kitchen I get that unless balances out a little bit how much the on the car\nAt the we got back I think twenty four twenty five thousand dollars up on the ... what's your household and when you pay it off get what's your household income [noise] ah right here ... years here\nOkay All right well it's all going to get taken care of British in any way so more than anything it's just an emotional discussion I don't I mean yeah as long as you don't um\nWell the ... or you know what what would have ensuring Ramsey do we would look at it through the lens of what what is wise and that would also be pleasing to grandma and so I probably would buy you know I'd probably say share and let's go get a really high end amazing set of\nCooking pots and pans are knobs or whatever drop a grand on it I don't know something like that uh-huh and then let's throw the rest of it at this in honor of grandmother because I think she'd be smiling about both things\nI think you're you know you're honoring the wife or tradition the way she thought and believed and that is something\nYou do

three seven eighty nine Robert's with us in Atlanta Hi Robert welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHigh bay thanks for having me on sure what's up\nA one to ask you I'm retired I Am still work each time so I have a double dip in Asia actually another small town and Assad's by my retirement for them to come for Medicare I mean Social Security out next February\nAnd it was thinking at sixty six so tight that try to re invest it in any gross more\nA cushion for my wife is younger than me I think I've got enough money to live at home but I Want to help her out a little bit cause she got a\nBad early retirement contributions to marry a ...\nA car and we both putting end the maximum all that we can and color retirement story employment mhm so I'm actually twenty four or five apiece starting this year so I'm Wondering what you thought about taking Social Security is sixty six like that\nNo problem at all especially you know will turn around and reinvest it\nWell we'll we'll have to pay some taxes on it since we don't qualify for all but uh well I think we still put some regular alright but yeah\nWell you would qualify for a Roth if you continue to earn at least five thousand dollars a year\n[noise] uh well I Am a misunderstanding or there's a upper income limit on there\nOh there is yeah yeah you can do not make over two hundred thousand dollar household income do you\nDo\nOkay All right then you can do what's called a back door Roth I'd do that every year I might considerably more than two hundred thousand\nAnd the back door Roth is a at over fifty I'm over fifty year over fifty we can put in sixty five hundred each six thousand five hundred each if we want to\nI'm into I put it into good gross stock mutual funds from me and for my wife saw Thirteen thousand dollars each January I Move into a what's your news you move it into a A N after\nAbove for Tom sorry how before tax\nIRA traditional I write\nBecause that way you haven't had taxes taken out on it you didn't take a tax deduction and then you roll it to her off instantaneously and all in the same trends are action it's called a back door Roth IRA I talk to your broker about it if you don't have one the one of our smart best her prose they can show you how to do that\nBut that that's the ... the IRA issue but you can invest your Social Security money whether you do a Roth or not you just put it in a mutual fund\nBut if you're going to just take and spend it I mean you can do that too but you don't need the money you got plenty of money so I mean yeah I Would go ahead and begin to draw it\nBecause I'm\nYou know the the faster you take it out when you turn around and reinvest it the more you're going to end up with a more than you would have in the difference in what it pays you by waiting\nUm so the only difference is if somebody's just consuming it and you're nowhere near that uh then you might run the calculation differently but if you're a poet and invest it answers always pull it as soon as possible and start investing it is you're going to end up with more alive and more dead by doing that\nA Marlene is with us in Austin, Texas how can we help today\n[noise] hey hey what's up

is going to increase\nI'm actually start a new job next week so modeled jump I'm about five thousand dollars a year I'm at the beginning of next ... my wife so probably spent about the same\nUm and
