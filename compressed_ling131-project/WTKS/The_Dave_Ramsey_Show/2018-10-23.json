folks are very cool is beautiful place now where a notch welcome capital and you're here to do your debt free scream all the way from the other side of the world Oh absolutely love it how much will be

all do for a living\nYeah so I'm inland acquisition for residential home builder\nAnd product marketing very good good for you so what kind of debt was the dreaded thirty thousand dollar\nSo it's pretty equally divided between student loans and both of our cars okay and we want to mention that in that Thirteen months we had the hip hop and R debt snowball twice and three months into it on fourth of July or\nI or I unfortunately we're celebrating the little too much and uh\nApparently I had appendicitis and I thought it was more than something different so I thought it was bad food\nAnd every ... and I had to get my appendix removed so that but it's on a screeching halt yeah wow yeah so that was an emergency surgery that we had to cash so\nNo I mean we did but everything on pay that off ... started up again we're back at it filling out our our thermometer and six months later lucky me I had kidney stones so yeah so I had a double whammy yeah the only thing that didn't go with the gall bladder I'm\nLindsay this word on greater burden than what I Know I\nI I Know that a lot though not margin see appendectomy you almost warrant area oh my goodness\nAnd it happened the kidney stone last two months of the new year so we had to start over that ad hoc itself but it can be weren't stressed out because he knew how much we can pay off your mind so long have you\nBeen married five years on the December the first\nSo what happened that put you on this journey Thirteen months ago\nWell we had our little guy he's too right now that I had just gone back to work some attorney lease ... and we always plan of big annual trip and\nHaving him without a logo do at Disney cruise or something and\nUh we're planning that trip and then I kinda stressed out because we only had maybe three thousand savings and then just didn't sound right\nAnd we knew that you are his parents actually given us I think you are to ... when we got engaged okay Manhattan but it just didn't click back then and then watch them\nNo no well as early as we know we watch them that we stopped at a ... and just didn't stick to it on a cell and I knew that you went on line found that you had an ad and I had about an hour and a half hour commute each way to work\nNow I listen to your podcast and I\nYeah I heard you tell a capital that was on base that too that they're ... they can't go to any vacations and that's when it's ... like we can't do any of that stuff we need to\nReally buckle down half our debt so that's when I came home to him and tell them no vacations\nWe're going to get started to which he was really excited to go all the wrong side of a\nGang pay off a payoff dead or go golfing and Florida Keys or something I'm like\nOh our choice I guess it's a day I I Am but the good news is you're out of debt now and I'm like no one else later you can ... it was like no one there's no what do you tell people to key to getting out of bed as you probably thirty thousand and Thirteen much\nFor me at that budget sticking to the ... budget that we never and stuck to it through the ... that always change we knew we had extra cash we do that in spontaneous spending\nAs a planning the for each month happened and loves the every dollar happy that all the time cool and so yeah just sticking to that budget and planning ahead and just delaying sunnier and things that you'd want and just waiting on them\nYeah and for for me I Would say it's just you know everybody's different in a way that they approach\nOr this debt free journey\nLindsey over here she's an excel guru in geek in loves to see a split out I'm a put a thermometer up there and let me hold her in\nThe whole thing and get me to the top ... more goals driven in that but we do about it I'm going to All right but on the refrigerator right when we were on the refrigerator so that everybody can see that we're in that it's kinda like you know when you're an alcoholic you go to Alcoholics Anonymous now this was it it was like hey we're the ... were in debt\nI Am not I was our way of being honest and I end up front and letting people see kind of be a part of our journey if they enter a home\nSo that people look at your luck curiously or like you were crazy or did you get more cheerleaders\nNo it was a little bit of both I mean our family was very supportive but for me the crazy part was that it was weird I I kind of took it took my blinders off and realize that a lot of people are OK with with being in debt and taking on that and I'm like\nEither way you do have a higher to duck to bowl with a nature say and they lower premium as a result\nBut you'll have to just find out what they're offering do they have a hundred percent pay after the ... um and if they do and you're healthy or you're sick either one it comes out better kind of in the middle it doesn't necessarily come out better\nBut if you're going to go to the doctor will every year and then they pick up a hundred percent that's a great deal if you got like a chronic illness\nAnd or if you're hardly ever sick Ramsey is knock on wood we hardly ever\nEnd up at the dock then in that case obviously we save a lot of money because I'm only pay what comes out of our pocket and we never go to the doctor ... so we just end up with a cheaper premium is what ends up with us and the ability to put money into\nThe health savings account which creates a tax deductible account and you can use that money of course to meet your ducked double or any other\nHealth issues that you want to cover as you go along so good\nQuestion go talk to you Annette thank you for calling in\nDennis is with us Dennis is in Rochester, Minnesota Hi Dennis how are you\nI'm well your shelter\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well my wife and I started your program back in June and um we've been working our way through where they just have to um we have some whole life\nLife you're sure policies um each of our parents took all life insurance on us when we were younger we still have those policies number we got married we each took out a policy\nFor the whole life um the cash value on their policies as volatile loving housing dollars mhm and we're wondering if we should cash out the policy is after getting her policy\nAnd use that money to put into our that snowball absolutely\n\nYeah they're horrible product they're just um you know the whole life has to payday lender the middle class I mean it just as a\n... a ridiculously low right of return on your money and the worst part is when you die they only pay the face value the policy they don't pay the the cash value also which means the extra money you pay to build up savings in their disappears at death\nThey keep your money you know and so it's just a bad bad product the math on it is horrendous and you're you're much better off to buy inexpensive term insurance Hindu you're investing anywhere except on in life insurance product and so\nThat's what I that's what I have done for you know Thirty years\nThere'd be a ... it with the issue that we pulled out\nVery doubtful and the reason is is that your basis in a cash value policy for tax purposes\nThe the in other words what you paid into it\nIs everything you paid into it throughout the entire time the policy has been open so if you add up all the premiums that you've ever paid you don't even get that much out and so you really end up with a law she can't write the law but you end up with having put more into it then you get out so there is no game now\nYes um and it happens about five percent of the time with an old with a very very old whole life policy\nThere it is possible that the cash value is greater than was paid in which you would only pay taxes on the difference and so you know you use the figure eleven thousand so if you if you found out that the all the premiums added up to only ten thousand then you'd pay taxes on the one thousand dollar difference will be still do it\nRight\nWhen Ninety five percent of the time Ninety eight percent of the time they lose money 'cause they suck\nYou don't make money you know and so you end up losing money on the transaction and of course that's not a taxable event when you lose money no question about that Catherine is with us in Danbury, Connecticut Hi Katherine how are you\nHi Dave I'm doing good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nA number and then I just got married last August and we're combining our finances and everything else [noise]\nUm and we're working on paying off all I think that we get paid off his car like three days ago Hervey\nYeah mine should be paid off by the end it is here which is great and the next thing we're going to tackle some on Iran for property on 'em and then after that guy I tell them\nThat that we live and so why planning on saving up to three to six months of American seemed fine but we're not sure how much we can save\nTwo income family obviously we have no kids on but if both at my talents leads and my rental property fat out require like a really different amount and then if I have that we're trying to figure out how much is a fair shake hands\nWell given that you have two properties that can have stuff break down on them um you could set up in your rental accounts some savings just to cover the rental issues a vacancy or repair I assume you keep a separate account free rentals do not\nGet much out of work that\nOkay I Would I Would open up a separate checking account just for the rentals and put pay all the bills associate with rentals out of that account only and then um and of course by the payments out of there with a ... in there and then you can tell if you're making money on the rental cars what's left in the account as your profit right\nRight that's a taxable a that's a portion is going to be taxable each year\nBecause everything else is going to be deductible all the expenses associated with it and you can keep some money in that account to cover vacancies a or to cover repairs and I might keep that to do it that way a separate from my emergency fund and then 'cause that's like a business over on the side it's like a small business right off okay\nAnd then over but then at home I Would have three to six months of expenses there not counting the rentals\nUm because I got the rentals covered in the rental account than you're okay over there um and you know if you've got two incomes and you're pretty stable it sounds like you're doing really well and you're paying attention you might be okay with the three months out of the three to six months of household expenses measure\nKnown as your game plan and and so forth some good question thanks for joining us Joe's in Austin, Texas Hi Joe I'm short on time go straight to your question\nDave I'm I have a one year old\nAnd I was wanting to get your advice on how to say first feature so we have a five twenty nine plans set up and he's been getting money I'm from birthdays and um you know they're all day\nAnd I was going to know how what we should do with that money and how can we teach him finance worth possibility as he gets older\nCool well good for you what a great that question yeah you just um I Would have the money inside the five twenty nine invested in good growth stock mutual funds or course or five twenty nine is used for college\nAnd so we're going to teach him that his college money as they were showing that money as he gets older and he didn't need to understand it four years old don't don't worry about that but then there's for things you teach a kid about money for things we only learned about\nMoney number one is work number because that's where money comes from a number two is giving number three is saving and number four is wise spin and you teach them to work age appropriate when they're three we don't send the salt mines okay we're in the canoe or to give to save and to spin\nMust send you

I'm not saying you I'm not saying you're bad for doing it I'm just saying we couldn't do what you're doing\nFor very long it'd be for a very short window out of sheer taking desperation and then we would go get some kind of little rental and have our own little life until we could save up a down payment but you know maybe you can do that maybe you can hang out there that long but if your debt free today and you land a job tomorrow what do you think you're going to be making\n[laughter] well I'm I'm open in somewhere in the ... the the sixty arrange\nOkay so that puts you at like at a hundred how young household income you don't have any rent\nIf you're living with them and you don't have any debt 'cause I just paid it off and then you need to save up you know Fifteen thousand bucks or so for an emergency fine and start saving for your down payment and then just run that map out how quick can you do that and then ask yourself do we want to rent a year\nAnd slowed down are buying maybe by one year which is not the end of the world\nIt's not you know it's not like we're renting the rest of our life but just in order to have the dignity of having your own space for your kids and and writing the conflict that I mean very few people can live within laws an extended period of time and it not create in not create relationship string\nYeah and it it hasn't been bad living with I mean we get along its just after a while you kind of want to sort of be able to be on your own and you know walk around the house and have it be quiet and you know I haven't people I've given their advice all the time necessarily\n[laughter]\nA man and I and I will say whoever's parents you're living within ... years or hers it's not it's always harder\nFor the the other the other one show if you're living with her folks it's harder for you\nRight now she's used to hanging out with them and listening to their advice and all that pressure like no I mean we make a hundred thousand dollars a year I think I'll do what I wanted to thank you very much you know and uh yeah but so I'm probably gonna land on a rental for a little while and your situation but again I'm not saying you have to do that but if you're asking me what to do with your financially\nFor sure I'm writing a check today and I'm debt free for sure I'm starting to build an emergency fund and quickly as I Do that I'm for sure going to start saving a down payment\nAnd um and even if you bought and didn't save the ... because she didn't have a full twenty percent that's okay with me to as long as you're on a Fifteen year fixed and the payment is no more than a fourth of your take home pay and your debt free with your emergency fun when you move in after you make your down payment and you're going to the house will be a blessing that\nBut if you do it the other way because you get all twisted up in a hurry\nYou're going to regret it Sharon is with us in Florida Hi Sharon how are you\nI'm going to have better than I deserve what's up I'm like I have a question about my husband quite contrary um he's gonna be the next night and have\nFan than we've been paying ... we got married about Twenty years ago you know lord and yet [laughter] oh I Know it's a terrible thing that we found out a couple of years ago they came to lead to what we pay every mind\nWas that enough how you keep it so now you have to even pay more\nAbout that that's right do it and they create paying the cash value and I'm David over eighty five hundred\nI'll tell you on hold on I'm going to give me a good solid answer out of this commercial bread commercials not up on me with me is the ...

house and other stuff then\nYeah back to the other night I think we started around then and uh you know we had had a car loan and credit card debt Carlo and I'm like thirty granted about like fourteen thousand in credit card debt and we paid all that off and then over the last few years we got\nThings around the house after we paid off the day you know cat or a kitchen and I was like twenty thousand dollars and different stuff like that and then uh we really started hearing them worried oh probably though three years ago\nHow well done well this this was probably\nThis is the typical total money make over reader or financial piece university a tender it's about seven years or house gets paid for and everything else too in the process so very very well done so what put you on the side a journey tell me what happened how did you get started\nProbably on that rap we bought the house that I hadn't heard of your stuff in church one time and I got her name and it really did anything and then we moved in your show you've got five to ... and I happened to see and then really kind of I Know all your stuff was all about\nAnd I right around that at the data that we've got to do this stuff and candidates how it all began [laughter] whatever it took a class or anything like that but we did actually teach one class but we never take the class but it's mostly in your pocket every day and that's kind of began\nGood deal so Alison he comes in and said he's worth listening this weird gum and radio he wants to pay off everything would you say\nI was actually really on board with that I never had a problem with like over spending that was more Bobby that you know I was all for it and let me start doing the house I got rough but now we're on the other side so it was all worth it\nYeah you got no payments at all now you know you're thirty two years old you might get two hundred I mean you guys are you are going to be so wildly this is awesome\nAnd it was really cool we paid off the house on his birthday so when we had it in there and they said well let's just wait until you actual birthday so we we always remember that day I'm so awesome all four of its land and take it for all jammed up for it so it's got\nThat's fun very well done how many kids do is have you got\nTwo boys what ages\nSix and Benjamin just turned three\nSo you've changed your family tree have insurance\nOh yeah they don't know anything other than they've been warning to I've never having a credit card which is pretty often\nIt was very awesome so proud of you guys did you have more cheerleaders or more detractors as you went along\n[laughter] actually talking about that a little bit earlier and I mean when my parents are very proud and you know carrying a gun you know some other people oh we've got to poke fun a little bit here and make something and basically now my friends or anything like that and they don't they don't say anything now\nI guess not yeah you're sitting there with a paid for house shut up yeah that's pretty interesting very neat\nWell well done guys very well done what do you tell me the key to getting out of debt is\n[noise] ... and staying on track\nYeah even when you see when you grew up I mean I can be the one that would be the most is all my idea but when I Want something or I like stuff so [laughter] I always like the most expensive thing\nOkay good and um okay the uh\nThe thing is is you\nWant to keep an emergency fund up three to six months of expenses are probably keep one of six months worth of expenses\nAnd no one's forcing anybody to invest in anything um the the thing I finally figured out and they took me a long time to get there and it may take you a little while to get there is that buying a mutual fund\nIs not risky and does not keep me up at night if I understand that mutual fund and its track record let me give you an example of how I Know that would be true for you you bought two houses neither time did anyone give you a guarantee\nThat they would not go down in value that day\nAnd they might have actually gone down in value back in two thousand eight\nBut you didn't get scared and sell them as you thought well real estate a workout you know now that's what that means is you're looking at the track record of real estate not the guaranteed because there's not one\nI'm looking at the track record and going you know I'm Seventy three I've watched houses go up my whole life sometimes I go down but most of the time they go up and if I go down I'm not going to panic and they'll come back up\nAnd that is looking at the track record you might not have had the actual numbers memorized but good walking around since ... means you observe really goes up in value over time right right and so that's what I needed about mutual funds were some good walking around sense so one of the very first ones I ever bought\nWas Seventy five year old mutual fund and um it's got an average annual return over Seventy five years at a little over eleven percent\nNow that's the average some years it went down\nSome years it went up but for me that was kind of like buying a house on the street with big trees I felt like that's a pretty stable neighborhood oh and out of the last ten years it'd only been and when I bought it back then I mean it only lost money to two out of ten times\nAll the other years have made money and over the scope of ten years it made money\nSo it was a pretty calm growth in income type mutual fund and when I was looking at was the track record and going okay\nI Know there's risk in the stock market and I know stupid people lose all their money in the stock market 'cause they buy some little stupid company in the company goes on and they lose all their money because they're just playing with their golfing buddy told them to do but I'm looking at a mutual fund here that's invested in Ninety two hundred different stocks\nIt has a Seventy year track record as a you know tenured drag are you in twenty ... and I can actually look at it and go okay what's it averaged over the last ten years what's your average over the last Twenty years and how many times has actually been\nDown now is that a guarantee that it won't go down in the future it's not a guarantee but your house wasn't either\nAnd if your house did go down one time out of ten years or one time to three times out of Twenty years you wouldn't panic you don't all of the house and you know let it come back up and that's how I first got ...\nBall with mutual funds because you know Rick in my late twenties I went broke and lost everything I don't like losing money on like risk but I also don't like money invested in or sitting in an account making one percent when it could be making ten or twelve\nAnd ... and so if I got a mutual fund this average eleven percent four Seventy five years\nAnd it only does half of what it used to do well that still five and a half percent\nPass I mean it's got a really shock to go do half of what it's done for Seventy five years\nThat's got to be really bad I mean it's like the the worst possible ... period of time you know so uh I'm a beat my savings account I'm going to beat your annuity I'm going to be everything if it does and that gave me a lot of comfort\nAnd you know and again on but but the reason you're lying awake at night is you didn't think about it in terms of track record and knowledge\nOf history will give you peace on investments it'll allow you to sleep well and and so just take your time and learn take your time and learn and if you need some help sit down with one of our smart vest or pros we will not endorse people and they're not people that worked for us but we don't endorse the smart Mr pros unless they have the art of a teacher\nBecause we don't want you to invest money in light and I I don't want you to that I think it's that means you didn't understand what you invested in or you did understand and you put it in some stupid\nOr you shouldn't be lying awake at night with your investments just like you shouldn't be lying awake when you bought the house from Texas you bought your home should be laying awake at night I was with that and so\nIf you go on the website ... um put in your information they will drop down a list of smart Mr pros in your area Saddam parked when I'm there is no obligation just learn the more knowledge you have about something\nThe more calm you are\nAbout it it's as simple as something like driving a car\nThe very first time I got behind the wheel of a car I think that's probably about ten years old ... told me I could move the car down the driveway and um the gravel driveway and I think I emptied all of the gravel out of the driveway because I think I just stepped on the accelerator floor border to end just dug a hole with the ... of the guard\nAnd the first time ever drive a car you remember how nervous your or there was in a field or in a parking lot and then the first time you drive on on the road you remember how nervous you were ... and then but you know what\nIt was the thing about it now your ... your brain auto pilots the car in or what happens is you have learned to do something that has risk because you can record car there's no guarantee it has risk what you've learned to do it\nAnd the knowledge and the practice has given you a piece and you do it without your heart rate even change and you don't lay awake at night on a country I drive a car tomorrow\nIt don't it doesn't bother you even though you're taking risk but it's practice and knowledge in practice and knowledge [noise] open\nPhones a AAA eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money Justin is on Twitter following me at Dave

in the renting of the apartment there's\nPlenty of those out there but some of the large corporate things they they don't allow them to think and if you don't have a credit score we can rent to
