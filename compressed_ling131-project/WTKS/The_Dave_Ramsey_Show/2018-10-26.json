for everything you're doing a sense of listening to actually have a few dollars truck together\nGreat um\nMy question is basically about I'm a ... a voluntary retirement scheme that um is in Singapore so I can put up to thirty five seven thirty five thousand seven hundred dollars a year and that would get tax relief on that\nBut that calendar year ... which translates to about four thousand dollars in taxes mhm now I Want to take half my emergency fund and put it into that account because I might not reached a thirty six thousand just gosh blowing it felt my salary mhm\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're selling so I'm On a home near coaching them into this house was gonna you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is is that really out of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that you're in a sense your financial coaching them\nAnd so but you get paid a commission when they buy a house\nAnd so uh you know this idea that some people have that everybody gets credit commission has a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd there's plenty of people on strike commission with high levels of integrity that do the right thing so you might explore that angle\nBecause truthfully you can make more doing that then you can\nJust doing a book billing by the hour and I'm not saying making more is the whole answer but you know as a as a young guy coming straight out of school as a financial coach you probably don't have to get a little bit of miles on you before people are going to trust you\nYou know I could be I mean there's some people trust you and if you're really good you know you're no you're stuff than you'll you'll get business but ah I'm just saying it's it's a tough road to just do what we did back in the day and it's one of the reasons is not is one of the reasons we quit doing that as our exclusively but we did\nYou know we started doing events we started having a class or we started\nDoing other stuff to go with it um because it's difficult to make a

is in a trust my\nOf my real estate is in El al ... um and it's kind of an extreme risk management thing but I actually I actually don't want anything I'm pretty poor personally [laughter] except on all those companies that don't all that stuff so that's okay I guess but I mean it's a\nYeah we put up to five million dollars worth of property or we're doing single families into an El Al ... and then we open another one [noise] and I we buy a building standalone building to building I'm sitting is worth about sixteen Seventeen million and its its own\nTail Elsie stand alone and then I've got other buildings that are worth whatever their their home El Al said well we put up about five million a or a single standalone thing so they're different companies and that way you risk the spread around\nGood risk management [noise]\nHow often do you look at your bank account and wonder where all your money went how often are you stressed about bills and afraid your paycheck last the whole

making decent money but got a big pile of debt and I don't feel like a written oil\nWell I I'm a travel junkie and so whenever I realized I couldn't go on all the trips that I Want it and yeah\nBroke yeah kind of you know was horrible to being on a trip and not being able to afford things to eat here\nAnd so what happened twenty two months ago I was traveling with my boyfriend at the time seemed to be my husband ... and ah he the year before had paid for a trip for both of us to go to Costa Rica which was great um so I was going to pay it back and say hey you know I'm gonna pay for our trip next year\nUm and then realized I can actually afford is um airfare whoa I had to go to come and say hey can you can you purchase your own airfare um\nSo it was kind of that you know and then also

about six years ago mhm end started to to become ill intent started to understand some of the teachings\nBut then um the twenty two months ago is really one of our kicked in going in this stupid why am I taking so long to get to that 'cause I'd started and then stopped and then got back into it so that's when I write you know\nI had my lovely excel spreadsheet also use every dollar out um so we started doing all that and plus my company started to um do smart dollar at all is for your company or a Becker\nOkay great so they talked smart dollar yep which is going through the whole class as an HR benefited your company yes very neat and so that gave you about the time you were disgusted in going beyond airline ticket while law smart dollar appears from the charging\nYeah and actually um to circumvent and I and I think when we go through this process you start to get really creative so one of my passions us to travel so I became a national speaker and had other people pay for my travel I was just working the entire time um but I still got to do a lot of my travel well also working on my income and\nRunning around the country or smoke\nYeah that's not bad at all on a professional eater

through it you get your income up with all these side gigs you're traveling and getting paid you know software on the side you're doing your work Ninety Ninety thousand dollar job and what is the secret to pay off forty eight thousand dollar for the dead and twenty too much\nSo I'm I'm a marketer um my one tidbit is don't pay attention to commercials or social media boat because that's the second you start to see the restaurants on commercials or the cool stuff that people are purchasing and showing off on social media you start to have that why should have with the Joneses have mhm\nSo don't put as much weight into what you see that all the marketers in the world that we're really good at what we do if it's trying to get you to purchase something outside of your means ... shut off that that device to shut off the TV shut off the apps shut off the social media um and do something else but she time\nAbsolutely they all the ritual cruise book love your life not there and that what it's all about his don't don't compare your life to other people's highlight reel on Facebook yeah very cool good for you and what did you do did you cut your spending did you sell stuff did you live on beans and rice what'd you do\nUm I so I sold some things I did a garage sale and really I Want it to get rid of the clutter in my house\nAnd um I actually created a marketing campaign around my garage sale so I titled that I'm ... turned minimalist and I did a full fledged marketing campaign around it and also created posters to go in my yard and I had a poster of you with your face on it that said they ran these making me some stuff [laughter]\nSomething\nThe second thing is can you be dead free everything but your house in a year\nI'm Sorry and two years within two years if you can ...\nTake an extra jobs up so much stuff the kids think their next beans and rice rice and beans don't see the inside of a restaurant unless you're working there are no vacations busted and be debt free scorched earth and beat debt free\n\nIn less than two years then you would keep your car even if you owe more on it then it's actually worse there's going to pay it off and you're going to clear it and you're going to own it it's going to be all through all done\nRight that's where we're going to end up now\nIf you owe more on your car then it's actually worth and you can't it's going to be more than half your on your income and or you can't pay it off inside of two years then you do need to sell it how do you sell a car that you're upside down on that you owe more on your car then it's we're in that case if you need to sound like you've got to cover the difference\nYou owe twenty thousand dollars on the car the car is worth sixteen you can sell it for sixteen but you've got to have the other four to put with the sixteen to get the title from the bank in order when you give the title to the ... in order to give the title to the new\nOwner\nAnd so where are you going to get that other four thousand dollars if you're upside down by four thousand dollars well you would have to in that case\n\nBorrow the four thousand dollars saved the four thousand dollars or talk the current Linder on the car and letting you sign a note for the four thousand dollar difference that will only happen if you had like a credit union or a local bank it won't happen with a big bank or car loan company General Motors\nIs not going to do that Lexus motor credit is not going to do that and so on something that's what you do hope that helps open phones a triple eight\nEight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money John is with us in Detroit hey John how are you\nGood day how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell I thank you for taking my call it an honor to speak to you um my wife and I are avid ... and we are planning our next move here in the next few years I'm forty nine and she's forty six\nWe don't have kids um and we're thinking about moving to the Las Vegas area over the next\nTwo possibly three years we we are planning for him mhm I'm my question to you if we're looking at because we do a lot of travelling um ourselves and so we're not sure it looking at a condo\nOr an actual having a home would be a good idea what's your what's your opinion on condo um 'cause we are planning on whatever we purchase we're planning on paying out fine so that we eat you know have no market\nAnd that's good okay my pinion on them regarding what value increases are what\nWell ah you know facing the sort of thing because let's say we we buy a condo um we're looking to buy kind over three hundred thousand\nUm monthly dues are highly thousand or something like that um if they don't waste of money I'm used to go into account of versus the homework is not sure what the white financial interaction with the\nNo it's it's not a waste of money um the benefits are as you said you don't have to deal with the exterior maintenance and when you're traveling you've got neighbors that are close and if something curves obviously you could you know or have the next door neighbor or the the person near you have a key and that kind of ...\nI mean there's a lot of possible good things about owning a condo as far as they as far as a condominium increasing in value\nOr everything that controls the value increasing on real estate there there's three things location location location right right and and so is it or is it a condominium and a good area\nMeaning to an area that's a stable growing that values are increasing a good neighborhood neighborhood people considerably a desirable place to live\nA ... and so I Want to I Want to buy a condominium in a fairly a ... area or in an area that is you know right on the edge of a rapidly growing edge of an established area that kind of a thing from from a ... British resell standpoint okay\nAnd um you know if you do that you're going to get similar growth in value to what you would in a single family in that same neighborhood\nSame families to do a little bit better there is a little bit more market for them and there is condos but you know uh if you're in an area that's accepting of condominiums you'll be fine and Vegas would be fine with that now having said all of that then the only downside is what you mentioned earlier\nAnd that is the H away and the handling of the budget of the ... I wouldn't want to investigate because you are a planner the budget and um how they're doing with the ... budgeting let\nMe give me an example I had a condo come I own a rental or a many years ago when a condo complex that they had budgeted no reserves to replace the roof\nOkay now the condominium association is responsible for the ex stereo maintenance which would include their roof replacement so they come up with a several million dollar problem because the roofs are going bad\nRight and they don't know planning to get rid of it so guess what they did\nA special assessed every body and the place in addition to the right way fees to keep 'cause they had to have roasting Lincoln all over the place\nExactly but that devalued the condo and spoke to cash out of everybody's pockets okay and so if you look up and they've got no reserves for parking lot replacement no reserves for exterior maintenance no reserved for roof replacement in their budget\nAnd you know when you're looking at a complex is ten years old you got a problem you're walking into and so the thing you want to look at their the deferred maintenance is hidden down in that age are way reserves budget\nThe second thing you're going to run into is a and I'm In a bunch of ... on a bunch of real estate I hate H always right generally speaking the people that want to be on in charge of the actual way or the people that are in charge of nothing else anywhere else and their Barney Fife\nWould drive you freaking nuts absolutely and there are people that need a life\nNow there's an exception to that but by and large or you're going to run into a lot of that\nBut yeah I'm currently currently live in a whole Martha ... right now and I'm the president of yet so [laughter]\nBasically [laughter] I stayed at our you know\nI I stay that way because I didn't want to run into a firefight kind of situation very very\nBright guy you say\nYeah there there's a lot of that it's not it's not a hundred percent truth thank goodness I hopefully you're out on you know that at all [laughter]\nBut that's what you want to watch for is the politics of the association I'm In one eye joy the barrel suing each other and it's just on the whole neighborhood just melting down you know just ridiculous so you just hit it you got it\nThat's what you could get into you if you're the president so she has she already knew all the stuff I was just talking about them as far as I'm even reserves in a situation things there that you've got to have reserved\nReserved cover and so that's all you got to look for [laughter] that's fabulous lists Ramsey show [noise]\nHey guys this is James Giles producer of the day Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on six hundred radio stations across the country and to find one near you tend to Dave Ramsey dot com last show\n\nOf course I didn't hear you ever talk to people who say things like becoming a millionaire

brand new book everyday millionaires it's available for pre order starting August seventh double duty chaos savannah\nAnd high heart radio station now Fox News radio covers the world\nOn news radio that seven points out an ad\nXenon clue design least sound like Sarah Fox news federal and local authorities zeroing in on one state as they hunt for the person or persons responsible for Kansas making bombs into high profile Democrats and other investigators\nAre now describing Florida as a region of interest is is the FBI refined to search for the origin of some of those suspicious packages containing possible pipe bombs all intercepted in several states\nMhm okay so here's the situation I think you've got more talented than that I Want you to do an exercise where you spend a little bit of alone time today while it's fresh in your mind I don't want you to write out several skills that you have cars you have more skills than just being able to talk will\nUh you you you you started a business in Seoul you started a fourteen and sold it I think you're thinking way too hard and I want you just release your brain right out the top three or four things you do best\nAnd then I Want you to go over to the passion side work that you just enjoy you find yourself you know this is a small task around the car if I was going to pay you tomorrow to just be around cars what would you want to do all day and just begin to do than to let your mind run and make a list of three or four of your top passions things that you enjoy to do\nThat I Want you to sit down with somebody who knows you very very well and is also truth telling your life and we want them to be able to verify and confirm both of those list the reason is is like 'cause I think you need a jolt of confidence\nAnd and you you're very special young lady who's done something pretty amazing at the age of twenty three\nAnd I think you're just you're over thinking and I think you need to get somebody else in your life will show you a mirror and you come away go okay I get it so back to that talent passion calm but once you get clarity on that it's how do I use those top skills to do work that I Love\nAnd and and if that's involving cars great but maybe just maybe you know you love talking to people about cars and help them get getting in a new car do you get a lot of joy when you sell a car to somebody\nHow yeah how do you feel\nWhen they walk off the lot and they're pleased how's that make you feel\nBad if you can share\nYeah so I think if you're looking long term to start a business I'd stay in that space I'd be thinking about how uh you can continue this idea um and and and maybe expand a little bit but what you're doing is is when I ask you this direct questions you're having a hard time identifying some specific things\nAnd this is important I think there's a lot of people out there in the same boat we get this we get this on on the culture quite a bit\nAnd there is some type of limiting beliefs that is holding you back when you can't quickly say these are some things I Do well\nBecause here's what I Know if I sit down with people who know you will and I interviewed them about you those of you that are listening right now that have a hard time seeing all this is this is a talent these are my top town when I sit with those people they're going to tell me areas that you are good\nThings you do well\nAnd there's something that's holding you back and lock you up\nIs it that somebody verbally abused you did you have a failure in your life at some point that has made you believe that you don't have much to offer\nVotes we deal with this every day and some of the out there are locked up on that one limiting beliefs\nAnd when you get beyond that ... wait a second I have something to offer I have something to give then you begin to allow yourself to truly identify\nWhat it is that you do well and worked it makes your heart come alive sick a question from Facebook Rachel writes in should I take a lower paying entry level job it it is the first step toward a new career\nPaths that would eventually lead to a higher salary if so should I Do this while still in baby steps to or should I wait until after baby steps or this is a great question\nSo if the answer is you would take a pay cut by taking the entry level job which is what she's saying here it's a lower paying entry

constantly step forward on the path to fulfilling your purpose through your work\nAnd courageously staying there that's what clarity does clarity gives us confidence to step out\nAnd then clarity allows us to have courage once were on that path in life throws its curves at us because it will and uh you can just be assured of that and yet when you face the doubt and fear\nAnd the pride is where you retreat back to clarity\nWho am I what was that created to do simple formula that we use\nWhat do you do best when he talked towns what do you love to do most what we're brings you enjoy\nThe sweet spot for everybody exist where your greatest talent your greatest passion intersect in other words I use what I Do best to do what I Love to do most and here's the deal folks as I tell my callers every day I don't have the answers you do\nThey're inside of the answers to this somewhat mythical journey\nOr actually within you you have so if you're scared if you're confused stuck give us a call triple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Nelson who's on the line in Fall River Massachusetts Nelson ...\nHey Ken thanks for taking my call German not going to help\n'em right so um I don't know for a while and ah I figure it out my sweet five which is\nAnd apparently it's um creating an editing ... found either okay and uh I ... a practical okay um [noise] forget can research I found a video marketing firm real close to me\nAnd uh I kept an eye on Lincoln and you know they're ... they're linked to a buddy of mine that I've known high school and I'm from here to get some coaching I don't want to screw it up because it's a very\nUniverse get heard my call and gave me a great opportunity\nAlso well have you talk to your buddy that are that is at least connected to this company on linked in\nA I I haven't spoken about their uh you know were quote by oh\nOkay well that's the first the first step is calling up saying hey uh I'm interested in learning more about this company I see that you're connected them on linked in what is your connection how strong is it that's the first thing\nBecause he could have a strong connection or maybe it's just a random connection or ... you see what I'm saying\nSo you are in um urine staged too and that is full on research and so you found and identified one company that does what you want to do\nYou mentioned the proximity principle to the Dave Ramsey show lizards I haven't heard that it's important to clarify what that is proximity to the proximity principal says in order to do what I Want to do in this case\nNelson wants to do a film an audio editing production work so in order to do that he's got to be around people that are doing that and in places that it is happening so here you're next steps after you talk to your buddy and see how strong connection is\nThe next thing you want to do is I'd like to see you come up with a a bigger list even if it's three or four local production companies or or companies that are in this space okay 'cause you know where to look in your area so look and ideally I'd like to see a list of three or four companies that you we circle and say I need to learn more about those companies\nI Need to get in proximity now the only thing I Want you to do is I Want you to start talking to your buddy other people acquaintances or who dabble or work full time in this space and I think you could probably come up with a list of those people as well\nAnd so you need to take them out to lunch or take 'em to coffee and you say hey listen this is the ... this is the place I Want to be in\nAnd so I'm here to pick your brain into areas number one what was your path\nWhat are some areas that I could get better and where can I grow uh what do I need to learn who else do I need to ... do you have any relationships you know of any open jobs this is a very simple conversation it's going to yield something positive\nAnd so this is proximity and then even if there's not a fulltime job available ... and this is the this is the part that I Want people to get that are in your similar situation\nLet's say you do all of that and there's not a position that is right for you at the time\nIt doesn't mean you throw your hands in the air and take your ball and go home what it means is you say All right I'm going to practice proximity in a in a non paid situation so I'm going to go volunteer or or I'm going to say hey can I just shadow you for a day\nYou're you're sort of needs to be met your mother is great again and that's really what I Want to and I want to work for myself and I just don't know how to make the jump from well\nEven my current job on not excited about it all going to the mall or their career and that is completely in a different field that has nothing to do with what I'm currently doing\nGotcha okay well let's talk about where you want to end up you want to eventually on your own business so let's let's identify that dream what is that\nI'm currently is kind of\nI Know it got to focus on one thing but um I'll have a degree of ... and I have a passion for development Web design\nOr create websites companies and and just doing maintenance for companies [noise]\nUm but I also have a big passion of a day Ramsey teachings and I've done the financial coach monster courting and I would like to come up with practices you know maybe financial coaching homeless and I'm just it's completely different I'm not going to focus on one thing I just don't know\nWhat exactly I should be focusing on right now and and I work for somebody to give me that after\nA no well I think you have the answer I think you know the answer I'm going to put you on the spot okay so I Know that you're\nPassionate about Dave Ramsey needs help change your life and so you'd love to help others get some of that change that's what's really drawn to that but I I I and I think that's fine I think you have multiple passions link passions could be on different levels and I think you could maybe do some coaching on the side for extra money\nBut I heard ... clearly and definitively say that you always love designed and Web design and I think that that's the work that brings you great joy if I could snap my fingers and give you a job doing that right now how would you feel\nOh go right now so fantastic\nOf course I'm so but here's the deal so\nThere's a pathway to getting there what are you doing right now what is your job and how much are you making\nA right now I Do a commercial laundry equipment Rick her hotel room laundromat owner\nMhm what do you think I'm a about sixty five thousand a year but I Do a lot of time working in and out of town you can really kind of what can they burned all I Know you've got to overcome All right do you have been outta town travel\nAre what are you completely out of debt what's your situation there\nAre also embarrassed to we started with about Seventy thousand and right now we're down to it though are Eighteen thousand though he started after ... years ago that's awesome\nUh we we've had two babies are cash for a ... we've had a lot of medical expensive come up that we've been working for cash for it now but [noise] uh\nJosh aren't given up on the planet oh listen ...\nThat's incredible you're doing great what's your pay off day you've got an idea in mind if if life doesn't keep throwing some ... and everything stays the same when do you think you pay off that Eighteen thousand\nA bomb march march or April ... next year we that's where we're headed oh\nOkay so here's what I Want you to see\nFirst things first your current job I Know you're ... you're working hard but it's making a huge difference and in less than a year from now you're going to be debt free and then after that you're going to put an emergency fun together and get through baby step three how long do you think that's going to take\nA look when they are probably a month ago thirty six to eight months ... murders in front of like a six month\nI agree with that Josh that's not that much time for you to bite your lip and be the study he wrote that you're being right now and get yourself set up to make this step not asleep but a step so my other question is let's focus on the future so how much experience do you have with Web design\nOh I have a lot from the past but I you know with technology everything advances All right we're with that I'm\nKind of out of the loop on that as far as the code and stuff but the one good thing I have in my corner if I'm a very quick learner Dr phil motivator started right one third wireless talk too much so um but as far as the old knowledge I mean I've I've got a lot of knowledge\nThat's how I feel just a Josh here's the deal so you got some experience which is great so you're you know that you've got the skill set this isn't a skill issue this was a train issue so you're the number one homework assignment today it's\nTo go find out what qualifications you're going to need for the marketplace to say I'd hire Josh to do Web design that's that's number one homework assignment what additional qualifications slashed training education do you need and I'm I'm In college because I just mean getting\nMore equipped and getting up to date to make yourself marketable\nFind out what that is\nThat when you find out what that is the next question is how much is this going to cost me\nFinancially then the next question is\nBased on my budget based on getting out of debt and everything that's going on in my life if it's going to cost me this much much financially how long will it take for me to complete that qualification which will then make me qualified and marketable to do the role I wanted\nJosh ... that's all you got to do because once you get the answers to those questions that's your plan\nYou understand you just\nPlug and play at this point All right to continue this much I'm going to say this much money I take this class this course and then you begin to practice proximity and talk to people who are in the Web design space in Winston Salem North Carolina\nWho's hiring Web designers or this could be companies that hire internal people or maybe it's a marketing group a just a you begin to identify targets now this is all happening\nJosh while you're paying off debt\nAnd this current sixty five thousand dollar over time gig is not going to burn you out any more 'cause you're going to change your attitude toward gratitude which is this job is setting me up to step\nEasily\nAnd triumphantly into the role of I ultimately want a field do you see where that is you see that about a year from now\nOr it may be sooner if you get the qualification sooner and you can get a Web design job that's going to pay you sixty five thousand or sixty thousand after you've paid off the debt it's game changer all of a sudden Josh you're waking up on Monday morning fired up and feeling so white you're not even sure if you're sitting in the car\n[laughter] the center yeah but I mean you can see that can't you\nOr ten times as hard as I'm saying that it makes me my my attitude change already and I'm Glad I called you and I'm Glad you're clearly little later\nWe'll listen me and I'm Glad you called because I think there are millions of people that just hurts your story and they see themselves in your story\nBecause you've you've got it figured out and and it's just\nComing up with a basic plan Dave Ramsey has been giving people plan for twenty five plus years\nA folks there's five stages to realizing the dream one discovery who am I what do I want to do what I Want to do next research you just heard me walk Josh through research what I Need to learn to be able to do what I Want to do that after I figure out the research what I Need to know who I Need to know\nUh what I Need to learn who I Need to know then we're going to move into\nActually embarking stepping out and making something happen practice that proximity prince will get around people they're doing what you want to do get in places where what you want to do is happening that is the embarking your start knocking off those mini milestones and those goals\nYou're going to begin to achieve and as you achieve you originally\nGoing to step into that dream role of the role that you were created to fill the world needs you to perform\nThat's the final stage of ... and the dream that's meaning waking up like Josh wants to wake up each thread Monday morning how many of you dread Monday morning there'll be a shame that Seventy percent of Americans no longer\nThrilled to sit in front of a rambling on the same day for allowing me to do this career ... thank our producer James trials at our associate

Fox News Florida now considered to read you know the entrance tests that are all in local authorities continue to investigate a series of suspected bombs and a high profile Democrats and others one today found in New York City a pledge\nUm we're in baby steps to and looking to pay off about ten thousand dollars worth of debt by the end of the year or so we've been attacking it hard um and the question is actually referring to [noise]\nLike out there the sister who is twenty four she lives right now with our parents um and she's just an added a lot of trouble financially she upside down on a car payment I Know\nAnd just really struggling career wise as well\nUm she has expressed a desire to come and ... with us for a while and indeed and get back up on her feet\nAnd I want to know what a smart way to try and help her as I Do have a desire to help her um but I don't want it to cause any kind of stress between myself and you know my future wife and I don't want it there ever to be a situation where she you know stuck between myself and and her sister\nToo late um the uh [noise] she so when's the wedding date\nUm we're looking for some time around Christmas next year\nOkay why are you waiting until Christmas next year\nOr we would like for her to finish college before we get marriage to graduate for ... school\nWhy\nUm I don't know we just felt like it was a good decision to try and wait a little bit and and make sure that where\nYou don't whiter than the other job\nRight so I don't know what the differences you're right\nOkay just something to think about because it kind of affects the other question I'm not just being a smart I'm like okay I Know that's what he does this is your sister in law or if your girlfriend's sister there is a different right okay a girlfriend's sister wrong stuff on them a lot easier and I can't my sister in law were\nYou know and uh so you got to walk that through so here's the thing\nUh it takes strength to be gentle you guys are not standing on really strong relational strength right now you're not married\nAnd you're not standing home really strong financial strengths and for you all to be gentle with this other girl who's not got her act together who happens to be a sister\nUm is gonna be hard it's hard because you don't have a lotta margin you know\nVersus like sharing and I've been married thirty five years we got a Brazilian dollars okay so we can handle this kid without any trouble\nYou see what I'm saying you see the French and so you guys every little thing is going to be sand paper every little thing is going to be fingernails on the chalk board um and so I I\nUm\nIf you were married for three days or three weeks and you called messes same question I Would have to say I think it's a really good thing for you guys to help her at a little bit more of a distance than down the hallway\nMhm I wouldn't move around with you I'm not sure I Would put ahead of her need I Want to help her I'm with you\nBut there's there's really a lot I'm just being an old guy now a lot of financial guy okay there's just a lot a downside to this relation like I'm In ... you know\nShe comes in there you can't there's no there's nothing ... if you're sort of your fiance decided she's going to be an enabler and give her sister money you you start stepping in and say and that's a bad idea you you're going to be the bad guy\nA and really and you know or you get to participate in enabling and both of these things are stupid and so nobody's going to tell this girl no because everybody stand often from each other they try and get later then I I wouldn't move around\nA if she wants to come to town will feeder occasionally she can come by ... lover and she needs to get a roommate and have a job and come to town and get our act together and be like a stand up adult if she comes she could come for three weeks and stay well she's looking for her first place but at the end of three weeks\nPre arranged three weeks an exact date that we've been ... on the email that says we will be out\nBy the state and the so otherwise you look up three years later and the three weeks are still going so yeah I'm just put a date on it\nJust dangerous really really dangerous for you guys [noise]\nI think for the call this is the Ramsey show [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do

T. K. yes so bad [noise]\nYou're joining us today Ramsey show\nCarla is with us in Jackson, Mississippi hey Carl how are you\nDoing very well thank you for taking my call I'm sure\nWell I think ... is that um there's three in the household my husband and myself and um my dad passed away two years ago so mom on the line with us so um because she couldn't\nMake it on her own that we just kinda combine our income um our monthly income with three of us command is thirty four hundred and forty dollars I've done the everyday dollar budget and\nWe're like forty seven dollars I'm not over budget as things stand now um we had back in January we had an identity theft going down in our account and that it is\nAnd so in is that possible yes that is possible it's very possible but you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or\nWhatever and again it doesn't I don't want to put a bunch of strain on you physically but um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation where the over the phone so you could have an intelligent conversation was on my own sell them something right\nAnd that that's possible thing you can do um the you know\nAnd it doesn't cause you to work forty hours a week necessarily but if you could do anything that creates a thousand dollars a month it would change your world and that's that's really what I Would work on rather than try to solve the forty seven dollar problem that you've got what that is a symptomatic of the fact that you're struggling with income\nAnd legitimately ... you're struggling by 'cause you're lazy or something like that but it just hand\nIf you could come up with any kind of a small business idea that your husband and you could do together um and just get them to get the needle to move a little bit here man\nIt would change everything for you a thank you for the call open phones interpolate eight to five five two to five Benjamin is in Oklahoma City Hi Benjamin how are you\nAt Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so my wife and I graduated college about a little over a year ago and we got a good job\nAnd bought a house good and I'm Wondering in your eyes are they're getting on to what are we paid it off about half the boy ...\nWondering and your eyes or your parents or any kind of financial perspective is a good time to start thinking about having kids ... wife's getting kinda pushy and that it I'm sure mhm ah so I just wanted to get your thoughts on it\nNow I was actually the one that won a kid's faster than Sharon ... who she won but I'm\nA I I don't think that there's a financial manager other than just being completely crazy like if you you don't want to sixteen kids or if you're broke that stupid okay that's crazy but you guys are in great shape your sharp young couple whenever you're ... whenever you're emotionally in relation to ready to have kids in God's says it's okay to have kids\nGo have kids I I don't I don't tell people that need to be out of debt and have their emergency when there's not a baby step for kids\nUm you know you don't have to be a certain place you're going to be fine a child is not going to destroy your life financially or as a matter of fact you probably won't even hardly notice everybody talks about oh children ... five hundred and sixty two thousand dollars to raise yeah really not really they eat the same broccoli you eat after a certain point\nThere in the early in the same warm house you're already in after a certain point and so the actual cost of a kid is just\nNot that it's not devastating\nBut again you don't want to just load up a whole house full of them if you're broke and that that will cause a problem but to decide to have your first couple of children I mean it's that's not something that's between you and God and your wife\nAnd you guys are in good shape financially smart you're already moving in the right direction you want to start now it doesn't bother me at all\nThis is the Dave Ramsey show\nDid you know that if you combined the data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every American had their personal info compromised or act over fifty percent of our listeners and viewers tell us that they or someone in their family has been a victim and Seventy percent of those folks have had\nIt happen more than once she this is unbelievable wants the you get your info the risk never goes away and they can use it whenever and however they choose it truly
