a victory lap I'm Roger eastern Fox News President Trump at a campaign rally tonight in Richmond, Kentucky talking about securing the release of American pastor Andrew Brunson\nRick it's a pleasure once again to be here with you and to to have the opportunity to ask you some questions about why health concerns come up and so much of what we discuss on this show has to do with the very basic things that one can do for oneself\nWithout involving medicines or doctor visits and so because of the time of the years is a time when people start to get\nColds and cars and lung problems things like that so I thought this might be a good opportunity versus discussed just the simple act of breathing and I mean despite the fact that it is so natural breeding is something you do without having to think about it\nAnd yet why is that there's so many people are breathing correctly\nWell at at at the end of the day market goes back to one reason and typically one reason only and that's called emotional holding and it's not knowing how to keep everything bottled up and have it makes sense without losing it completely\nSo much in our society is pressure filled and people are pressured and spend most of their time simply trying to hold it all together and this holding this emotional holding inhibits normal breathing patterns and and creates a imbalances within that whole breathing mechanism\nSo when you're holding back from being able to breathe fully what what are the problems that than result is from that happening\nWhile incident amount I mean we need oxygen in order to start the ah fire so to speak to get the metabolic process he used to occur in when there's a lack of oxygen what what happens mark you know then you start to feel faith lightheaded and and uh you'll pass out and then you go back to breathing normally but if if you don't have\nEnough oxygen if you can't get enough oxygen in if there isn't enough oxygen for you to breathe what ultimately happens you die you dye eggs satire is it's interesting because because God made breathing free\nAll the oxygen that we need is available in our immediate environment\nUnless you put yourself in a contrived environment which is very common nowadays with temperature controlled and climate controlled environments and having your smart thermostat and all of this other technology that goes along or most of our environments are contrived and they're controlled or which which is fine but um\nIf if you're just simply in an environment\nYou're going to a breeze and you're going to be able to exchange whatever needs to be exchanged than a normal fashion now the challenge runs into which I'm sure we'll get into as the show goes on as well what happens when that doesn't work properly well then then you get then you get respiratory issues but at the end of the day\nThe most vital important ingredient that human beings need to survive and continue to live\nIs the one that God has made free which is just simply oxygen out of the air and our ability to breathe that\nYeah I mean um it it takes very little time for you to become you know injured or damage brain damage from a ... not being able to breathe\nRight there's there's three vital ingredients that we need for survival there's food and we can go you know as many as three or four weeks without any\nReal food I mean I see that on the on the TV show a naked and afraid sometimes they go as long as thirty days without eating any real substance and their body as degenerating and his breaking down and feeding on itself but the person is still viable um\nAnd so eating is important but more important than eating is the next vital resource that they all have to it's a choir on this show which is potable drinking water they need water\nSo food is your third biggest priority water is your second biggest priority and number one is what we're going to talk about today which is being able to breathe and you can't go very long without oxygen to the brain and otherwise you create brain damage\nNow as I understand it I mean your your lungs are located in your chest so would it be natural to be breathing in your chest\nWhile there's a big misconception to say yes that that are all breathing should take place in your chest except when you become a chest breather mark when you breeze above your diaphragm\nYou actually create problems and your breath is restricted now why is it restricted what what is the the a cage so to speak that surrounds your lungs whether that called drip Kate Ascher rib cage exactly I gave you a good ... so the rib cages there to act as protection\nBut it also unfortunately is every stricter\nSo as you go from the top of the cage to the bottom of the cage the cage actually expand its narrow in constricted up top where your first ribs\nAnd your classical and your spine all come together it's very it's closed off up there all day and then as you move down the ... cavity where all your ribs are down to your diaphragm it actually expands and opens up\nAnd so the the base of your lungs both faces of your lungs are wider than the ABCs of your lungs of the tops of your lungs and so I'm your lungs are meant to expand but they're not meant to expand up they're meant to expand down in what helps to facilitate that is your diaphragm\nAnd so when you're diaphragm expands downward because your lungs are filling down with their they fill up with their but they fill up in a downward motion which is kind of confusing to kind of a community where you don't fill up your lungs even though you do fill your lungs your lungs actually fill in a downward direction\nBut if you hold your diaphragm in place and you have everything above the diaphragm moving that's called chest breathing then you actually have restricted breathing as a result of that\nNow that the diaphragm is a very interesting a part of the body um\nIt's not an Oregon but it is a muscle that separates the threats a cavity where your lungs and your heart and your esophagus are from your abdominal cavity which houses the stomach\nAnd all your other vital organs per se and the diaphragm it's supposed to expand down when you fill your lungs were there and it's supposed to move back up into its original position when you exhale or\nLet go of the air this in your lungs and so that diaphragm is supposed to have a moving\nAction of going down when you breathe in and coming back up when you breathe out\nAnd if you allow your diaphragm to move it does a couple of things number one and helps you process your emotions\nIt's where all your emotions are actually facilitated as far as letting them go and if you don't freeze properly die of Frank medically then you're going to become an emotional holder and when you become an emotional holder then you start to have issues that affect how your lungs function because the first organ that's going to be affected with not\nExpanding attracting properly is going to be your lungs and so I'm\nIdeally we want people to be a belly breather which means when you breathe and fully your belly below your diaphragm should start to expand now and you should actually be able to see that\nBut Madison Avenue in the modeling industry and the magazine industry and and all the ways that we sell how a person looks industry does it look very attractive to have your belly coming out every\nYou know twenty times a minute or uh even Fifteen times a minute depending upon how many respiration do you have permitted\nWell people miss associate that expanded belly with a fat belly right right and that's not considered good so what\nMost people do in an effort to not look like they have a fat belly\nWell then you're going to hold that deli in\nYeah you're going to hold it in and you're not going to let your diaphragm moved away that it's supposed to which means you're not going to process your emotions the way that you're supposed to win all of that trapped energy over time is going to create health problems\nNow at the at the juncture where your diet for him is is the sort of ... and that's really is kind of the central seat for emotions isn't it\nYour solar flex is as a as a collection of nerves that regulate a whole bunch of different functions within the body related to metabolizing digesting and processing our our ingredients and uh I remember as a little kid if you if you get quote hit in the solar Plex his then you're diaphragm\nDoesn't move and then you have to send you can't breathe and it's like the most death defying experienced that you can have and and\nIf you've ever experienced that you know that you don't want to ever experience that again kind of thing and so when you paralyze the solar flex is or you or hinder the diaphragm from expanding and contracting appropriately then it's very very hard to breathe and that it's like I said is very very uncomfortable so\nThe interesting thing about belly breathing is when you do belly breathe what it does is it pushes down against your digestive system organs and then when you breathe out it\nReleases that pressure and so what happens is you create a pumping action that massages your digestive organs and allows you to better digest your food so those who typically are constipated\nThose who typically are have difficulty moving things through their vowels are those people are probably ... and just simply by concentrating briefly for a period of time and getting into the understanding and and the felt sense and the rhythm of valley breathing\nWill probably make your ... and go away without any of the other uh ancillary services that they will convince you that you need to come in and have done or the products that you need to take it cetera and it all goes back just simply into breathing\nTo just to breathing now it's interesting that the the the diet for instance would still talking about that uh when it contracts it goes down so the tension or the or the NFL part of it is not the relaxation phase and it's when you exhale\nThat that muscle than relaxing releases so when you talk about\nOh absolutely in a year the listener I appreciate you being

reason why you have what you have\nAnd we can address the Y. and then the Y. goes away and then your condition goes away and don't sign up for the treadmill of treatment to where you treat it every day for the rest of your life and never actually addressed the cause and are today mark and I've been talking about conditions related to breathing and how important breathing is and I'm sure you have many other question\nI mean one question that strikes me is that you know a lot of what is in the air is not oxygen so does that mean that the lungs filter and exhale the parts of the year we don't need\nA the lungs filter or the respiratory system we talked about the hairs in the nose and he talked about what goes on to get the lungs are to fill with air and the importance of that but the lungs are are a filter it's an external filler it's it's our it's our air filter in our vehicle if you will\nAnd making sure that the air is is filtered and processed and are\nLetting the oxygen in that is required for our metabolic process sees is important but they are yes there are other ingredients there are things like nitrogen it's it's it's in our area obviously there's there's carbon dioxide in the air because we exhale that the nice thing is is that trees are are\nAre a a processing plant of carbon dioxide back into their extra tore product which has oxygen and then we take that oxygen and we process who are processing plant and we excrete carbon monoxide and so there's a symbiosis between us and plants and\nWe need to make sure that we maintain that understanding because they're the ones that help keep us alive\nThat said yeah that said that the breed the lungs of for the earth really right correct now I'm so if you're if you're not able to to move your chest area is that going to be causing you breathing problems\nUm well that depends I mean in in a perfect breath if you're a belly breathing your chest doesn't move at all and I demonstrate this when I'm teaching people how to properly breathe that I can put her hand on my belly and a hand on my chest and I can breathe and fully in my chest pain never moves\nAnd that's because your your rib cages in primarily about breathing you rip cages primarily about muscle attachment and protection for the lungs and your heart or as those are vital organs for our survival so not chest breathing\nNot being able to excrete the carbon dioxide out of your lungs where the COPD or something like that is going to create barrel shifting because there's going to be ankle low sing that goes on within the muscles that hold and support the rib cage\nAnd then if your rib cage isn't moving properly at that point yes that becomes a healthy balance and health detriment but uh in a perfect world if your belly breathing you're not using very much of your upper part of your body anyway and then the energy for that can be a\nYou know transferred over to your arms for reaching and carrying it\nAnd pulling and doing the things that you need your arms for but you know as far as the the rib cage moving as flexible so that we can bend forward backwards to the side says and and rotate and all of those things we need that flexibility for our movement but\nThe chest expanding and contracting when you breathe that's not the primary\nMotion that is it's designed for\nIs is it a problem with the chess moves as well as the deli breeding\n'em it's you're just not breathing efficiently and you're not getting the the most out of your breath and it's not serving the purpose of what proper breathing is all about or are you going to die from being a chest ... no you're not going to die you're just not going to you're probably going to have digestive issues as a result of not massaging those digestive organs overtime\nNo I guess my question is I mean if you if your belly breeding 'em then can your chest also expand and because you were talking about when you can demonstrate that you don't have to move your chest muscles all but what about both\nWhat if you're really really really breathing deeply mhm when you're diaphragm has fully expanded then if your lungs are still taking in air than yes your rib cage is going to expand and you're going to see that the that the chest part of their breathing is there\nBut for the average person breathing doesn't involve the chest if you're doing it correctly so you go to the extremes of breathing\n[noise] maybe an athlete or a yoga masters and\nWell an editor yoga master those people are good belly breeders and they can get everything they need because they train their bodies to be a fish in it that doing that um if if the novice who's\nYou know when I'm teaching people how to belly breathe and reduce their high it'll hernia and the conditions that come along from backwards breathing\nWe go through the process of helping them to see what a belly breath feels like and and get them to focus in on that and and once they get that they're just like wow this is easier than I thought it would be and I don't know why I was doing it backwards on years and it's again that goes back to the emotional holding\nYeah yeah yeah now a so your posture most and have a significant effect on your breathing as well it\nDefinitely can have a a significant impact on your breathing and so you want to have good posture\nI'm your posture changes when you're breathing is inadequate\nReally your body actually adjust to the fact in the bones deformed to the fact that you're a breathing in and inadequate way and and you can get a ... which is like having a hunchback of Notre Dame kind of thing okay Hi you see these senior citizens who\nAre all hunched over in a lot of them are in my experiences have majority of them have been a older females are all hunched over and and that has to do with a\nYou know psychological perspective to wear 'em want a woman develops breast tissue if if they're made fun of or if they develop breast earlier or larger than the majority of their there are other female friends et cetera\nThey may get poked fun at or they may uh you know become self conscious and what they'll do is they'll roll their shoulders and in an effort to hide their breasts and that also influences\nHow they breathe and how they carry their head and all of that and over the course of forty fifty sixty Seventy years that that will contribute to a deformity within your spine in deformity within your ability to breed\nMhm [noise] now what about problems with the airway before it gets to your lungs are are there\nMeaning the wrong guy or a yeah ... yeah I mean I mean the people get killed ... by the rocky on the wrong key all those things yeah um when you get that kind of um if you get milk is in your bronco and you get a bronchitis or or uh\nYou get inflammation of your bronco ... which still still call the bronchitis the question is is okay if if\nAir can't get in and out efficiently because of the inflammation okay uh you're dealing with things like asthma and that kind of stuff it's it's\nObviously a detriment to the person's ability to exchange gases appropriately the oxygen and carbon dioxide and um that that's going to lead to issues\nSo are those are those costs and things like that generally related to bronchial problems more than lung problems\nWell that depends on the cause and where the airways being affected generally will involve the bronco guy and this is where the ... needs to go through in order for to clear to clear the airways\nUm so if it does involve the bronco guy Abramoff ... and the Bronx Bronx GI than than yeah that that's going to be an issue as far as being able to um more most likely release the air and not necessarily so much bring the air and\nThat you can get to work on it right away it's a great prize the value of fifty bucks to get a call right now for your chance to win\nOne eighty they'd money that you didn't need six six six three nine seven four\nVicky in Louisiana is on the line with a

many forms of social media because as we are here\nSmall Hong Kong writer\nAnd I remember you can do it yourself that you know what\nWhere the soil is running away from the foundation dropping about six inches over four feet you can plant something on that grass remote or stone after but make sure you have good solid drainage they'll talk about the vents in the ... space you need to have enough vents\nSo probably one or two on each wall need to make sure that the crawl space for has a vapor barrier on it what's the ... floor now and for me\nIt's vapor barrier so it's it's completely covered in plastic right okay\nAnd then the other thing that you could do is you could add vet fans to to the walls\nAnd have them wired odd too humid a stat so that when the moisture builds up inside the crawl space because the humidity is high the fans will come on and draw the drier air and from the outside so those are things that you could do now without spending a whole lot of money\nTo try to dry that space out yeah now the idea of an absolutely the cross space\nIs not a bad approach and many homes are starting to be built that way today but that literally means stealing everything off a hundred and ten percent\nOr so since you're kind of closer to being able to improve the grading improve the drainage a double check that they were buried to make sure it's really solid and it's you know second covering every aspect of the cross mix for sure if it overlaps overlaps about ten feet\nOr make sure it's up against the the foundation walls and then get good ventilation cross ventilation and they're using some advance wire do you miss that you may find that that gives you the rest of the rest of the moisture reduction that you that was left over after you rerun those those strange\nOK okay sounds good thank you\nYou're welcome Ron good luck with that project thanks so much for calling us at ADD money pit Julian Colorado was on the line and have a question\nMy question is regarding how and how energy efficient they might be because all of the house are electric they are very high\nAnd how is your house heated right now Julie\nIt hit with a sport and actually we don't even really ... our house for hate one round the F\nRight now you're cheating with electric resistance heat which as you accurately stated is the most expensive type of heat\nNow heat pump system would be far less expensive but it would require a duct system to be installed throughout the house so you would have that upfront cost of running the heating ducks have you had a system installed the way he works is it's kind of like an air conditioning system that runs all winter\nExcept that in the wintertime the refrigeration system is reversed now if you've ever walk say by a window air conditioner in the summer you know it blows hot air out the back of it out to the outside if you sort of took that window air conditioner out and flip it around and stuck it in so I didn't have any ...\nAnd the people in the hot air in the house that's essentially what happened to the reverse is the refrigeration cycle in the wintertime now generally speaking heat pumps are not always recommended for very very cold climates because he pumps only maintain the heat when there's a tutor differentiation between what the temperature is set at\nA was the temperature is and what the temperature is set out and I should say\nSo if you set your temperature at Seventy it falls is sixty nine that he goes on this fall's inside the sixty eight the heat pump stays on that falls a sixty seven the heat pump says to its electric resistance backup system which is always part um hey I Can't keep up with this I Need some help turn on the heating coils\nAnd then you're not saving any money so we'll let's say will be less expensive than baseball electric yes but it has a significant upfront cost in terms of the installation because you'd need a duck system as well as the heat pump equipment that makes sense\nOkay sounds good thank you\nGood luck with that project thanks so much for calling us at eight eight eight money [noise]\nYou know I Can't even the money pet home

bucks number again as one entity might it\nMight in Pennsylvania stands on the roof tell us what's going on there\nYeah I have a kind of in northern parts of the roof on my house um my shell area as well as my neighbors have these black streaks um it seems to be part of the roof it doesn't get a lot of\n... and my question was you know I guess first of all what what is it ... ... is there a way that I clean up ice shelf it's a homeowner or do I do I have to hire somebody to some street\nWell generally those streets are made up of algae or moss and they have more frequently on the north side of the roof because it's a cooler side of the roof and there's more shade there\nIt's slowing down too much\nSo this is a gravity situation so let's give you a gravity solution let's have the drainage work with you and not against you and by the way\nYou can see all this so the cows come home and it's still going to find that ... on his way in which you have to do is stop the water from accumulating it's on the opposite side of this retaining wall I'm guessing that there's some run off that goes towards the wall yes there is\nSo what you're going to want to do is is intercept that run off so we don't get as much for the collection that area where we want to try to do is limit the amount of war that gets in an area that just direct rainfall with no runoff that means no gutter discharge no a runoff from higher elevations\nSo the way we do that is is first of all examine the situation in the mission there's no water dropping\nAt the high side of this war could work its way down if there is you've got to run a pipe underground to get it to a place where it's not going to interfere with a with leaking into the basement secondly in terms of intercepting the run off what you could do is installed something called a curtain drained Richard it's really it's a rather simple drain you might construct yourself\nYou took a trench that's about twelve inches deep and twelve inches wide you put some stone in the trench then you put a ... type on top of the stone surrounded with more stone\nLay a piece of filter cloth across the top and cover with soil so it's all done it's invisible in the end of that dream that you just installed should exit the daylights somewhere so you figure out the best way to do that based on the configuration of your yard will that will do is they'll intercept the water that's coming down from higher elevations\nIt'll fall into the trench come up to the pipe and then run around the house as opposed to collecting in that particular corner\nIf we can keep the water from collecting in that area\nYou will probably be just fine because it's rare that just direct rainfall accumulates enough water to actually leaving the house it's almost always the runoff from gutters and from drainage\nRight well and needless to say I probably have to do some uh get rid of landscaping because it's got some a little green Bush's ear along along that well as well so\nYeah and that's a good point 'cause sometimes you can make the problem worse by having landscaping that traps water suggest thing in terms of water control here not in terms of trying to steal that water out to be in good shape [noise]\nAll right thanks so much for calling that might impact now when breakdown in your home you know that life can come to a screeching halt
