I feel like Donald Trump last night in his rally\nDid what he did but the mainstream media would actually pick up the story because nobody was talking about the inconsistencies of ... a doctor board has the money and I think that he did\nThat because he knew they would all talk about how Rudy was or how inappropriate he wise but in order to do\nThat they would actually have to show what he actually said and so I feel like\nDid that any like that you know what I'm taking a bullet for for Kavanaugh why I've been on hold for the last two hours and get ten minutes\nOr I Will tell you been on the phone for two hours in Fifteen minutes I'm Sorry I don't even have that are my clock here\nThat's fine my my I I I've had the opportunity to educate my daughter's on why this is so important

pulp he was hanged he was then burned go ahead\nYeah and in two thousand a Caroline Bryant at the time of the initial allegations Caroline Dunham at the time and she was Nate recanted her story and said that she lied about his story\nUm of course her husband and brother in law who didn't launching and who were initially um put on trial for the lynching of this young man\nOn the you don't believe me when I say we're about to run out of time do you\nKnow so I Do I\nGet to the point\nHe's okay oh you're gonna miss it\nAll right Donald Trump is the one you asked the department of justice to reopen a case on July well out in and he'll because a woman lie about sexual ...\nAll right I understand your point thank you we can find many many examples of people lying about crimes that they accused others of being committed we can't the history books are filled with them and not just our history books the world's history books are\nTwice when we created this country and when it was a stylish we decided to do something else\nNot only does the accuser have to prove their case against the accused the bar is even higher it's not a fifty fifty proposition\nIf you choose somebody of criminal activity depending on the crime the worst of the crime the higher the stand the worse the allegation the hunter the standard\nBeyond a reasonable doubt if you're accusing somebody of raping you are sexually molesting yeah beyond a reasonable doubt\nAs a standard in most places ladies and gentleman there doubt all over the place here this has been politicized horribly\nThe Democrats don't care about the truth they wouldn't know the truth to the punch them in the nose it's not about the truth same with most of the media in this country\nAnd they're having a grand old time if you're watching TV endlessly pumping the same stories looping the same video using that breaking news breaking news breaking news when there's no breaking news they're planning us and I for one am sick and tired of it\nI Want to thank you for Georgia for holding so long I didn't realize it but I Will say I've been hammering this point about are inconsistencies now for [noise]\nMany of them as well so what if there were a lot less yeah everyone squarely so my point is if you're not using them and their squarely there is no squirrel\nTwice\nYou know so I Would I wouldn't tell them I Would add it and then you can choose which one you want to use from time to time and it was widely you got the big coverage and you can drop the squirrel okay yeah that's I wouldn't bring it up as long as you're not as long as you're not doing anything to\nInterface with the Medicaid system then they're not even going to know and you're not doing anything wrong because you're not taking money I mean you're just you're just not activating the squirrel\nYeah yeah and I mean I guess as long as we're not using it there you know\nThere are not even going to have some yeah they want to notice now and then if you step back and start using it they might notice and then they might have something and if they do and it causes a problem just lean back over on your husband's policy at that point\nYeah our pay the bill like we would have to anyway yeah\nI Would just I I think I Would just put 'em on there didn't cost anything which put 'em on that plan and start using that plan and then if you ever want to reach back over to medicate on the shoulder for something you've got that as an option\nOkay yeah and I mean again it's it's great for these you know emergencies but the ongoing care which is you know the thing we need once or twice a year and it's just miserable\nMhm mhm Oh absolutely\nYeah and it feels weird to even have it I mean it's just frankly just bizarre to to present that as an option to a doctor when we go into a doctor's office\nYou know when I hear you what's your household income\nAnd it's variable but it's not there to fifty oh no I wouldn't I wouldn't screw with that I'm with you OK yeah and I mean I guess what I'm On\nThe husband's plan and news I just leave it sitting over there in Ninety nine point nine percent of the time you're not going to have him on the shoulder anyway and don't worry about\nOkay okay well that sounds good that's good advice and it gives us a plan for November when we have to make this decision as good as it doesn't cost anything it exactly I

Fifteen\nAnd we make a pretty good income shootout about one twenty annually I met one eighty three hundred come on\nThe question for you is I was a move back to school and get my master's programs

that\n... masters in one oh it would be in software engineering ... ...\nAnd it would increase your income by more than twenty five K\n[laughter] it would probably be hard to say I'm there wouldn't be a winning case and you raise because of the category of jump into\nMhm okay what are you uh do you get back into it would make it back in touch over a year then from\nThat point so that's really nice return I think you can put that in the budget and the reason you can put it in the budget as you make so stinking much money now you live in a very expensive area granted\nIt's crazy\nBut I didn't want to live in a really rough ... you know but you guys are really you're really spending\nMoney ...\nAnd so I mean how quick can we pay off four hundred well we can pay off four hundred and two years if we do it in two hundred a year that mean you'd be living on a hundred I'm not sure you can do that after taxes in your area so you probably got a three year and get out of debt plan\nBut you know vacations you don't need to see the inside of a restaurant and don't you dare tell me about buying anything else\nYou bought enough for a while you need that you need a live like people that make a hundred people that make three hundred and get this debt ceiling\nIn the process of doing that can you we've twenty grand a friend in the budget\nThis is\nA common theme around here is teaching

you're with this is the Dave Ramsey show\nBrandon is on Twitter Ivan equity line of credit on a rental property where we're paying\nThis all fall into the baby steps\nWhat brand on if it's relatively small you easily could stick it in to baby step to most of the time we let real estate dead of all kinds lay a baby step six\nUh if you have a very large equity line of credit on a rental property you might want to refinance it into a traditional mortgage and get rid of the risk associated with the pop and interest rates are possible call provision for that line of credit\nAnd I don't want to get yourself in a pinch where the bank of calling notes uh that they're allowed them to call based on the way that is written in like that lack of\nLiquidity as we see could put you in a problem you know the cash to pay 'em [noise] so um but so you know you got like a ... you make a hundred dollars a year you got a hundred thousand our line of credit that's probably refinance you make a hundred

up\n[noise] um how do I have for college and not go into debt\nOkay how old are you ... Eighteen very cool what are you going to study\nUm possibly um [noise] pretty much anything that I can get into were ... I can\nI T yeah she said okay so you like technology yeah All right well\nUm I I think the first go before you go start your education process is you need to have an idea of what you're going to study because that will change the answer to your question that you asked okay so let's say for instance that you wanted to be a Web programmer\nAnd um I've got folk guys on my team that make 'em in excess of a hundred thousand dollars well in excess of that that that are right ruby on rails code okay\nNot a bad career and uh that's an example of an ... type of thing okay and Web programmer writing code\nIf you're going to do that you would not need and it would not be preferable for you to get a four year degree in information technology that's not necessary to do that\nYou would need to take some classes on how to code and you'd want to learn you know some of the basic got teeth things and so I Would probably direct you towards a vote tech type school or which is probably a two year degree\nWhile you're studying and everything that and I would tell you to work your tail off in the technology field uh and if you can\nUh you know bring coffee for people who are doing code and just watch over their shoulder and learn from them and hang out from them and you're a new hobby is hanging out with people who are world class code riders ... was in a you know and you're taking some classes that'll get you and they're more than a four year degree will get you and there's a lot cheaper\nBut it depends on what I mean when you say ... but you could change your mind but I'm ... I'm not going to do I T I Want to go into business well then you might want to do a four year degree with a degree you know the specialization in marketing or finance or something like that and in that case the answer would be different on how to pay for it here's the thing you want to number one", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Savannah", "day": "04"}
