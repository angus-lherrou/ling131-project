now she's eight month old how old are you two thirty four and are you saying okay\nAll right and he took the show they took this apprentice jobs how long ago\nIt's been about six months\nAnd they're written promises that at the completion of The Apprentice apprenticeship that he will have a access to this kind of income\n[noise] no no\nI never heard of an architectural sales apprenticeship so I'm just is new to me I'm trying to understand\nWhy it would do this you know it's not\nNot a new aren't like in a very common thing and that's all right you got him in the door and a condition um advocate at a lot of people don't get\n... on our own likely we totally believe in that actual how can I just I don't know if you're in the meantime it's like okay\nWe're only working forty hours during the ... would be working on the job\nRight\nYou got you got bills to pay you can't pay and his wife who's got a baby at home is calling me it's a pretty simple equation and has more money so how far ... what is his income that I was thirty and and what do you how much would another thousand dollars a month change your life\nIt would definitely help we're hearing more calm and you know like we can look at it again and I guess I just you know we're not we're just barely paying\nAre trying to make you feel our calm I'm trying to get your where you can ... medically pay the bills

now you're having to put up with her\n[laughter] goes with the territory is what'd you got signed up for it you know you can't afford to move out while he's on the apprenticeship right that's your

Want to know exactly on friday by friday\nWant to know what the guidelines are of this apprenticeship won it in my income goes up truck and move out of your mother's basement\nThis ... this I Hope they keep their word I think they're going to keep their word but I'm not even sure what word they gave me it doesn't work for me I think you guys need a nail this deal down so he you know what you signed up for and you know what you've signed up for so you can see alive and the tunnel and you can put a chart on the wall when you get to move out of his mother's basement\nAnd um and then he needs to work and extra job to get the bills paid and I'm going to guess and say you have a big honking car payment and he'd sell the car or just a guess but it's a fairly educated guess so I Would add that

[noise]\n\n\n[noise] I was Seventeen so\nI'm not that I'm overwhelmed\nStuff happening everywhere I look for something fun is good happening she'll be good is happening smart conference this weekend was an absolute blowout\nChristie right ... business boutique founder equipping women to make money doing what they love joins me for a couple of segments if you've got questions ladies about business you can join us here the phone numbers triple eight eight to five five two to five\nYou did a new talk that I'm nursing you do I'd I'd actually seeing little pieces of some of the talk and you kinda stitched it together in a different way and book ended it with some stories and open shorter closures story that\nHad everybody in the audience crying knock rod commercials so I'm an I'm an easy target right but uh I'm a I'm a ... shop the ground balls are crowded everything but and you and me ball and out there it was ... ... but a powerful story about in your talk was about overcoming fear yeah a bright talk\nThank you yeah it's a it's a really important topic and I've I've really taught on this topic for years at Business Week because it's a number one barrier to why women don't go for it why they don't chase their dream or use their talents or start a business or a you know try something new it's really fear that hold them back and see if I can help them\nGet to the fear and through the fear that I can give them all the help and business that they need but when we started dreaming up smart conference tunnel nice balance for years\nThat okay let's keep it fresh let's do something new and a Jeremy Jeremy ... you know my leader and myself we're talking how can we apply this content to this audience and really realize that it's so easy because everyone deals with fear whether it's in your marriage or or in your relationships your career and so I worked hard to take that talk and adapted for this audience um ... I was really happy with how it turned\nOut it was really really strong range of stuff\nThat was so much of it I mean I I've been uh I just was editing a bargain commercial break a couple of commercials where I'd go back to the content people on a blog article I'd written them a few weeks ago before I even heard her talk and they had you know that element of overcoming fear because I think there's so much we talk about transforming around here a lot of transformation transfer forming and\nGetting yourself out of debt transforming her marriage outlets parrot talks about that ritual him less with marriage and money a van or a you know Anthony with transforming with your teenagers you ladies in business and every time this transformation as a possibility failures of possibility and fear Cape kicks in\nAnd doesn't that voice in your head gets really loud\nAnd it starts to even sound rational and you start to make make excuses that really make you make a lot of sense and you stay stuck but if you have someone that can speak into your life whether it's a mentor a friend a spouse that says you can do this and here's how and you lay out the path which we've been talking about that even just today that's what\nA you know ran the solution is so great at getting people to plan whether it's with their money or their business and so on um that I loved\nThat quote from the tri athletes should don't listen to your self talk to your so yeah it it was listening to yourself just start telling yourself the way it's going to be attacked and even how he describes and he's just so funny walks around talking to him\nYeah when I listen to myself all hears beer in doubt and worry but when I talked to myself I can tell myself anything I Want to and it that simple as you can tell myself into something\nSo today it's here how did your new project is here I was little so book is cool this we don't even given anybody I Know I mean no one knows so this is like big time announcement right now are holding my hand the business boutique\nTwenty Nineteen gold plan or your personal guide to getting results and this thing is chock full with a step by step process to change your life talk about putting this together and what's in this go planner\nWell when I introduced it to our team a few weeks ago really the best way that I could explain it as there are different things that I use my own personal life to grow and to improve and reach my goals I read books to grow I Will use work books if I'm doing a devotion or Bible study I have to do list and I use a journal to write down goal and the calendar and a calendar\nHow can we pull all of these pieces together into a planner that connect those dots so for example in January we set goals and then we talk about what we actually uh put those on the counter than we put them on the task lesson you begin to see\nHow those goals you set in January really can carry through the entire year and and the way that bill today was like I Would have coaching session so I have questions in there for reflection and activities to work through so if I was sitting down with your coffee these the questions I Would ask you to help you get to where you want to be so it's really fun and then every single month\nHas a different topic in teaching\nTo help you grow and this is kind of like a complement to business boutique book it's almost like a workbook to help she put it in\nThe month of August is taking care of view yeah and then you've got questions when they're when do you feel your best what activates what activities give you energy and bringing joy and what things make you like yourself the ...\nThat's awesome first of all I Love how you introduce yourself you said I'm a young entrepreneur in right there that mindset\nIs already going to set you up for success you already see yourself in his face that just screams confidence and I love that\nI Will tell you one of the great things a million I see that's a lot is you don't have to wait until you graduate from college to start working on this this is something that you could have a side business\nAnd start while you're in college to help you not only pay your bills\nBut then you're building up demand building up your brand by the time you graduate this could be your full time job in fact um I worked with a guy that did that he started a little T shirt business Dave in college little T shirt business that was a multimillion dollar business before he ever graduated and that was his full time thing so I mean you can do this I just want to encourage him\nThe idea that it's difficult to get in this space because you're a girl I think\nIs more in your head than in reality if you build great pieces people want to buy them if you solve problems for people if you had a great product and you take care of the marketplace they don't really care if it was you or do some old someone young they just love the furniture\nI Am I'm an older doesn't buy furniture but my wife went through a decorator and I can just tell you either my wife or I were we buy a piece of custom made furniture made by a lady that would actually be a brand that advantage 'cause we would think that was pretty cool\nYeah that you had that you have a good eye for it that there's yeah I think a million that you this does it have to be a barrier for you if anyone that gets an advantage is just you just get started because you're going to get the most confidence when you saw that first piece even if it's small piece even if you sell it to your aunt I don't care\nJust get started dip your toe in the water and million will make sure that Kelly since my book and you can follow that plan at the step by step plan to grow this business and start small start on the sly side and you'll see your confidence growing up promised you a ... that will be a non issue it won't even be a fear in your head anymore because like David said you'll start to see it as an advantage\nThat you offer the marketplace through your business that excited for you the fact that you're even asking this question and making that phone call girl you got big things ahead for you I'm so excited for you\nSo let me tell you what happened to me a million when I went broke and I wrote a book about how to handle money I'm a broke a show on a book about money\nThat's kind of a disadvantage and all of us who\nWould want to read them money book from a guy that went broke that's what I used to think and after seven Fifteen million bucks I kinda figured out everybody wants to buy a money book from a guy who weren't broken learned his lesson\nAnd so it actually turned into my what I thought was my disadvantage what my my insecurity that felt like a disadvantage\nEnded up actually being my brand differentiate her because I Know how people feel I've been there done that I got the T shirt you've got a brand advantages you've got the female touch\nOn the furniture um and you're going to put a different kind of look different kind of feel to it\nAnd uh and it makes you different you're not just another group making furniture it's really cool you know it makes you stand out I just love it I think you need to get some really cool pictures\nWith you with your power tools and yet somehow get in there with the big ... or whatever and safety glasses on and that's your business card\nI I think it's an advantage I think it's a ... opposite of a disadvantage but when I started my insecurity\nI thought was a brand disadvantage has turned into one of my biggest brand advantages because it might be different and you need to identify that when you're doing a business right\nIt's interesting we just had entree leadership master series last week and I was on a panel with Sudan than ... than ... a very common theme we heard a in the audience asking questions is how do I don't think the women women leaders women leader now you know how do I succeed as a woman in a man's industry\nAnd there are certainly some industries where you need to be aware of what you're going into but the reality is so often\nIt is bigger in our head than it is in reality it's to your point if the thing we think it's holding us back when that's the thing that's going to set us apart and make people want to buy from us and so I I Love the whole perspective Amelia uh that that you already see yourself as an entrepreneur now you just need to see yourself as a successful business owner and start to take that that\nWell I mean I think about somebody like um you know we're Condi Rice speak as we ... and I got to spend time with her obviously female obviously African American obviously super brilliant oh you get smarter to ... oh yeah with a woman so unbelievably smart [noise] but um I mean\n... successful I mean secretary of state right the United states of America I mean you know this is no small job here yeah ... and but what ended up happening with her what what were we were asking her about the same thing the barriers you know the racial barrier the sexism racism all this kind of stuff\nAnd she used the line from her neighborhood should growing up in a segregated neighborhoods in Birmingham, Alabama that her mom I told her it doesn't matter where you're coming from it matters where you're going Mm that's good ... and she said I don't let other people with their prejudice decide\nMy fate yep I decided my foot and whoa it was like coming out it was just very calm but yeah I heard a loud and clear confidence in their ... but again it comes back to that that um you know you're going to I'm going to own a space and I'm going to turn what you think is a\nDisadvantage race sex whatever it is you know into an advantage because it's Brenda ...\nWell I Love how you even talked about you and sharing buying furniture if you look at most American household the women make the purchasing designing decorating decision\nWhat I think of a a woman that makes plans she's known in space as at creating furniture and plans and white and I buy her a plant like bunk bed plans or a fork in the backyard plans\nAnd I love hers more because she has that female touch via email design so far at least you think she does not only in my mind I got you got you connected we're best friends you know she gets me so uh I don't really have all will draw those people based on that she didn't even realize it\nYeah that's that's very very important I think this is good information the book is business boutique it is a number one bestseller and you can see why\nChristie ride is with us the founder of that you don't hear her speak all over America and teach and you'll see her own media you'll see her a business ... dot com and those of you that are members of the uh business boutique academy regularly get coaching from her\nUh and of course now the crusty right business podcast yes very well right\nIt is it is taking off and it's amazing how when you can encourage people and inspire them and teach them while they're living their lives so like listeners writing on the radio show they may be driving in the car on a commute they may be going for a run or they may be cooking or cleaning or something around the house\nThat you're able to encourage them and give them a the steps and plans and tools that they need to win so it's been really fun to to see the stories coming out of someone that their life has changed from the podcast\nWell the information is important because their promotions what changes your life um you don't you don't you know you can listen to music and if you're if for those of you in the car all day I mean if you listen to the same if you listen to him all the time you get the same song\nAbout over what the hour and a half or so now put the thing all loop and I like the music I enjoy that I enjoy talk radio in general but to have something like a podcast where I can absolutely decide okay I'm doing a leadership thing on this Ron\nI'm more than about Russia or I'm going to do a marriage thing I'm trying to learn about marriage and you can just download the podcast is just information intentionally going into my life and the my body

Shirley\nHi you may have trouble I don't know you need to see an attorney and ask them\nA hot and my guess is the most you could help to get back will be the penalties the taxes you already ... and

income during that time\nUm during that time we started out about one twenty and we had kind of a temporary increase to about one fifty five to one sixty years but then what kind of go back down to one twenty five okay what are you going to do for a living I'm I'm a stay at home home schooling mom\nAnd I am a a contractor\nWorking overseas okay what do you do well I primarily a work as an aircraft mechanic an inspector o blazing in a non destructive inspection\nGotcha okay and so what kind of that was the ...\nUm most like credit cards and then we had a car I'm a tractor and then he vacation time share oh\nGoody you guys are a little bit of everything going\nAnd how long have you been married\nI'm almost Twenty one years now so what happened Nineteen months ago\n[noise] um well I had a\nBecause my work is kind of cyclical I work about sixty days on sixty days\nOff overseas\nI for a long time had or for the first couple of years of my employment I had the opportunity to do extensions ...\nAnd we used those extensions which kind of worked out like all the time to kind of cover expenses and make things and all that and then but a few months ago I was told that we wouldn't be getting any more extensions\nSo I was I was overseas at the time and Mary where I couldn't really call stuff to do everything by text to my texted her and said here's what it's looking like which are understandably we we were doing things are upset her quite a bit\nYounger numerous dropped off\nA yeah yeah just to be good to be your income there and she was pretty upset about that so we were considering cashing out my four one K. to say things off and to kind of makers will hold him\nAnd and then what happened at that point as when we got done\nTexting that night [noise] um I Will like you said very upset I started looking into the four one K. option I didn't like that option because we've already in our past of Twenty years cashed in a couple of my small retirements when I quit a job\nAnd so I called my brother at like eleven o'clock at night he works nights so I can talk to him and I called my brother Charlie and he kinda ripped me is what he\nDid Dave Ramsey on me because I'm\nJust said that you know we make too much money can be that's broke and he told me that we could you know he started telling me we could solve this or that he started talking about selling the car and selling the tractor and selling the truck getting\nThe van and I kind of came up with excuses for everyone and you know it wasn't really listening very well and hung up like in tears just crying and\nTried to go to sleep but Clinton and ended up getting up out of bed a went into my office got on the computer and started making a spreadsheet and I sat down in the first thing I looked at was the car um it was the only vehicle we other than the tractor that we owe money on still\nUm we had my mini van was paid off um had to ... thousand miles\nUm but wasn't worth a lot so I didn't see that being helpful but we had a unique opportunity with the car because we happen to own one of the Volkswagen diesel\nWas my handle yeah you know\nYeah and they were offering us you know we could do that by Dr that and we were planning to keep it\nBut I looked at the options and started looking at if we get to buy back and got the cash settlement and got rid of the payment and the position that would put a than I did actually had us at that point to where we would pay off in thirty six months and about two or three o'clock in the morning I called my brother back\nOn him what I'd been doing and he said he would buy us F P U\n'em for Christmas and allow us to you know to the program at home we kind of live in the middle of nowhere and then I told him that I Would ... the next day or to talk to

Francisco Hi Scott welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nRight ... thanks for taking my sure what's up hey so I've got a question\nFor you so my dad has a small\nGroup working with them for about seven years and I just started a family so I'm trying to take over the kind of make it better\nOn everything around this time of year he wants to buy tractors because he because he can't get think that's the best way that the amount you can do for taxes rather than\nSaving money never been able to hold over twenty five years and you've never been able to have really\nMhm well that's why you know is because we keep spending money on debt to buy stuff that he didn't even need to say on taxes are the the math that he's doing is unbelievably faulty\nOkay let me give me an example of what what would be a typical purchase it will be the size of the equipment I'm uh fifty thousand dollar item a hundred\nThousand right out while yeah fifty thousand\nDollars he buys a fifty thousand dollar item um in years past he had to he could not write that all off in one year to run it off over five years or ten thousand dollar a year right off and if he has a ten thousand dollar you write off you don't get to say it doesn't say ten thousand dollars on your tax bill\nOkay mhm instead what it does is it would save you about two thousand dollars on your tax bill now what we're saying is that he borrowed fifty thousand dollars to save two thousand dollars a year on this tax bill for five years\nYeah the the math is really really faulty there\nAnd so what happens is entrepreneur is either don't think this through an or use this as a rationalization to buy toys inside their business that they really can't afford she got to have to quit buying equipment until you can pay cash for it and then and then you're going to buy older used equipment only get equipment you need to do the job\nMhm we don't buy anything here in our office if we don't have to have it to get the job done\nWhen anything in the tax write off\nThe way he explained it can be if you have because it has to be a shame because they're not going to break down ... ... when it won't be found and outfit ten days because that's the way he explains to me and I\nTell them you're telling me all two year old and three year old tractors aren't safe and break down all the time again no asinine ... I asked them that that's just ridiculous OK here's the other thing is kind of a doctor Phil moment he's worked has bought off all these years and he has no money\nMhm and Dr phil would say how's that working for you yeah it's not you know Charles theory of years working out here it's not working out and and so I don't know how to tell you to tell your dad what to do he's probably not listening to you and he's probably look I mean to me see the point\nNow finally starting to take it you know I\nKeep all you're running you know if you're running than if you're running it then you get to make the decision\nAnd you and I am just decided you can ... I don't want anybody to be unsafe and I don't want to have equipment but I've got\nProbably a million and a half dollars and equipment sitting here within a Fifteen feet of me right now what we're doing the show I Can't have that equipment going down the show would go down that would cost me a lot of money just like that but but we also don't buy equipment we don't need\nAnd then we make a decision whether we're going to buy new and we certainly pay cash for it\nAnd whether it's cameras are computer systems and in your\nCase it's actually heavy equipment we don't own any heavy equipment um couple pickup trucks to do delivery and stuff around here and one bus that keeps running us between buildings but other than that we don't have any big stuff like that but still I Can't have that bus breaking down all the time but on the bus used\nDonald Harris drives our bus everyday runs us back and forth between our little shuttled between our things and it's it was a huge shuttle and uh\nPaid attempt for it on a new one cost and it's run I mean it's broken down a couple of times when we rented a shuttle for that day when it broke down kept kept moving put it in the shop and fixed it but I mean for that little bit of inconvenience it's safe and it's been reliable enough to get the job done and not shut us down\nAnd so that's a minor example but it's filling in the same metaphor and so yeah you can you can make this work\nBy use to pay cash for your equipment otherwise all you do is work for nothing\nOh you do is end up with no money for all your work because and and the you know the heavy equipment dealer gets all your money and that just doesn't work for me I don't want to live that way Josh is in Savannah hey Josh welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nHow you doing better than I deserve how can I help\nMy wife and I mean from Alabama or Georgia almost a year ago and we have our tax records are are coming up here and in Alabama you pay for your car tag acts yearly but I'm George eat it at all in one one of the beginning and I'm One of our car completely\nPaid for so we're going to keep it there's nothing there's no but we have um another car that we are about eleven thousand on that we've been comic letting sailing anyway um we we recently started ...\nAnd I'm with the cat on any way and we were uh our eggs we have to bring your attack at the end of October which would be a lot more money than it would have been a clearer than an Alabama how how much how much it costs to run a ...\nAbout four hundred for it and what what's your household income just under a thousand\nAnd one of the death she'll be got not counting your house\nAlone or me and my why um ... nine thousand and one or twenty\nOkay and that's it they're okay you like this car\n[noise] uh it's on it's not what we um we got it as a family car we we recently had a baby and it it it's not as much room whenever we test drove it it's not as much room as we thought it would be once we got strollers and\nWell if you want to move to a different car that's fine I don't think you have to do this financially and you're certainly not to do it over four hundred dollars worth of tax um that's not what do you make the decision here but I'm basically you got a policy that you're trying to get through can you get through that in two years and keep\nThis car yes I'm In his car the total of ... less than half your on your own income yes and those are the guidelines we use on whether to keep a car so this car is very capable if you want to keep it if you want a salad and you can sell it at
