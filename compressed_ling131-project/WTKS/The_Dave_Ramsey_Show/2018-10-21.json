life is if you keep doing the same thing over and over and over again you're going to get the same outcome and that's one of the definition of insanity right and and our health care industry we keep doing the same things over and over and over again and getting the same results and we call that modern health care and\nYou know when when you're treating disease and you're not addressing the cause of disease and when you're putting people on the treadmill of treatment for disease and setting people up to have a disease\nOr that's good for the financial windfall associated with being in the health care industry\nUh I personally find it morally reprehensible I find it ethically ah immoral as well and and it's it's it's just sad that we live in a society where one of our birthright has to be healthy and yet we have absolutely zero way of understanding how to exercise that right and\nWe're not teaching people how to be healthy you are not teaching people how to be proactive and we're not teaching people or the importance of maintaining their health\nUh do we're doing more on the lines of\nCome see us when you have a problem and then we're going to treat your problem but we're not going to touch your give you any understanding until you have full blown problem then we're going to give you all sorts of difficult decisions to make depending upon what your condition is and nowadays if you have\nA any type of cancer or a precursor to cancer all the different ways that we promote cancer and cancer awareness and cancer screenings and this that and the other thing\nMy question is is why do we keep getting these things and what are we doing to make sure that we don't get them not simply treat them after the fact\nWell one of the things that seems that happens is that is it there isn't a mentality that is so prevalent which is that we are victims of the circumstances in which we live and that we don't have control and part of your messages that\nIs to switch that that sort of a point of view so that you can actually take control of your life so then we\nWent to empower people right we don't want to enable people to stay stuck we want to empower people to never get stuck or empower people if they are stuck how to get unstuck\nSite and and and it seems that that medicine has gone very far down this one side of the equation in other words the pendulum is kind of swing you very much into this realm of treatment and they've all the drug discoveries and the great equipment that they've done and that they can intervene in these very late stages of diseases and extend life\nBut they haven't they haven't emphasize the other side of that swing it depends on which is how to be healthy and the first place which is really the point of your practice\nRight I mean at the end of the day I had an epiphany between my junior and senior year of college and I was at Ohio University and I was studying zoology pre med and people have said well why ... why the study of animals and I'm like well human beings are animals that's why they call as well as any but\nIt was a pre med program and I had taken my em cats and I was filling out applications to go to med school because\nThe big part of my ego wanted me to become a cardio author ethics surgeon and I thought it would be the coolest job in the world to crack people open and go in and has something to say in terms of how they're hard functions or doesn't function in\nThe summer that between my junior and senior year I had an epiphany after I went to the local ... in the area who was I lovingly call the quack his name was Dr Phillip math a tone and\nHe was the local chiropractor who didn't even call themselves a chiropractor key was so aware of hyper aware of the the resistance to chiropractic care that he\nCalled himself and apply can ... which is a methodology of healing developed by Dr ... the great Dr George good hard called apply can ISI algae and\nIt's a methodology of of\nOf figuring out why the body's doing what it's doing and what the remedy is to do that and so we're leaving his office after my first in\nAnd first off his visit to him I had an epiphany walking back to the car and I was just like that was a fascinating Fifteen minute offices and I think I just changed my career\nAnd I changed my career from wanting to treat end stage disease where you're going to win some and lose some and have to deal with life and death every single day and the stresses associated with that\nI said well what if I could figure out how to prevent heart disease so that nobody ever had to die of heart disease ever again\nI Would much rather go on the prevention side\nAnd understand the mechanism of cause and learn about that and ask the questions of why this happens and why this is so prevalent and and why we're\nCreating the outcomes that we're creating and and why we're not smart enough to recognize that and why we're not doing anything to truly remedy the cause of the problem rather than treat the symptoms of the problem and so I went away to chiropractic school and I learned what it takes in order to get to the source of a person's problem and so\nThat's how I practice and that's how I feel that we should all be practicing not from a prejudice perspective just from a logic perspective it logically make sense\nFix the problem problem solve then you don't have to worry about it as opposed to getting of every day and worrying that I take my medication this morning I was in I in a hurry to state that I forget to take it and now I'm going to take it even though maybe I did take it now I'm taking twice the amount of dosage that I should and my doctor told me never to do that and so now I'm\nParalyzed with now not knowing exactly what I'm supposed to do because I couldn't remember whether I took my medication this morning or not\nYeah there's so many issues and I is fundamentally a you mentioned the concept of empowering people\nAnd one of the things that we end up feeling so often in in our culture is dissident powered that we don't have control of the things that we're always under somebody else's rules that were always having to function in the way other people are directing us and\nWhen we get that sense of powerlessness or it can lead very easily to the sense of hopelessness and despair all of which\nVery true and and that's the difference between being in control versus being out of control being being are in charge of versus being controlled by and so the listener the the most important question they can ask themselves\nBased upon wherever they are in their health concern whether they even have a health concern or not okay if you do have a health concern you need to ask yourself do you feel in control of it or are you being controlled by it\nAnd if you're being controlled by it meaning that it influences the decisions that you make the activities that you participate in or don't participate in a argue reaching more for life or is your health concern restricting your life\nAnd if you are being constricted by your health condition if you are being controlled by your health condition then you need to pick up the phone and you need to call me today and we need to have a conversation so that I can help give you back control of your most important asset that\nBeing your health you\nYou said that you want to help\nGive back control of the person's self to the person who has the health\nIt's theirs they own it the question is is what state is it in and sit in a good state or is it in the state of disrepair isn't controlling you are controlling it\nWell depending on your health situation if you are and if you do have a full blown disease or some health condition then you're that's where you are you have to start there you can't just ignore it\nRegardless of where you're starting from you just asked the question are you being controlled by this health concern if you're a stage for\nEnd stage cancer disease okay I'd definitely\nEverybody knows that your situation is controlling you and All right I don't know that anybody that wants to end up they're so good in an effort not to end up there you need to start\nTaking control of your health before it becomes full blown disease not get a wakeup call\nNot the guy that went through a quadruple bypass and is now in the recovery room and all he wants to do is go have a cigarette because he's Jones in for a cigarette okay that somebody who doesn't understand that you're smoking led you to a quadruple bypass then you probably should put that away but if they are controlled by their addiction\nTheir addiction to nicotine or what have you and they're\nThey don't have any way to get out of that okay then they're practicing passive health and I don't want people to practice passive health I Want people to pack practice active health\nSo that's really the flip side of being proactive which is what you're talking about and and it seems to be happening more and more ... in the American health care crisis we're now being led to believe that being passive\nAbout our health and then put turning the control over to the doctors in the medical facilities and the testing and stuff that we're giving it over to that whole ... and have no control of it whatsoever\nAnd and you have noticed that having you are I have and it is a big bunch of crap and we call it health care\nAnd the way that I spend monopolize and in the name and the profits over people and and uh never being taught how to exercise their God given right to be healthy and and all the things that we talk about here on the show\nThat's why the show is so important it's not important for me it's important for you the listener\nOkay it's important for me because my passion and my purpose is to educate you the listener and it's important for me to to go through the steps that I go through in an effort to be here with you to record the shows that we can broadcast them to as many people as possible and it would be nice if\nMore people listen to the show and it would be nice if people who listen to the show who have these health concerns that worked for corporations\nCalled developing your ability to discern appropriately and have it be rational and have it makes sense and have it be able to be broken down into three or four or five year old mentality okay because guess what I have four year old in my office that understand what I Do\nWhy because what I Do isn't complicated\nYou got to Cancun your garden hose and you wonder why there is no water coming out of the host what are you going to do mark ... ... if you want the host and the water flows\n... the hose and the water flows\nOn king the hose and your spine and then you'll be fine look I'm just rhyming all the time look at that [laughter] so at the end of the day was important is is if I can get a four year old to understand exactly what I Do in terms that they understand I don't need big complex words\nI Need simple duplication of understanding if I can break it down to a basic understanding\nAnd duplicate that understanding and the person with a condition then what if I'd done for that person you've given them I've given them back control I've empowered them to now make an informed decision about what they want to do now I'll fall I'm offering them as one outcome\nOne particular choice and I pressure them into that one particular choice then you're not giving them freedom to choose you not allowing them to know that there's more than one solution and there is more than one solution to all problems\nOkay the challenges that we don't teach people how to think anymore\nEverything's done cookbook everything is done by a recipe everything is done automatically everything is done without any thinking whatsoever okay and it's it's very very guilty within the health care industry because the health care industry you ask a question to your doctor your doctor doesn't necessarily know the answer to that question and then that\nWanes that the confidence so doctors now spend a minute and a half to three minutes with each patient\nBarking out orders and telling them what their problem is and telling them what they need to do and they don't actually answer questions\nAnd it's sad when you don't get a question answered it and it's frustrating when you don't get a question answered so what's interesting is you go to the most widely researched medical Web site out there\nWhich is Web MD and I'm not here to promote them but I promise you they should go to that website and Ninety seven percent of every condition that they talk about\nUnder mechanism of cause they will say in some form of what I'm going to share with you right now we don't necessarily know what causes this to happen we don't understand why this happens to people\nWell if that's the truth than what business do you have in treating it\nYou have no idea what you're doing you've acknowledged that you have no idea what you're doing then you have no business in getting involved in the process go get more education go more understanding do get more schooling and when you have more schooling and you know what the truth is under under standing the mechanism of cause\nVet now you were appropriate to treat it like when I treat to treat forever treat to fix to be done to have an end point and have them go back\nWe're normal life and wait for the next person that as make similar mistakes and has similar outcomes and come in and then you can solve that for them\nI mean what's so interesting about what you do is that you may be able to explain things to the level that four or five year old can understand them but your knowledge and the basis of what information that you have is far deeper and far more sophisticated I mean even in talking with you on the show every week\nThere are a lot of times that you're describing very complex systems the body is not a simple thing\nAnd yet it is which is funny because it can only take a certain number of distortion patterns and each distortion pattern\nPoints to a different source of cause\nAnd when you understand that then you can address the body at the mechanism of cause as opposed to treating the outcome war or the symptom or the the uh the effect that you don't want and and so what's interesting is is when you take the time to simplify things and explain them in terms that the person with the issue\nCan understand Venus empower them\nAnd then they can make an informed empowered choice not a passive I guess I don't have any choice choice\nYou know very good excellent conversations are quick we need to take a short commercial break to hear from our general sponsor the alternative health care network dot com when we get back I Want to do some more about this notion of passive health and what that means to a person's future\nAbsolutely but please us in this commercial from a generous sponsor you're listening to the alternative health care network dot com\n[noise]\n\nYou've been going to the doctor for years they order you blood work give you a pill to cover up your symptom and send you on your way the side effects of that medication can not only be dangerous but life threatening and what you don't know can kill you I'm Dr Richard onto the advance

and um your host Dr Richard on tune from advanced alternative medicine center where located at one thirty eight canal street in polar park that isn't pool of Georgia where it's sweet for zero foreign building four hundred\nThe best way to get a hold of me would be to call my cell phone which is area code eight four or five\nFive six one to two to five it is a cell phone it is not a text receiver please don't ever text me I Will not receive the text and I will never respond to your text because I Will never receive your text\nIf you want to call my cell phone and we can actually have a

one to two to five again eight four or five five six one to two to five if you want to communicate to me via text text me at my email address which is ... dot com it's called an email\n... dot com you can send me all your verbiage that way and I will be happy to get back to you that way as well um come to a free healthcare class come to the office itself come get care whatever your concern is I Want to help you solve those health issues and uh [noise]\nI Want you to be active about your health because today mark and I are talking about passive health which is taking a back seat to your condition instead of actually getting in the driver's seat and controlling and remedying in in removing your your health condition and so Mark I'm sure you have more question\nWhy do I mean part of being passive about your health is that you have to wait until you have a a a true health challenger something diagnosable to know that you can get the care that you want from the traditional medical system\nBecause that's what the insurance industry requires\nRight but how do you tell a person is may be facing a challenge but they haven't become symptomatic well\nIt's very simple you have to lose mark you have to lose greater than sixty percent six zero percent of normal function in order to have a symptom so you're pretty far down the road so you have to be functioning at\nForty percent at best or less typically less than forty percent of what your body's capable of doing to in order to have\nA symptom now we do a thing called functional testing and we test function\nAnd we do that through a tool called manual muscle testing and we apply it to a over two hundred and fifty different reflexes on the body and we can determine if\nThe reflexes functioning properly and when it reflects isn't functioning properly even if the person doesn't have symptoms we know that the communication is being interfered with and then we know that there's a problem there so it's interesting there's a reflex point on the body specifically for what's called bladder weakness\nOkay and it's right in the middle of the sacred ... when we muscle test that reflects and it creates a weakness I'll ask the patient in that moment [noise] do you have bladder\nWeakness do you have bladder leaks do you hold year year and a lot when you have to go do you really have to go and they'll look at me and they'll say how would you\nKnow that and I'm saying so you do have that issue yeah I have that issue I get up in the middle of the night when I got to go I really got to go I you know I'm ashamed to say that I sometimes have a accidents are linkages and uh you know I've\nI've been investing into depends undergarments stock because I'm using their product very much and uh how would you know that and it's like well you have this reflex and when I can demonstrate that to somebody and they actually develop\nMore understanding more care more affinity more interest in\nHow I evaluate them and then they start asking me questions about stuff they wouldn't normally ask their doctor about it opens the door opens the door to giving them a better understanding and even if they don't ask those questions when I'm done with my evaluation\nAnd we start to go over what their body has told me and I explain how it all fits together in terms of why they would be in my office now they have a deeper understanding of where their body starting\nTo have issues and what they need to be aware of and what they can get in front of instead of chasing for the rest of their lives which is what we do in this country we chased symptoms\nSo often you go to the doctor or you might have a vague symptoms or something or discomfort that's the doctor was they will come back if it gets right where we\nCan't find anything wrong comeback if it gets worse and there's a part of me that says that should be called malpractice\nNow you guys use a technique called warmer blanket on the exterior walls what does that mean well\nThat's the way you take the insulation the disowned well that's right\nNow you can also use rigid film and you apply it to the exterior surface of the building so you framed the building in this case we had the old building we had to deal with the conventional wall right those was ... on the outside of the sheeting you have to put a thermal barrier because you have\nTo worry about the thermal bridging of the structure when you when it meets that different installations so in other words it could be some transfer of different temperature\nFrom the actual study ... and so you got to worry about condensation forming on the\nInside of the outside insulation\nIs that makes sense though it does enter the sandwich right so in other words you're putting something like a um it's it's ... like a house wrap that you put on before you put your installation on is like a range screens you know of any any condensation should occur in between that installation it will run down and not damaged she\nBut it's actually has to be completely formally separated ... yeah yeah yeah it's almost like when you're building sound that the buildings you put separate walls and never touch the same idea here which are firmly separating everything's in good shape and insulation exactly right yeah that's the trick\nNow you also had to install the solar right which is on this building and you also have a beautiful wouldn't shingle roof here now which single roofs if they're not done right and I've seen an awful lot and I know you have to they write like\nCrazy said rye fast if they're not you you have to ... you have to think of that ... a ... today is not like ... it was say fifty two hundred years ago right the wood that you get from lumber is really farmed\nTrees younger trees because all the big old tight green trees are gone so now the wood will\nAbsorb moisture and so on down the line so what you would do years ago you would have what is called skip sheeting right basically it's like strapping their roof with spacing between it so the air could get underneath the roofs shingles and dry him from underneath and from the sun up top a wood\nRoof is like a wooden boat it has to get saturated with water as well tied to the joint and then it becomes waterproof yeah the shingle itself is actually wet\nAnd if it's laying on cheating without any air that rut it rocks from the underside help out yeah so you have to put some type of a breather\nUnderneath it ran there's all kinds of systems like a seat or read or write on online Benjamin high tech wake me up when you roll it out on the roof of the great ... he creates a fan of there for that ... set on an actually adds more light\nAnd if they do it right then you can get twenty thirty forty years old yeah hopefully have forty years I didn't think he is if you do it right All right ... another amazing job here with his ... house and I can't wait to see what happens when the next thirty five years in the show him\nYou know how you separate the fortieth anniversary for his these reverse revolted against on a show for over thirty five years congratulations spank them ... good to be\nThis is the money that home improvement show coming to you set the forty season them to these this old house you can watch the progress\nAs it happens on local radio station\n... online at this old house dot com\nCrash trying to you age Jamestown\nAnd for the answer to your home improvement questions call us now I have the money that was in my home advisor dot com\nFast and easy way to find a home service broke you

remodel\nAdvisor to do the work\nEither dot com [noise]\nMaking good on better welcome back the money that Ruben\nShow on Tom right in the coming in today from Jamestown Rhode Island where I'm pleased to be on site with the entire cast this'll houses around production on this their fortieth season and all this talk of home remodeling has you thinking about your next project you can call in your home improvement question now to eat and eat money pit presented by home advisor dot com well the heart\nOf every home is the kitchen and that's where meals get prepared and homework is done and guess always loved to hang out and the Canada tree in this kitchen was made by the ... plain and fancy custom ...\nAnd Brian you're on I was looking at your website and I sounded pretty interesting that you guys make every single cabinet by hand is that true that is absolutely true yes in the heart of Pennsylvania that it's a it's the work you're just spectacular so what's big loss us like I mean\nObviously cat it's coming standard sizes but you guys basically cut the parts and put 'em altogether by hand and whom in kind of supervise no process the whole way\n... uh we make cabinets up ... to the sixteenth of a niche mother is no real standard so for us uh we make our own doors in drawers we make all of our cabinet tree whether it be European ... or traditional framed in ...\nI think a lot of folks don't realize how mass produced most kitchen cabinets are are in their ... and there's a lot of trade offs in that process\nThat that is true or we are what I like to call a local custom cutting to jump on steroids [laughter] we do some production minded work but we're also very close to a lot of hands on work we do a lot of custom cutting the tree for any room of the house that a lot of other companies really don't want to touch\nArt so let's say you're hearing this program you're thinking about redoing your kitchen you blank slate um how do you tell folks get started with that process\nUh basically we have a network of professional kitchen about designers across the United states of America or they can go to our designers and they will talk to them\n... colors woods\nStyle or a traditional whatever it is and try to narrow down what their goal is for the project\nSo that's really the place to start once that's done we're the manufacturer we take those plans and create an order and bills that exactly to their specifications what's unique about the kitchen that you know hearing the gyms on how well it's quite unique oh we're using a transitional door style let's actually the name of it and\nIt's done in very precise equal sized panels that would be the maple white\nPainted part of the kitchen a lot of the rest of the temperature in the house is a risk ... which is one of the hottest what's going right now rice and and the custom market we have done some blue ... and we also did do all the vanity and the house so it was\nVery good design very easy for us to make it to sit around and make it look like or the customer wanted so we're we're very proud of it looks interesting\nYeah it looks it looks it looks really great so what are some of the mistakes that folks make you think when they start to plan the kitchen where people go wrong and then moved to her credit for many years well\nYeah I think a lot of times um\nPeople tend to get caught up in trends ... or so they will pick something trendy and then they'll find themselves five years down the road still living in the same house with no plans to move or thinking about doing it again I think a lot of times people tend to uh get wrapped up in counter tops and appliances regular\nTakes a lot of their budget and they end up spending money they should for the quality of Kevin need less than a lifetime a lot of times a day do the buyer's regret\nNot case so careful planning working with designers you're going to be the kitchen for many many years I'm ... from playing fancy Kevin thank you so much for stopping by the money they printed vice thank you for having me you've been listening to the money that home improvement show comic you from Jamestown Rhode Island and\nThe ... season TVs this old house I'm afraid we're going to want to extend these very special thank you for the entire lasting\nWelcome here today\nWho wants to learn more of a strange town house projects for the Generation Next initiative visit this one house dot com or follow national housing Twitter\nFacebook which\nWhen we did that you could see sort of the vertical boards going across to buy and there had been at least an eighth of an inch maybe a quarter inch gap between all of those\nAnd I just say that it's sort of an example of how much can leak try um we got to feel all that operation got a foundation that in the ground that leak says well we've got a roof that leagues so you've got a deal that up and then you got to\nAdd a new addition onto the house and make sure that those to marry well and there's a whole bunch of different ways that we got into that and we won't know for net zero for an entire year of living here\nYou run the numbers in and see if you basically made all the energy that you need\nAbsolutely and we were able to do some tests beforehand you know we made great strides in terms of air barrier there efficiency energy efficiency we've got some good equipment but it's a huge challenge students you're on a retrofit so we're going to see if we pull it off\nNow everything is unique about this including the framing it's not your run of the mill two by four\nWalling as it [noise] it's not ... who is our local builder this time he's working for us down here in Rhode Island you know his goal is to try to get as much insulation in his house was off so he went to a two by six law and that gives us a deeper cavity the other thing that allows us to do is because the two by sixes are bigger than two by fours you can spread 'em out\nAnd you don't have to be sixteen inches on senator you twenty four inches on center and that allows you to drop some of those two buys\nOut of the equation and again as you know when you take the two by fours out of the equation there sort of you're weak link that right you get the thermal project get rather have insulation in the wall is in the wall and were able to drop about forty percent\nOf the lumber ... or whatever that connection from from outside the insides for those do by force now you have fewer studs and uh you're going to have that much less connection that must thermal bridge basically been limited they're\nAbsolutely and and we're fighting for every possible ... reduction trick that we get and that was one of\nThe windows were another thing that you worked hard on you very very carefully selected some windows for this area that we're ... ...\n... yeah so a triple tame windows helps us a lot at when you look at sort of a house and you think about the wall assembly if you use or fancy words you know how it's built you've got two by fours you've been insulation you've got air sealing any good window which is otherwise just a big hole in the right to you like oh my gosh everything's going in and out of the windows\nThe pain is better than single pain triple pain is better than double pain and that's what we actually have here are also controlling for the Wii um are controlling the\nNecessity of medicine thank you [laughter] as he gained in and out because you have to minimize the amount of air conditioning they wouldn't need 'em in heat load and the friends that Marvin helped us you know not only designing these windows again you know up to code right up to speed for us but there's lots of 'em and we want to have as many as you possibly could so an efficient windows ...\nProjects continuation of your brand Generation Next initiative you got some friends is working here how's that ... going in and what's your message young people that are out there\nThat message to young people is that a career in the trades can be a very good one it could be something you do after college or instead of going to college\nThere are there's a huge need for people who work with their hands and have skills and we've got two young practices who've been working with a side by side one of the young woman who keeps us from Mississippi the other one is local former marine who's already been employed by his wieners so it's a great way to show people that this is a good job\nNow the other thing that was unique about this is you had owners that we're pros so that must have made a process easier because sometimes it's hard when you're building a product to communicate the needs to the owners that are not projecting architect and designer here husband or wife who owns property\nA noxious pros but smart pros and and the ones who sort of manager their appetite and\nIt's not a big house they didn't want a big house they didn't want excesses space\nUm and it was really up to do on our architect really up to ... come up with the net zero calculation and make this whole thing work\nSo we were pleased to be working with them it's still going to be on them over the next twelve months to live accordingly prices you know even if you build a perfectly if you leave the windows open at the air conditioning cranked too low you will not make net zero so now they're the ones are going to have to actually live here and make that and that's your work and we'll find out a year from now if they pulled it off\nAll right we'll see Kevin O'Connor the host of
