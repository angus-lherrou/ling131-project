[laughter]\nLove us right way to go you guys yeah that's so cool\nSo what started you're doing this what made you say we can actually pay off our house 'cause most people never bother\nYeah well because the journey happened so long ago the beginning of the journey he had come home from work one day and he just said hey I heard this guy on the radio talking about money I was always reading books about finance and and he said take a look at the sky and see what you think\nSo the next weekend your CDs came the ... the very first set of CDs came from that you had created I listen to those CDs and literally that day my life what from awesome\nThat we had everything we can ever dreamed up our big house in our jet skis and so it was awesome until it was an awesome because we didn't own anything\n... nothing and it was just so\nRude awakening and it was so scary to sit there thinking we don't own any thing and so that started the journey so lots of life happened in between the removed about five times before we finally settled in Cape creek Arizona air got hurt on a construction job he was builder\nUm and when that happened that changed our life because he chose to go to college he said you know we need to go to college and that's what took the income down because I had to work and we cash flow to it you know and then once that was all done\nI printed the amortization schedule for the house and I brought it to him and I said I think me and pay the south in two years and I said you're crazy yeah [laughter] but I really thought we could but this last two years has sucked it\nWas hard to to you so you do the three Ninety four really in two years or how much of the three Ninety four was the house [noise] house was two hundred and forty thousand okay we did that who you're forty in two years\nYeah whoa that was the gazelle intense where we ate the gazelle 'cause we were so tired and rice and beans\nYeah yeah he cleaned up all the jet skis and the other stuff in the previous seven years yeah so then when you look down and you go okay game on now we're going to do the house and you leaned into it with\nWild good that's right 'cause he had graduated from college and got a good job I had my job we were stable ready to go and we did it\nUm what do you owe on rental property number one\nI'm we our number one we owe a hundred and seven or eight times what about one sixty five that's right and rental property number two um we are one sixty five and it's worth about Ninety five right\nYou're making a little profit you know what might get a lot\nNo it's about a thousand in mind I mean it's definitely not\nAnd all that that's what our drought shut\nAnd all that your gross that's before you count like and see and major repairs that come up\nThat that's the gross cash flow the different ... and the payment so twelve thousand dollars a year minus vacancy mine is a an occasional heating and air system or a roof occasionally you're you're making a little bit of money\nBut you know ... yeah fire five ... five grand for around something like that I'm On a year something like that Oprah I Am a writer means from years will be better than others and that caught on a bunch of rental property shark and kind of\nDo these things are my Dutch um the uh uh ... and what your household income\n[noise] um I said we bring about a hundred and ten grows\nTo try and what do you own your home our primary uh we just heard to stay on ten months ago we owe to eighty worth about three hundred and ... and\n... and so he's saying um\nYou've got a hundred and thirty and uh fifty or so so you got a hundred and eighty if you saw both of these give or take 'em expenses that you could throw at your two eighty\nAnd that's what he's saying to do your saying we're making a little money um I like rental property these are good rent or should I think I Want to keep it and that's the discussion on the right\n[noise] yeah I can live on a great guy and we have about a thousand dollars in and got them in your ... um we combined probably twelve thousand could cook up we had a lot but we took a bite out of you at in the back out\nWhere money help you know this sounds like baby steps are very clearly defined that you do one before you do the other you can't sort of do them or you can have your plan but you can't call them baby steps I won't let you\nGuys are going to do your plan okay if you're going to my plan you'd write a check today and be debt free\n[noise] yeah and the only reason I I Would hesitate because now because you're doing an airplane and\nYou know at the end of the year that will be very tough and I feel you know in Iran\nHalle Berry in the event that on my condition don't come through for the next three nights I'm afraid of liquid data Atlantic I don't think an act during the hot spot so I figure ... neck and everything I found and I would try to track\nMhm okay let your plane okay uh uh the uh uh you know ... ...\nYou're not making a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them so they could flip around and you're pretty quick\nIf a ... at a minimum you know a good compromise between the two every I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love real estate and I want you hate them if you want to keep 'em in the big one that's got more margin in it and more equity in it is the most appealing to me\nThe three the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five one and so a migraine one and dumped the other one\nThe fifty\nThousand to move the needle much but the one that only got a fifty thousand more equity you know making anything on that and that you're in gash bread on that at all and which means that it could turn upside down on ya meaning if it went vacant for three months you can be writing checks\nBy the end of year lose money on that house if you go to three months vacancy market softened up so you just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is is it is an asset in your situation even though technically okay so I'm probably dumping the little one as a compromise\nBetween the two of you and um\nAnd if you're going to hold the other one than you guys just got a you know let's start working these baby steps the right way\nAnd following them through and getting the emergency fund done and get a proper emergency fund in place and and if your income as volatile enough that you need to have an additional account to cover of our income volatility to separate from your emergency fund than you could build that went up to\nAnd build you some cash position so that you're not constantly you know in the lurch back and forth menu making good money overall but you kind of living hand to mouth anyway\nAnd that and that's that's the cycle you're trying to break so good question thanks for joining us\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is with us in San Francisco Hi Mike\nHow are ya Hi Dave how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I just started in October here um and I got my that's when I got my start are set so I have um with the money make over um I got an eight hundred in my emergency fund film among baby step on the first time I've got a budget and and it's a mess it just seems like I just can't dial it in\n... and you only have one dollar um every dollar okay\nI'm In trouble going in\nThings like I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cost and then I just either it seems like it it goes over and then there's things that I think we're going to have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just a doormat\nYou been doing it a whole two weeks yeah yeah\nWell that you're you're just takes a little while to get things are just in the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're wrong put more in there\nBut you're always people are always spend more on food and they think they are I mean I've met people go I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going to hold it was just no way you know I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more\nReally quick I wanted to ask what should I invested in the financial peace university um I should I get that now are kind of get it after I'm done with my thousand just put everything in their first and\nThat's up to you I mean you you can decide what you want to hold on one on just give it to you and that way you know to worry about it\nOh [laughter] okay All right that that way you can get signed up and get the every dollar plus going and that's a one year membership to that thing and then you get in the class you know you go to the non non lessons and you've got the online\nExperience and that's going to answer a bunch of these questions as well but basically if you just visualize a yellow pad forget every dollar forget\nA budgeting and all that and just go okay here's what I make\nAt the top of the page and then every dollar of my ... not every one of those dollars needs an assignment going down the page um has been Exxon food and why on utilities and Z own rent and so on down the page until every single dollar has an assignment you don't have any leftover money in your budget\nIt is a great out by made it it definitely the easiest one I've I've done other ones before in the past than this one is definitely the easiest is are\nThe only problem is is you're facing your realities it's not the app and it's not the system even it's just the first time you do a budget you suck at it yeah you know and it just takes a month and then the next month he'll get better really about the third month you're doing it\nIt'll be accurate\nIt'll take about the rhythm of about Ninety Days about three times through it and you'll go oh I'm not forgetting all soccer pictures and then there's one down you know and we know what the food really cost and we know what the utilities really are and\nGot a few things that are fixed that are predictable and ... with us fix thing we know what that is but some of these other things you're just you're taking your best guess and and it just takes a little while to get the trial and error get the course\nOf course corrections done and get adjusts you'll get it ma'am on all have ... will get you signed up for financial\nThanks to Dr Charles our producer get within our social producer named Dave Ramsey your host and we'll be back\n\nBoise production officer

of term life insurance and the other doesn't big difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food\nAnd other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting\nTerm life insurance just go to Sandra insurance dot com or call eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible\nIt really does make you the hero of your story and they put you on course for better things ahead WTC chaos so that\nAnd I hardly CEO station now Fox News radio covers the world\nOn news radio dissenting voice at an\n...

it at the dead one by being mommy come home we pushed play again the pause comes off\nAnd we get out of debt as fast as we can but in the meantime we just created all your loses a little bit of

how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] [noise] well I don't financial piece nursery coordinator and I have a pretty interesting situation going on I have family in my class I'm In between them a mom and dad his co signed for their daughters student loans which are over one hundred thousand dollars\n...\nInto I'm trying to find a way to help them in to them and I'm trying to get a little bit that I Know that I'm short on knowledge and experience so what's the what's the problem\n[noise] well the pollen is may have taken the on the dad is kind of taken on can be be collector and ... he's pressured his daughter and and with All right and you should be um she just not interested in and actually not interested in being responsible for it\nI'm into they kind of old here now in ... financial pieces while with her and um but I don't know what's coming to you know\nHow she reacting now that she's in the class\nWell she's reacting in Iraq and like she should kind of wanting to take it on\nOkay I'm does she have an income\nNow she doesn't really have an income she's well actually she does she's working part time um\nShe married no she's not married okay\nWell her first goal is to take a ...\nYear old twenty five okay and why should not working fulltime\nI Do now apparently the degree that she always being video editing she hasn't been able to keep a job you're out of between her responsibility and it was bad decisions in our lifestyle\nOkay I I'm kind of hearing spoiled brat\nAnd mom and dad coached on for a spoiled brat and then they're shocked she she didn't come out and become a a a great a citizen of the United states and pay your bills or are they shocked\n\nYep yeah okay All right well I mean you're ended up being a family therapist you might want to send this family to your pastor to sit down and talk through this with them but the bottom line is legally they are both on this\nAnd that can play collector all he wants but let me tell you something about collecting you can't collect blood out of Iraq\nThere was no blood there and this girl and getting money you know I can share and work much\nRight if her so she's got to take care of food shelter clothing transportation and utilities first then she pays on the student loan and if she has a one to then what change do take like five jobs\nAnd getting gear but that's going to be a shock to her little system\nThough she didn't like it used to working much\nYeah so I mean that show what we're doing is we're training her to be an adult and um but you you know dad as I Walk around with his chest puffed out like he like he can just yell at somebody and I make some have money don't have any money she broke because she didn't work so I'm Glad they got her in the\nClass so let's get her into let's teller you needed you treat her like she has a hundred thousand dollars in loan debt you twenty five years old so she Dutch\nSo her answer is you need to get six jobs live on beans and rice rice and beans live on a tight budget take into roommate sell so much stuff the dog thinks she's next\nAnd you have no life ghetto cause you signed up for a hundred thousand dollars in debt get your butt in gear go right that's what she would tell a single girl that was twenty five in your class with a hundred thousand dollars in debt when you get her good\nOkay then I'm a look at mom and dad and they're in my class and if I if somebody came in my class and said uh Dave we signed up because we were stupid way co signed for our daughter who doesn't work much and ah what are we going to about there's a hundred thousand dollars in debt I'm going to go do you just bought yourself a hundred thousand dollars in debt\nAnd so I Would put that in your debt snowball and I would get my button gear and pay it off 'cause you're an idiot you coach signed this because it says in the Bible you're a fool if you ... for another\nAnd you may nicer than that but that's the message so uh you know but I Would put the responsibility on both of them and let one of them start working on the bottom of it one of them start working on the top of it and we'll see where they mate\nDoes if she doesn't pay it they get to if they don't pay it she gets to\nThat is what ... only works are both on the stupid no so I treat them both like individual cases and let them let them start chewing on the top one of them so she went on the bottom of the biggest fights sir first there's the middle\nOf the middle on this but I train them both separately and then the as far as the in a personal relationship between these two um\nYou know if she won't work and all that kind of stuff and you may want to have the family so fast so this sounds like a family ... girl and she's in a row of sounds like this is the

way with I'll pick\nA check on them like actually and we we want to hear you\nWell I mean it's a personal decision I made a personal decision I don't go into debt and once I got out I don't think I could go back\nRight and that kind of the you know what we're thinking about um how are you know we definitely that if you know it it actually fan on and we\nKnow you I mean you could benefit with Bob I'm about\nTo be in debt to do it I mean you know it's it's one of his ... definitely don't need you have a house so ah two hundred thousand dollars how much do you make now what's your household income\nAnd I pay twenty okay okay and you don't have any debt but your home or you don't have that at all\nYeah we don't have any guy\nOkay with no payments in the world you're making two hundred grand how fast can you save two hundred grand\nAt that point you know it's already were lame [laughter] years\nFifty grand a year or two hundred and you want to buy better house currently at the house unless you did this I bet I bet you could do it in a little over two\nHow about you want the house [laughter] well I guess now that in that the uh yeah there you go but bad enough to go in that\nSo this is where there's just you know I I'm picking on you just to make you think okay well you know I'm not just picking on your for the fun of it but here here's the thing what happened was sharing a nine Jody when we went broke was we should never again\nWhenever you know take a phone call if somebody calls us collecting money it's wrong number\n... okay and\nAnd life is God and there's nothing I Want bad enough to go back into the news again\nWhere the borrower slave to the lander that's our decision that's how we decided to live that's what we teach people the goal is it's kind of like the holy grail that Iran's you show rocket everything paid off so we can become very wealthy and ... and you're making two hundred thousand dollars you you're there now and now you're going to go back into this for a couple of bedrooms\nI couldn't do it\nIt makes me sad just hearing you talk about doing it but if you do it\nYou know you're just living a different thing so you called me to ask me my opinion what would I Do when I drew once I drew the line and this and I said I never borrow money again no matter what is in if I Want something I have to get really creative about it or I have to really like work hard to save up the money for it\nAnd I have to sacrifice other stuff to get it and then it makes me go I like my lifestyle but I don't know like those two more bedroom so I'm probably not going to cut my lifestyle down to nothing to get this which is kind of what you just said and I show um which is okay that's okay choice you made the choice though but what that does is it allows us to buy something we can't afford\nShow I mean you can do whatever you want to do what you and I'll be friends I'm not really mad at you but you called the Dave Ramsey showing us to borrow money\nAnd it just new you're not ever going to get a yes on\nThat one um show\nAnd just makes me sad that you would go back in so I I Would 'cause I I think he doesn't stop and measure the freedom that you have the sense of peace that you have the economy turned down to ... for back then if you did that feel\nWhen the world is falling apart and you have a house paid for it gives you a different set of peace because I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere 'cause I've done research I've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures\nOccurred on them home with a mortgage shall we just\nWe quit borrowing money so you do whatever you want to do will be your friend either way but the way I live my life is how I answer questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability and up terms and in down times\nEnjoy to not have a ... named country wide on my back\nBank of America on my back can't even imagine it's been so long since I've had him that just just ... I think I Would probably like having anxiety attack it would be bad Carl is with us in Pennsylvania hey Carl welcome to the ... show\nI gave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up hey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping he can give me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free uh recently at our house off yeah the way to go\nUm there is a hundred and won a circuit giving up my own I have fifty eight for markets and about six thousand for her car\nUm seven thousand for one medical bell four thousand for another medical down on down the road and other medical bill\nOkay how old is she sixty three why are you know power of attorney\n[noise] she's starting to forget that um she kept getting checked out for the amount shots ah she's in the process of doing that and she hasn't been paying a ... on a budget and so now I'm taking care of her stuff what is your income\nUm she makes ... about twenty eight thousand air\nMhm okay and um what is the house you were hired sorry what's the house worth\nUm my sister lives in it and she kind of destroyed it I'm sure I'm where's your mother and my own apartment\nYour mother is paying rent an apartment so that your sister can live in the house\nYeah so what's the house worth\nI'm guessing sixty five\nOkay okay so how fast is are you a throwing your sister out and selling the house\n... [laughter] she's on a date I Can't figure out\n\nAre you on the deed ... last night how did she get on the deed\n[noise] um my sister has um a child with me so my mom wanted to make sure my niece had a place to lead so she put my sister on it\nAre you paying that it was your mother paying the mortgage\nShoot them not any more I was it yeah I told my sister I well not anymore yeah everything everything's in my mom's name all the utilities everything as take 'em out yeah I Can't turn the heat off I Can't tell you tell the kids want to come in\nDirection for the ... and her name\nHe had to count because her the pilots too high\nUh-huh 'cause she doesn't have to pay her about how they [noise] they tried to posit too yeah compensate for that\nBut you can see to pay the bill right yeah okay she has to pay the bill that\nAnd that's it and she used to pay the mortgage today yeah okay I got rid of fifty eight thousand of the debt good and one hundred and one thousand in student loans passes away when your mom passes away\nYet guy so we don't worry about those quit paying a quit paying the students that quit paying out to lunch so now I got eleven thousand dollars in some medical bills yep there's rest of it we're just not paying your mom don't have any money she broke his apparently got dementia mess twenty eight thousand\nDollars a year she sixty three years old you live in an apartment where you have to make sure she's cared for first and that's food shelter clothing transportation and utility she doesn't need transportation did you say there was a car and heritage you need to be driving\n[noise] I Know you're the power of attorney\nYeah I Know that I've tried to convince her to sell her car and get a thousand dollars a pack of fifty eight hundred dollars that a lot for a car so\nIt's not a lot for a car but it's a lot for a car for somebody that has dementia and I'm not sure they need to be driving\nRight she can't remember to pay your bills can she remember how to get home I'm scared for her\nThat was one of the problem she forgot how did you get home that's what side of that\nIs it responsible on your part to let her drive the answer is no\nRight\nShe I Love her you love or you don't want her to be hurt or to hurt someone for God's sakes\nThat she could she could go driving often end up in Tennessee\nFrom Wisconsin\nAnd we'd have one of those silver alerts or whatever they call them right\nYeah yeah no I think\nWe're going to I think we're going to do away with cars period oh okay now we're down to medical bills\nThese are very hard decisions for you right but you have to do your\nJob as the power of attorney and as a loving daughter is do things that are good for your mom regardless of who it upsets\nYour sister is upset your mother's upset I don't care yeah it's very hard for you to make\nThose decisions but we're only going to do things that are good for your mom none of this you are doing is out of greed\nFor yourself okay\nSo that all the student loan people they get dizzy up nothing nada okay tell your sister she gets nothing not a zip sell the car\nNow I'm Down to just a few medical bills and I think you can work your way through those with her income or at least get some kind of a payment plan going this very small and ah you can let that attorney's office know that basically she has no money what ... what is the twenty eight thousand dollars coming in from\nUm he has a pension I knew it in her security okay\nI'm than what I probably would do with these medical bills is let them know they're probably not going to get paid either except if I have a little extra money here or there after taking care of mom\nOkay I was in the\nHigh paid fifty on on on each one\nYeah it's okay if you won't pay twenty five or something or if if you can work out some kind of lump sum and you know five hundred bucks settles a whole dad or something like that clears up that's fine\nBut here's the thing if they were to sue her do you know what they're going to get nothing because you know what she has nothing all of the income that she has they cannot attach you can attach pension income you can attach Social Security income and you can't attach an annuity\nAnd so that she's what we called judgment proof because she's broke\nAnd so that puts you in a very strong position to talk to Mr or Mrs collections bottom feeder attorney when you do talk to them\nAnd just go here situation she sixty three she's got dimensions she has no assets and are only income as pension and Social Security she's judgment proof tell them I said that when we talk to him an angel coach and he said they are judgment proof\nOkay and uh so what we'll do is we would like to clear this up but we're going to do it for pennies on the dollar so make me a ridiculous offer because that's the only way you're getting any money\nAnd play hardball with them because we got to take care of mom here I'm not trying to I'm not trying to beat him by up I'm not trying to hurt anybody I'm trying to protect your mom\nAnd the last thing I Need it she she gets her food paid her lights and water her rent and she is taking care of only then do we deal with a couple of medical bills seller car sister gets nothing student loan gets nothing\nSo I I'm I'm saying this real kind of like 'cause I Want you to get a little that down inside 'cause I Know these are going to be hard\nConversations for you yeah but you got to be our cars at your mom you're protecting okay exactly you couldn't do it you can do it if you need some help you call me\nBack but just just play hardball with them tell them to judgment proof my goodness what a story [noise]\nThere's reason to save for retirement right there in a juvenile not want to return to ... save for retirement and there's reason rather than you just heard it under [laughter] why you want to have half a million dollars in your in four one K. when you get to return to my right there it is ... instead of mine

have been victims of ID theft they feel violated and they have a sense of fear an intrusion can be overwhelming\nIt's scary and the fury aiding at the same time people question your character you try

I have a hundred and kind of pulled out my four oh one K. pension or how my question\nFirst of all I could relocate to a different city but I don't want him I really like it here in ... why why would you need to do that I'm I'm afraid that I won't make as much if I look for another job why are you leaving your company\nOh I'm Sorry your clothes and hair next August oh well yeah OK an action that actual\nCarmen ... so I we we want to stay here mhm not the other part is that if I stay on that okay I'll get fabric package director equivalent ... thirty three week mhm I'm I'm thinking after it get hit with taxes\nAnd because I currently have the health benefits that it's probably not going to come out\nTo enough that worked waiting for oh you know I'm Wondering what it\nDepends on depends on what kind of a job you get I mean if you get a job in eighty grandma it\nMight not be worth waiting for because you might trade out the service for the stability but um I mean we're talking about thirty five thousand bucks or minus taxes\nAnd that's not you know and there's no chump change\nBut I'd be a nice thing to have room\nParticularly deeply indebted you guys are so um you know your tax rate just went to ... percent on the show it's not going to get only be taxed about five six thousand bucks so now after taxes taxes are not going to eat it all up so what what has happening here is um you've been hit\nAnd got the wind knocked out have you with this announcement\nAnd um I think you're immediately assuming negative things why don't we look around and like for ...
