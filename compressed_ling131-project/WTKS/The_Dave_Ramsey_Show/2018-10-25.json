E. V. I. N. for Hillsdale dot com that's living for Hillsdale dot com\n[noise] alright Claudio Rockford, Illinois the great W are okay go\nThen the smell of and how are you okay thank you I'm a great a lot of a lot of the topics and twice that\nYou make our our typical ingredients of what is taking place in the destruction of Europe and\nFortunately we and the U.S are just mere in that image and I I Believe that uh\nThat what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um [noise] it just what they're seeing\nTaking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they call them you know that they're there Mike when there are a people coming from the Syria Sudan and all of these regions that are going through wars\nAnd uh we have the media that is destroying everything and has their opinion and agenda and they have in Europe the you which people that are wearing suits but not appointed by anybody they're dictating what's going on\nMhm and I find very interesting a fight and I don't know if I can share on the air with you\nWhile let's not but uh you make you make some interesting points there and um\nAnd you're probably not aware of this but you're quite right in this to this extent the progressive movement a reaches to its philosopher kings in your roof so and ... and marks and ... among others\nAnd also you know in in certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back into your\n... to skew in Sydney and in others but also of course Aristotle and says real but\nBut the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity\nOne looks that humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you on a one individual at a time individuals have merit individuals have value individuals have words their God given God given God created\nAnd then there's another view which is to look at the whole the community\nAnd if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they are expected to do for the better good\nWell then those people need to be addressed and dealt with\nAnd of course what happens here is a relative handful of individuals when compared to the overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good for the community or not\nAnd this is where you get in trouble you get into these various ideologies and theories and obstructions in which I'm a a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will on all of society and to destroy man's nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual\nIs willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good of the state because conformity and uniformity our priorities their primary\nNow are viewed doesn't view it that way conformity in uniform either is not the priority as much liberty for an individual but as possible and in order to society and moral ordered society that's our model\nAnd so you want in in addition to that an economic system that is competitive that his market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on as opposed to this constant central is Asian the government\nPower uh but that is essentially seized by an elected individuals and they will that has imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's taking place on the southern border the vast majority of Americans do want the southern border security even those who are fairly liberal and the issue of immigration [noise]\nBut you have a political party leadership and a political party that believes it must change the population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible a permanent hold on power and\nThat's exactly what's taking place here that's what Merkel and Germany that's what's taking place and people don't have a right to come to the United states of America they don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution it's the people in this country who have rights and have the right to make these determinations\nAnd so uh I agree with you to that extent that\nWhat's happening here on the American left as they've taken the European left the progressive left both of which are ... of haggling marks and angles and the and the Russo and others are and that's the that's the road they've taken as opposed to the road we've taken which is the light meant\nThe embrace of western civilization and those sorts of things\nThat's my round about kind of process or your way of agreeing with you All right Claudio thank you for your call appreciate it\n[noise] and when they tell you this every night right up to election day first of all we are going to have an election day that isn't a lecture night

game by keeping it simple\nSomehow people have the idea that primitive or simple is bad\nAnd the contrary to the contrary it it the truth is the contrary to that the truth is is that the typical person who builds on net worth of up to about ten million dollars or does keep it very very clean and very very simple\nSarah is with us in uh Seattle, Washington Hi Sarah how are you\n[noise] I'm doing well thank you Kelly taking my call\nWe'll we'll let Kelly answer your question if you want [laughter] what something Sarah [laughter]\nUm I'm trying to get a little bit of advice and how to advise my parents to get long term care insurance\nMy daddy is sixty seven and doesn't qualify hands and health issues for my mom just turned sixty a couple of months ago and a couple of months ago and we're talking and my dad says well\nNow for the insurance doesn't fit in our budget and my mom says that short term thinking ... and I think they need at the budget which there how income\n[noise] um [noise] well that's a good question they are retired missionary\nPower they have not made a town and my dad and now like ... cut the receptionist I don't know exactly\nWhat he might not fit in their budget okay\nI mean there may have to buy very very limited policy if they don't have hardly any income why what's wrong with your dad that he doesn't qualify\n[noise] um he has made us have had a kidney transplant\nAnd so he's attempting to get it in the past and hasn't been able to\nDo some I tried to do what you said the Potter back or whatever you know say you know what works for me to fathom mhm really doesn't get\nTo get in front I get too much into that get fat apparently um like last year I encourage them to look into that and they talked about ... I think he didn't qualify at that point out\nSo if you if you can't talk about this what are they going to do it or not I mean how can I help\n[noise] well my mom called me and told me all that so I think she's on board\nOf trying I guess my question is um [noise] how can I ask how to convince them that it can according to your\nMom already knows it's important not only question is I don't know if they'll get the money to buy much of a policy sounds like they're pretty broke too many\nUm with what you're describing I don't know I mean some people come off of mission field not broke but but sometimes they don't and so you just got to you know um it it sounds like you're trying to fix something a lot harder and they're trying to fix it you can't make them do this\nAnd so I think your ... your mom's question and the yeah I mean if there's any way I could get it into my budget I Would get it into my budget um but it sounds like his health is he's an older than her about Fifteen Years and he's are no I'm Sorry about seven years you're saying but I'm\nIn his health is worse and typically Seventy five percent of ladies outlive their husband statistically nationally\nUm and so the one

financial these university class\nShe was attending and she was telling us about budgeting and hanging out credit card and I kinda just pass it off at the time because we already followed a budget and then I caught you on the radio show a few weeks after that and\nUm I really liked her no excuse attitude for paying off debt so I came home and suggested they told me that we should go to a total money make over one day event\nAnd so we did that and we decided to give it a try and so we\nWere aware of was that have been held Kansas City okay very cool very cool and I got you guys going\nYou know we started to do that and we finished baby steps two and three ... and we had just finished baby steps three in October two thousand and twelve and then just a few weeks after that our entire

screening they have the younger the only way I okay teenagers or to go yeah yeah okay\nUh what can I Do they tried to help him uh you know get on the right track as well as making sure I'm preparing myself for my financial future so I don't end up in what he does\nYeah he's an okay\nWell I think you're already preparing yourself for your financial futures Seventeen years old you actually know the day for him to show exist go figure\nSo I mean that that alone is is um put your way ahead of the game of most people say you know what to do and and and you're obviously observe some things you don't want to replicate from your dad even though there's probably some things that he does that are good\nThings not necessarily win money but but and he's probably got some good traits that you do have a really Kate and carry forward\nUm so uh um well the first thing is is that you learn to stay on a budget you learn to stay out of debt you learn to save money for emergencies and invest for the long term\nYou don't spend more than you make 'em you don't get credit cards and carry him around so that's how you prepare for your future and obviously you're gonna have to handle your own a school\nAh and you know on the show you have a lot of work ahead of you but that's okay you'll be fine\nAs far as you go now as far as him on there's\nNot many men on the planet that will take financial advice from their Seventeen year old middle son\n[laughter] absolutely\nYou have the powder bud syndrome once someone has powder but they really don't want your opinion about money or sex [laughter] and so he's not looking for your advice even though he knows he's probably wrong uh so you're probably not the man to speak up and caused this to happen that's my guess\nShow what are we going to do well there's a couple of things you could do um\nOne is is there a person in his life uh particularly another man that he respects is their business ability their money ability or even they're just they're spiritual walk\nA well definitely our pastor in the past there have tried to helping them in the past but it seems like no matter who's talking to them or what or how they're trying to help him he just doesn't seem to either comprehend any of it or want to replicate any of that and he's very stubborn and being his own man\nMhm okay well I think if I were you ever talk to your pastor again\nI'm ... you know I I find people every day I've been doing this for a lot of years and I found people every day who\nTwo years ago weren't wouldn't listen but now they list a five hundred years ago they wouldn't listen but now they listen so all of us you know the stubbornness comes and goes with all of us and be in our own man comes and goes but if the past or you know just a leans in and and I think\nI'm most pastors if they're going to make an error it would be on the side of being too soft not too hard\nAnd so I might if I were you ask her past her to turn up the heat is just a little bit more\nAnd just spending time with your dad and pushing on your data on this subject and not mentioned that you are involved because you're not involved yeah you can't fix it and you keep your mouth shut\nDown you're not going to make things worse very true yeah 'cause he's gonna he's gonna do whatever he wants to do and then you know at the end of having done everything you can do I mean you know if you wanted to give him a total money make over book or something you can do that but you have to be real\nI was thinking about doing that for like Christmas or something I Would just say this summer and I read\nThat I liked I thought you might enjoy it because you like business\nOr something like that not like a hey you're really fat here on how to not be fat\n[laughter] that doesn't work right that's insulting you fall on me and just so you know instead you would just say are just kind of blow it off and make it not might not make it a big deal oh daddy would change my life I Would feel so good if you would read there's no don't do any of that crap\nJust yes kind of keep it nonchalant just go hey I read this I thought you might like it because you like business stuff or something like ...\nAnd and just see if he picks it up he may throw it away he may put it on the coffee table as a coaster for the next two years and then open it we don't know how this was going to work but at least on a minute outside expert your pastor is an outside influence\nThat does have or could potentially have the credibility for him to listen to\nSome people aren't listening anybody and so you have to be willing to go I Love my dad in spite of his um incompetence than this one area of his life and I'm just gonna love him where he is it's all I can do\nAnd are you may you may do that your whole life ... you know he may go to his grave doing this\nIn ... and show your love is not conditional upon you know whether he handles money well or not your respect for him it's not even conditional on that\nBut you're not going to take financial advice from somebody that's misbehaving with money so he's not going to speak into your life on money issues but that's all that's all you know I don't speak into people's lives on growing hair because I Can't seem to do it on top of my head so I don't tell people how to grow here so if you can't do something you shouldn't tell people how to do it right\nOr you shouldn't have any even have an opinion this loud about it but people try all the time so just kind of keep that in the back of your mind their joy hey thanks for calling in

with it and look long enough and hard enough with twelve years meaning experience there some wealthy families that would need you to do maybe a little bit more than just ... that's right we're maybe you're just doing some light cleaning laundry hoping\nGiven I should say life for ... meant\nThen are you on me and you can make more than forty yeah home for more than forty yeah I think you got to own that this is what you love to do and find the best place to do it that's a game changer\nAnd having the confidence right\nRight you just you just detect a little shame I'm thirty one kid and

very wealthy it has a new pair really pay that lady big dollars yet so again you know there are some limits to what you can do they're really really can't\nEven like for families that are looking for that kinda thing not to drag goes on but but it is such a vitamin I care dot com for instance it's exploded because people are in need of that so even if you started a service where you had been working for you that you helped train that's right I mean I tell you that that the options are ... it's great creative\nAll right let's go to a social media question from Facebook Angie types and I'm not sure what to do I'm plugging away and my first snowball which is third which has thirty eight hundred dollars left on a loan and then some smaller medical bills are coming in and do I put those smaller bills in front of the Thirteen hundred dollar loan on the debt snowball list\nYes as as more loans are coming in and just go ahead and reevaluate does something that comes in okay where's this with the thirty hundred and put it in its place so you can keep knocking it out for and\nWhy is that why because I think the question is very calm and they go and work on the snowball nuggets of so let's say it's a four hundred dollar medical bill yeah well I Do that\nTo go ahead and get it out the way it's still momentum yeah you're still building the idea of okay I can do this and if that thing is just tagged along at the end you know what I mean like there's no purpose for it you know if you have the money you're going to have the money that point you've got them all especially if you're almost done with it you're going to have some cash to be able to throw at it and pay it off and then probably still put money on to pay off the other day that\nOkay this is a little bit

some clarity today's the day make the call\nNow before we went to the break I told you that I had some shocking information Rachel I cannot I'm beside myself because I meant to let you react to the people don't notice you and I love a good spirited public conversation you know whether it be politics sports was that we enjoy a good job\nIf we're going to have another radio show that wasn't really revolves around money in Korea target that we have a current event it will be\nGood so here is a current survey yeah All right now here's or at least set the scene as of June two thousand Eighteen according to the Federal Reserve\nAnd and so I mean the payouts are different obviously in ... make a hundred K. give or take a ... ... the one Seventy five\nWhich do you really want if all those money things weren't an issue and you had the responsibility of the wife and the children in the house and all that which one would you want if you could snap your fingers\n[noise] that's it it's hard for me to personally answer just because there's the bandages and disadvantages to um I don't think I Would take away a yarn a more right okay but I mean I Would be happy as empty as well\nOkay so the question becomes a can you take that next step or what do you call it the ...\nIs that right yeah nurse practitioner\nOkay ill okay in ... and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\n\nNot without going back to that tree or program enjoy fame prerequisite\nLight but my point is let's say you're in ... for five to seven years and you've got no debt you may even pay your house off in that time and so you cash flow your way through that as you move up the ladder how old are you\nTwenty nine\nYeah I just wonder can you do it just logistically can you do if you go into the into the situation you're going to casual that so no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to casual your way through that ultimate role\n\nReally know what are you making now the\nOkay you'd have a forty grand bump basically ... a year with that and how much is that scholastic and he said that you the cash flow\nOr that one would be forty K total and the other one is nine thousand correct you could\nDo it just started ... salary honestly\nAnd go and do that is forty can invest that but you're gonna make forty came back and a year so yeah Ken's right if you do that I Know ... and then go back to ... you may not be able to do it and that our school right now like you said 'cause you don't the cash for it they're not going to see them on that for that\nBut go ahead and go through the school getting upgraded job upgrade basically and you enjoy or in a sense that you are an increase of any kind of at least and yeah and then they've into the school and a few years and ... yeah\nThat ... I just want you to have that idea in your head I think well you pause you're sitting there trying to\nRun the numbers and I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there's a ladder to that ultimate goal might it take you seven or eight years yes but guess what eight years from now you're thirty seven [noise] you can cash flow your way so I think it's both saying that's what I say because both of them are what you want to do both of them or something that you're good\nFolks more of your calls about your life your career your money here on the Daily Show don't go anywhere [noise]\n\nAre you on of the millions of empty nesters are look around their house and just see unused space it might be time to downsize\nBut when you've raised a family and I have a lot of emotion is tied to your home it can be tough to separate the facts from the feelings and that's where an experts advise comes in handy Anna in Portland, Oregon knew she needed a real estate agents help when she decided to sell I had lived in my own for twenty five years and it was overwhelming to think where to begin\nYour E.

Rachel fake it\nGo ahead how can we\nThought well I'm just a little bit about about me or I'm calling for career advice I'm twenty eight years old I've been working in banking them back which are uh several years and I've been able to narrow down my passion which is a financial coach helping people build low\nBut in my current role my comfortable on the line with a belonged at work um banks or\nThe bank is very heavy on language and sometimes I don't think that the right thing for for everybody [laughter] so I find myself talking to people how to read another teacher ... and my question is how can I pursue like crash of as a financial coach without\nA huge great good well what do you make right now are you\nOK so first of all I think you need to to a deal with the guilt\nI absolutely love where you're coming from and your values and I understand you're having to sell something that you don't believe in\nBut in in the temporary a you know don't take on this massive guilt what you want to put your energy on right now is how quickly can replace that eighty thousand dollars so that I can step over into the uh financial coaching space or or like one of our smart vest or prose\nYour Dave Ramsey fan you're part of the tribe you know about are smart best prose and I think one of the first pieces advice I Would give\nIs to go sit down with one of those folks locally in uh Miami area of all those folks are listed on the website I'd find two or three of them tell them you're Dave Ramsey fan tell them your situation just the way you laid it out to us\nAnd and say can I take you to lunch or take it a coffee and learn the best path to get where you're at to do something similar they are going to give you some very very practical or knowledge and some next steps then you do your own homework\nHow much training how much qualifications certification whatever that is that you need to be able to do that that's something you can do and then once you know that you say OK how much is that going to cost me from a financial standpoint and then from a time standpoint these are basic\nResearch questions\nAnd so once you get the answer to that you've got the formulation of the plant and so you\nThe wisdom and knowledge from somebody who's actually doing what you want to do and then go do your own homework on what is going to take and you've got yourself a timeline an action plan and and then to to the extent that you can go work for one of those people\nThe mists around that the truth around that and it's so great like we've in St George Campbell our very own one here at the Daily Show out in the streets naturally ask people I have to like for instance your job\nWhat do you think a millionaire winning at our jobs are and it was like doctors lawyers movie stars right like all the answers but the truth\nIs so different it's all in the book every day a millionaire so I was just really encouraging like you said everything from their job their salaries these people they are not what you would think are the millionaires but the average Joe millionaire out there in America looks a lot different than what you probably have in your minds and so it's really close to the whole episode yeah we have fun talking about\nDid you how to be a millionaire too because when I was on your show it was used to have you hang it for ... for the first human bring a shape\nNow and he said about me money what if the millionaire show me a million dollars in the crowd in this country and run for cash but I just want to reach a crucial [laughter] [laughter] if you pay I'll I'll get you get a ... eight to five five to too far but ...\nCheck it out sorry and you'll even Facebook ... then you Amish and your show going well two\n... one Twenty one two younger than ... sorry ... percent back to your calls AAA eight to five five two to five triple lady too far five two to five is the number Lauren is up in Atlanta Lauren how can we help\nI think he's looking when I call Cher well my husband and I learned more young ... and ... and really black financially by some family and we don't have any that our houses paid off all that that we don't know what to do next [laughter]\nAren't you earn a spot where do you mean by that what do you mean you don't know what to do to I understand you are saying well what does that mean specifically what your next goals are that what you're asking\nYeah yeah I mean we don't make a ton of money on a teacher and he's a ... or so yeah our but our family his grandmother really lost financially\nVery cool so is this a financial cushion career course you\nKnow try and look like him or anything and our careers [laughter] ochre\nGreer you go there you go right to cook I well\nI Would say are baby steps learn if you know is passed every step three which is to say three to six months of expensive and the bank do you guys have that cash available\n... okay so you have thirty six months of expenses so that's done so then I Move on the baby steps four or five insect forests are funding retirements whatever you guys make than than you know start going into funding retirement like ...\nA four oh three bees is that whatever if that were ... if your husband's church as a pastor has a retirement plan plug into that but the Fifteen Percent into retirement and then what do you guys have kids\nYou do yes they yes no no no that's already know cat the ... and then you get baby step five which has kept college it skipped maybe six 'cause it done which means are near um baby step seven right now so that is just knowing wealth and giving which is a pretty awesome spot to be it's what I Would say for you guys is funding at retirement\nBut then also have similar goals that you guys want to me because I'm you know there's there can be this monotonous state that you get in\nWhen you don't have any debt or housing that none of that and you're just putting money away\nIn savings and it's just kind of like okay it's just there so you need something exciting that you guys want to do whether that's a vacation you want to take maybe etch we want to upgrade our home and five years and can we cash flow that can we go next Kobe are upgrade of our house we're going to complete we're never going to go into debt like bless your grandmother's like us and say\nWe're going to know that if we sell our house put money towards that so still have some things are working towards\n... that makes the saving money fund versus going just those black hole account and so for you guys to your lifestyle keeping in check like you don't need to go strap against\nMaybe you know you could up at a few a few percentage points each year as your income gross it's totally fine enjoy that because you guys are at that spot I'm but had that savings Goldwyn says and I'm\nYou know we we definitely has a couple now we're like okay what do we want to save towards because again like I said it can kind of be monotonous up just putting money in savings so having those goals for you guys as a couple of as a family it's huge and last but not least learn and it's the first thing we always talk about but it's true it's give\nYour at a position that you have to do some really cool giving because you guys have no payment at all not even help paying that much of an easy thing goes out in a while do really the big things you can do now and vast safe for something in the short term that you guys are looking forward to and ... do\nWe know Chris organ talks a lot about this on or you do as well I think we need to do next is go to a very nice dinner\nCandlelight dinner and take a pad of paper and dream a little bit over that remain because essentially what you just laid out was dreaming yet and I think they're in the position that actually really dream\nAnd even about giving and and maybe a homestead was that's your deal you want to buy land and what happens is now that you're in such a great position you're going to get their way faster than you fought but this was a season to dream\nAnd ... and for anyone out there like this is something that couples especially if you're married because if you're\nHere like us which I think your your three kids one\nBut it's like every day it feels like\nYour alarm goes off you wake up you drink your coffee you get ready for it you get the kids up to get them out the door and how to work on my roof you come back I mean there are saying you know you go home you get kids going to throw in the bath tub ones running out make it you're trying to get them back in the ... mine are\nThey like it is and you finally get 'em in bed and you're like oh\nWhat had happened like and you can live in that state for years and you never look at a couple of like what we want to look like in five years and that's the fun part criticize it and it is true this is fun marriage you guys like you get to build your future together so\nLauren and her husband need to do that debt free but also if you're in that still have those dream meetings and dream 'cause that's fun to be able to like what are we going to do even if it's our dreams to be out of debt and Eighteen months that's an awesome dream go for it\nAnd she can make a very key key point I don't want to drive it's home to folks some of you out there don't have a lot of hope and it's because you're not focused on a vision\nSo there's a psychology study up there it's a very well known and uh it's it it shows that the brain what it focuses on we tend to see you notice when we didn't see before and here's an example of the study that most people get when you go buy a car\nYou buy that car lot you drive it out how many times have you done this and you see it everywhere for\nThe next game have you noticed oh yeah totally so that's real\nIt's a real effect yet and what's happening is is the brain has been so focused on this new car purchase you want to do you look forward to it so much then you go by\nIt and you're so excited about it\nAnd then all of a sudden you never saw before\nBut it's materialize and in front of you it's always been there but you are focused on is so to your point\nThat applies to this idea of even if you're just just completely covered up and debt right now maybe your baby step one you just got to know Dave and you're you're doing the ...\nIf you can have the meaning that you talked about Rachel what it does is it allows you to see the end of the baby steps and when you can see it and focus on this desire future phrase we use around here all the time yeah\nThen your brain will begin to see the baby steps and the sacrifices many opportunities to do the long haul stuff to get you there that's the key club just as fun romantic dream section it's practical it's what keeps you in the game\nOh absolutely and I said earlier ... said again some fun around here it is for the pay well see you're you guys were you know wherever she said twenty twenty three you know thinking about Thirty years when you're fifty three like what do you want to do great\n... awesome awesome awesome big things Rachel crews were hanging out with me or think of producer James child our associate producer Shelly Daniel and most of all\nYou America thank\nYou so much for your show [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nYour dream job producer\nI'm excited to announce it we're down period of six hundred radio stations across\nAt the debut done washer [noise]\nWhat if you could help people in your community when with money what if you could help them get out from under the weight of that\nYou can as a financial ... coordinator with other coordinators from across the country we've helped five million people learn how to pay off debts spin and save wisely and ultimately changed their lives\nAt any given time thousands of groups meet to work through this program together and people just like you volunteer as a coordinator to leave those groups if you have a heart for helping people with money when you're the perfect person to become a coordinator\n... it's not going to be Fifteen hundred is not that's not what it's going to work out to be so be ready that's what's really going to happen uh and if it gets to be a burden around south stupid thing you know what I mean dead on it you're paying cash for it it's what's your dream was you work for it ring the bell hit the goal do it\nIf it doesn't work out Charlotte\nBut be emotionally ready to sell it if it becomes a bird 'cause I don't think that writing those maintenance checks is going to be a sponsor as easy as you're acting like it's going to be that's my opinion I think I probably wouldn't do it do you work for you got the money that cash for it do it ding ding Nate sweaters nights in Las Vegas sign Nate how are you\nGood Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up great thanks for early rated by thank you I have a\nQuestion on my wife and I mean ... few months now and the back story um we pay for my bachelors I'm a school like mom it's totally paid for\nAnd we got shorter cosmetology school and we passed what her car and we were sitting there with about thirty five thousand dollars in savings good I'm twenty four and she's twenty and so\nI was planning on going to graduate school here in state mhm one bachelor mhm and I was going to call about twenty five thousand mhm so my oldest brother is a big fan of yours and he suggested that we open raw higher rates\nGo we went ahead and did that we looked up one of your\nFinancial advisors I'm a we max out her and one on three to five hundred ... decided that I Want to law school\nWith a much more political call [noise] so we're just wondering\nIf that with um a fake doing both up money the more of what you said about me can make your finger so mhm and so is there anything we can go to the point to get that money back we want to be going to law school about Twenty one when we were caught it so we have time to play but more money but for\nSitting on about twenty thousand right\nNow what's it like to go to school law school [noise]\nUm well I'm hoping to get scholarship but if I go in and it'll be about Seventy ...\nOkay so you're fifty shy and you're going to get that and the only months\nWell ... I Hope\nThe hope would and don't get it all up why calling I Would have\nThe sirens I write and solve that problem\nAre we able to take the money so if I recall correctly\nBecause right now I don't know ten thousand dollars does not solve a fifty thousand dollar shortfall so even if I answer your question and it's like clean out the raw you still got a major dad gummed problem here and you're indirectly asking me to participate in the student loan scenario I think\nNo we're going to show how you're going to get elected grant about how many calls in here do what now currently we make about over the problem currently\nAnd you can bank the majority of that okay well I well here's what I Would do would ... I Would not cash out those routes unless I have to but you can take the money out of the raw to talk to your tax people and be sure but I'm pretty sure you can take the money out of the raw the portion you put in without any taxes or penalties on it\nOkay that's what I was on there yeah\nI don't want you to do that today I'd rather you just cash flow this and leave that alone that's that's all among job one but before I borrowed money I Would do that yeah\nEspecially if you can get the Seventy thousand together get get sixty thousand of you're Seventy together with scholarships and and was saving out of your Seventy thousand dollar income yeah you'll be on fire then do very good [noise] okay cool that sounds like a plan\nAnd that's the way the new law school pay for it I Love it very well done [noise] this is the Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped\nYou can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just getting rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and\nThe only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share exit team they have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution\nThey've accepted thousands of timeshare owners this year alone there are the best in the business because they simply a more\nOptions for exit than anyone else it could be a long process but there with you every step\nOf the way and timeshare exit teams so confident in their acts of service that if they don't get you out you get a full refund called eight for for nine nine nine exit and schedule a free consultation eight for for nine nine nine ... or timeshare exit team dot com\nHey this is Rachel created that has always drilled into us that you can buy quality thing and they'll get a great deal that's why I Love cats and eat on mattresses Palestinian offers amazing Massachusetts for every budget and now they got a brand new mattress called\n... they kept their best mattress and made it even better it's incredible\nTry testing needle for a hundred nights rent free at ... dot com that CNN dot com I don't remember its ships for free at the end dot com back\nTo school means it's time to get focused if you want to change your future if you're sick and tired of the way things are and you need to improve your income then change your career check out my friends that career step career step\nAll first training to quickly prepare you for a career in healthcare that will get you a job you may even get to work from home and get this career step helps with the job placement visit career step dot com slash Dave\nFor a special offer\nKeeping you updated with Fox News at the top and bottom of each hour news radio Ninety seven point seven in twelve Ninety am you have a duty Kay s so better [noise]\n\n\n\nActually is in Los Angeles I actually well from what I've read you show\nAnd thanks for taking my call sure what's up in your work\nOr how um my husband and I don't agree he recently came back from a deployment and said he wants a divorce\nAnd a bankruptcy so um we are fifty thousand dollars and last year remain thirty five of them are dead breaks down to twenty five and car penance student loan and Fifteen and credit card ... I'm just not sure where to go [laughter]\nOkay and um [noise] so uh what what do you make\nSo I mean his chances of moving\nUp in the military are are are harmed pretty dramatically if he falls or bankruptcy but he doesn't make any money ... and he just came home of a deployment and he's lost his mind to show it was like oh my goodness\nYeah [laughter] and I'm so sorry I didn't care\nAnd I was just trying to start over and it's not going to be as easy for him as he wants it to be how old is he\nGoing to seven\nYeah okay\nWell um I I think you sit down with your pastor and if you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine um\nI think if he files and you don't you've got to force him\nA to sell the car that is in his name and probably we're going to sell your ... to ... I'm ... and and get you get you a five thousand dollar loans for the difference and then you work your way out of the credit card debt the little bit of a car loan driving a beat her and the student loan debt is going to take you a little while with your income\nBut you can do that it doesn't mean you have to file just because he files mathematically or to legally\nOkay this is just making sense to you here\nSo I'm Sorry your face and all this one of ... listen if you get in the middle of and you're going to the question you call me back I'll help you okay\nThank you\nThank you Chris is with
