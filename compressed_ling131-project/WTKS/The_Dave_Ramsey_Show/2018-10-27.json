how are you\nFirst time caller Dave hey good to have your math not going to help do my wife and I we have zero debt but\nWe um we have that on our house and we plan on how in the house next spring mhm should we still pay on the house\nSo soon as soon as the weather breaks you putting us on the R\nWell yeah like like for much\nProbably like may or June\nOkay All right so like six months plus or minus All right um\nOkay it doesn't matter much um the thing I Would do though is if you put the money into a savings account instead of pay an extra on the house\nAnd you have to like write yourself a note that shows like ... yourself a letter that comes June first is says if the house is not up for sale put this money on the house\nOkay so in other words if you waffle on this decision and the money gets spent on a bass boat it wasn't a good plan\n[laughter] okay 'cause that's what happens to loose change it tends to find its way towards an impulse purchase if we change our direction on the sale of the house and I want it thrown at the house if\nUm if you're going to keep the house but for six months it doesn't matter\nTo the other part of my question would be ... sixty nine thousand currently in a savings account so say we don't know how\nMuch of that America is he from what you put towards the mortgage on emergency\nAnd she'll be three to six months of expenses I doubt that your expenses are\nThat high sick I mean oh okay so what would it take if you lost both of your jobs or what would it take for you all to pay your bills for a month\nFor a month mhm um eat keep ally and get on it or does it keep the lights on that kinda stuff\nI'd say three to four thousand kind so a three to six times times four thousand six times four thousand twenty four thousand so twenty five thousand of the sixty nine is the most you should do\nOkay which leaves you about forty clear okay for a forty five clear um and uh to throw at the house and what's the balance on the mortgage\nTwo hundred and eight thousand okay yeah so hold that and and had to separate those two accounts by the way I'd have a twenty five thousand dollar count in a money market and not have a forty five thousand dollar account in the future house paid off house Fonda or paid off styles fun\nOkay if you don't put a sign in the yard by the first of June take that money on that account and put it on the house okay\nIf you waffle in change directions in your decisions which are allowed to do you're an adult by the way a white man that is a winner who who's up okay Monica is up well who's up just just make up your mind I don't care [laughter]\nI'm getting signals from the boost that um we can't repeat okay why [laughter] San Antonio [laughter] hey Wyoming what's up [noise] how's it going to have better deserves that's for sure how can I help\nUm no I was just calling in today 'cause I I've been listening to you for about a year I'm On and off and I'm right now we're in we have about a hundred and five thousand dollars in debt and fifty thousand and cars twenty two thousand and other debt like credit cards and all that\nSo one Osama includes cars\nYes hitting the cars\nFifty on cars and what's the other fifty five on\nA dirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's ah about eight thousand on mine and a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that\nGot it and what's your household income\n[noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years and um we're making about one one oh five one twenty ... a year where did you used to the old job\nYeah that that's what I was making before a yes before okay um what do you make now why\nOkay and how much is in your ... ended emergency fun I have about sixty thousand dollars okay good for you and your household income is what\nI'm about one a high [noise]\nOkay cool cool when you're doing really well you've got a big well you got a big pile of an emergency for an end you really sound like you've hit some things and I obviously this was an emotional issue and he told me recently Miami and a lot to you\nIn sorry to interrupt the reason why I'm nervous because I'm not able to build it back up as fast as it started so it makes me nervous to take a big chunk out to eat or how big is the ... ... about a third\nSo twenty grand other sixty yeah okay\nWell the emergency fund is there in case there was obviously an emergency capping already this year right so um but but if you think through your single\n\nAh yeah I'm divorced buy more stock I have a I have a son already but I did in case I re Mary Mancini option to have more children and how old are you thirty nine\nOkay All right um\n\n[noise] there's two there's two things that are bumped into my head and they're ... they're they're both are working against each other okay so I'll just say I'm Out loud on a show it was just process this together a little bit okay thing one is I tell folks not to use their emergency fund except for emergencies\nGuy thing too is this is very very very important\nTo you obviously it is and uh I mean it's it's in and you have a window of time you know a show I\nGuess what I'm going to do is I'm going to shop around and and make sure I've gotten all the possible ways to pull this off is twenty grand the best most efficient most reasonable most safe\nWay is there a Fifteen grand methodology is they're thirty five grand methodology is or other things that cause I don't know anything about this at all um I mean other than the obvious to you know the higher level understanding of it but I'm\nBut I'm going to ... to gather more information anytime I'm buying anything for running around I'm going to learn a lot and you may have already done all that but I'm going to I'm going to really push it on the research always the more options you have when making a decision the better decision you always make you follow me during that time I'm also going to just be piling up cash like crazy\nBut my hair was on fire let's just keep adding an adding an adding an addict but the other thing that comes into my mind is forty thousand might be an adequate emergency fund for you\nAnd that's the ... this is not an emergency we could\nSay that for sure but I feel like I feel like it is talk\nOf the on the line is but it's not an emergency it's not a a it's not an unexpected event it's an elective\nLuxury that's very very very emotional and very very important ... and that's a reasonable statement but but I I think if I'm In your shoes on might declare forty thousand my emergency fund\n\nAnd then I'm okay could cause a lot of catch most of what would come your way what kind of an emergency would come your way that would be more than forty thousand and extended unemployment will be the only one that would\nRight\nI mean or I don't I ... I mean I assume you've got good healthcare coverage\nI Do but they won't cover it\nBecause I don't like talking about that I'm saying if you had a major health issue\nYou know that that would that would eat up forty grand but it wouldn't really wouldn't I mean you to get the forty grand if you got you know the ... co pay it that's a lot and I thought that'd be a million dollar expense you know so it'd be very and I think you're okay at forty grand\n\nAnd if you declare that then we don't have to declare there's an emergency I'm I'm just process on this with you because I'm trying to figure out what to do it\nOkay I'm In if\nYou want a soup your emergency fund backup later you can do that but you don't have to feel like you've violated or a principal the process to do this then\nOkay that makes me feel better there's a logical to you I think so yeah I think so\nHave you got a good friends or family or pasture or somebody else on you and walk in with you on the just the whole process on this and the decision making and everything\nYou know [laughter] not doing this show the what I've been told I don't have to worry about it but I Am [laughter]\nBye bye good counsel was that what you're saying\nNot necessarily good counsel but friends and family say oh you know the\nFamily and I are where are you might have been crap I'm Talking about somebody that loves you enough to look and your husband go really seriously what are you doing here I mean our our yes you should do this you know but it's not just a I mean if somebody really thinking this through with you're not just casually over coffee going\nGood accountability good counsel in the multitude of council there's safety and that's what I'm looking for but I I don't I don't hear anything holding me back here in your situation very interesting question though very interesting situation\nThanks for calling in and we appreciate you being a listener wrote Rami is with us in Columbia South Carolina isn't Rami roaming\nIts romey high romey high how can I help\nYeah I um I Want to reach out to you I was on recently called called by a kind of a a major insurance provider and they were trying to sell me on a farm insurance products so like you know term insurance and a lot to do the which I agreed with him that I needed\nAnd um but I don't like the prices they quoted me were rather high so I went ahead he you know reach out to one of your recommendations and whatnot and got some or some other coach there were a lot better mhm and ah and I reached out to them and mentioned it to them and they had mentioned yeah those are those are kind of like\nLetting those insurance companies aren't good their um their their ratings are high financially you want to go with the more higher expensive or insurance companies are going to they're going to be\nIn the next Twenty years you know we are going to show you yeah I was like oh okay um so I Need to buy you basically just got as the Mercedes of ensuring you need to buy just said if you don't want to\nIn like a you know a Chevy yeah so I wanted to get your thoughts on that\nWell um that's an absolutely ludicrous way to solve the objection okay there are there are financial ratings for life insurance companies if they do not meet a certain level of financial criteria the state that you're operating in will not allow them to sell insurance they're\nSo they're almost broke the state will let them sell in your state\nYeah I have to make minimum criteria to just financial solvency to do that number one number two if you have permanent life insurance and your term life insurance company goes broke\nOne less you're sick and can't get insurance you just go buy more church it's kind of like if your car is your check the financial stability of your car insurance company lord no [laughter] right now they go broke you just go get another one\nYou know if you've got a recipe and progression of goes broke you just get a different one you don't think about those progressive have the money to pay my claim\nYou know but you can look at ... am best ratings of someone at the sand or insurance his website and they are all financially solvent as much as this group or the ... on the other stuff that's a that's a complete land a BS rum Rome is what it was\nOkay with that make you feel a lot better 'cause I yeah I went ahead with the the less expensive option anyways they say well I wouldn't I wouldn't do that from my family was like oh yeah\nYou are now selling insurance and by the way you called called me yeah [laughter] right right yeah that was when they call you that's just one thing right there but [laughter]\nYeah yeah if you are doing investments with them if you're doing the whole live life insurance with them which we don't recommend so you'd be a lot more about the stability because you have a savings account\nThere then that's a lot more important they couldn't even hardly\nGot split Thompson

targeting high profile Democrats and other\nAll right so here's the thing I don't want your house payment to be much more than a force of your take home pay is about a third of your take on by today but I think when I had my four oh one K. back in your ... on on those four oh one K. it sounds like\nSo I'm going to temporarily stop the four oh one K. your house is not the problem you're toys or your problem and your student loan is your problem\nA hundred thousand dollars worth of toys when you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year as backward\nGuy because they're all going down in value you shouldn't have toys stuff was wheels and motors that add up to more than about fifty percent of your take on pay or fifty percent of your income now you didn't just cut your income down substantially when mom I came home I got that part but still you were over you were at a hundred percent even when she was working\nSo you got too much tied up and things going down in value that's a bigger problem than your houses and you're staring down the barrel of a fifty thousand dollar debt that you need to clear I Would say you ought to clear that and\nIt's probably gonna take you three years in the setting if you stop everything vacations eating out and for one gays and sell a toy or to it's probably still gonna take a weapon on which way you sell but um you know I'm getting all this debt\nBecause it hasn't benefitted you number one number\nTwo I'm getting out of that but even if it had been offended you even if you got a fifty thousand or you were raised because I've been I use that fifty thousand to clear that that the first thing first order of business but I really don't think your house was the problem I probably would sell some toys\nUh no I Know I Would sell some toys but I shouldn't say that so lightly um that's where your problem is you've got too much invested in depreciating assets\nAnd on your houses it's generally OK I'm temporarily would stop my four oh one K. and I would beat on this debt with a hammer until it's gone\nBut I Want you to do once you're rolling stock and stuff with motors and it to be less than half your annual income now if you say your income coming up very dramatically in a very short order and you want to hold a couple of these toys or something that's fine but still you need to keep it around fifty percent or less\nA because you just got too much juice tied up and stuff that's going the wrong way it's all going down you look up and that hundred thousand dollars worth of stuff can we were fifty thousand about a blink of an eye\nAnd then scratch your head and wonder why you're broke you know you got stuff going the wrong way so yeah I I think you I'm probably got a pass on something that you\nThought we were going to show which was the house and you got surprised by me selling your toys but I you know whatever you want their toys but that's\nWhat I Would do if I woke up in your shoes and oh by the way I'm a boat and a car guy I like anything with a motor and it just about but that but the problem with all of it is it goes\nDown in value and so it needs to be a small percentage of your world Rob is with us in Bend Oregon Hi Rob how are you\nKnow great Dane thank you so much for all the stuff you and your organization view [noise] um I've got a question I have traveled the passed away of employment I've gone from jobs where I had to wear name K. two jobs that were possible careers to owning my own job\nAnd now I'm at a point where I'm starting a business and I wanted to be employee base [noise]\nBut my question is for that new one is an employee based business\n[noise] well that that's one where I don't do all the work I have people that I've had people doing the work for me\nCool that's better than you're just doing all the work and honing your job I got ya okay right very great so now I'm In Atlanta now now I Hope that work on your business not just in it okay good right\nAnd so when it comes to compensation for the employees is it better to give them more money or or benefits or how do you balance that\nWell when your brand new and small you don't have a lot of choices the benefits of are ridiculously expensive and so um you know like for instance health insurance when when you have less than ten people you they can by helping\nSure it's cheaper than you can for them [noise]\nOkay so I'd rather just get more money and let them do what they want to with it or they buy health insurance through their spouses work\nRight attached to that family that kind of like ... different benefits are very difficult for the business without it or twenty people are less but you can give them other benefits that are not corporate tied benefits like treating them good a tree in my family being there when the baby is\nGoing to the ... funeral or some and flowers for the grandmas funeral and you can treat 'em like human beings we don't get treated that way\nAmerica [noise] this is that Iran [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents in a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and

fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not have to write him a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nUh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the hold harmless but I I\nI Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're

holiday that this is something that you've touched on our website\nAnd find new to the baby and I know that number wine in the ads and dollar an American the fine my question is do you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing happen mhm I stay at home with a kid mhm but I'm just wondering how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get back to baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an unstable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you OK but um that's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years old and they're never happened I mean really lucky we haven't been laid off you go in and they get ... I mean more than a couple\nOf weeks she don't couple of weeks to do something ... going to\nFind something to do when he comes home and they did get laid off so\n[noise] you know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed paws all my money make a little baby step thing and just pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my

Ninety seven point seven and twelve Ninety am W T chaos\nMm\nYou're joining us America we're glad you are here open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five star measures with us on Facebook day we've got a whole eyed policy on\nAll our family members [noise] I'm In the process of switching my wife and out of term insurance ...\nWhat do we do with our three kids whole life policies should we keep it as is change it to term or cancel it altogether cancel it altogether if you need life insurance on the child it would only be enough for what we call final expenses God Forbid a funeral\nAnd ten Fifteen twenty thousand bucks as a child rider on your term policy would cover that if you want to cover that if you've got an emergency fund them within Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars in it I Would self insured through that\nChildren we love them they're precious they're everything they do not create financial benefit\nWhile most often\nI had a friend who had to get a diaper commercial he created financial benefit but most of the time kids costs money they don't make money\nAnd so our goal is to take care of them not for their passing to take care of us\nAnd so the only cost you would want to cover it would be God Forbid and the event you lost a child would be a final expenses cost and you usually have an emergency fund if you're following our steps in Europe the baby step three to do that and you won't need to do that\nWhen you're switching you're so I'm cancel the whole life policies on kids they're sold to you as a college benefit but your child will never see the front door of a college using her whole life policy\nBecause there's I mean you just that they're going to be four dollars or something and that thing I mean it's ridiculous a little kid policies are just a complete rip off and for whatever you do don't buy financial stuff from a baby food company\nThose will be buying those Gerber policies I don't know who bonds and stuff I mean does that it just strikes me as funny than anybody would even consider buying a financial investment for my baby food company\nJust backwards\nBut we're going to use them to feed our kids more ways than one [laughter]\nIs that why\nAre you thinking so ... jump on the sand or insurance is website get you some quotes on you and your wife and just drop the kids whole life policies completely\nAnd drop your whole life policies one Sanders issues your term policy which of the term policy in place you can get the best prices anywhere as Vander insurance dot com because they're a broker they shop among a zillion companies and get you the best\nOkay and what's your household income\nBetween the two of us about a hundred and twenty six year\nOld and the third car that's paid for what is it worth\nA five hundred dollars okay in the okay and and it's running yes huh okay\nAnd the other car that you have you oh half on a or it's worth half of what you ah what is it worth what are you a\nA word about Eighteen thousand I think we're thirty three\nOkay All right well uh as you've probably heard in the lesson there's two rules of thumb I use on getting out of that how much other debt do you have not counting your home\nI'm told probably about a without the cars probably another Seventy thousand most of the student loans\nOkay so Seventy plus about safety\nYeah about fifty four actually okay\nAll right um well the rule of thumb I use is is you don't want to own vehicles that are more than half your annual income and if you discover through going through financial piece and you make the phone call like you're making is can we be debt free but the house in two years if we keep the cars\nAnd your answer is no\nMy aunt Betty I mean something's got to give here I don't know what it is but something's got to do and so if you sold a Twenty one thousand dollar car where did you get your values are those private sale values are wholesale or a dealer all for what\nAre those are trading values\nOkay so you can literally sell them for more than that possibly yes\nHow's your credit oh no you definitely could you sell it for more than ... ... value I mean you saw it for a price sale amount on Craig's list so um how's your credit\nI'm lying in the tank I went through a divorce couple of years ago\nUm have you all this money to these these two Carlin's where the loans\n\nI Believe they're both through Ford Motor credit so\nUh so you've not got an easy way to finance the difference\nUh well my wife for credit scores about an eight hundred\nOkay she would just do it all in her name then\nYes uh-huh okay\nAnd you don't you were going to drive the five hundred dollar cars one driver and then this other car deal is going to be your second driver\nYes uh-huh okay\nAnd so if you sold the Twenty one thousand dollar car for twenty\n... twenty four that gives you about three to throw at the other deal and the Eighteenth probably worth more like Twenty one or twenty two shows on white man and the whole if those were trading values I'm not a ... year only about six and the whole here\nUm that's yeah that's not the end of the world um I I Would only do that if I moved down into a car that had a value of a hundred ten thousand dollars\nOkay and when you're in the problem with your trading them in is you're not going to get as much for them so that part I'm really not up for I'll tell you what let's don't do that let's let's sell the Twenty one thousand dollar car that's worth actually more than Twenty one\nAnd buying our bite you try to sell it for me I'm going to guess and say let's say for instance that would bring twenty twenty four that puts three in your pocket unless by three thousand dollar car with that\nOK okay and um then let's get the other car sold for as much as it will sell for and just borrow the difference\nFrom the credit union in your wife's name\nWas her credit and that gets you a three hour car in a hoop the\nBut she got still got Seventy thousand dollars over here to deal with a student loans but you're making one twenty six so you can do that and within a couple of years easy Eighteen months or so and so then we're going to move up in car once we're out of debt and have your emergency fund in place\nSo we're not going to drive these who peace but maybe two years is what it sounds like maybe two two and a half years of time\nOkay and that gets you clear but you know your car poor you have a car mess on your hands are right to observe that and um you\nKnow at a minimum I'm getting rid of one of them but I I like your idea of getting rid of both of them if you were to do a trade in with the dealer though\nYou're going to make a lot less on these cars because they're going to give you trade in that's all they do and it's not 'cause they're evil or something they just have to run cell by car make a profit they don't they're not in the break even business during the profit business\nAnd so um you know a trade in through a dealer probably not going to help you achieve your goals nearly as fast it could throw a difference in five or six thousand\nBucks in this discussion easy if not more the difference in trade in value improv a sale on these two vehicles Tracy is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Tracey how are you\nDoing very good um I Am here I did buy your book here in the whole ... by it currently on I've got a Jew by I thought that after you and then the other\nFinancial piece book and the total panic over book okay\nAnd I am having in direct combat mhm and I and cutting and cutting out right now and I felt\nI work at night crave the I have great now thinking about Seventy I like to be I'm a ... thirty in the car fare effect yet I'm right now I failed I kind of at minimum payments but I Do not have a thousand dollar phased out\nMy main cry it aired I had like you got for\nMark and I have about a hundred ... not not that many or anything like that it back and forth but how can I point out in ... and ... correct fairy category\nNow now it's time to read the books that you bought the book the book\nThe total money make over will explain to you exactly how to take your baby steps\nAnd I'm the first thing we're going to get current with everyone and get on a written budget you don't have a detailed budget yet\nYou've just got along I got a little list that you made but you don't even got car gas on your list yet so you don't have an adult budget yet you need to do that on an easy way to do that is go to every dollar dot com\nAnd download the app for your iPhone or your eye pad or I'm Sorry your iPhone or your Android or you can put it on your desktop and it's free to use every dollar\nAnd every dollar will help you put together your budget in about ten minutes so the first thing is to get a detailed written budget that you do a new one every single month\nThe second thing you've got to do as a part of doing that budget you have to have your husband involved you have to be in agreement if you're not an agreement and both of you pulling this wagging together you're going to get really tired of pulling the wagon by yourself\nYou have to have unity you have to have agreement in order to win money it's almost impossible to do it with one spouse by themselves\nSo a budget that your spouse and you both have looked at and you both agree to on every dollar dot com now when you've got that and your current with your bills the first goal\nIs to save a thousand dollars ... just save a thousand dollars for all the money you can squeeze out of your budget in the ... baby step on until you get a thousand dollars then we step to\nYou'll read all of this when you read the total money make over me is you start looking ... and you attack them in that order and that puts us our the rams are showing the books\nWill be back when you're in the meantime remember there's ultimately only one way to financial piece of ... which are ...\n\nWe use the phrase part of a teacher to describe our real estate ... because we only endorsed agents who care more about helping their clients that are earning a commission\nBut you don't have to take my word for it here's what Paul one of our listeners from Boise have to say about is a yellow be part of a teacher is the perfect description for Matthew the E. L. P. I used to sell my home\nI'm In order to be able to keep the house in order to keep from having to sell it to pay the credit card debt you just pay a lot of your pocket to keep the house but bottom line is what you stand is good for what you owe your assets minus liabilities equals your net worth and that's all that would go to the ears in the event of a someone passing away and that's assuming you did\nNot sign on any of that person's notes which obviously we wouldn't do especially in the case of Amanda Kyle is with us in Greenville South Carolina Hi Kyle how're you\nDoing sir how are you today\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\nYes sir so we did maybe step seven sometime around march last year or Yes sir and we've been saving aggressively since that point a possibly getting into some real estate or just\nReally looking for some ... retirement investing advice or we have about three hundred thousand to do something with 'em by the end of the year it just kind of been hesitant to put it anywhere till we get more information kind of had had a better piece about where to put it I guess you\nGot you okay so what is your long term plan with with your wealth building money what are you going to the invested in\nA boat non bully we're going to do this mutual funds outside of our current retirement but we also are are learning more currently about real estate right now as we speak so mhm\nIt's more we get our our mind wrapped around it and put a little bit more peaceful that you're probably gonna go invest now she rentals maybe ten to twenty rentals over the course of the next six years\nAgo in ... so take a cup take a hundred or a hundred and fifty of that and by a rental house in Greenville South Carolina then right\nAfter her that's ...\nThat's cool yeah it's it's okay to let it just sit for a little while if you want to park it in something that rides the market while you're ah when I'm saving money at that stage it maybe step seven which I obviously amount than what I Do sometimes I'll just throw extra cash a guy like that into a simple S. and P. five hundred fund\nA it's a no load fun and it's going to do whatever the market does so it could go down before I pull it out but most of the time it goes up I mean you could lose a little bit on it but um at least is going to ride the market and you know mark is doing real as hot right now I don't know how long it'll be hot but that's\nThat's what you're facing and so you know you could park that three hundred in there and and you know you might make twenty thirty grand on it while you're waiting to buy your first piece of real estate but I'll just I'll throw a certain amount every month into an opinion when it gets big enough I use it to buy real estate with\nAnd um that's how I Do it but I mean you can do whatever you want to do if you want to set a certain amount and mutual funds permanently you probably want to try to beat the F and P with those funds but the the money you're kind of just holding out\nUh on then you know you just hold that out but if you want to leave it in a money market not taking risk with that you knew that as well it's not a problem at all either way\nNicole is

my my parents type relatively young at that point in time not a millionaire no so\nWould you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nOr those patterns or because of the amount of heritage is ... maybe ... maybe ... percent\nOf its lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm ... I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell that twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below your means they are a modest lifestyle which we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was you people do stupid things I've done a stupid thing is I think if you can limit\nIs saying that that should do along the way that's good I like that [laughter]\nBecause because every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do stupid things begin you can minimize those ... along the way\nAnd we have a modest lifestyle will blow your means I'm no Lloyd\nSo do you think there'll be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nIs probably a probably even higher if they if they minimize do stupid you know maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and the ... all the math on networks to your benefit a at a Wal alive if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand to hit\nThe question about it a thank you for joining us and thanks

us on Facebook news radio twelve Ninety WB gas\n\n\nBring anything at all\nSure what's up\nTold me and my brothers are taking care of mom dad passed on years ago she Seventy eight an intermittent or hell has sixty thousand dollars and what we would call her retirement fund and then about six thousand at a checking account and that\nRetirement fund has been a rental house that my brother used to pay a rental house and he's basically been given all the rent money even though he covers all the maintenance just kind of extra gift from him\nBut that become a bit of a problem because he doesn't he owns a small business and that's really not it's focused though it go it often goes without attending\nThe mom doesn't get that money coming in\nAnd wondering you know if you have a recommendation on may be a better um consider an investment maybe a admitted in pain or just a mutual fund or want to get your thoughts on that her\nAnd her financial situation is hard net monthly is about two fifty and the whole when she gets a Social Security I'm after she pay their rent which includes an independent living with meals so that three hundred two or three hundred a month and we've been chipping away at her checking account\nOver the past two years now by its pound only six thousand that's about time to start hitting the fix the\nOkay the sixty is in cash and it's from rental income over the years\nYeah for about the past eight years okay now you've got that and that's invested in want\nIn my brother's one of my brothers rental property\nHow she would yawning mom's money it's not in ...\nHe could liquidate it he can he can give her the cash if if we made it if we decided to go that route but he basically just took the money and paid off his rental house and started giving her all the rental income\n\nOh I see okay and so her investment that she has made in this rental property is not doing well because there's not being managed well\nCorrect okay um and where is the property\nIt then it around Jackson, Tennessee so she lives in Memphis with me and it hit near my brother it's in his home town but you know there's still a burden on him and I think it kind of even though he says it's not a problem I think the ban and thought\nIt would be better off I'll sell the house and use the money to invest in something that doesn't require\nEffort correct okay\nYeah I mean if you just did that and you put the money in a mutual fund um throws off six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month that's ten\nPercent right and that covers shortfall\nWhat are your thoughts on David in pain she think that\nMore now or a labor no I don't think it's more secure safer\nBecause you're not well diversified you're stuck in one or two stocks in the grip and I wouldn't get into that um I Would like to take a growth in income mutual fund\nAnd a balanced mutual fund for about thirty K in each and try to find something that's got a track record of paying up around ten percent a year eight to ten percent a year a again gross and just drained the growth off of it and they should run in perpetuation and to the tune of about five hundred bucks a month in\nAssuming you're sixty out of the sale of the house but yeah sit down with a good mutual fund advisor to you work with one\nOf my company uses fidelity so they've been putting you know they don't
