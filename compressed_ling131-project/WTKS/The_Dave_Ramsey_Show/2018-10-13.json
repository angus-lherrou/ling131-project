we've ever seen\nIn history we've never had anything like this\nIs actually pretty close pretty close [noise]\nAlready so you might hear quite a bit about where Michael ranked historically [noise]\nNow ... what you hear is that top five ... not quite in terms of recorded hurricanes in\nUs history but by name storms that is the case here's the deal we've had in Atlantic hurricane season that we've tracked since Eighteen fifty one but they didn't start naming hurricanes until Nineteen fifty three All right so\nYou actually had the strongest hurricane that's ever been recorded in us history it was a name to it was the Labor Day hurricane Nineteen thirty five\nClock in with tops who said wins a lamp all hundred and eighty five miles per hour\nThe second one\nWas hurricane care Nineteen sixty two top with one Seventy five\nThen you have a two way tie for the third strongest hurricane at the time of land fall hurricane Camille Nineteen sixty nine a buck sixty five yeah Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two and one sixty five as well be fifth strongest hurricane\nAt the time the landfall recorded us history what's called the ... hurricane of Nineteen twenty eight that's another one deals with Lake Okeechobee here in\nSouth central Florida if you will a hundred and sixty miles an hour tops the state of wind so where does Michael Rank with wins that a hundred and fifty five miles per hour at the time of landfall this six strongest hurricane and recorded us history that big of a deal\nCertainly prayers go out to the folks\nImpacted direct to line their one of the other things so much for two and we heard the death toll earlier today Lebanon twelve and a lot of concerns that number's going to rise one thing in particular like in the in Florida we do off in a really good job of minimizing death\nThe time of impact of a hurricane but often will see a bunch of people that will go out there and and make mistakes after hurricane they'll end up dying that's been four to track record historically really easy by the way when you're hot you're tired you don't have power to go do something silly\nThat sometimes it just didn't include step it in water bottle or something with a downed power lines I kind of thing happens in the case of what we are taking a look at though with the with hurricane Michael\nWhat we don't know how many people were actually in those homes Mexico Mexico beach and uh let's pray that folks did get out and that we're going to have a a death told the rise is considerably\nTomorrow and over the weekend this one was bad bad news for sure\nAll right and the end on a lighter note I ah\nCouldn't help but to but they go actually the first time I remember hearing the name Kanye West and it was a when I was doing radio in Savannah\nDuring the Iraq War the folks you saw in a Baghdad or toppling the statues of Saddam Hussein heroes among heroes those are the third if the third Infantry Division third id at Fort Stewart just outside of savannah\nJust amazing people and outside of the tourists that come to savannah it's a major military town everybody is either friends or family was somebody serve it and back then somebody who was overseas\nSo when we have the Iraq War going on it was important with all the major updates to get the information out to all of our radio stations we happen to have a a urban station a rap station there was a young rapper they are in the afternoon\nAnd uh he was playing in in ... is from Atlanta and so he's got a big deal in Georgia he was just starting to become a big deal I think nationally about that time anyway I'm supposed to be going in there to do this major update on the third Infantry Division and the Iraq War\nAnd I go in there and this young rapper is doing his thing and he's all worked up and then he is coming over to me out of a Kanye West dog\nAnd he couldn't remember my name and he went it's it's it's Whitey with the news and I became Whitey with the news\nAnd [laughter] I managed to hold it together long enough to give the the update but after that we kind of turned it into a thing and for ... for mainly couple of years that was in Savannah he would end up helping me with culture and so I Would do things like ah you know learn how to to speak the language\nI'd just be a ... and stuff you know that those were the types of things that I was doing in in in Kanye West was at the forefront of my organized education\n[laughter] anyway I digress a it has been a couple of weeks for short run the gamut all situation or gun yet and the oval

line of credit is it worth having or should I avoid it well a line of credit is an approved alone that you take out only when you would want to or you could get pre approved and have a\nLien against your house for a certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit\n[noise] um and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically a show or is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that\nWe tried to take it the other way we went through to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one one once you get ready first mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of debt because when you don't have any payment you know what you have money\nAnd that three thousand dollar spent on that is more important than than the mutual fund so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise]\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago I Mike how are you\nI'm great Dave it's an honor to speak with you\nYou too sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward they can protect retirement and we're using the excess our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our gross take all of our dilemma is when we have an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that and I ... that we already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from August coloration so when we save the thicker than we're able to save a lot for a mortgage coloration so is it okay to do that or him recommend saving the twenty four\nPercent now the the mandatory amount that you're putting in are you ... are you vested in that is that uh uh you're choosing an investment for that or is a pension\nThat the answer no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nCorrect guy I probably would split the difference because I don't like\nThe pinch and we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be\nYou don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly\nRun state and now we're better than all those guys [laughter] oh yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we Canada's before then that means we need to put it in ten percent right\nYou got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood as I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension and Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and just round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it was a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so I'm\nI'm you know go do it that that's what that's what I Would do a backing off a

deserve welcome\nWhat are you guys live where I Am glad you out of Washington which is just south of Seattle\nOkay very cool well good to have you guys and the young folks you brought with you the ... of their names and I just\nWe got there and who is eight and Harper who's seven\nAll right good looking family very cool and all the way across the United states here to Nashville through your debt free scream\nYou bet I love it how much will be paid off right about six nine thousand good for you and how long did that take close to nine months wow that's ... range of income right about a hundred and fifty thousand what are you guys do for a living so I Am in charge of management sales for Wells Fargo\nAnd I'm I'm a full time stay at home mom that during that process either as a um how can catch\nOkay very good and what kind of debt was the sixty nine thousand dollars\nA couple of cars and a little bit of student loan left\nCool did you sell any cars or did you just pay them off\nNo we just stayed them off in the car got us into the travel\nOkay very cool but nine months ago some kind of a switch lip because men you went all after it you went game own hair this is a pretty serious numbers wild on tell me the story what got you started\nSo probably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car\nNeeding right I'm going out and we decided to bearing for ... yeah the emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we wanted and probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we didn't brand new\nAnd it was the end where just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills even though we can pay it no problem that was just we didn't want to any more um we one we're more\nSet up for the future and that was just going to be in the way for the future mhm so we just we won ... intensity near term so ...\nSo how did you end up where in the process to connect with us\nSo it I'm a huge following them pod cast a lot of time on the road and always listen to and it's like I said we can do this you know ... we've got this no problem so we started doing that at the same time it always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church ration center and so we uh\nGot that started right about the time we started we got everything in line to start at a few in January at our church and we did that and so it was kind of who started it and then as we ... we were learning for the first time was the mentors and now we're on a second session and loving it\nWow well thanks for leading the class yeah very cool well there's nothing like leading to make you do it I mean that's ... you can attend and may be kinda slough off right but are not hardly it's very difficult to do that but it's almost impossible to lead it and not be game on\nExactly and I think that just kind of stems from what drew me to it because they believe in modeling all the eight years and now if I was going to model what I wanted my children have in the future I had to model at my house\nYou know my daughter ritual cruise always says that when you're teaching kids Moore's caught and taught yes the modeling thing is a big deal they're going to do what you do how many times about open my mouth and one of my parents' voice came out I mean oh my goodness you know it's ... but on the show and you're much [laughter]\nSo well done you guys very well done so when you have someone in your class and\nTheir show up for financial peace and they're not game on because they're scared and they don't think they can do this the the whole peasant kicked in yet the belief hasn't kicked in yet what do you tell them they need to do\nTo be debt free one of the things you need to do if you want to pay off sixty nine thousand dollars and nine months\nWe did not do whatever we do\nYeah and you start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell there's a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team it can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team in his own as to if you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nOne of the main things that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much [laughter]\nWell that's true but generally drew\nOkay so I I also think that they need to focus on why they're doing it and to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that\nMy reason why it might not be the exact same reason it his way but the end goal that that way in front of us is what we're both gravitating toward ...\n[noise] I I thought about and ah I'm ... I'm already starting now planning on um I'm trying to get jobs or or at least one or two jobs over the summer I worked for the sixty hours really kicked in and the gear could get off of the credit cards\nAnd you're you said you're a college professor\n... for what subject do you teach\nI teach theology and specifically for individuals with disabilities\nWow and I would guess that would also apply to athletes would it not\nNo my athletes can be disability sports but my research specifically for people who have disabilities cognitive disabilities and they have trouble getting out off the couch and exercising or being physically active not more towards a competitive fun yeah\nOkay I Would think an independent practice separate from your teaching where he worked hand\nA hand in glove with some therapy people into therapy community a would be ideal for an on going extra income and your jacket up a lot during the summer\nA in a sense you're you're a tutoring if you will your own students are but you're using your research and your expertise in your information that ought to be very valuable\nUh and that you could build a quote business consulting business working with therapists are that you come in and and you know supplement what they're doing and and move things alone so I I think you've got a real upside there on your income that's exciting stops\nWesley with us in Pensacola Hi Wesley welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThank you day by day better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so a little background my wife and I graduated college last year a completely debt free I'm and I'm looking into trying to get a separate vehicle because right now we've been driving or like you said a ... you got a a United States marine driving a few hundred thousand miles free cell thanks for that\nBut I I I drive into base but whatever I\nLive in the car payments because I told my buddy as you also this truck with only about sixty thousand dollar car and I'm like we need to talk\nAnyway so my question is I'm trying to figure out what to do next because I Want to get rid of the press they don't want to replace it with a truck and I've got a Nineteen sixty four Chevy back home um and my uncle is willing to buy your labor for me for free\nOr to get it fixed up putting you engineer for new training and all kinds of stuff it's really sweet looking shot truck\nA problem for the is that you know it's not going to be quite as reliable probably never gonna be reliable as a moderate are what the law which rod would you consider going down the road and you know stop at a couple of thousand into this truck to make it you know\nWhat you know driving around or do you you know save up and wait for a vehicle layer off\nI think the trucks a keeper and it's a project truck that you work on after you get your financial straightened out\nOkay um so I I think that previous is going to say I hate it too I'm with you but [laughter] but I think it's going to be a lot more reliable than a fixed up sixty four I've got a ... I got a Nineteen sixty that does rebuild from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ... do four but dual for barrels on it it's a beast\nOr not but it is a project car I mean they you you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere I have to be it's more of a fun thing to have in the garage and I think that's what you're sixty four is going to be some day um but if you want to sell the Prius and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car was what you would have spent\nOn the truck motor and that kinda stuff and move into a little different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a ... D move up kind of a thing then I'd be okay with that if you want to do that but um but I don't think I'd let that truck get away and I want to do the project because it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is one of those Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin Hi Josh how are you\n[noise] I'm good how are you do better than I deserve what's up\nSo I've got a question um regarding a credit card for business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here 'cause I'm looking for someone by\nUm my wife and I have never been through a few but we actually just recently paid off all of our debt as in about two and a half weeks ago great congratulations thank you um\nI work from home with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in a while and we are required basically it you pay for some of those business expenses during the trip\nThat money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to fee pays for that but we have to kind of want that money ahead of time um\nWe'd close out all of our credit cards except for the one for the business trips because we don't have money\nYou know set aside to be able to pay for these expenses\nI might have been much to the expenses run a month\nWell I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but there I mean every time I go on a business trip it's it's anywhere from a thousand two thousand dollars covering the hotel or a guy who was\nGoing to get the money back when you get the money back within thirty days\nYeah OK correct so mean we're we're paying the pain that off and and obviously we're not going to using the credit card for our own personal use is\nLee and Lee ... losing the you need to see that one time you need to ... from the one time with two thousand dollars in a separate ... new checking account that as a debit card on it and it's used only for one thing\nReimburse ... business travel and you use your money on your debit card and you pray your little company doesn't go broke and not pay you back\nA little company you're taking a big risk sure\nYours or you're the bank or for the small company that is too small to even fund their own employees travel\nThat's pretty scary at some point\nMay go belly up and you're going to be left\nBut two thousand dollar ticket in your hand that's the risk you're taking so\nLong now so the company that we go and visit they don't they don't\nPay you they pay your company and then your company pays you write right ear company ... they're going to take that money from that other company and pay their bills with it and you're going to be left out in the cold someday sure I've seen it happen I've been doing this Thirty years or seen happen a lot\nOkay so then where does or does that fit in with\nThat leaves you well known as up a creek because you're taking a risk for this little bitty company that's what I'm pointing out for you know what I Would do it all with a debit card if you want to do that that's fine but at least then you're admitting that you're taking this risk\nI Will tell you I'm going to go back to your little bitty company and say gosh I'm Out of that I don't like borrowing money I don't want to borrow money anymore if you want me to take business trips why don't you give me the money to take business trips and then when they pay you back you'll get your money back\nIt's only two thousand dollar right I don't ask\nMy people to travel here with their money I got a twenty eight year old young person this trying to feed their dogs and their kids and keep their lights on and I'm going to send them out and put airline tickets on there on them know this company here pays for their airline tickets so we pay for the rental car and we pay for their hotel and their food when they travel I don't have somebody here to travel and\nAsked them to pay for me to pay back we just pay for it we give them a debit card we give them the cash when they leave the place you're company should do that for you and you should push 'em on it because you're taking the risk otherwise but if you don't want to change the situation you need to funded with cash build a debit card do away with a credit card\nWith ads gonna make you how ... going to make your stomach because now you're realizing they're real\nThis is Dave Ramsey show\nAnd\n\nHey guys this is James child

how quickly can you pay this one off if you really lean into it like you did before\nI rarely meaning to it [laughter] any here every three\nOkay yeah I Would think you could you know\nThat sounds right and then what I Would do is I Would build up cash and I would never buy anything else again so what I Would ask you to talk about tonight turn off the television and sit down at the kitchen table tonight looked at each other and go okay do we want to sacrifice really deeply out of our lifestyle\nAnd make a hundred and thirty thousand a year we got for paid for rentals but we want to act like we're broke people\nAnd pour it all on to this rental for two years is this rental worst that to us so we can knock this out really really fast and then never do it again or going to pay no horn and we want to sell it\nBut I don't want to know but I don't want to keep it with NO PLAN to pay it off fast okay and then here's the other thing no more Home Depot credit cards no more sign up for dental Reynolds is the best way to do do it is to live debt free than actually live debt free\nYeah stop it yeah\nYou got to decide which way you're going to be like you got one foot on the boat one on the dock philosophically yeah\nSo um you know decide because I think you were really doing good until we got to Home Depot and then borrowed money for rental and then you kinda like lost your mind for a minute\nOr so\nThat's what it sounds like ... now you can clean it up I mean you cleaned up the Home Depot which moved over to this deal now we can clean it up by either selling it or we can lean into it for two years\nAnd I have no life and clean this thing up and is this rental wars that we love that rental that much\nI you know I don't know if you do or not you might I like real estate I might do it but I wouldn't do it again the next time you get ready to buy something at home depot pay cash for the next time you get ready to ready to buy rental you pay cash for it regardless of what you do with this rental but I Would do one of the others\nThat's what I Would do so Hi thanks for calling in sounds like you guys got a lot going on I mean you're making good money you get your

your other than\nA is there anyone in that resort area\nIf you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort is or is there a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere the kind of specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the have stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives are that are not not hurting\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort area\nThe higher end stuff\nI'm not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving\n[noise] we need to get it or we have an hour drive to work we can't can't do it anymore you know OK Kid you\nKnow on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like do we just say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices are promising a you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at\nThey're looking at it on line\nAll their workers they're not they're not clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through them and they realize where it was I walked away\nThere were not client's location Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours here for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the law you know\nBut he found a buyer square miles to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one I mean do I pick another well yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that when someone comes to look at that ... million dollar house and says gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it\nAnd that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the\nPerson that can do that this that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel them down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area and and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you're not a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't want this area and they and they don't have a central buyers and you need it it's a very unique [noise] semi rural ...\nThis is that I Ramsey show\nIdentity theft has become an

of this week one we want to have ... million okay and how long did this take\nEight months just okay you know there's a story and your range of income is it's about eight hundred grand okay my goodness gracious [noise] All right so what in the whole world this was a ... ... is our number\nShe had a if it's a it's a long time coming so we were the Joneses so um you know for a long time we had to have the new everything and the nice everything luckily for us plus for us that we had a decent income to what do you do for a little at all that\nWell I'm I'm just I'm I'm a I T cells guy\nAnd Tiffany I stay home and these two little lady awesome okay an auto um\nYeah for a long time we got caught up in that and I I listen to your show probably for about\nEight months leading up to this and you know for me is pride and ego just you know I'm too sophisticated for that that's that's for other people and um I came to realize through ah through a lot of prayer and a lot a lot of just\nListening and thinking and knowledge in reading that this was the right way for us so we sold a a lake house we saw what a beach house and um\nWe were beans and rice for eight months much to the chagrin of my family um but\nWe made it through and knocked it out and so excited\nGoodness gracious so I don't er thousand as your typical year's income\nYeah I mean I guess over the last ten years this range between eight and one point to run\nYou know obviously slaying it well done so how much of the one million and some change was the sale of the house was what the hell spring what the springs\nSo be\nDown to three thousand dollars okay\nAnd do you understand premium offset is they're using the three thousand dollar cash value to pay the premiums\nIraq\nNow that's not offset you're using your savings account instead of your checking account to buy your bring me\nTo act like I said it's not all say they're ... they're getting their dad gummed money you can count on that\nThey're taking a that ...\nYou know it's hot ... is my point he made it sound like it's three\nRight and I went back to the candidate given out policy the rates are low and you know\nI Know and when you die you know what happens is the three thousand dollars they're going to keep it now they\nAre going to keep it so how is this good idea there's no way this was a good idea so you show you do whatever you want to hunting but those policies are crap and I wouldn't keep a thirty seconds and it wouldn't have the big discussion was stupid whole life insurance agent about it either match on the line in Los Angeles Hey Matt how're you\nDoing fabulous they thank you for taking my call sure what's up\nSo um my question revolves twenty five percent rule that you use for the mortgage and my wife and I bought a home about a year ago\nAnd I'm I'm One of those finicky people where I did not include the property taxes on modern association and the\nInsurance as part of the payment to the bank I Do all of that separate way mhm so my question is is are you supposed to include the H away the property taxes and the insurance as part of your twenty five percent role in the way that you teach\nI generally just say principal interest taxes and insurance that your way no but most people as you know we're paying that as one payment and the whole point is not whether it's twenty five percent or twenty seven percent or twenty three percent there's no magic number there the point is is trying to keep people from being house\nOr okay where they got such a dead dumb payment they can't breeze and then they wonder why they're broke right\nYeah well we started here class about six months ago we actually purchased the house about a year ago and and the numbers like we we actually get a thirty year long but at a cow twenty percent of our income so\nUm we have about forty thousand less than a day off and then we are looking actually refinanced into a Fifteen year long one that\nCan ... if you've got a good interest rates you can just pay that loan like it's a Fifteen and it will pay off in Fifteen\nThat's true we have the option to do that as well\nEither either one is fine I don't know if I go to refinance cost if you have a competitive interest rate but it sounds like you're fine I mean 'cause you're you're twenty percent is in great shape for right now you got to clean up this other bad but I mean the thing I don't want to have somebody with a six thousand dollar\nIncome take home pay and in a in a four thousand dollar house payment wondering why they're broke you know have the whole\nThe whole point is big numbers here not the new show and not splitting hairs on it the er and honestly and you're splitting hairs you're being wise to ask for details there's nothing wrong with that but but I Am saying my formula of twenty five percent is not so perfect\nThat if you're at twenty five point five percent oh God you're going to you've messed up everything no no no the point is just to not be house for that's all it is it's kind of a big number philosophy in other words big chunky numbers not fun to numbers other things I Do I Do find two numbers on but that's a good clarification thanks for calling in\nJackie's in Oklahoma City Hi Jackie how are you\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up okay\nI'll just start off really quick I Am twenty seven years old I had a and a total of twenty five hundred that I or twenty five thousand a day or that's including my mortgage and\nAccess that and my question is would it be worth it to save an add on to my house for to save up and buy\nAnd so at least save up for the down or if it would be more ideal pet save that\nContinued until you can tell you ... ... every single stat and then by our dream house later on\nOkay I'm a little bit confused you you you yeah I Know ... it's okay you're wanting to add on to this house or move up in house\nNo add on to this house I live in a gray area I work from home is why I Need a physical neither based\nIn one day when I have a house that you're living in worse um\nRight now it's probably worth about Seventy thousand I bought it for forty\nOkay and if it's worth Seventy now um what what size edition what'd you do how much money would you spend\nOn the addition\nI Would want to spend about twenty grand just enough to add on an extra brown just kind of kids I work with children and that's\nGood and so the homes in your neighborhood\nOn your street and then the next street over cell for what price range\nThey sell for about a between seven eight ten Ninety on the Upper East side of my neighbor had just because it's a really small street has pretty nice houses I mean they're they're they're pretty darn nice and like my ... my part is a\nIs there somebody looking for a house that's worth Ninety thousand dollars it wouldn't be unusual for them to be on your street\nRight but you wouldn't want you want to come on your street to look for a hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nRight okay so don't put more than twenty into it cause Seventy plus twenties Ninety and in order to be able to get your money back out you don't want to over build the neighborhood okay right so yeah and yes we're going to pay cash for the addition and what's your household income\nUh it's about five thousand and my mortgage is about four hundred dollars\nYou know and your mortgage an old you're dead is only twenty five thousand right right yeah and ... are and how much of that is mortgage and how much of that other debt\nA there is only three thousand in the day and then there's twenty two and a mortgage\nOkay and you're making like Seventy thousand dollars a year right household income alright well and so how quickly could you come up with forty five thousand dollars to be dead free and have the twenty to do the ... well I I I\nCan't do math myself but um I Know that we plan on eliminating the access that within less excellent yeah and then we're going to kick off and start paying about falling out plus I'm an extra fall now between the lowest my\nEggs if it takes two years from today for you to be dead\nFree and you have the addition done and you've paid cash for the addition is that okay\nUm well I mean that's where I'm kind of ... I just I Want to do with that I just started\nWatching it takes two years from today and you are dead for it's not a trick question is it okay with you if we if you have the addition completed and paid cash for and you're a hundred percent debt free and it's two years from today is that an okay plan\nI think so because I I honestly lover I live good yeah I think you can do that because that's too that's twenty two thousand dollars a year out of Seventy thousand and you paid off\nEverything house and everything and you pay cash for your addition you ought to be able to do all of that within two years so I think you've got a great plan I Would become a friend that I Would say about but I had on the couch and do more than twenty thousand a trivia contractor Bijan\nEverything down and you know what you're getting into that boat so this hour that I've Ramsey show in the book and we will be back with you before you know in the meantime remember\nThere's only one way to financial peace in that storm daily with the prince of peace and crises\nCan\nSay it's Kelly ... we have a Seventeen when the bank at the force of download\nPodcast or the year thanks to all of you for helping a friend the way [noise]\n\nWe use the phrase part of a teacher to describe our real estate ... because we only endorsed agents who care more about helping their clients that are earning a commission\nBut you don't have to take my word for it here's what Paul one of our listeners from Boise had to say about is a yellow be part of a teacher is the perfect description for Matthew the E. L. P. I used to sell my home\nHe helped me through the frustrations of working with an uncooperative bank and addressed all of my concerns in a respectful and compassionate manner they display great integrity and did what he promised when he promised he would do it is positive attitude and infectious spirit\nYou would be a renter was an option to purchase the house for the loan balance for a number of years until you get your other debts paid off now much of the dead of you've got\nA got fifty four thousand last I'm thinking\nOkay right\nOkay so she moves out you move in and run it you sell your house oh how much where you're much equity we get out of your house\nMaybe go out and not very much at all\nOkay stomach celebrate the baby ... baby step to a little bit he ... the payments not too high that doesn't bother me a when you ... what's the ... you have any idea what the interest rate is on the loan\nOn my first year right refinanced about on two years ago and I would imagine that it's not very high\nYou know it's reasonable so it so it's reasonable to assume you could get a mortgage that was a very similar rate and payment when you get ready to purchase it after you get out of baby step to and get your emergency fund on in baby step three but it's going to take you a little while to do that a little bit longer because you're eight hundred bucks it's ten thousand dollars a year or more to live there\nRight [noise]\nWell I don't know if I Would do it uh just because of emotions but this is not a bad thing you're\nJust a renter here's your worst case scenario you're a renter you've sold your house you're renting your mother in law's house and you realize you can't afford it and so then your mother in law will do what she would have done if you say no now and she will sell the house and you have to move\nBecause if you say no now she needs to just sell the house right\n... thank God so you could try it and say no later no harm no foul okay\nBut you don't have to be ... you don't want to sign a contract me obligated as we're going to go into Iran try it we're going to rent it for the payment and we won a written contract that we're renting it for the payment is their brothers and sisters anywhere\nUm there is a brother\nIn and get them by going to be pissed off about the fact you're getting all this equity given to you\nKnow you sure\nAs far as I understand it now and\nYeah I think we're all having coffee in one big pollen talking about this this is how families end up not speaking to each other generationally okay so yeah we're all going to talk about it and we're going to do this in writing I Want you to lease it with an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance\nOkay\nLease it for the payment with an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance and then just like your rent or somewhere else and you decided you couldn't stay than she would just sell it then and that's no different to her selling it now accept it may have gone up a little bit in value and she might get a little more money out of it\n\nYeah it doesn't hurt to give this a try the only thing it hurts is eight hundred bucks a month more rent but it's if there's if this is a place you see yourself living for many many many years like the rest of your life maybe I'm probably given Iran at this and partly because of the emotion here emotions okay\nPersonal finances personal\nAnd that doesn't mean it's situational e ethical or that the truth changes it just means you look at it and you go to them that item you know that the car sitting in the driveway I rebuilt it from the time I was Thirteen to the time I was Nineteen when my dad and he died two years later I'm not selling that car\nThat car sitting in the driveway I bought a three weeks ago when I was stupid and smoking crack when I was about the car I'm selling that car\nThere's a difference in the in both of them are car both of them are sitting in the driveway both of them are transaction that needs to occur\nBut we're going to factor in you know that there's something real uh about the connectivity to the item and it's a reason reasonable people would acknowledge that can activity you cannot do personal finance without it also being personally\nThat's why people don't get out of that we don't get mad enough and you've got to get mad and getting mad this person was
