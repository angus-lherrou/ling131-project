the Democrat media complex\nAnd he hooked up with Matt Drudge and worked with Matt Drudge on the Drudge Report until he started his own Web sites and what is now you know as Breitbart News and along

L. super duper pooper scooper or whatever then cancel all that crap but I'm Talking about water\nAnd the lights and gas to eat okay\nNow I don't really give a rip whether you can see Downton Abbey or not but I Am more concerned about you having lots of water on and gas to heat if it's gas heat okay so you pay your basic necessities food and utilities you make enough to do that and get current on them right now\nNumber three shelter now you pay your rent\nDoesn't matter if you pay your rent and you can't sleep there because there is no heat so you got to put it in the black guy so [noise]\nSo that means you need to write a check today and pay off your car and a credit card and cut up your stupid credit card [laughter] okay okay now your debt free right okay yeah okay and that was foreign to\n... so six thousand so I'm Down to twenty four thousand right yeah okay and your land is paid off and it's worth sixty uh about Fifteen\nAbout fifty and uh we need sixty so you need ten thousand that's where you're getting your twenty percent I see what you're doing okay uh well we're going put fourteen thousand in the emergency fund okay so now you have an emergency phony what ten thousand with the land you get a construction alone with the takeout\nOn a permanent takeout and your budget cannot exceed or a three hundred thousand dollar value that does not mean a house that you spend three hundred thousand on my couch okay the value of the total package can't be more than three hundred\nDoes that make sense huh so that means you're building up two hundred and forty thousand dollar house maximum\nOkay\nBecause the packages were three hundred and that gives you the twenty percent down maybe if you spend three hundred on the house\nNow you're at three sixty and you don't have twenty percent down anymore huh OK you see how that works\nSo you're giving trucks and loan that is tied to your new mortgage that is your final mortgage good called your permanent mortgage that's the mortgage that takes out your construction and so you're construction lender will require a take out letter\nWhere your form or your permanent mortgages already approved sometimes you can just package all that together and with increasing interest rates are probably would package it altogether checked Churchill mortgage they can probably help you with that and you can join lock in your interest rate on your permanent mortgage\nBecause he's a mortgage record Roger ticking up and a good idea to lock 'em in when you can by the way if you haven't ... and you got a higher interest rate loans folks this would be the time to call Joe Joe mortgage a it is taking up\nAnd I would lock in rates if you're in the middle of a deal right now walk your rights in\nAnd I probably would lock 'em in like twenty minutes ago like four days ago with legitimate period but we are in a rising interest rate environment nothing to panic about but it is going up\nAnd so you might as well take advantage of the lowest possible right you can get your hands on for refinanced were for buying or in her case for building and um\nThat's by locking in current rage 'cause I don't think you're going to see rage come back down dramatically\nUm you know in in in the foreseeable future in the next say six to twelve much they're probably going to go up and so given that environment um you don't have to be an economist to figure this out it's fairly easy to look at the trends\nUm then then I'm going to walk everything in as fast as I can get in touch with Churchill mortgage today and get this done Barbara is weather's barbers in Salt Lake City Hi Barbara how are you\nHey babe during gray area there are better than I deserve what's up\nSo we are a month and a half away from a and gotten a baby step too good and um yeah you know I don't want to leave that moment that we had kept going toward ... and and going into a baby step three there's like a few of\n'em that are happening so we want to defeat the baby three ... my husband is also wanting to go back into school she had a bachelors they get a better paying job that would be going to be step three\nOkay but that's my question we also want to family but we need them to like pay the fine because we want to cash for that\nYou have a baby on the way you will build up a baby fun no need to do it\n\nOkay to build up the emergency fund or\nMerges you finish first for you do anything and then you start doing other life goals I wouldn't worry about saving for a baby you don't really need to save a bunch of money for a baby\nUm if you got injury and they've got health insurance you know and\nYou should have health insurance and um you know you've got your emergency fund and blood and you know you'll be able to budget the diapers and believe me your work it out um but yeah you don't really need an extra baby savings account unless you just want to save up enough to cover whatever normal labor and delivery is out of pocket\nYeah that would be a it would be around a I think we pay like Fifteen hundred dollars toward yeah labor and delivery\nNo matter how that's easy enough to do during that's easy enough to do during an on much okay yeah so you could just do that whenever that happens and whenever\nBabies on the way you decide well run there were saving for that and and then you know anything you want to do that to an upgrade them move on whatever comes after the emergency fund 'cause it's not an emergency him going back to school not emergency this Fifteen hundred for the baby's not even an emergency you can cover it\nIt's a luxury to have that as extra savings or maybe came on the way writes\nIt maybe got here before you had to say you'll be All right\nOkay yeah you know that they're not curve balls are things that happened after baby step three\nLike thanks for the call appreciate your joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five cliff is with us in Chapel Hill

that contract that we've been talking the recommended a USPA loan and you're not a fan of\nAbsolutely not no I Would never do your do you\nKnow it's a it's a subsidized loan and if you ever sell the house or go to refinance alone at any point you're going to pay back all the subsidy and in some\nYou know really trapped in these things and they're nasty bad no I never would do a USDA long I have to have had more problems with that loan working with people that are in trouble than any other loan I've dealt with\nWow so wow now ... as far as how much how you can afford and we always say I'm you know put your down payment whatever that is the end of the formula rights and then the loan amount on a Fifteen year\nFixed rate loan which today's about five percent interest loan amount on a Fifteen year fixed rate loan is no more the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay\nAnd in that put you right where you want to be some like you've done some really good stuff open now I mean you can really do it I mean you you've you've gotten out of debt you build your emergency fund you're doing really smart things so yeah I just get you a ... the least expensive\nAlone between F.

I'll be able to pay off in Ninety Days after\nThat my question is I've been looking into refinancing in my house because I have an F ha and so I have\nPM I and I when I Do the math like the six

see that she just doubling then now okay why\nI haven't got school yet okay and I'm a single miner fighter and yeah you you need the money more than you need that car don't you yeah yeah\nI in the cars going down in value quick show yeah Charlotte pay off your debt but your emergency fund in place and get you an inexpensive car that you pay cash for probably in the five thousand dollar range okay\nMaybe seven or something like that there's something reliable and you can get lots of car for five to seven thousand dollars right now\nIn your debt free and you got a good emergency fund and then put you in a much better position but as a rule of thumb cars are the largest thing that we all by that goes down in value anything on wheels or motors for that matter if it's got wheeler motor\nIt's going down about you and when you have all of that stuff I had it together you don't want too much of your life financially too much of the math on the wrong way\nAnd you get when you have more than half your annual income tied up and things going down in value then that makes it real tough to prosper in your case you're going to change your income by going to school and things you

[noise]\nHello thanks for taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nYeah ... ... mortgage pay off the question for you um are are currently have a mortgage thirty year mortgage I'm back on many balance of three hundred and fifty thousand [laughter] and I am wondering if\nI should use money after ... ... a savings account I'm Becky ... my emergency account to paid us off or junk junk on it at a at a time or how have the money I guess I'm just having trouble ...\nAlready up with ... with the whole you know time value of money just you know put you know what what I can make you know ... what's your what's your house actually we're probably about six hundred thousand\nBased on your concern about time value of money why do you not oh six hundred thousand on it\nI'm chunk Dexter on it why yeah\nThat's right I actually got some contrary to your ... your money problem\nYou're yep\nShouldn't consistent okay so here's what's going on\nRight you you have um some good information but it's incomplete\n'em and show that in that cause you left with a a a primitive analysis and let me walk you through that right [noise] 'cause I used to think exactly the same way so I don't know where your brain is [laughter] yeah okay so it gives you obviously have a good intellect on especially on financial thanks so\nYour your concern is if I can borrow money at three four or five percent and I can reinvest isn't good mutual fund at ten ten eleven twelve percent and might not making that spread why would I ever\nYou know miss out on that spread and um you know I've got the money invested now it's making me ten twelve whatever it's making me not the day but it's making me that overall and why would I you know lose that spread and uh I had to really wrestle that down because that's how I was trained in the financial world obviously with a finance degree\nAnd then I had to start looking at didn't want to start looking at stuff through the lens of the borrower is slave to the lender and there's no good mentions of debt and scripture and I'm going okay either God's stupid or and I've got something figured out he doesn't know about or there's something I don't understand\nAnd so um what I figured out was was that that formula that we just used\nTen percent over four percent ... percent spread leaves out risk\nAnd in a sophisticated uh investment analysis you adjust for risk\nMeaning I Would never compare a growth in income mutual fund apples to apples was an aggressive growth stocks mutual fund the rest of gross stock mutual fund might have an average annual return of twenty twenty percent the other one might have an average and overturn of twelve percent\nBut the risk ratio is completely different risk profile in those two funds is completely different agreed\nAgreed okay so what you would do is you would adjust and in in that world you can actually use a thing called a beta with an inverse formula and we'll get an all that crap but they should go you can say because one is more risky than the other we mathematically adjusted for risk to be able to compare them apples to apples\nAnd that's the proper way to do an analysis between those two funds but no one applies that concept that that level of sophistication to this debt analysis that says Tom value of money and I could use this money to make more than I'm making now so ah but what I have found is is when I Do pay off my house\nI I don't know which risk neutralizes a lot of those the difference between the foreign the ten percent\nIt takes away most of that spread when you when you you know when you factor interest 'cause we're there is risk when your mortgage now it's not a lot of risk 'cause you've got the money in the bank today to pay it off but er an investment by it off but there is rich\nIn show or you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of foreclosures her own home with a mortgage there is rich\nAnd so I'm getting rid of that\nWill have found is it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula\nBecause when you don't have a mortgage you start making different decisions with your career\nYou start making different purchase decisions you start having different levels of enjoyment with your money your relationship with your spouse charge to have a different depths because there's a a level of security in your overall life that there wasn't before and those things are really hard to put on paper so\nWhat I have figured out is I'm going to live a hundred percent debt free\nMore people buy poor people buy lottery tickets or governmental brushing you they're giving you fall show when you're on somebody's got to win you know you're not going to win stupid you're just going to be poor but you bought the ticket you know it's a tax on poor people and people that can't do math\nThat's what it is stupid\nOh it's entertainment is never entertaining to lose money unless you're sick\nI mean you think it's entertaining to lose money\nI was an entertaining if you do that just throw hundred dollar bills out your car window on the way to work at being entertaining come on watch the rearview mirror and see what happens to be back there I mean you know something in our people break\nThe banner training right [laughter] so you know seriously now so there are things that happen to people that caused them to be in poverty and we're not mad at anybody in poverty but they only variables you can control out of the three possible reasons someone's in poverty you're born into it\n\nYou are oh pressed by others\nOr\nYour choices are stupid\nAre the three things that caused me to be poor cause you to be poor\nAnd the only one of those three variables you can control as you your choices you can't control what other people do you can't control what you were born into\n... spoke to us in a while back and leadership event when around her leadership summit and she was talking about growing up in segregated a working class the poor neighborhood and she said her parents kept telling her her whole time growing up and she's freaking secretary of state okay\nSo brilliant highly educated woman fabulous communicator\nI think we can all say she kind of made it okay but she came out of that neighborhood she wasn't born into and obviously she was a woman obviously she's African\nAmerican so a couple of strikes right there right now but she said mom and dad told me they didn't tell me about the victim they taught me it doesn't matter where you're from it matters where you're going\nOh doesn't matter where you're from matters where you're going and so I don't know where he started most of us didn't start with a silver spoon\nOr your privilege okay I'll take your privilege whatever ... just I don't know what your privileges but I you know I've never known anybody that had ... their life perfectly easy and with no obstacles\nThere ain't that much privilege out there yeah some people start further ahead than others I get that but I Can't control that I can only control my response you can only control your response and it's your decision it doesn't matter where you are coming from what matters is where you are going love that quote\n\nHard work brings profit talk leads to poverty\n\nI don't get mad at me God's said that\nHard work brings a profit me or talk leads to poverty\n...\nDoesn't matter where you're coming from what matters is where you're going I Know you got a tough\nI Know that sometimes people don't treat you write because of the way you look or the way you think are your accent or you're a man or you're a woman or your bald or you're not or you're from the south or you're a poor white trash or your uh your races got experiences\nRacism or sexism or age is a more some kind of an is we all got an Islam some of them are worse than others whether everybody's got an Islam\nI mean I I Am ... destined to not be successful at me tell you all know that there has never been a bald president of the United states since television\n\nGerald Ford was not elected the president he became the president when Nixon resigned he was ball\nIs not been a bald president elected since Eisenhower Kennedy was the first product of television look it up I have a ...\nIt's they stacked against me I Can't make it I'm not going to be successful everybody's got an is um some of them are worse than others that one's fairly easy to overcome you can get a little to pay I could put a little rug on my head get me a little raccoon had to do something else right but everybody's got an some dumb thing\nEverybody's got something that's holding you back\n\nAnd yet dreams don't work unless you do all work brings a profit but ... only the poverty so you can sit around and suck your some and talk about your Islam or you can get with a baby you can start planning something on the ground to stuff she'll grow when you plan on the ground\nThat's the way this works there has never been in the

week top TV stream our radio\nThe rams news radio seven forty seven to twelve buddy am double duty chaos [noise]\nAnd a little off your shoes\nBill is with us Hi how are you Hi Dave I'm good how are you doing\nSo I live here in Nashville I'm originally from Kansas\nThough will welcome thank you and your ear to do that for ... yes I Am Lovett much will be paid off I paid off sixty thousand or how long the district it took me about three years okay and your range of income during that time\nI started out at fifty thousand and then I'm In the mid seventies I picked up a second job towards the end of my baby step to\nSell oh God what are you there for a living I'm an accountant I'm a CPA goal which sucking job\nSo I kind of just at a part time thing at the YMCA didn't earn a lot but it kept me out of trouble it kept me out of the stores you rubble target get in trouble yeah target gets\nMe in trouble [laughter] oh buck I Would draw yeah small or what kind of that was the sixty thousand it was all student loans or what's your degree in\nSo all accounting I got my undergrad and master's degree\nIn accounting degree which obviously such a re should be some actual actual excellent show up at three years ago when he got out of school\nYes so I graduated and and you know when you graduate they require that you do exit counseling with your financial aid and as terrible as it sounds I didn't really know what that final number was going to be so I was kind of just doing my exit counseling\nHoping for the best and I saw how much I owed and it was terrifying\nBecause I knew what my starting salary was going to be and I owed more than my one year's salary\nAnd so I saw that and I sold my monthly payments and then I saw all these different payment plans and you know I'm an accounting so I knew the interest was going to add up quickly now and yeah it was just it was very scary but I knew about the baby steps so I just decided that's the route I was going to take poker show ... registered for him\nSo I actually listen to the Dave Ramsey show when I was like in junior high and high school age and\nYour brain that will kind of\nUm so my dad is a farmer in Kansas fan in the summertime I Would drive tractor and combine and all you have out in the fields is the radio and I I didn't even have a cell phone back then and so um you know I Would listen to FM radio and you learn quickly that they play the same songs over and over again\nSo then I learned about a man and I could switch to a and listening to talk radio so um you know I listen to us in in the morning and then I switched to the Dave Ramsey show from one to for a nice little three hour break and listening to talk radio and then switch back to that and so it was just a nice nice little break in the day\nI have a strange movie version though combine yes which is in our house yup tuning in the radio ... out here ah getting getting some ah oh we got picture of it I guess it was that we yes\nMy dad's a wheat farmer also yeah we would drive combine and cut the wheat and you know after that we'd have to work the feel\nYounger she drove back home by yourself\nI Would probably say like twelve or Thirteen million something like that yeah I have two older sisters and they did the same thing so yeah\nYou learn a lot of work do you have to grow up on a formula or not or yes are you are not a drop early [laughter] very cool All right so this was drilled in your head come over counting you get the degree you look up go Oh yes oh maybe step so I got her ... from the radio then what happened\nAnd uh well I just jumped right into it I so I went to Kansas State university I moved to Kansas City so it took me a couple of months to get established but then\nI jumped right in and I started paying off my debt and then I kind of hit a little bit of a bump in the road about a year into the process I was in a motorcycle accident and so I had to hit pause on the baby steps for about six to eight months and I just paid the minimum then and then I picked it back up and was able to pay everything off but\nYou know I'm so thankful that I was working your plan because I mean I probably wouldn't have had an emergency fund in place and that was\nSo important that I had that it was so helpful to me and made the terrible situation that I was in a so much more manageable so I'm just so grateful that I follow the plan and had that set aside you know it's very important\nTo many vehicles in the store called ... I had no remote [laughter] exactly good for you yeah so how does it feel now that you did this it feels amazing it's it's the best feeling in the world how old are you I'm twenty eight twenty\nAnother one of these rockstar millennials on all the time very well done very cool so um you talk to your dad and your mom you were doing all this stuff\nYes I did I talked about the plan constantly I was probably annoying throughout the process just talking about Dave Ramsey [laughter] but yes I've everyone kind of been in on the loop job who is your biggest cheerleader [noise]\nProbably my sisters I have two older sisters and they are also working the plan and they're working on paying off their student loans right now so now I'm like they see me pay them off and you know there'll be next so you know we kind of true to each other on throughout the process", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Savannah", "day": "11"}
