here's the problem I I heard one I'm struggling with you you haven't obviously on the beliefs of le fabulous income I mean crazy wonderful income but I Do not tell people to borrow money to buy businesses\nAnd I'm not going to tell you to borrow money to buy this I think you can save up the money and a year and I think it'd be just didn't you know negotiate with this guy put together a deal and\nEven if you um took it over ran it for a year and I had an option to buy put a hundred thousand dollars that down as your option to buy the practice and then clothes on the practice in one year in ... and clothes on the real estate the next year and pay cash for it and that's how I Would do it if I were in your shoes um\nI Do not borrow money mark and I do not tell people on the show to borrow money for business purchases\nUm I don't believe in it I think it gets you into problems and I'm a you know if this guy wants to sell this ... this practice to you that show and they'll have to sell it if I were negotiating the deal\nBut I mean certainly you can do what you want to do I think that practice um you know I suspect it's going to even add more to your income and then in the third year of this discussion you can probably pay off your house I didn't ask what your mortgage balance was but um\nI don't go into debt to buy to do business\nWith his business has too much risk with it and even dental practice is too much risk with them especially when you're completely changing the format of what you're doing in that you're picking up a whole second location and practice management comes into play them\nAnd so there's risk here there's a real risk here\nI'm so I'm paying cash for it or I'm not buying it and that's how I Would go about it a good question I don't know what you'll do\nAre you certainly got a lot of income and that that covers a lot multitude of sins but that's how I Would do it thanks for the call open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five uh Melissa is on Facebook and Dave Ramsey a Facebook dot com slash they ... what exactly does it mean if\nThe term insurance is Twenty years I'm forty three should I go for longer or shorter term\nWell that means that policy will not change for Twenty years\nIt's called twenty year level term and you don't have the same premium and the same amount of coverage for Twenty years after Twenty years the premium will go up dramatically um or you can go have another medical examined by a new policy that will not be\nGo up nearly as much as that one would go up now the question is how long do you need life insurance\nIf you've got a six year old and a twelve year old in Twenty years you'll have a twenty six year old and a thirty two year old hopefully they're gone\nThat's the idea we train them to leave and come back with grandbabies that's their job okay that's the ...\nProcess here this is how life works so kids are grown and gone Twenty years from now you would be a hundred percent that free because we never tell you to take out more than a Fifteen year fixed rate mortgage\nAnd Twenty years from now if you were doing the baby steps that we teach you be putting I've been putting Fifteen Percent of your household income away for Twenty years which would probably make you well in excess of a millionaire\nDepending on what your household income\nSo let's just say you have seven hundred thousand dollars on a paid for house and no kids at home\nYou die I think your husband could struggle through\nRivers that he does you could probably struggle through so hundreds of hours no kids who

'cause your age and nice commission his own life and this is the day Ramsey show oh\nAsked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide\nFor their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace those stay at home parent

what to do with ourselves now hard cash we've always had you know the nice thing about following your plan there's always one step at a time and you always have a goal that you're working on and now that we're like done we don't really know what to do\nNext [laughter] shows ...\nAbout all you can count on it oh well done you know\nWas it for you it's really awesome a it's a long time coming it's a lot of planning but now it's just you see one Bill Bill and then another bill go another bill go into more power come back one more open another most normal isn't it feels really good\nCool what do you teach a law oh good okay so a law professor and empty ... not bad\nTip for a long way to go it was a lot of work to get to where we are a bit and uh I think you know coming out of medical school it's um\nYou you have this big lump of money that you owe and I remember getting statements in the mail from the loan company and I would just kind of open them and put them and put him to the side because it's so overwhelming you know and um I I was nervous about having\nTo make an Eighteen hundred to two thousand dollar payment every month for ten years and then end up paying almost double what I'd a borrowed ...\nUm and it's basically like paying off a mortgage so um we were\nWe actually had a great I'm attending physician that during my fourth year med school actually sat us down and said\nYou know we're we're going to talk about money and we were thinking oh easy and it teaches about billing or how to run a practice and he's like no some day you're going to make a lot of money\nAnd you need to know what to do with it so you don't end up like me and my sixties and I can't retire because I because I have that still while um and so he's he's the one that I heard your name from and got the total money make or a book and read that and\nI'm probably was another year or two before I really started the program 'cause\nBeing in med school and not having any income living off loans it's kinda hard to figure out how you're going to pay out that while you're taking out ... um and then Alan and I met and we were engaged and\nWe want it to start or mirrors off rights or we want it to sort of gotten the same page for ... or ... or what have you with a sort of what our future was ...\nSo how Allen actually had a when we met he had already paid off all his school loans and had a lot of the evenings and I'm like hey you want to get married I've got a hundred and fifty five thousand\nAnd that you know I don't think I really don't see doing that\nI'm On a minute ago yeah yeah\nAnd our church I'm at the time was offering it for you and so I'd like to go to this class because I'm terrified and I don't know what to do and\nI'm so we did that in that was in two thousand twelve where she did that while we were engaged and so we got married August twenty twelve and so to this day you know before we got married we had our budget ready to go on the spreadsheet ... from the nerd and uh\n[laughter] to this day we could tell you every penny we've spent since the day when I got married so that's been that's been an interesting journey but definitely a blessing\nSo here's the thing we know about putting miles on a car and you know this is the more miles you put on the car the more you destroy its value correct\nCorrect\nAnd so if I'm going to travel um or for instance people who travel for a living people road warriors I call them they you know there there have to travel for work all the time I'm In that case you want to drive in that case you want to drive the least expensive vehicle that will get the job done because you're destroying whatever you drive\nI mean you might want to grab a hundred thousand dollar car you it's going to be worth nothing by the time you've finished traveling\nAnd show 'em unless you've just got millions of dollars you can afford to lose a hundred grand but but you know most people don't have that so basically what we're saying is you're going to take the Seventeen thousand our vehicle and you're going to cause it to drop in value faster than anything else what's your household income\nUm I make about eighty thousand okay you're single ... single bachelor right to renting a small little okay All right so it's I'm always hanging out you have any debt a just a car that's ... ...\nUm eleven thousand okay All right\nWell there's nothing you know I'm hearing here this crazy as long as you realize that you know the Seventeen thousand dollar car might be worth um you're going to lose a few thousand dollars extra on it just because you're going to travel in it okay\nAnd as long as you're willing to do that with the kind of money you make you should be okay let's get the car paid off as soon as possible so your preferences keep it in drive it is that right\nUm I probably could keep it from five or six years yeah but my friends and coworkers or whatever the fake Detroit and betrayed it you're crazy to keep it to trade it in for what um last night on I I was sitting around the brand new BMW for forty uh-huh exiled falling in love with\nRon well that'd be easy to fall in love with that but the but that's even more expensive so we're going to destroy even more expensive car if you want to travel and that right\nYeah and to upgrade to a brand new one you know that would be twenty percent less\nWell number one they're in day out and you don't have the money to do that so that's ludicrous we wouldn't do it on that basis alone but\nThe idea that you're going to travel in it no you don't want to you know you don't want to upgrade and destroying more expensive cars about how you show if you if you're going to travel you need to run the wheels offer something there's not going to cost you as much\nSo we don't upgrade in order to lose more money when we don't have any money that that doesn't make sense at all so whoever your friends are I mean they're they're encouraging you to do stupidity but I've had friends that have encouraged me to do to ... I didn't have to do it though uh Brian's with us in Bakersfield, California hey Brian how are you\nBetter than I did in our day how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nOkay they so far I found you at the beginning of this year I impulse to and purchased a ridiculous car [laughter]\nAnd and as soon as I found you I was like crap off what'd you bought we bought a two thousand fans came off the fix with all the bells and whistles\nSo we eat yeah well not for ... 'cause my pocket hurts yeah well I guess but I mean the cars great now okay oh yeah so what what do you owe on a similar thing we'll thirty five thousand mhm okay and what's your house\nAnd I'm here will be making sixty sixty five maybe touching Seventy depending on my over time oh yeah there's just argued on you know so and I'm next year I'll be getting into a Fifteen Percent right plus another ... percent right down the road yeah I'm\nSo here's my ... I'm calling to see if you what if you're OK with it is a memo I finally agreed to let it go\nGood and sell it good it's worth Twenty one thousand oh God yeah she ... down into it or die that bad yeah and I thought that it only took like three months good lord so Twenty one guy on trade in\nYes well I mean you know twenty three on private sale\nSomething that's not enough to spread on ... so you're saying this car went from thirty five thousand uh twenty three thousand and one year\nActually technically over forty thousand two thirty five thousand I I also canceled the warranty on it\nBecause we had to extending warranty yeah and then we found out that it's funny how when you pay off vehicle or you reached ... miles to all of a sudden a it starts to fail on you and do our chief counsel a few or did it\nThe cars one are old and I almost a year old yeah All right\nOh yeah when you get rid of this thing for so many reasons so so what's your plan\nUpon as me and my wife you're looking around and we saw some four thousand five thousand dollar cars I'm I could save up that money and I already have it by next income refund\nBut what I was thinking is because our monthly payment for the hub throughout the whole month and it's like eight hundred dollars so because I also have stood among and assuming payments like one sixty eight but almost done with that we have like six thousand dollars left over\nSo what it what it might just go ahead and sell this car mhm bottled a difference and I didn't vote for the guy who are on the car that showing for like four or five thousand dollars\nAnd just make payments off on this for like a hundred bucks and the monthly payment will go down to four hundred dollars to making the mess\nMhm yeah I mean to be okay with them yeah sure but I I I'm not sure I understood how your financing the your second car ... one of the uh the five thousand dollar car that you're buying how are you financing it\nOh just go ahead just like you know just like you're going to go buy a car for a little down payment on it oh okay I Know where the you know what I mean\nYou know that's fine if you can just get a regular car loan on it that's fine let's do that because we're still reducing your debt by half right\nAnd um by doing this and then you can concentrate on getting that carpet off and then getting the whole that you've dug with this other car which is absolutely horrendous it's a great car I'm surprised that thing just drop that foreign value\nI'm sure you got your numbers right on that because I I mean I [noise] the cars are horrible as far as going down in value I get it I I'm I'm a car guy but they and they go down in value rapidly but that one is like a black hole for money on or something like that is incredible\nWhat a horrible horrible\nCar on holding his values so check out and make sure your number your numbers are a little high on terms of lost money I think you may be over the last as much I'm hoping you have a lot of so much as you think you've lost\nSo let's dig into that a little bit further than you do not want to sell it to a dealer at wholesale you want to sell it private sales it should be in this situation about a five thousand are different\nIn other words you should be able get five or more out of it shown a profit show than you would for a dealer on something that expensive I'm shy really check those numbers I'm not sure you've got correct stuff there but wow what a dad gum kicking the teeth man you got hammered amazing\nAnd good luck with it but yes I Would get out of it for sure it's too much car it's a mess it's going down in value it's breaking I mean there's nothing good of a story thanks for the call\nSo that puts this hour of the day Ramsey show in the books thanks for hanging out with is America's James Childs is our producer ... is our associate producer and phone screener I'm Dave Ramsey are hosting\nAnd we'll be back\n[noise]\n\nAnd then\nGuy is James child producer of the day randomly show I'm excited to announce that we're now in theory on six hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you Saturday Randy dot com slash shows\n\n\nDid you know there are more than two million real estate agents in this country two million\nWhen all you want to do is buy or sell a house you don't have time to sift through ads on line or email twenty different people to find a few agents you want to interview our real estate EL peas have years of experience and are the top agents and their markets in fact\nWe recommend less than one percent of the agents in the country that is why many of our listeners have success with any lp\nRichard in Mississippi did and this is what he had to say there are so many real estate agents today that it is refreshing to find someone like your E.

Tennessee Hi Josh how are you\nMaking your taking my call precursor speak with you too sir how can I help [noise]\nWell I have ... about a foil on a show about a nine thousand two hundred and thirty six thousand two hundred thirty six dollars from school debt\nI'm from an advanced degree and just kind of really looking at the best advice on how to pay that off I Know that you're not a fan of the public service loan forgiveness program and I'm\nJust wondering maybe about income driven plan where the government might pay it free fan of unpaid interest monthly Oregon ... go ahead and getting down to it knocked out as quick as you can\nNow the third one is the best one you'll be out of debt faster that way what your income dropped\nAfter taxes that bring home about fifty four thousand change\nWhat do you do for a living\nI'm a nurse practitioner at a nonprofit hospitals you\nKnow kind of like um saint Jude ... okay cool All right actually wonderful wonderful place um the um well I don't know whether you\nCan pick up extra time there or not but with a ... nurse practitioner you're very marketable and you can pick up other time you can work as much as you want to work as much as you're able to work logistically [noise]\nUm and I would get out and and I would just try to pay this off in about two years and be done with it instead a monkey and around with some kind of a government plan here's the problem with the public service loan forgiveness program\nIt isn't happening last year thirty to thirty thousand people but in an application for their loans to be forgiven Ninety ... Ninety ... Ninety six people were approved so I mean that's that's those are the odds you want you know I Want I Want to wait\n... years only to find out that the government's scam me basically\nSo I'm not I think you just work like a crazy man pick up as many hours as you can pick up the great news is you're nursing I mean it's just a wonderful career paths because you can add hours or add you know\nPick up some he our time or whatever you need to do I don't know on the short term when you make sixty thousand dollars extra money so fast it's on blue like in two years you can just make sixty thousand extra\nYou know I'm again you'll be work I don't watch but it just be done with this and just you know I'm\nA I'm I'm a band aid off fast guy I mean just get it done I take the pain and get it done and then you can get on with the rest of your life and you've got you got a good again a great career track so you're going to be in really good shape\nThank you Josh what you're doing saint Jude good stuff All right Tim is uh weather's in Binghamton New York Hi Jim how are you\nA Dave how're you doing better than I deserve how can I help\n[noise] oh well I have a quick question I'm about three hundred dollars in debt among or twenty five and my car is about to go but I'm trying to office shave and pay off the debt as quick as possible so my question is is right now I'm putting seven percent of my paycheck\nIn my four one K. shed doing all that down to about one to two percent and just start throwing money at this loan right now I'm doing about a hundred dollars a week at it ... just to get it knocked out as fast as possible but I ... was your opinion should also thank you for so much\nI you know you've got to videos and lifting your show you've helped me avoid a lot of bad decisions like buying a crappy house and going into like a twenty thousand dollar Carlo shower I really appreciate that\nCool good so well thank you um what do you make what your income\n[noise] I Do about twenty three thousand dollars after taxes but that's not including the overtime\nYou know what are you there I'm a welder okay she'd get a lotta overtime or for the most part can you get more Oh absolutely you know\nA temporary basis you could really load up your overtime and clean up the ... very very quickly and then save up and get you know kiss your car shave every emergency funding to save up and move up and car and cash\nThat would be my learning to do now that would be my first three goals with what are her didn't then and only then what are restart\nMuscle ... so what I'm saying is temporarily not forever but maybe for a year or maybe even to completely stop your four oh one K. to become completely debt free builds your emergency fund us three to six months of expenses and then\nOnce you've done that and save up and pay cash for a car and that's maybe step three in the rebate and then you moved to babysit for and restart your four O. one K. and then you start putting Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement but at that point you don't have any pain mentioned you're driving a paid for decent car\nAnd these are all a really good place for you to be ... that's the direction\nIt tells you to move towards show yeah while we have people working these baby steps Tim unless your own maybe support were telling you to temporarily temporarily temporarily stop your four O. one K. investing Andrew is with us in Dallas texas I Andrew how are you\nI'm doing well how are you doing better than I deserve what's up oh not a whole lot of reasons for the new job we're making a good amount of money and I'm very uh ... stadium more wanted us to get more\nMhm okay um what are you out of debt\nI'm going to get us are going to get off the little one yard should\nDo you have an emergency fund of three to six months of expense for\nA good twenty grand she currently\nOkay so what would you be saving for them\nAnd that's the whole thing minute John ... wrote about five weeks of buying a house kind of a question right now mhm so I guess the question what should be saving for said he couldn't be more in the rough fire right or race or something I mean you look for torture future would you recommend\nWell you're at what we call baby step for she'd be starting to put Fifteen Percent of your income away for retirement or beyond that if you wanted to start piling some money into an investment to buy a home later that wouldn't be a bad thing but today it doesn't sound like you're on the market for home\nYeah yeah so it sounds like him to get your retirement savings started and a Fifteen Percent of your income going into that take your gross income before taxes\nPoint one five as Fifteen Percent\nAnd then get that started in your four one K. do it in a Roth if you can match or if you can if you can't uh than let's do we'll go to Ross on your own to a Roth IRA on your own and let's make sure you're getting that money set aside if you'll say Fifteen Percent of your income throughout your whole life into good mutual funds in a retirement plan you'll be a millionaire usually a multi millionaire actually\nAnd um so we we can just at least get that started and then beyond that if you want to save towards a house or\nEven invest some money in a side mutual fund that's not a retirement account to use for a house later you could do that well let's get Fifteen Percent started and now you're going to fit it in the right direction so\nGood question man thank you for joining us we're appreciate your hanging out that puts this hour that I've Ramsey

weight guy least Sarah Fox news fast moving Michael ... storm leaving the war is behind in North Carolina I Know\nEnsure that you're never back again okay so I I Want to revisit part of the conversation 'cause I'm trying to get into your brain and see how you made the decisions to do this so you use the money that was going to be used for you to have a place to stay in a in a a ... in an apartment to fix your car\nSo instead of being Carlos you chose home wash\nWell so what had occurred without and park so a very small town\nI wasn't able to find work because it was in the summer so everybody was already very over now so I've for me to find work I had to have a vehicle to try it down to a Korea he'll be able to secure somewhere up and working two shots at the moment mhm\nEvent that I Would have used the money to get a ... um I wouldn't have had shot a patient to get to work I guess\nThey don't ... know buses drive from a a cheap bus ticket wouldn't have gotten you to the pleasure that you're living now um and ...\nWell being was an early like where the like I don't like the emotionally and\nSo part of how you got here I guess my point is not necessarily jobs or even financial is just bad decision making\nAnd I'm not I'm not trying to shame though yet I'm just trying to say I want to analyze how you got here so we never get here again and that's what I'm trying to do with you OK\nI'm at and and so what we've got to do is say OK when in doubt we have a place to live so I'm the second thing that keeps coming up is there's no jobs there's no jobs are no jobs I don't know anything about British Columbia in terms of elder jobs\nNow I have a new jobs right now but they suck\nHas a server yeah yeah I mean\nYou're making any money and so I Know that if you were in Nashville would I Would tell you to do is take your last fifty dollars and go buy a leaf blower rich people are afraid leaves you know I mean you can you can find ... you can go create work right I mean I have a young men knock on her door where the pressure washer and he's\n... he's pressure washing driveways and paying for his tuition to go to college and so there's work to be done that pays a whole lot more than ten hours a week as a server with bad tips in your situation\nAnd so I got to do something to create income here and it's probably some kind of self employed\nUnpleasant thing that you do for a little while but that page really good\nI mean for a short term all heavy clean out septic tanks with a toothbrush or if it pays good to get you some money okay 'cause right now in the short term you need money right and that's what we're doing and I've done all those kinds of things on their own septic tank will do rash but I've done everything else I got\nA ... you know cut grass and hauled trash away and shoveled stuff and I've done all that kind of stuff and and honestly you can get people doing that kinda stuff for them\nTo pay you better it was and then you can make six dollars an hour or somewhere you know uh and so what happens is is your spend a lot of your effort\nTrying to analyze the local job economy and get jobs suck\nAnd I'm trying to think of how we can get you working a lot like your car running yeah my car driving and you deliver pizzas there\nUm\nI think I could probably make more money serving like I Want I mean I again I don't know\nBritish Columbia but everywhere else you deliver pizzas or we'll do that like five six seven nights a week you can make two thousand dollars a month and we can get you in an apartment\nYeah yeah ... ... and that is I Am ... I Can't get it to pay five hundred dollars and kind of a modest here sure how much should cost\nOkay then you need to go investigate that and get the cheapest possible place you can with six roommates splitting the six ways and create your own little hostile there and let's let's let's get off the street and then let's take another step up and then let's take another step up and then it's like another step up\nBut this is all about how fast and how much income you can create by just going crazy I Want you work and like all the time you know anything else to do\nFor a start you out then I think you can begin to turn it around\nYou call me back if I can help you more but that's what I'm hearing listening to [noise] I think he got potential do this is that I've Ramsey show\nOne question
