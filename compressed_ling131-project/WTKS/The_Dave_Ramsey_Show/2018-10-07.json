I'm a strong advocate of getting rid of the department of education living mistakes take care of education the way we're supposed to be Jimmy Carter but the department of education employees and to me it's a waste of fifty some odd billion dollars a year as far as giving credit for somebody going in protesting\nI Would I Would love to see where that actually happened and I would love to follow up on that you know what school it was\nA I forgot the name that many years ago and I forget to watch anyway\nNo way listening Seventy still young you got plenty of time so do you favor or send me an email at ... dot com\nAnd if you remember where that school was I'd love to follow up on it\nIf it's a state sponsored taxpayer subsidized school there's no way they should be doing something like that private school they've got different rules but that would be ridiculous to do to give somebody a benefit for protesting on one side of an issue over the other let me go to line three Patricia is in Florida Hi Patricia what's going on\nHi how are you I'm living the dream what's happening I'm I like to think for the whole health care and gone and what that movie coming out yes oh come up with an F ... weeks ago I called they can crack the gaming crap\n... nice\nAnd I think that pullout dying ... hit me by ed they should apologize capping on family and for the public\nAnd I think if they don't like it here and they can now get blown out of it hit me poor now having somebody up on an airline so glad you can in the ... yeah\nI have family up in the Arab guy got Bush for what you can

still are still coming in and help me clean and\nThat ... that race they made they haven't gotten to where we come back again the evil horrible people and in fact by someone in my car\nWhich Russia appreciate what you're willing to deport him too but but and and don't hold your breath because none of those people are gonna be apologizing in fact a Dianne Feinstein just friday just yesterday said are you just went down a litany of why Brett Kavanaugh should not be the guy and it had very little to do\nInterestingly very little to do with the allegations that she leaked or her office leaked about Christine Blasey Ford very little to do with that her\nComplaint was that he showed drew interrupting her interrupting other members and his anger she showed me the governor the temperament to be on the court that's being able to do with no\nHe doesn't have the temperament to be on the court\nOh by the way members on the left on that committee interrupted Chuck Grassley the Republicans nonstop\nI guess they have the temperament to be on the Senate Judiciary committee and to be senators but he doesn't have the temperament to be on the court when he was honestly emotionally reacting to people ... family like crap\nPeople calling him a gang rapist he had every right to react the way that he did\nThey die and Feinstein as all of this new she knows that she is let me go back to it and say Hi to being in Tampa gambled on on high\nHey Joe thank you all for taking my call but I bet that's all I just\nWant to make a comment and that I Want to get a question of it by you and all I Know\nAll right comments is simple oh I think we've had it I think it's been years that we've had a\nBeyond that his rule they want to pick your president they want to make the whole people are tired of the mass contradictions convoluted logic the same political correctness pseudo wives pretension it's\nAll over there and the tide is turning and thank God for that and I got a great president was the one who started this and put us on the threshold IRA\nI'm thankful for that you know um and I and I heard your last call and your great for doing what you Simon and still semi gods and hope is a princess than Donald Trump junior for your listeners should be taking the mantle from his father he should be running someday cause that\nHe's fired definitely\nOh man I mean that great family it's not just hey nothing but crucifixion waiting liberal paid back at what they do to that family grateful just by everything that they do is\nJust absolutely disgraceful and you know what is getting to know where you can throw the kitchen sink at him and for all with how will let them you can throw a refrigerator random it doesn't matter you know when\nHe's going to and they're still going right down I don't I don't have much time what's the question\nWhat do you think now we do that house and yeah you think that what what would the impeachment process the like and what what ground so we have or on the show because that's all they talk about\nThe the left will say it's obstruction of justice if they should win the house and they will in fact the way you go in with\nTheir with their job for the bill claims bill claimed that he tried to do call me to not investigate the women to be more\nBill so that he probably ... of justice to stop calling me know you look you and I agree he didn't do that but those are the grounds they'll say obstruction of justice I think they will in fact impeach him and I think the Senate would would uh would find him not guilty so nothing would happen\nBut that's the whole thing and it's a great question because the\nThe voters of his country after ... if you vote for Democrats to November one month from today if you vote for Democrats you're voting for

no nine justices on the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in the same thing as to being burned by the Senate President Trump claiming victory tonight at a political rally in Topeka, Kansas he will\nEven in talking to my daughter about what's going on in the school I mean uh in the news just recently in fact I was looking at the paper today and there's this thing these jewel each cigarette type things that seemed to be a growing concern in the schools now\nI Know that most of my daughter's friends and people that I Know that she associates with aren't doing that kind of thing but it sounds like there's a lot more that activity that I'm aware of so there are things that are going on in their world related to their\nHealth and their wellbeing that are hard to track as a parent you just us don't necessarily see and so those are some of the concerns that I have to know how do they deal with it you know growing up and and the world that they're living in\nRight but what's nice is the fact that you have fostered her relationship with both of your daughters to where they feel like they can come talk to you\nThey feel that they can share their day with you they can they feel that they can talk to you openly and and that's important for any parent when they become a parent to actually foster within their children foster communicating\nSee them as an extension of you see them as a gift see them as an opportunity for you to actually learn more about yourself now in our society so many parents get so caught up with the wanting to support their children\nAnd they have to work hard and they have to go to work and they have odd hours in the you know then they come home and they have to try to make the home or a suitable place because both husbands and wives are working and it's like okay well\nThen they end up eating fast food and this that and the other thing and\nAt the end of the day I remember growing up I mean I got three brothers and my mom was the first one to one to working in a of of all the people that I knew\nBecause this is where the heck back in the early Nineteen seventies and so\nMy mom's works all day then she comes home she's got a kitchen full of dirty dishes and she's got to clean those dishes then she's got to make dinner and then she's got to clean up after dinner and all of these things and it's like you know what [noise]\nNever gave mom enough credit for the hard work that she did and when we got old enough uh she basically put her foot down and said I didn't put the dishes that are in the sink I was at work all day [noise] make sure the kitchen is clean if you want me to make dinner and if it's not clean you're going to feel morass\nI think that happened twice growing up and after the second time I had learned to make sure that there are no dirty dishes in the same when mom comes home\nAnd just being able to help out with all of that but\nSitting around the dinner table as a family and openly communicating about what your day is like and how you feel and what you're dealing with and if I might being bullied at school and my you know as somebody taxing me weird messages as somebody sexting me weird messages is is is\nIs one of my friends going through a difficult circumstance and I want to help them but I don't have the resources and which to know where they live in variance and know how to deal with them and and\nHave conversations along those lines I ate dinner with my whole family every night there wasn't a night where I didn't\nBecause that's the kind of family that we had and nowadays priorities are a little bit different and it's like okay well you got a kitten this sport and another kid that's in this for so mom takes one that is for it and that takes one or the other sport and it's like okay well\nThey're eating out and we're eating out and it's like but we're not eating together because the schedules and it's just a little bit off and it's like well\nHow do we how do we coordinate all that there are a lot of concerns\nThere are a lot of concerns and and being able to be there and have those conversations with your kids and you know I I Know that my my kids are able to tell me stories about what's happening and uh you know one day my daughter was telling me that she was ... some strange man was kind of following your in his car\nAnd we live in a pretty safe community but you know you never know who's where and she told me what she did she was on the phone and she she took a circuitous path that she was able to sort of outmaneuvered the guy\nAnd get away and I you know I complimented or on her ability to do it and and keep her smarts and then how about just being self aware and being aware and I said you know the other thing you can do is you got your phone there you can always call nine one one and he was talking to them or nine one one I can tell them\nThe license ... like you're talking to my dad no I'm actually talking to the police but you don't know you reporting you right now exactly and if there's no trouble and if it's an innocent thing in the you know the police will get it no no but uh [noise] you know those are the kinds of things that were\nWere you know that maybe people don't take that directly related to health but of course anything that you do to protect yourself is going to relate to her house because ultimately anything that happens you physically is going to affect your health correct [laughter]\nSo I mean I Know you don't recommend vaccinations and but a lot of the schools are requiring them and we're seeing a resurgence of some of these old childhood diseases like scooping cough and measles and what is your perspective on avoiding some of these potentially devastating diseases\nWell and this is going to be controversial but I'm going to put it out there anyway avoid vaccines avoid crap food and especially avoid sugar\nAnd when you have an opportunity assuming that you're doing the first three go have your kids play with children who get sick a lot\nLeft them develop a natural immunity the way God intended\nNot the poor way we've been led to believe will help us avoid getting sick by going and getting vaccines it's interesting there was an article that came out a couple of weeks ago from A. R. P. about the vaccines that are adults should be getting if they're in the senior class and I saw that article and I was just like\nTotally knocked off kilter by because now I I could qualify to be in AARP member I don't choose to be involved with a A R P but you know I I always thought that they were there to protect that\nAged person foster them and give them information to be a resource for how you can be successful at that age and and maybe give you discounts and and and honor the fact that you've lived that long et cetera and now here they are telling you of all these different vaccines that you as a\n... in AARP members should go out and get so I read the article and I scrutinized all of it and then I went on the CDC and I went on the the statistical a health information Web sites and I looked at\nWhat the truth was about\nThe number of cases of people who die of these diseases et cetera and they they they hype stuff up but it's just not accurate\nIt's not that it's not true but\nIt really isn't true because when they're saying that all these people die every year from not getting this particular vaccine and then you go look at the health this test extent it's you know it's if not hundreds of thousands of people\nOkay we're talking a handful of people and I would say that they died of whatever they died of related to the thing that quote they have a vaccine for why because they want to promote the vaccine they want to make sure that they're going to link the two together and going to say well this has caused because this\nThis person was foolish and they didn't run out and get their flu vaccine and therefore they died of complications of the flu no they died of nutritional deficiencies that caused them to have a weak immune system because of the way that they live their life and now the pathogen had an ability to overrun the body and set up the body being able to resist the pathogen\nSo you're suggesting that if you are taking care of your nutritional health that you could do a lot to avoid any of these diseases that we're talking about\nRight and as a kid who doesn't have an ... a fully developed immune system and they come in with their innate immunity which is the immune system that you build born with that you inherited from your mom assuming that she's healthy and if she's got crap health and you're going to have a crappy immune system thanks mom\nYou know you didn't do a good enough job of taking care of yourself so now I get to deal with the effects of that and you get punished for it because now you're the one who always has to take me to the doctor all the time why because you weren't healthy while you were pregnant with me kind of thing\nSo I as an aside from that it's like okay if you have the innate immunity that I just mentioned but you also have a thing called the choir the immune system which you acquire over time based upon exposure ... okay\nNow if you have a a family where you have helicopter parents that are always hovering above their kids and never let anything happened and they\nThey put pads around them and they keep their world so safe because they don't want anything ever happened to their children there's pluses and minuses to that though the plus part is is that you keep them safe the minus part is is to set him up for failure because now they don't know how to do things and one of those things they don't know how to do\nIs fight off infection because they're never exposed to it\nYeah I mean it's one of the challenges that you have is that it's if you don't allow your children to have the challenges that they have in the course of their life and try to protect them from everything that went challenges happen and they do happen to all of us said what will happen they will happen to all of us are then their ability to handle the challenges is that much less right\nAnd smart mother's back when I was a kid I used to do something unique whoever was the ...\nFirst kid in the school that got chicken pox what did the mothers do they wanted to go hang out with a kid that had chicken pox so that their kids could get chicken pox and then it would be done and over with and then they could go about their business and not worry about that being an issue and then they could go hang out with their grandparents because\nNow they've already had the chicken pox and they don't have to worry about activating the shingles virus within the the senior citizens and\nYou know it's like okay so\nOne of the one of the vaccines that they talked about in this way or the article was specifically ... right now and it's like okay I looked at the statistics of that and I'm just like okay\nThey're making it out to be worse than it is now I've had shingles mark it's not pleasant but there's a way to address it that doesn't involve putting a toxic chemical in the back end of your immune system in an effort to try to get your body to develop immunity from it okay that's a non natural way of developing immunity\nThe natural way of developing immunities through exposure and if you've had chicken pox then you have the basis for having shingles if you lead a proper life with proper nutrition and you get proper sleep and exercise and drink enough water and lead a balanced life you won't get shingles shingles as a byproduct of being too stressed\nCan come to a free healthcare class go to my website which is a wealth of information and the labor of love I Want to get you the answer that you require I Want to be the one that answers your question and most importantly I Want to be the one that answers your question why this is the way that it is\nSo we can address it at its source and get rid of the problem permanently instead of suffering quietly with a health concern for the rest of your life and\nToday we've been talking about kids health and it all starts when we're kids mark doesn't it\nDoesn't and we tighten the first section a about about having kids exposed to things that might in some cases might get them sick but ultimately will build their immune system I was wondering what about pets is that is that a good way to help expose kids to the various kinds of pathogens they need to develop the immune system to\nIt ... it just depends upon is yours an indoor pet or does it go outside if it's indoors all day then it's not it itself isn't getting exposed to a lot of stuff therefore it\nMay not transfer any of that to you but in an outdoor pet that goes outside and\nGets in the garbage isn't and goes out and and you know villages the land so to speak and and comes back into that house and and your ... I don't know yet wrestle with your your pet areas sleep with your pet I wouldn't recommend sleeping with pets but you know people do that shouldn't be allowed in the bedroom\nThat's my own personal belief system because what are we talking about we're talking about\nPets transferring sicknesses to humans and what's interesting is we're seeing pets develop human diseases why because we're feeding them crap food and my wife's a canine behaviorists so of course we very very high quality food as far as what we feed our pets\nUm but at the end of the day most of what's out there available for our pets is is manmade processed chemical type stuff and uh you feed\nThe dog so that kinda stuff service thinking develop human diseases and that's what we're actually seeing\nNow you know it's one of the things that that seems to be a concern for people now is what they're calling the superbugs that don't respond antibiotics and do some real damage is there a way that this kind of way of exposing kids can help you prevent\n... you know becoming a victim of one of these superbugs\nWhat what you gotta understand mark is super bugs you know they they do they they've got their big red s on their chest and they got their big blue Cape and they fly through and they sleep\nBuildings in single bound and all of that kind of stuff and they are super bugs yeah\nNo they're not going to the gym they're not working out they're not from a different planet than to have superior strength and can withstand all of our a defense mechanisms et cetera and they they're they're striving it's not because they're getting stronger just because we're getting weaker mark\nWe're getting weaker because the high consumption of sugar and we did a sugar show last week I Believe it was yeah well we got to understand is is that when we've disrupted our digestive system which directly feeds our immune system I think we did the immune show a couple of weeks ago when when you follow along with that line of thinking\nYou now become more open to these pathogens and your body's defense mechanism isn't strong enough so that when you add in the medical treatment the medical treatment isn't as effective why because the body that it's being given to isn't very effective and therefore the results isn't going to be effective\nIs not that the bugs are going to the gym and working out and taking steroids and getting stronger and being elevated to the the classification of superbug no we're getting weaker because of what we do to ourselves because of the refining of our foods because of\nThe ... the high in a number of different ways that we disrupt our digestive system and and due to the lack of exposure in developing an immune system causes our immune systems that have weaknesses and have holes and then these things can get in and they don't respond to traditional treatment the way that we would expect them to\nAs speaking of of weakness and strength I mean one of the things that happens with kids as they tend to to eventually get into different kinds of athletics into sports and things like that and it's possible for them to sustain injuries so what's the best way to support your child during those type of activities were injuries are possible\nPut them in an age appropriate activity and given the appropriate training given the appropriate equipment and make sure that they're not being put in compromise positions because you want them to be the next I don't know ah picking the of the super super star athlete and you you know you think your kid has that potential\nYour kid may have that potential I think all kids have that potential the question is is do they have an interest in it for your kid has a natural affinity towards\nPlaying a particular sport foster that affinity but also foster around a a well balanced lifestyle to wear their life doesn't become completely about that because truth be told it's one in a million that your kid is going to be the next I don't know\nPick a sports star Michael Jordan what I mean Gretzky I mean those are from my age I'm you know the bond James right and and at at the end of the day is it possible that they could be the one in a million yes it is possible\nBut don't push 'em into it don't force them into it if they have a natural inclination toward that or a desire to do it\nThat will happen but if you see them if you are more interested in them participating in that sport than you are I mean than they are then\nThat's that's a problem because a lot of times kids will defer to what their parents want as they're developing their own sense of self and their own self confidence they look to their parents for approval and if you're putting a lot of pressure on your kid to participate in a sport\nYou know I remember that the the summer that my dad was just like okay what sport it you're going to play this fall and I was hadn't even really\nThought about it and his whole mentality was as you're not going to sit on your ass all day at home you're you're going to participate in something and I was like okay I guess I'll look into what it is that I Want to participate in and I'll go do that why because my dad's telling me that I have to do it\nAnd and it was fine but at the end of the day we we if you really want to foster a healthy relationship with your child you need to do the kinds of stuff that you do that you you you do so Well Mark which is you take the time to be a parent\nYou take the time to take them to school you take the time to pick them up from school because you set your schedule up so that you can do that you're you're there at the big moments in their lives when they are performing or when they're you know graduating or whatever it's like you know what you're there you're you're you are an onsite parent\nYou're not a a parent that males it in and and sometimes it's it's difficult because of the parents' job takes them where it does and and they may not always be home in time to talk of the kid in order to be there for dinner or what have you when it's\nYou know we we we have to understand what's important is making money important or is raising a healthy child important\nWe got to make those those judgments and enemy now you're talking really about an emotional health of a child and and you know parenting is that's the first place where you can help a child and most will health because\nAs a parent um you can't control what their friends are saying or doing a so the only thing you can do is be an example for your children in terms of how to handle the situations that they encounter you can't protect them from everything\nAnd still within them a sense of self confidence mhm self-confidence I Believe that I can do these things because my my parents taught me that I can do these things\nAnd and be there to expand a child sense of confidence by praising them for what they do right and then\nI don't know instead of punishing them for what they do wrong sit down and see it as a as a teaching circumstance to where okay the the the outcome of this you know your your teacher sent me a report that says that this that and the other things going wrong and school what can you tell me about it and I'm not going to sit here and punish you\nI'm going to ask you tell me what your perspective is and tell me what you're having difficulty with or tell me what you don't understand\nThat causes you to act out this way and what can we do to foster solving this in an agreeable way without it becoming a punishment or without it becoming a you know deterring the child's from still being able to reach in life what's so important for children is their ability to reach for experience and we don't want to\nWe don't want to dampen that in any way shape or form by telling them know too much or telling them that they're not capable of doing that or that they they they aren't good enough to do something like that no\nFind out what your kids are are good at what they have an aptitude for and foster\nDifferent activities that helped to strengthen that within them but also keep them well rounded by giving them other things that they may not necessarily be good at that they can become better at\nSure and I think are being able to support your kids and and all the things that are doing whether they're you know at the top of the game with what they're doing or not is really not relevant to your relationship as a parent to your child right this is all about just supporting the kid doing the best job that they can do\nExactly and and that that's what being a good parent is about is is about loving and supporting and nurturing whatever gifts that child has within them to have more of that within their life\nRight right I mean and this brings this kind of the topic of a mental health because it's it's I don't mind for so many people and you know what we're seeing now is the level of violence is kind of being normalize the kind of disputes that are being normalized and\nBefore winter sets in and whether it begins to get coal it's a good idea to clean and store your window screens meet face it the battle elements all summer long so you do need to treat them gently here's how to start\nFirst of all you need to remove the screens you can't clean them while they're in the window itself and you need to put them on a flat surface like maybe your driveway now go ahead and mixed up a mile soap and water action and then you put it down with a soft bristle brush to remove the dirt and grime\nThey need to clean both sides that window screen and around the interior an ex carrier of the ... south\nAnd once you've got everything cleaned up really nice you want to rinse everything off with lukewarm water don't be too aggressive with your ... I\nKnow you need all at the window screen dry completely before replacing the window and don't even think about using ... like you said you can't be too aggressive mostly views pressure on them especially when there's when you close it's going to be bad really bad too much force so do the host on better\nGet now you can put this going back in or if you prefer you can store the green during the winter months\nWhen you do that I didn't want to keep them up right or flat don't lean against anything or put anything on top of them I always feel like if you're leaning against something you forget exactly what it is it like behind it and then you could accidentally like push something sharp through the green and then you're starting from scratch come spring\nNow you're dropping storm windows into place keep colder out once you clean those a window screens now is a good time to clean the windows as well and also the liberty to trucks and kind of get dumped up over the year\nAnd for all your windows you also want to check the exterior space between the trim and the sign to look for cracks look for gas in in ... as needed to keep the elements away will be a lot warmer and more comfortable if you reduce draft now is the right time to do in\nA lane and Delaware is on the line with a bathroom foreign question how can we help each day\nI purchased the toilet\nSo for for the oil you know so that's why we started it and it was hard for me to stay with there's now a slush 'cause I'm\nOnly I'm Upset for\nWell there's a product out this designed for him almost is very situation and it's a toilet gasket that is not made wax it's called fantasy you'll see an I.

process involved and how many I should go to or\nI think that you hit the nail on the head and that is to hire an architect because essentially you want to make sure that whatever you do this house flows and maintains a structural integrity as well as is designed integrity\nTo an architect can help you do just that selecting where to put the bathroom will be you know a a balance of compromise is trying to decide where it fits bills that's designed where the plumbing is now what it would take to get to the plumbing where it needs to be to for this\nParticular bathroom and then how best to design those rooms for your collections and then that sort of thing\nThe architect in hand with the structure in the mechanical systems once that's done then you'd consider bringing in interior designer to help laid out choose colors choose furniture and and and make it work for you visually\nWell and I think the other good thing about bringing in the architect and they may have an interior designer that they work with you can bring your own they'll be able to sort of work together to help you specify the right materials for the right areas to really is a strong partnership\nI hate out do I do I talk a chance outlook chew architects and get their ideas are like a skull whining and get that get Hank\nWhat I Would do is I Would I Would bring in one or two or maybe three architects to see the property tell them what you want to accomplish find out how they work you get a feel for them and they get a feel for you and then you make a decision based on the\nThinking meet with somebody you meet with two or three architects the times ingested\nJust get a feel for them 'cause you're going to know if you want to work with them you're going to know how well you communicate back and forth you're sort of sit by ideas you know there during that meeting and get a really good sense of how much they're understanding you and whoever you feel the most comfortable with I think it is what's going to lead you to the right to say and then you'll start drawing\nOkay um I didn't get a card for semi he is so that if this person but he wished is card says drafting and cash strapped in a shocking\nAnd you don't want to draft or [laughter] okay you want an architect you just want an architect the good quality architects of focus on that first you could take usually they'll have books that show some their past projects you can see what kind of work they do you know it's gonna be you'll figure out through a process of elimination which one you're most comfortable with and that's the person that's going to get the job but they are well worth\nThe investment because they're going to make this process easy and they're going to be you're going to be assured that that it comes on exactly as you as you plant you know if you if you go right to the contractor step there is going to squeeze us bathroom in wherever they think it fits in and says he's not going to be happy with the ... the architect or World War if their investment\nOkay great good luck with that project thanks so much for calling us at ... money pit\nAdam in Rhode Island is on the line with a leaky skylight what's going on\nI have a bay window in my bedroom skylight and for a while it started to create those brown stands on my feeling but the most part the biggest problem with there was a leak in the window so my uh my father and I went up there we put a new flashing ... on the\nUh the skylight seemed to help the problem but it did not eliminate the problem\nAnd I had a contractor friend over who took a look at it as well\nAnd he noticed that if you are on the outside\nThe bay window of the gutter where the gutter attaches to the root of it and the opinion that there shouldn't be perhaps some like sixty eight inch gap there between where the government to the house and where the bay window starts so it's his opinion that that they might have been improperly installed\nSo it sounds like the bay window was up to high is that what you're saying so basically goes right up under the gutter\nCertainly there's certainly no separation between hum of it but there's also no separation from where the gutter meets the house either\nOr is that they wouldn't have its own roof on it or is the roof sort of built into this off at structure under the overhang\nGoes on in Iraq Luca ... is it possible that the gutter is over filling and perhaps the water's backing up through the gutter getting to soften running into the bay\nI thought that at one point um and I have gone up in check in the gutters are acquaintances\nOkay and where this is on the roof is they're sort of a long stretch a roof that goes down before this for his the skylight\nHum yeah I guess maybe ten or Fifteen feet\nSo I'm gonna give you hum a trick of the tree and this might solve it you might be in so much water against that flash against that skylight that's sort of forcing its way I Am wondering you might want to do is to try to put a divert or on the roof right above the skyline in this sees this works\nIt's real easy to do and so it's kind of nervous enough to try it but you make 'em up you take up a piece of aluminum ... in the shape of an L.\nAnd you basically attach it to the roof when you especially want to intercept a slow watered down the roof and haven't run around the scali and around the bay window to slowing the volume of water that's coming down the roof you know running full steam towards a scholar and that they window area and running around that space\nAnd we got to do is is is tax that onto the roofing singles put some silicone clock to help seal the edge and see what happens\nThey caught you got the the L Word where to look on it how do you fix the aluminum theory\nYou could you could simply nail through the shingle soccer and was like a roofing now because you're but with the court will help seal it and basically you're you're capturing that water is it's running down the roof and that sort of running right around the sky late bay window roof combination and then off to the gutter\nGr I'm willing to try\nTo look at it that much for calling us at the money that\nYou

different\nElements that really impact that color that you're going to put in in your space in your home and I we know that the number one reason that people are looking\nTo change a paint color in their room is to change the mood and the feeling the overall look and feel of of what that room as is going to be into and imagining and visualizing how that changes is going to happen can sometimes be tougher people but we try to provide as much inspiration is on the\nJob you're feeling kind of stuck you guys tend to put different colors together you assemble pallets of color and you're done there quite well especially with your way this announcement of the new color of the year it was talking about that\nThis week we actually released our new twenty Nineteen color of the year blueprint in our trend palate and we're very very excited about that we believe that this is the color that symbolizes our desire for positive energy stability represents confident we believe it's a a color that will really stand the test of time\nI mean it really is a gorgeous gorgeous color was there something specific I mean you have a blueprint and it obviously sort of the basic every major home project what was it that market for you guys but that\nOur team a color experts we we look everywhere for inspiration for a for a color palette and we look at different industries like fashion hospitality colors you know that we're finding as we're traveling around the round the world\nAnd throughout this whole journey as we're looking we just are blue everywhere with that dark blues without light\nDo we stop bold saturated blues but when we landed on blueprint we just felt it was a real sweet spot it's refined blue\nWith just amount the right amount of depth and brightness we feel you know it's a warm debt it's warmer than denim but it's softer then maybe it's very very livable and very approachable and usable and any ruin your home\nYou know the word that comes to mind when I when I look at this color or ... is comfort me just feels comfortable you got huge wanting a on your Web site at ... dot com\nForward slash twin aunts you trends as having four different

ourselves both in our it at home and out there in the world\nAnd you know what I Love it because it it's blue but it feels gray [laughter] I'm Still so much in a great moment right\nNow using that to you know the paint project and you don't know how to get started in making that the color decision which if you have to get cookbooks moving\nWell I think that the first place to start as you look at your room and you decide how you want you're thinking about how you want that room to feel and color course helps with that transformation and that re imagination and very often people are looking to coordinate a new all color was something that they already have in the room\nA piece of furniture piece of art work I'm a floor rug or something else in that room that really might help inspire the change and and they're trying to coordinate with with that so that's usually the first place that we look\nAnd again uh we have many many tools on line on their dot com that\nHelp with that journey if we have color discovery tools we have a pin to palate tools they also had paint your place and color smart that again help cure rate and narrow down the colors elections for people\nI mean are there any specific tips you get folks from there in the aisles looking at all of the paint colors watches out there is it look for an accessory that you really like bring a pattern pick something from there what do you think is really a good starting point for the people who are just terrifying\nIt's all of those things because right to everybody kind of enters it from a different place in a different point some people start with a blank canvass and just really have a mood and mine so let's say they're trying to create a calming mood\nThey might look for blues and greens are they just really want you know kind of a neutral background where everything coordinates with that you might look for Brown's in Gray's whites of course are easy option because they kind of create this light open expansive feel\nAnd we have again color collateral in the aisles that that help people do that but the number one thing\nThat we tell people remind them to do is sampled a color at home in his biggest watches you can and so there's little tester jars the eight out samples that we sell at the paint gas and those are really really key in helping people visualize what that colors and it looked like on their wall\nYeah that's so important because it's not only just applying it to the wall is watching their color throughout the day as the sun once were passes through the room and then every few hours you kind of takes on yeah we we differ you", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Savannah", "day": "07"}
