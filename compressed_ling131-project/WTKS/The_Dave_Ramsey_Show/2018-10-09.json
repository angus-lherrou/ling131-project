changed that this month and they don't start counting your rent\nOr they didn't start counting something else that we don't know that they count then your credit score will go to zero which is what we call it but they technically call it in the terminal because they have no way to determine a credit score um you know they actually sent me an email back in the day that said um\nYou know we want to

we are huge fans\nBelieve the case until something under I get home turn into millionaires the original book\nStarted everybody talking about those back in the early Nineteen nineties when I wrote my first book when financial piece came out it was a book called the millionaire next door\nBut Dr Tom Stanley changed the way everyone thought about millionaires I got to know ... a little bit a while he was living and I've gotten to know his daughter since then and I'm big fans of each of theirs and we're big fans of course of anyone who's in this millionaire space doing anything\nAnd as you guys know Chris Hogan has a million or a book coming out in January but Sarah for law is with us a Tom Standage daughter and a ... this was the first time we've ever talked on the air we stopped off the air and she has a new book coming out of the in well almost some of her dad's original research so Hi Sarah how are ya\nI'm good how are you in for having me on well\nI'm honored the new book is called the next millionaire next door in during strategies for building wealth and it it's out this week right\nHave kind of calling for making that decision though and you know the example we get out there and it rained a lot of great time to go out and look for in a car because you're not if you're in an emotional age where\nYou are better at it up and you income level that you have all that you're making as well as he can stay home and come as\nA matter of what a financial bar then you'd have an aunt in the right one\nAnd I I often hear ah we've got a ... inch personality does a career show on you know choosing a career and there's all this um ah stuff about following your passion out there\nBut you guys have you found yet again in this new set of data the idea that ate a lifestyle related freedom does not equate to less income or less wealthy it actually which to greater engagement greater will the new\n[noise] yeah you know I think that's right I think that you know understanding that against your son or your entrance let's say for your career Hackney ground it and I'm kind of reality and and I think that that's something that\nYou know a lot of people don't want to hear but trailing um if you had an accent or the art and that's really where you live your career to go out and you know you take that with the reality is I mean certain things are going to be set aside\nFor that kind of again a lot of I don't want to hear but um we can have a happy here and then they'll say well\nYou know there's a price to be paid to build wealth and it's worth the price and nobody does that accidentally they'll do it with a plan\nI lately yeah that that one of the things that ... thing over and over again and again we're talking about millionaires or this on their way to becoming there at\nThat time bent planning and and looking at your goals and monitoring what's going on in your life and not you know keeping your head and and um that that relate to building mouth as they can't be that way in court and go do it while\nWe're talking with Dr Sarah Stanley follow all of a ... in your last night about offsite correctly\nOr at the la la la la la la yeah I'd\nSay like I told me that one on there and a strong mess it up there I'm so sorry for law and a daughter of Dr Tom Stanley a comic work called the millionaire next door a lot of you've read it if you hadn't you should and you need to reach ... new book that she did combined with her dad's\nResearch project that they were working on together when he passed away the new book is called ...\nMillionaire next door it is now out\nAnd you need to read it or you know we've got a book out called a ... called everyday millionaire and let me start if you want to be a millionaire there's not one book you read all of them and you learn from every one of them there's no competition\nThat's where we answer on we've been friends with them for years we'd love that she's got a book out come in the same year that we do and we want love helping her we want you to go by this book right now it's called the next millionaire next door Sarah thank you for being with us today\nI think he's got I mean this is the day Ramsey shot [laughter]\n\n\n\nYou've heard me talk about our deep there for years and now it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that have been surprised me and chose the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity the last year yes sixteen million\nTwenty six percent of them have to borrow money from family or friends twenty two percent of them lost even more money by taking time off work\nAnd nine hundred thousand victims took out loans just opposite freaking nightmare\nThat's why the

catch\nI Would love to know a guy I'll get Jim awesome visual ... but I can get you will will get your particulars so you're here to do your debt free scrape I Am loving I'm about to be paid off thirty one thousand seven hundred dollars so bright love it\nAnd how long does this strike it took three years almost to the days since I started the financial ... very good and you're injuring come during that time above forty seven thousand two fifty thousand or what do you do 'em by day I'm tech support at trouble and expense software\nAnd by nights and weekends I work in the film industry mostly doing onset audio but other things too fun good for you very cool what kind of ... was the thirty two thousand it was mostly student loans but then also a car loan and a car repair\nLoans to judge broker show you a single guy making forty seven thousand thirty two thousand and three years which is a you know basically a thousand bucks a month give or take during that time average and that's the that's really watching what you're doing your most a casual and the whole\nThing yes it was it was very tight ... when I was a at least at the beginning stages I figured it out that um if if I budgeted everything out and all of just the basic\nIt was in food and gas and I had about forty dollars left over for months while do it was it was tied\nUp some extra jobs and that can help but you're over ... got a little bit out of film but some doesn't pay too much [laughter] okay good deal good deal so three years ago you said you started financial ... personal journey began and other than that\nI'm kind of a story well first of all my sister who's here um I did uh did your program into their debt free scream and that's where I first heard about you and I was and so I learned some of it by us most is kind of but I also we're like oh that's good enough I got it um which wasn't smart or [laughter]\nUm so then it was in twenty four teen which is when I moved sixty miles away from home just by myself doing apartment a sign a lease everything figured out everything was good and\nI had to move on the seventh of August and the sort of August my car broke down completely engine died everything is done wow and so I'm like I Need to move I Need to move now I have no way to get there in a way to get my job when I get there don't know anybody up there\nUm so I was just ran out and bought a car and I end up to that point I had been\nSmart in only buying a cash or using cash for cars but at this point I was like\nEvery breaks down in a year I'm tired of holding like Paul ... and I like I was just like that kind of looks nice I'm going to get that one [laughter] I paid too much for it I'm pretty sure and um and so\nBut of course I'd already signed a lease so that was something I hadn't taken into account right and so moved up there and about four months later my that car the engine fry broke down the exact reason that I bought a new car is what happened\nAnd so it took out a car repair alone and um because I was like I'm not going to let go this car I just got four months ago I'm going to keep it\nAnd um so yeah so replaces the engine at that point in time it was like there was I was over drafting it was it was it was bad um and because I wasn't budgeting and um I think I don't know if it was for moving gift or if it was for um\nFor a Christmas gift corny gave me a uh the box for financial peace but I was still stubborn I'm so like I put it on my dresser and I'm like I I'll probably do that I'll probably get around to sleep in the same room with a box that will be okay I just wanted to actually learn it you know by us most is\nAnd um it it didn't I didn't [laughter] so um I was still over drafting and actually it was I Believe it was April twenty Fifteen when she came up just to stay over my apartment so she could fly out of Minneapolis did your debt free scream and I'm like she knows my situation\nAnd she ... she will see that on open box as you will give me a lot of crap because she knows and I can't have that only a good sister rules are exactly [laughter] so I'm like before she gets here I'm signing up for a class and that was the motivating factor so I finally got it so it was her fault [laughter]\nRightful minimum wage to do her debt free scream you get shamed in the process that causes you to be here to do your debt free sharing Zach Zach I'll take it that work such good family stuff right there\nAnd I should say it ends up being a pretty good book into because I went out of them\nGot out of debt and this last April and um the singles at my church decided to go on this big trip to Montana\nHow old are you are on twenty four of them and how long you been married five years\nYou all had this discussion about the way your feeling about this check\nYes absolutely what he's trying to lose\nAny we uh we just need to pray about it and figure out what what's the most wise decision is\nHow much it on the check for twenty seven five will not pay off everything\nI'm not quite but we do have a five hundred and savings or we could take a I think maybe the ... of that and be done with everything\nEverything but the house yeah OK yeah good and then begin your emergency fund so who passed away\nMy grandfather okay All right\nWell there's a couple of gauges we want to do number one we want to be biblical wise which is what she was saying and pray about this and then number two we want to do something with his money that your grandfather would be sitting in heaven and see you doing this and smile oddly enough that these are actually the exact same things\nUm because when you start doing smart things with money that's going to be honoring to his memory in other words right\nAnd so paying off the debt would not make him mad as long as you had a process to never go back in and that's what bothers you a little bit so what I Want you guys to do is I Want you to go back through financial peace university\nAnd I want you to heart this money in a side savings account that is not attached in any way to an ATM card a debit card or your checking account where you can't do it without a ... to the bank\nAnd you have to physically go down there and make it hard to get to impart there for nine weeks until you go through the classes to gather you've got the one year membership I'm going to pay for it for you to go to financial piece university okay\nAnd and attributes university is a one year membership you've got nine lessons in nine weeks you've seen some of them some of them have been re done since you saw them and uh you go through those\nThen when you get done with that I think you'll know what to do and you take that money and work the baby steps but uh the problem is as you said the get out of jail free card if you don't change your behaviors and have something more than just a promise to yourself you're going to\nStraighten up then you could really cause a problem lighter um yeah and so what you want to do is proved to yourself during this nine weeks that you have changed your behaviors and when you all are looking at each other going okay we're really doing this we're not screwing around were not goofing off we're not going to issue\nWe're really going to do it no itching Dave in financial ... wise ... we're not going to ... and so that'll get you into a mess I and so you know I Would if I knew I Want to prove to myself that I'm not going to do this up\nAnd that's what I'm telling you to do\nA is so go to the non classes in nine weeks\nAnd then stay you can watch the videos and you can go on keep going you go to the legacy journey class on line\nOr you can you can get into groups on line and stay you know continue the discussion with the tribe and talking about it you've got every dollar plus connecting to your bank on line and that's there with you for a year I'm giving you every bit of that um we sell all that for a hundred and twenty nine dollars just about five hundred dollars worth of stuff though\nAnd I really really really incredible value and uh it's all a church and we want you to take care of it all we ask is is that you follow the stuff both of you plug into this and\nSome day when you're doing really good find the guy who um feels like a product and you help him out and that's all I ask you to do things for the call Megan is in Chicago Hi Megan welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I Am a newer ever forgive me for my ignorance I and I'm David stepped here we have our um housing our savings that are currently working on our we have about thirty forty thousand dollars in quit their cars\nWe do not have a mortgage we currently rent now my question as\nWe're going to have it paid off what can the next few years maybe even a year right\nNow we have a plan that we want to take our children into an RV for about two years and travel the country however we would have to finance ticket Harvey and something to tell us where we feel like kind of have to ask them to her kids are getting older I'm terribly would\nNot like to wait if possible but I just wanted to see what your advice for America to be\nA sneak dream I like having the dream that's cool very cool well I'm not going to I don't tell people to borrow money because every time I find people borrowing money I'll find broke people\nRight and um and if you borrow on something that goes down in value as fast as an RV does I'm going to find really broke people have you ever tried to sell used RV\nAnd seeing other people and most jak possible to get rid of them are they're hard to\nGet financing on and they go down in value faster than almost anything what wheels motors they are mathematically horrendous\nOr they're just a mess and so um the other the other one is a big a medium sized boat if you get a hundred million dollar boat you can get financing on it and if you get a cheap ... you can get financing on it but the middle range of boats the fifty two hundred and fifty thousand is a difficult product\nAnd on and so you just about have to have the money to just consume it and be able to afford it so what I Would tell you what's your household income\nI'm sixty thousand\nOkay I Would get myself out of debt I'd worked extra jobs and then I Would save up and pay cash for an RV that would um\nThat would suffice for the two year period of time and then if you saw what it is somewhat of a lost at least you got only me dead on it and you don't get caught in it it's not a problem it doesn't ruin your life going forward because if you take a wonder\nFor a dream like you have any financial you're going to turn it into a nightmare right it's going to cause a problem for your family 'cause I mean you put a hundred grand and an RV by the time you get home is worth fifty\nRight and you're going to be stuck in ... all that money and you know you're going to mess up your kid's college plan you're going to mess up your retirement\nI mean it it could be disastrous if you do this wrong and so what I Do save up and buy one or to look for a program where you can rent one for two years if we can do that for two years and turn it back in\nA doubt there is one they're probably a very very expensive I Know you can rent them short term for the weekend and those aren't bad deals but a two year plan is a different um\nAnd when you add all of this up it might be that you guys could stay in your you could travel in your car um or your SUV or whatever it is you own and stay in hotels cheaper by the time you out at all up\nBecause you're going to lose so much money on the transaction and again I'm not trying to ruin your dream I just don't want your dream to be a nightmare so do it with no debt you do it used to\nAnd um and do some mathematical analysis on it and you got some nights to do that while you're working to get your other debts bite off right now\nAnd then if you want to save up fifty grand and buy a three year old or a two year old hundred grand bang or something and and then it becomes more twenty five by the time you get home I'm mad at you for that that doesn't ruin your life\nBut if you if you just go write a check and finance something you're going to be in a mess kiddo and I don't want that for you I Want you to win a thanks for

okay\nNot okay at all Amy is with us in Akron, Ohio Hi Amy welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHow are you better than I deserve what's up\nWhile I had a um kind of the issues going on my um my father in law recently had a stroke and um and so he has been in a nursing home for about a month and a half ...\nUm my husband and I are on baby steps sex so we're actually thinking of looking into buying a new house\nThat might have an in law suite so we had maybe do home care at our house with him um we're just trying to figure out what would be better financially efficient half our house now which we owe about um Ninety thousand on or buy a house\nThe one that we kind of we're looking at on and so it's like um like around three hundred\nAnd what's your current homework um it's probably like one fifty\nTo move up a hundred and fifty thousand dollars yeah and you're using his moving into the father in law suite as the justification for doing that but obviously the whole house that the increase is not all about the father in law suite correct\nYeah we're going to upgrade our house within the next few years anyway what's your home income um it's about two hundred and fifty dollars a day\nOr you can afford it if you put it on a Fifteen year fixed or less All right I'd prefer to live because they don't want you every time you only get paid all start Fifteen Years over again that kind of guy each the purpose right right purpose would be to become a free so is he financially I'm obviously not able to care for himself obviously there is no other family members\nUm my husband has a brother um we're kind of a better situation I guess to to take something like that on um ...\nMy father in law does have a pretty he has a decent amount of money so he um he he could keep them in\nA nursing home for a little while until the money runs out stress for\nWell I mean you may want to shut down um you'll see capable of making decisions with the stroke\nIs yeah I think they're um mentally and physically had how much money when\nYou say he's got a fair amount of money\nUm he's probably a like a three and a thousand\nTo well I mean you could make a deal with him that if you got your half of the inheritance prior to his death that you would agree to care for him until his death and go and get your one fifty and then you go about pay cash for theirselves\nYeah okay\nAnd you know you would want to clear that with a brother as well everybody needs to be paid just as a kind of stuff this was apple off\nSo you're a real careful with it and go okay you're still going to get your buddy but we're two hours now you know and we're going to care for him and we'll take care of him a but that's a heavy commitment on your old part right and in other words if I were in your shoes the way I Would want to analyze that would be\nIf you reach a point being at home and your husband's at work and you don't want to do this care that you guys would be willing to write the check for the in home care nurse\nMhm yeah I um I think that we'd probably still need a nurse to come in\nSome of it is good that's good\nWell I mean you can decide how are you on to this but that's one way you could put some of the money together\nAnd not having a little complicated thing where he owns house to house and then you have to deal with your brother in law when he dies casino range half your house or half half of your house or some kind of crap like that I don't want to get in right that that's that's a nightmare but you can just Bob\n... and just go we make two hundred fifty thousand we can afford it\nAnd we're gonna put on Fifteen year and you know he can use this hundred and fifty to buy the in home care um however you want to do it that's the way to do it there's nothing wrong with that I Would have in my mind you know just your exit strategy is being you know if he gets really in bad shape and you have to put him in a nursing\nHome are we going to handle that\nAnd then number two we gotta get brother in law and everybody needs to be on board on this everybody's got to feel good about this man several in person meeting with ads sitting there telling everybody what he

community college\nI'm at work I went to a work [laughter]\nUm I did about like thirty hours a week for the community college and it wasn't an issue and now I transferred to a university I mean my first semester right now I'm In classes are you um you know it's a little bit harder\nAnd how much they want to share my student loan to the house she read at forty eight thousand drank and what's your household income\nFluctuates between Paco forty to sixty show I own my own business so last year we did sixty five this year we're looking at probably doing I'm probably going to bring home culture to forty two\nOkay I I don't know what you've been listening to on the show but in a twenty six years I've never told someone to do a refinance actually take care of to pay off their debt ever except to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure and you're facing neither\n... show on now I I've never told anybody do that okay and the reason is very simple you make enough money to pay this debt off in a couple of years um you've got to work like a maniac and you're gonna have to have no life\nBut then you're going to be dead free except your house and then you can work on paying off your house I'm from there and of course start working on your retirement and the other baby steps that we won't be groups but you can't borrow your way out of debt\nAnd on and if you pay their shop within two years the interest rate on this becomes mathematically irrelevant because you can also fast\nSlack you're keeping it for Thirty years it's a two year thing and and really is not forty eight thousand for two years or twenty thousand for two years because halfway through you're going to be halfway through\nAnd and so yeah you guys need to get on a budget really really tight budget very careful where Donald in\nTouch your lifestyle to nothing do everything you can all your business to increase your income because you need to clean up the student loan debt I agree with you on that part but no

a whole maybe but you don't dig out of home\nUnless you dig into China and work so no you can't you can't you can't borrow your way out of that and\nThat's the same exact situation show you got to stop that you have to break that cycle but on the sand and say well not borrowing money ever ever ever ever dishes that Iran's you show\n[noise]\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what

hundred and thirty where to go and what are you guys do for a living\nWhere ... in in the dental industry and I'm In the oil and gas industry how\nGreat very cool good for you guys what kind of that was a Seventy five kc\nIt was a combination mainly all student student debt a student loan debt and then we also had a car note that we we had one year left and we paid it off in three months [laughter]\nAll right knocked it out okay so you're going along and are paying on that and just kind of living life normal it sounds like ... and then Seventeen months ago you got an attribution averse to and that's cause you to push the pedal on down to the floor and get going so what started that how did you end up in class\nWell her uh her uncle actually was hosting a a financial peace university class and he tried to get us over to his but they were about forty five minutes from us and we decided well we'll just looking for one locally and we found one at our local parish which was a mile down the road so we couldn't say no to that and\nI I basically had to track him to class now are the true some guy whose article you're out and it's my uncle and okay got you started but then you find one close by so he's got no excuse and yet and my\nBrother and sister in law also it in the course of that kind of let it made us none of that is allowed\nTo go through the same parachute into an airline okay All right so everybody's in different places but\nThe same time ... very very cool or on the I'll be like you I'd be like you want to do [laughter] and uh so how did you talk into going\nAnd it's like you know I think I really thought we needed a third party and because all you want to talk about ways paying off our school debt by and I\nHe thought he knew how to do it but and and it's hard to hear what he had to say about it and so I thought like me to third party just to get to get them to class with me I just needed to hear\nWhat you you know speak to him a plan that you both can agree on yeah it's you know and you're\nBoth in sales and mom I been and so's my whole life and one thing about those people as we always think we're getting out earn our stupidity\nLike we just make a little more it'll be okay yep 'cause you know you'd make a little more when you're ... you know I just got to make a little more it's all I got to do in four years of my income will go up and my dad would go up if I had to change something so so Ronnie or what did she say the talked you into going\nThe one thing she just said hey we've got to get on the right page where we were both on opposite opposite ends of the spectrum ... she was a spender how's the nerd [laughter] I knew how to develop spreadsheets but I didn't really know how to go about paying this all off\n... some strategies and you know that's something you could buy into yeah it'll be on the same page being on the same page is a big deal\nWhen we first got married we we were all about buying a house and we got married and twenty sixteen ... and we're we're we're looking at houses were ready to buy and then we realize we're up to dinner eyeballs I Can't even afford it [laughter]\nIt's a shock yeah so we gotta do something to do something okay so the spreadsheet nerd who needed a strategy goes to the clash and what did you come out with Ronnie where you were how what light bulb moment did you have a ha moment where you want oh\nYou know David it's amazing when you go to this class you it's a big support group that I think everybody really needs to be a part of and\nBecause we we lived in a very high end area and it was just amazing how much did everybody had\nAnd were like wow like ... you know there's a big support group and you know this is a great way would start with the baby steps ... and we did that we had a bunch of savings saved up and we used a lot of that just Kickstarter ... intensity and it really helps how much uh we had about ten thousand and so\nThat was hard for a nerd it was it was a check out and clean up as soon as it\n\nTakes your breath away so Veronica the spender goes to clash you go to class but then you get in there and there had to be a moment where you go oh sure I like this\nWell it wasn't so much\nThat I didn't like it I just I felt like I Need it like I said strategies to help me because I I didn't want to be in that either and I just felt like there is just a huge cloud over as all the time and what was your\nQuincy Jones says be humble with your creativity and graceful with your success well\nTens of thousands of people have already

your brother in law that said that that was a guy worth one point to make\nHis opinion matters\nTo Loni is with us in Hawaii are I'm Sorry I Want to Hawaii I'll get all these out a Hi Connie how are you\nGood thank you very much for taking my call sure how can I help I'm Wondering\nWhat advice you'd have to make it in a place where the cost of housing so astronomical\nYou have to make an astronomical income right because you don't get a pass on math if you live in Hawaii California or Manhattan math is still math and so if you buy something you can't afford it'll still bankrupt you write write\nShower you know ... or so the problem and the problem is dramatic\nA for a guy like you who probably is a a a native Hawaiian and probably your grandfather and grandmother were and uh it's all you've ever known and yet the housing prices on the islands have made it were a regular working man can hardly afford to live there\nYeah it's like Silicon Valley right I mean you can't afford to you can afford to work in Silicon valley but you can't afford to live there you have to live the forty\nFive miles away an hour and a half commute to be able to afford a house their problem is you can't move that far out 'cause you have this thing called an ocean [laughter]\nYou know can't move that far out of town and it gets wet yeah but I I don't know I mean are there areas I Know why who in Maui and of course the big ... got his own issues right now but a little volcano action but the uh I Know who in Mali are outrageous or the other islands\nI think I think so I mean I think I Would probably have opposite of places\nThat you know somebody could um afford a but the problem is typically like you said it's like it\nIt's an hour and a half of your even though we're on an island and you only got to drive Fifteen or twenty miles with the worst traffic of the nation\nSo two two lane road it's a beautiful view but you get to enjoy the view yeah right\nOr the neighborhood is not you know you might not necessarily want to raise your kids are\nRight right okay so there is some options along those lines um then I you know there's not a magic answer to it what I don't want you to do and that's why I started the answer of the way I started to what I don't want to do is just give yourself permission to do something that's harmful to you\nJust because you're just because it's expensive and you throw up your hands go well just the way it is and they rooms you just didn't understand was not me it's math I mean math still a problem when your house payment is sixty percent of your take home pay because real estate's expensive\nYou're going to go bankrupt I mean you're not going to make it your kids aren't going to college are going to struggle financially you're going to struggle you can't keep that from happening and so you've got to you gotta you gotta bite the bullet into a neighborhood you don't love a commute you don't love or\nMake some other arrangements um or honestly truthfully what happens is uh are you Silicon Valley as an example of just reading an article about the other day\nThe number of people that have left\nIs absolutely amazing 'cause they just yeah and then they're having the bus they're bussing service workers in\nBecause they can't afford to live the bustle man and you know some of the ski resorts face the same thing they build housing for the workers because it's the only way they can get somebody to stay there because you can't afford to live in Aspen\nAnd work in Aspen as a as a ... you know or as a ski patrol guide right you can't afford it is to expand right and so it's the same kind of an economic issue on these micro we come economic situations but you know you cannot it's almost impossible to live on the island of Manhattan and make less than a hundred grand\nYou're right it just meant in mathematical you very tough and so you end up cross in one of the bridges and I'm ... and living out in one of the other boroughs um and in order to get your costs down enough to actually survive and live your dream of being there\nSo I'm hopefully you can find a way to you know mix in the neighborhood idea and the commute idea\nEnough to get a value that works what do you do for a living\nAnd I am a firefighter okay while as a part time on the flight attendants\nOkay cool and are you married yes what's your wife do\nRight now she pretty much stayed at home with the kids how many kids I'm too where two under two oh fun and what's your household income yeah I'm about five thousand a month a home\nOn average their town of fluctuates on my part time job kind of fluctuate depending on how much are you know work at a\nLow for a fire fighter have you got a lot of stuff coming out of your check\n'em on not really it's about I think my deductions about thirty percent well\nMhm I mean do you have other junk like insurances are something coming out of your check\n\nUm no\nI don't think well what it was a major city and so I'm just as long as you're not exactly in a rural environment here so I was just guessing I didn't know ... uh I I rented a firefighter from like a hundred all over the place so I'm\nNot at all in the heart of a captain ... which is a motion away from me to be yeah\nOr or and or are you doing are you doing three days on for offer that kind of a routine\nYeah three days every other day and then for you\nYou know I might instead of being a flight attendant might look at a part time a business on the side you might make more than that but on the flight attendants stuff\nA\nLot of firefighter guys I Know have great side hustles that they make almost as much as they do it's far off and that really fabulous I getting in construction business the painting business or something like that and they make really seriously good money but hey man I'll I'll Try to help you cannot put you guys are in the financial picture virtually the one year memberships that

million to use each month\n... millionaire our lips de France is so much more go check it out\nIf you're a business owner I Need you to listen up that you know that more than half of teens today associated stress and worry with money half\nAnd young adults are entering the workforce with no idea how money works that's not okay\nRight\nOkay so when you ... when you have a house is worth two Seventy five and you spend Fifteen more on it that's two Ninety and that's so you're likely not going to get your money out so whatever you're spending there is in a sense consumption it's like saying I Want to go on a really nice vacation which is okay you have the money\nAnd I probably would do some of that work I probably enjoy some of that money by spending it on the house [noise]\nBut the likelihood is if you told me your house was worth two thirty\nAnd uh the average house prices to fifty five and you spent ten or Fifteen on it then you would be like up to average and you would likely get your money out depending on what you spent the money on what the repairs were or the re models were I probably would do some of the work just for the fun of it you know just to enjoy the money\nBut uh but we can't do it based on the fact you're going to get it's going to increase the value of your home 'cause it's not likely to what the numbers you gave me Eric is on the line in Salt Lake City Utah Hi Eric welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave thanks for taking my call trauma what's up\nA got a question that started listening to your podcast or my dad listens to you and he's been recommended for a while that uh we start listening to you and go through financial piece of my wife and are planning to do that Tom just finally got her on board with everything\nI'm my question is to start a budget have I'm a contractor and so I get paid you know performance or or peace right um so my my paid\nChanges all the ... one month we might make a thousand women who make four thousand sir how do how do you have a budget without Dave take\nConceptually here's how you do it in the mechanically will walk through and a couple of different ways okay conceptually we just say okay what's our worst month and the next coming twelve likely it sounds like yours is five K. very like it's very very likely you're not going to be below five K. in the coming twelve agreed\nAgreed okay it might but it'd be very unusual now so we set the budget up regular on five K. we ... we have five K. coming in we're going to give every one of those dollars a name on assignment of mission and show five K. minus my categories equals zero every dollar has an assignment\nOkay on the five K. and so there you're going to take care of most of the things in your life then the things that you couldn't get on that list but you still\nPrimarily in this case is going to be want to do not need to do or it might be want to save some money it might be want to go on a trip that might be want to pay off some debt it's you know but it's not necessary for your living you can live on the five probably it's kind of gravy bonus money so to speak above five K. we make a list of\nThose things and we say are after our regular budget if we make a dollar what is the most important thing on this new list that didn't make the cut on the budget the understand\nYes sir okay and I don't care what it is you and your wife look at that and you say that's number one\nThat got you say are we made enough above five thousand to do that when you put a dollar amount decided it's four hundred and Ninety dollars okay so now we made five thousand four hundred dollars when we make the next dollar what's the next most important thing the ... this month that don't have to be for the rest of your life is just put this coming month\nAnd you put it to beside that and then a three and then a four and then you rewrite the list in order now you have a prioritized spending plan for each dollar that comes in it already is spent by prioritization above five caves that logical to you\nYes or no that's your concept the practical application is one or two things you can use your every dollar budget apt to do all of that and just change it through the month as the money comes and just go okay\nWe're going to set it up on five but as we get more money animal changed the income and will drop down in and will change the list okay and you can apply right through your every dollar budget out or if you've gotten your financial piece University of materials or you've got the total money make over book or any of the any of the books\nThat are have my based on the front I'm just about they have a budget forms in the back in the back is an ear regular income planning sheet\nThat teaches you to do what I just talked to the day\nAnd then when I just described is basically what you're Saturday morning to do list and momma momma do honey do list right momma said get it done list and what's the most important thing oh here's my smile this number one\nAnd then what's most important thing in after that's number two we get those two things we had a pretty good Saturday but we'd like to go on the number three and so on and it's just your prioritize them to do with your money\nThis is the ...\nAsked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now life
