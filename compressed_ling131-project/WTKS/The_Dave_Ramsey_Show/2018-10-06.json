cheerleaders cheerleaders they guy lockers man I if I could get over to middle school I'd be happy then you remember that and that was in middle school I got to be about the ninth grade and I was fourteen Fifteen Years old and one of my buddies got his driver's license\nAnd\nOh man if I could just get my driver's license I'd be free I could drive myself to McDonald's and we go through a McDonald's I'll tell you how long ago it was we would go through the McDonald's drive through and we can get a Big Mac and a small coke for a buck\nSixteen and we were scratching together the ... the sixteen always you can scratch the buck but the sixteen sense that you know may\nDominic on a penny right there I got to be ready I if I could get my driver's license I'd be happy then and then we got our driver's license or run round we're all in high school and finally if we can be seniors in high school and\nHomecoming queen and king we'd be happy then and then when you're a senior in high school some of your buddies go off to college and you know in college they don't care if you go to class\nNobody takes Romania there's nobody looking over your shoulder you can like be a grown up if I could just get the college I'd be happy then and and then you get to college and you go man this is hard\nIf I could just get out of college and get married and have to point three kids and buy a house on the street with a picket fence and start my life I'd be happy then you get out and you get married I have to point three kids you know I Want to go back to college to be happy [laughter]\n[noise] have you ever noticed that happiness is a bully in the schoolyard as soon as he draws the line with his toe in the sand is just cross this and we'll fight you step across that line he backs up and they draw the line\n\nYou cannot buy happiness with money you can even chase it down 'cause it's always moving you can buy fun\nIt is fun on to go on a really nice cruise it is ... ... to go to ... bay and dive one of two underwater national parks the other one's key Largo in the nation\nIt is fun on to see the harbor glacier in Alaska it is fun you can buy fine\nBut you can't buy happiness\nThe most powerful financial principle you'll ever learn in a culture that is full of angry people\nIn a culture that is full of is ... sexism racism is ... everywhere in a culture full of mean angry disjointed toxic people\nThe most powerful financial principle you'll ever have is this one contentment\n\nWhen you are content to just be then you're not at the Beck and call of a bunch of people telling you how to live with the way they live on Facebook they're highlight reel is on Facebook nobody really lives that way\nYou don't have to do what other people think you're not driven by other people's opinions and you're not chasing happiness\nWhich is a bully in the schoolyard when he draws a line in the sand he'll back up and say I'll be happy when I get that new car I'll be happy when you want when I get to go on vacation I'll be happy when I get to quit work and stay home with the kids know you won't\nHappiness is not a destination you can buy a fun with money and I don't mind you're doing that\nBut where you'll get in trouble is if you get confused because if you get confused between fun and happiness you will never achieved contentment and if you never achieved content you will always be in debt because you'll always be buying stuff with money you don't have\nStuff you don't need with money you don't have to impress people you don't even really like 'cause I'll be happy when I'll be happy when\nFamous last words of broke people\nContentment content people once you reach a level of contentment you can get out of debt pretty quick because you certainly don't care what other people think and you certainly don't even care what you think you're just like it's going to be OK I'm All right\nWhen you reach content your generosity goes way up because you don't feel like you have to have that money to be happy when [noise] when you reach a level of contentment you're investing level goes way up and the weird thing is is your wealth level will\nGo up you have a higher propensity a higher probability statistically of being wealthy by being content was not being wealthy [laughter] bedroom with a savior able to avoid that and you're able to increase generosity when you don't live your life in this costs the state of dissatisfaction saying [noise]\nI'll be happy when [laughter]\nThis is the diversion [noise]\n\n\n\n\nJessica on Twitter asks if

have an twelve Ninety am double duty chaos [noise]\nDuring the fall of meal with Dave Ramsey eight hundred thousand of you do what's your opinion of buying a vacation home with cash and renting it out when you're not there [noise]\nNothing wrong with it all with\nCash and your debt free everything about that when your homes paid for everything else just by for a vacation home is a wonderful extra as you start building somewhere else but basically what is it it's a very large toy\nVery expensive toy that goes up in value hopefully and if you rent it it might make some money\nMy family not me my family the rest of them most of the rest of them including the grandkids just spent a week down at um\nWas Rosemary beach Rosemary beach the other day and I rented a house on the beach really nice big expensive multi million dollar house for the week and obviously some people on that and rented out by the week I'm\nHere's the thing about resort rentals\nVacation home rental ... um you're going to make some money on it\nBut you're not gonna ... you're going to make usually enough to\nAfter you pay all the fees for the maid service and the you know resort rentals aren't like a traditional rental where you know for ten percent or something you can get the property management usually take half of it to manage it and that covers you know made service and that kind of stuff and then there's a whole bunch of the time it's not rented\nAnd so while you do get a great rate per week during a hot season with a ski house or your house in the mountains for ... for snow skiing or a beach house or something along those lines you're you're not going to get rich on rent it out\nYou really not I mean it's not gonna it's not really a great investment property it's more of a way to offset some of your annual costs of you're awake\nIf you look at it that way you won't be disappointed but if you actually run the numbers out you're not going to be thrilled with it as an investment you're better off to just buy investment property it'll make you more money for the dollar per dollar invest it\nAnd it's not as volatile and you don't come in and you know rent or something you know vacation runners haven't torn up your stuff or spilled want on your carpet or whatever\nAnd I know that there is a deposit and I know this stuff gets fixed but I also know people are living in their sleeping in your bed and you just have to think about that you know and you know\nIt's just it it's the way it is an even a nice home and even nice people like the Ramsey staying in your home we weren't we didn't tear up stuff or not he wasn't a frat party in there it was you know babies and\nGrandma ... and that kind of stuff in there so we want anything like that but you know stuff I don't think we broken English stuff gets broken and you just got to know that and for for some people\nAnd we put it this way for Sharon Ramsey to walk into the place where she wants to go on her second home as a vacation and someone else to have been in there and some of the stuff is out of place or broken or dirty it would kind of take a lot of the joy out of it for vacating there for her\nAnd so you have to think about that yeah that's a price you pay the rent it out\nAnd all of that to say it's not an ideal investment property it's more like a way to cover some of the cost of your way if you want to rent it out we've got a uh like how should we rented out we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out and um so it has to be a our income\nAnd our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that are weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall met worse and so there are a toy interest a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and I still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in you know the the condo the other day we stopped in there we're going to get a condo over in Knoxville and one of the ball game over there and he was out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more stuff more repairman you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich on then you'll be fine\nVery well done sir you are way ahead of the curve congratulations thank you well what we teach folks is to follow a plan we call the baby steps we think it is the shortest rate shortest route to wells okay\nAnd a baby step one is a thousand dollar saved too is that free but the house you've obviously done those three as an emergency fund of\nThree to six months of expenses you've obviously done that\nFor five and six you do simultaneously that's Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement is maybe step for five is kids college doesn't apply here six is pay off out shortly so that brings us into our question\nNow the way I look at paying off your house with a non retirement non emergency fund money\nWhich sounds like if I heard you right you've got fifty five K. and miscellaneous investments that's non retirement and not your emergency fund is that right\nOh that's correct and you oh eighty on your house did you say is that right yup okay and um the uh the way I look at that is if you owed\nThirty thousand bucks on your house would you go borrow fifty thousand to invested in stocks and bonds and my answer will quickly be no yeah and in\nEssence if you do a column of your assets in a column of your liabilities or what your own and what you owe that's called a balance sheet you probably heard that before and uh uh the balance sheet says that those things offset so it has the\nAnd in mathematical effect as if you had borrowed on your home to buy the stocks\nThat I buy that if we if we don't if we don't use that money to pay down on the house now I Would not clean out your emergency fund I Would be willing to take it down a little bit to three to six months of expenses it you know twenty three thousand or twenty two thousand or whatever was might be a little sick\nI might pull that down to pin or something you'd be safe as a single guy making fifty with a ten thousand dollar emergency fund\nSo I'd probably pull ten or twelve Thirteen out of that and I take the fifty five throw it at the house and you have that house paid off in a year what something else worth\nA it's only worth about a hundred and ...\nThat's not bad it's only two that only three years old with a paid four hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nIt'd be pretty nice\nYou know and then take and then you take that old payment you used to have and all of the freedom that you have mathematically now in your budget and and you use that that fifty five will be back in twenty minutes\nYou'll be amazed how fast you can rebuild and how fast you can build investment portfolio when you don't have any payments at all and that's the reason for doing plus here's what's kind a weird you've made really unbelievably wise decisions for twenty two years old I mean you you're just you're killing your head\nAnd a bank you know what all else will happen is did you remember when you sign the mortgage\nDid you feel emotional weight\nUh yeah kind of ... I started off with I've actually already refinanced once\nI'm done I mean when did the original deal the first time and you went from debt free young debt free with money in the bank to now I got a mortgage do you remember feeling the weight on that oh that\nYeah especially when it said Thirty years and\nYeah that's what I'm Talking about because there's more going on here than simple math there was a complicated math that entails risk\nAnd and even even relational and I'm spiritual things the borrower is slave to the window that's the way you felt Thirty years I Can't stand this I got to get rid of this well the same thing will happen in reverse but on the positive side of hey when you don't have any\n... no wait nothing on your shoulder it changes the way you play it changes the way you do you're investing it changes the you get so I got I got so enthusiastic dude when I got free with my investing and with my generosity both\nThat both of them went into outrageous mode very quickly and so yeah I don't get that fifty five back so freaking fast\nThat it it'll it'll it'll come back faster than in the first time you've got a lot faster it's not gonna take you five years this time um but you got more income now too so that's not fair but I mean you mathematically relation Lee spiritually emotionally\nWhen you're free you just do better\nAnd you make better choices and you're already making really good choices so all of that to say yes\nI Would cash out the investments that are non retirement yes I Would take that emergency fund down to about ten\nOr that doesn't quite get us there so you got to lean in and out of your budget and cash flow out the rest of that thing and finish it up within\nYou know four or five months be debt free on this whatever it is six months whatever it takes and then when the house has done than you than you if you want to build up that emergency fund a little bit fine but then kick those investments in the bud get them going again and you will prosper you are on your way sir honor to talk to you very very well done\nWine is an Indianapolis Hi Wayne welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nThanks Dave I just want to first say God Bless you for all the work you do it's really made a difference in my life\nWill thank you ... help today\nWell my wife and I have been a leading the life of ... for about two years now and uh we've pretty much become that for other than our student loans which we're working on and then\nWe ended up getting a now I got pregnant with her first child and April so we took your advice and stop putting everything toward their debt snowball and started a bank in all of that is good and uh\nAs of this month we we now have enough for her to take her for a month maternity leave um pain free for us which is great\nAnd that but the problem that the Murphy has decided to strike at\nThat last week we got a bill in the mail from our city here and they replaced and sidewalks here on our lots and or the bills for forty four hundred dollars and a with\nA baby on the way here in another uh two months we don't have that kind of money and our cash flow to pay that off and twelve months before they put a lean on our home so my question is um what would you do that in that situation that we we ... our maternity leave fun and pay that off or what do we do when somebody do\nA better than the beginning of December okay well\nThe game plan that will usually outline for folks is push paws on your total money make over your debt snowball Kobe becomes pile up the cash when baby comes push play again and take all that cash and throw it at your debt\nCorrect as long as baby mama come home and everybody is cool but the cash is just to make sure everybody's school there is no issues and we're not it's not really for maternity leave unless you have to have it to eat with but I mean it's not um it it's so that we can use it so how much cash you got piled up or will you have piled up by decide what\nWhat Seventy five hundred dollars this month and like I said she was going to be wanting to take the three months off the bond with the baby on such and we can't do it on just my income alone so um that's why we are smart about this and it set that\nGoal to make sure that you know so we got from now until December to continue to save right\nCorrect and what other debts do you have in your debt snowball how much\nI'm just about a hundred and fifty dollars a month as what we have a new best friend other than our car payment and you have your back and all that balances you need to pay off\nTime no not on your car and material on your car alley\nOn and on the dollars you know got well then the four thousand will be you're paying off out of this guy and then as far as set aside enough for her to things and re month so you got the cash you should\nTake guys this is James child's producer of the Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on six hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you had to Dave Ramsey dot com slash show [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed paying for the mortgage utilities food\nAnd other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement\nThat's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to sand or insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is the the family that

or restaurant jobs like a money that actually passed over the payment Philly and I said okay without getting myself and can't help\nPayment literally get included and paying payments Oh nice okay\nRight or the story sucks [laughter]\nSo I'm now ... years later a as last year she I got my job and she gave me the payments and I realize that even though I'm I'm just now starting off\nIn the corporate world I don't make enough to to pay for the car so my story kind of like a lady that called ... and so I Know how your diet lie that I'd have to get rid of the car but I don't know how to go about doing that I get my life you know it's not our off so thick\nYeah and it also fix so\nShe ... unable to delete issue mentally unable to make legal decisions\nNo she's not mentally eight she's mentally able she has a virus that if the credit so that's why he was able to get the car and get painted actually there are so\nHere's the thing she tried to do a nice thing for you and she did it in a really stupid way and so now you're both stuck\nBecause you she ... she owes\nMore it's not gonna hurt your credit all your credit is not involved it's her credit that we're worried about we want to do a nice thing for her 'cause she's sick and not able to deal with this so uh what she probably knows more on this car than it is worth I'm guessing\nIf they care for it at our adding Kelley Blue book steady was a work around close to twenty thousand it found out\nIt's worth close to twenty thousand would have voted against it\nI Want to throw like ... like twenty thousand now\nOkay or does your ... to have any money\nShe retired but not really so suddenly she couldn't afford it okay All right well I'm\nSure you guys are in a pinch just is very uncomfortable because here's what needs to happen she needs to sell this car because her niece can't pay the payments and when she sells the car she's going to lose seven thousand dollars on it what are we going to do with that\n\nDo you feel obligated to pay that\nYou're not legally are way I Do think that you know what I Do get the kind of accepted it I Know I'm at fault for not through\nYou know how old are you a choice at it what do you make a choice they have their\nJeeze [noise]\nOkay well someone's going to find the seven thousand dollars to put with the twenty thousand dollars that you get from your the she gets from her buyer to pay the car off so that the buyer can get the title and that's going to leave you and her\n... her seven thousand dollars in the whole if you want to help with that you can um and where I'm mediating this I Would say you both did something stupid and I would ask you to split it\n... that she each thirty five hundred and you eat thirty five hundred and let's get the car so if she's too sick to handle the transaction however sign a power of attorney over to you for the this title\nAnd then you get the car sold and um I have heard come up with three thousand five hundred and you go borrow three thousand five hundred and that's your penalty for being engaged in this and her penalty for being engaged in this because the other option as you stop paying the payments and she gets ... D\nDoesn't sound really scared of the credit yeah that does that doesn't sound like a good plan to make because she's going to end the sick old lady's gonna get\nSued for trying to do something nice but she did it in a stupid way [noise] so I think you both ... and that's just the fairness thing it's not a legal thing [noise]\nBut it's what I call stupid to actually do something stupid it costs

had a family or his wife had died and he had three small boys to do to make it short she\nFind a way a lot of things that you shouldn't have one is taken out a couple of title alone in her car a road rubber check as credit card debt so to make a long story short she's got quite a few clicks and agencies after her\nShe can't be clear with me right now about how much she really knows I don't know I Believe I'm guessing it's over four thousand and less than eight I'm not I'm not sure but she's racked up a lot of dead last year\nShe is almost thirty four she will be next month [noise] my my question to you is she has no money I Do not want to pay her death\nUm what does she said in these collection agencies I mean literally she has nothing\nAnd now she's still living with this guy now he's in a halfway house he was on drugs were not as kids\nIf kids are now with one of his sisters and his mother\nSo she now as a single mom with a new baby on her own\nRight the fear in Arizona gave myself and my husband uh the responsibility of taking care of the baby now we can go wherever she wants but baby stays with me\nOkay so his now moved in with you yeah she's living with me the ... the baby on the other correct\nOkay good good that's good news okay so here's the thing that um ... what you tell the collection agencies is is that she has nothing and so for now they will get nothing\nAnd she's dealing with bipolar and you know you date she is what we in the business called judgment proof\nOh absolutely can sue your pants off but they can't if you don't have any pants [laughter] that's what it amounts to okay\nWell that's what I was thinking that she wasn't you know her boyfriend has said to me well I didn't make Lee and find anything that she wasn't aware of I go but she can't make those decisions is what I've told them\nWell she she you know we've got to come back to that in the second book let's assume the debt is valid for\nUs it's not that much and it'll probably be good for her to work our way through it when she gets back on her feet well\nShe might even got a job right well I Know I Know yeah\nI Know what I said when she gets back on her feet mentally emotionally is working\nYeah we're going to let her let her um probably reap the rewards of her stupid ... in the middle of bipolar okay now having said that I work with we worked with bipolar for years people who have bipolar always end up in financial counseling goes major\nOnly with off from it for the past year and I realized he or she probably had her biological clock ticking going well mom and dad have always told me I shouldn't get pregnant on your knees mad because she's on two different mints every day so she's been off it from the bottom\nLine is random line is is that with good counseling and with the proper balance of medication not over medication but not under medication um that that she can live a very normal life and make good decisions about everything child rearing financially and everything in a\n... you know but it can happen it can I address on what happens\nIs is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nWrite I actually last January cook myself you know of of her checking account because\nWhole life companies don't sell cheap term insurance\nRight guy I contacted Vander no car last week\nWhen you get your term insurance in place you can just cancel with the company directly if you want to call the agent you can call a model air but you know their job is to save the say you'll\nLose your job is to run in and rescue you from yourself and so there is no reason to have the insurance review doesn't serve any ...\nI wasn't going to have it Irish you're going to be under grant can't no matter what you know but I didn't know there are certain steps now that if I didn't take I Would lose out on getting them the most out of the cash value whatever's there\nNo there's no difference at all all you do is you just call them and get a caller eight hundred number or whatever the name of the company isn't get customer care on the line customer service on the line and you know ask them if there's something they need you to sign in or if there's anything we needed extra expedite this but we need you\nQuickly to get me my cash value watched the fastest way I can do that but no you really can't pass it up the only thing that can happen is is they may try to slow walk or nor your request and you may have to push on them it's kind of like cancel on a credit card you got to argue with them to get it done\nBut no there's not a way you can mess it up you just need to be persistent is all and make sure that they follow through and change your your check\nAnd if you need to sign a piece of paper forget them to do that that's not a big deal don't cancel any life insurance until you have your new life insurance in place always remember that Denise is with us in Washington DC Hi Denise how are you\nHi Dave I'm great how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so I think I'm a wake up and down probably seven months ago on ... on a really challenging time because we have to travel in college second year that we need to pay for and that's how I have to carry expected it can get an extent that they can hide it and not far\nFrom ... to try to figure out in the\nHat and for the ... Chevy Cobalt fair ... parents on or taking out here on the fact that I get something to make sure that we're going to write the check I don't know when I'm going to be coming back to what it was really pretty devastating on them washed out just fine\nI'm Sorry you did then that the the century you lost your job and that's scary I don't want to make it worse by going into that if you're\nMaking your financial situation worse you know is what we got to do so what a master's you're in the middle of the storm went down the hatches and so how much is the tuition\n[noise] I'm coming up we'll total with I have to pay twenty three by coming\nI have to pass out a thousand okay and do you have eight thousand okay\nWell I mean even if you don't really like you can spare the eight thousand and the kid needs to pull out of school or he needs to get a job and by his eight thousand but I'm not going to tell you to go into debt and make the situation worse\n\nWhen you have the money the only question is you're making a decision do you want the safety net more than you want to pay tuition I'm guessing you're probably going to pay the tuition so how much did you use to make\nAbout five and what does your are you married yes and what does your husband might suddenly okay and what did you used to do 'em in software support\nAnd how long have you been laid off on a down side to not while not been able to land somewhere yeah definitely I ...\nI I'm going around something in that period of time in that field\nThat makes two of us working on working on it\nOkay 'cause I I Know in other words the good news is you're in a an active\nTechnology type position that ought to be some positions available maybe not Ninety five maybe a hundred and five maybe not a hundred and five maybe Seventy five I don't know but I don't think you're going to be unemployed indefinitely you're not you're in an active market metro market and you're in an active space so I'm not going to panic\n\nAnd I'm sure not going to make it worse by borrowing money if you're going to panic till junior to come home for a semester or time get a job pays eight thousand\nOn that too but um you guys are paying your basic necessities of life out of your husband's income\nAnd that's what you push through but I'm with but you know this eight thousand is another thing and it depends on how much you have in savings to that you got to work with but no I'm not borrowing the money I don't teach people to borrow money at them borrow money should emergencies don't borrow money when things are good and I'm greedy I don't borrow money when things are bad and I'm afraid\nAnd greed and fear are a good way to lose your butt with money for sure\nSo don't let either one of those be you're driving driving force for Christie is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Christie how are you\nKind and taking my call sure one in my head and and I are brand new ... then I can kind of northern California and in our new we\nI had a job and coming here at ... catering kind of a school district has been getting I and our goal with cash and that they had to\nHave that and and and ... and that got anyway anyway along with ... eternity we now have to pay well out of line against it about four years ago and\nHad eight thousand dollars you're meaning like retiring and giving him the can't make campaigning I have to get the\nDollar and the next here to finish paying off a ... dollar he retired from there well he laughed a company called ... twenty eight year anyway and they had an accurate higher\nNow that doesn't matter on this you're you're a four O. one K. loan if not paid within sixty days has to be considered do own fault it's Irish regulations\nHave had to cut back on it that that ... that he can continue to maintain it\nAnd I and I don't ... I don't care what they say you need to check with your tax preparer and if you're a tax preparer can find a regulation that aligns with the with what the companies are saying that's fine but I don't think that's so my I don't\nHave anybody that happen Africa Conway combat faraway people\nYou know you need to call attacks professional not the company that he worked for because my understanding the regulation is four one K. loan if not paid within sixty days of leaving the job is considered an early withdrawal and you are taxed and penalize\nAnd that's my understanding of the rail okay so the way\nI kind of game like that right now and when Lee lab we weren't going to be able to pay it back after that that's what we thought drawn based on what they call that we weren't going to take that penalty an attack on it wow and when we ain't got\nSettled in Kansas a letter saying that they will fade categorize\nEric hired I don't care because they don't get to decide what IRS tax regulations

correct okay well the good news is is the\nInstant before they go on an issue or you could file and they'd never get it done\nSo we're still nothing on fire were ways away from me to worry about this so you'd have to get a job and they would actually have to file a garnishment at that job and find out you had that job\nBefore you went that far you may end up filing\nOkay in it might end up that and I would certainly understand with all the hell you've been through would clean give you a clean slate\nAnd um you get a fresh start and you may end up filing a because it may be unreasonable to try to work your way through these things with your income but today you don't have to make that decision\nOne of the things that happens when someone's been through what you've been through is you feel the tyranny the tyrant in your head from the background and it pushes you to do things a very suddenly very quickly\nAnd out of almost all out of almost a desperation and emotional desperation I Am I wrong or am I reading your mail\nNow correct okay\nSo what I'm going to tell you there's a slow down a little bit because the worst financial decisions you make or when you're desperate\nBecause you feel like you're forced or you're trapped and you start slashing flailing around like your drowning or something and you really can do some stupid stuff and I actually know how much credit card debt is involved here\n[noise] um it's probably about twenty thousand dollars and\n... good and um do you have any other debt student loan debt\nI didn't learn that yeah that's probably about twenty three thousand\nGuy that is not bankrupt All right okay\nAnd do you have any IRS that\nNo just the um foreclosure on the house\nOkay and what type of a home loan did you have F ha VA or conventional\nUm do we watch started off ... but then I got I'm told in finance and I'm at this point I don't even remember what kind it was okay\nIt's possible that they're not going to chase you at all\nSo if you just said that's not there and and we start making some money and we wanted to settle with two and three year old credit card debt for twenty cents on the dollar four thousand dollars if that's the case and a lot of fighting on your part you'd have to have your fight back\nA arguing with them you can probably clear twenty thousand dollars worth of old credit card debt for around four thousand dollars and the student loan that doesn't change if that's all the case and they're not going to end your wages and you just began to work through this\nAnd you could have cleared it for four grand and it would all just gone away without a bankruptcy\nTo see the bankruptcy starts the nightmare the credit nightmare the money nightmare over again\nRight starts at all new but if you can just clear these things up like drop off into the past a whole lot faster and they're not as permanent as a bankruptcy as you may end up being forced into bankruptcy by garnishment\nBut to day I Would not find all based on fear of something that might happen that has not yet happened the man is not real you got away from him\nRight you're going to be okay if I Am able to start paying off but that we do the best he go from smaller steps to largest where\nI Would love to swim smallest the largest and I would call the smallest one in subtle with them\nFor ten to twenty cents on the dollar and
