I have to lay down\nThe good news is you won the argument the bad news is you both have to read the book again [laughter]\nDoing All right thanks for the call Rick Carruthers rex in Fort Lauderdale Florida Hi Rick how're you\nGuys are how are you better than others or what's up I'm\nJust calling about a product I have a I bought a while back called Avi well\nA very universal life yes\nYes sir Yes sir I'm and I'm not really sure what to do with it I'm not I know I'm not a fan of it but again even when I talk my eyes are on the ins and outs of it like to walk away confused and not sure what to do with it\nBut that's because of that is one of the techniques they used to get people to keep it came in the dark and feed them little neuro mushroom process or keep them in the dark for the manure try to grow mushrooms um [laughter]\nSo ah ... the deal is a it's a cash value life insurance policy there are three types her whole life universal bird more universal life and just verbal life and a universal I verbal universal laws and variable universal sometimes has a mutual fund selection the inside of it ...\nYears ago yeah okay and so what happens is though of course that you you know you're not a fan of it because you've not seen good return ...\nNo it's about eight percent returns but all the fees and built into it I think that it no more yeah\nWell in ... usually if you're in a good mutual fund that's making ten or twelve you'll ... somewhere in the seven range or after fees\nWhich if you're just bought the mutual fund you motivated ten or twelve and your case you're making eight and their fees are getting you down probably in the four range actually will be my guess usually the ... are going to eat four to five roughly in those things\nAnd so instead of buying the mutual fund directly you're buying it through the stupid policy and they're kicking you in the tapes\nAnother four or five percent that is what it comes down to that's problem number one problem number two is the ... the\nLife insurance portion of it is what's called a A R T an annual adjustable term and uh the cheapest term insurance you can buy his term insurance for one year based on your age that year and then it adjusts up every year as you get older okay that's the cheapest term policy by the year\nFor one year it's not the cheapest way to buy it over ten years or Twenty years okay but you know if you buy just based on your age this year so you're paying in X number of dollars\nSome of it is going to buy the life insurance and some of those going to the investment that we've already ascertain just doing poorly okay less and less every year is going to the investment more and more is going to the insurance because your insurance costs just increasing every year because they are the have you noticed that as well\n[noise] I have not okay\nAnd uh because ... and so what we have always suggested that I don't sell any of this I don't give a crap but here's the math on it I have found that a Fifteen to twenty year level term policy locks in and gives you less expensive term insurance\nAnd when you invest the money directly into the mutual fund you don't have the extra fees and you get a better net of fees return\nThat makes sense and plus when you die with the Wii U L they're going to pay the face and keep your investment\nThat's the worst part of it so it's a horrible playing when you die [noise] but ah it's just really bad while you're alive and it gets really worse when you die so what I Would suggest you do is get the proper amount of term insurance in place and then drop this garbage into your investing somewhere else does that make sense\nIt does I think the reason I haven't done that yet and because of the surrender charges\nWell you're you've already bought that I mean you're just did that just got ripped and this also means you're probably need a new financial advisor because I think I think you have a life insurance salesman this calling himself a financial advisor it's certainly possible\n[laughter] so it sounds like it doesn't sound like a most of the people in the mutual fund world don't solve this crap\nI say that they get on the actual funds and some of them sell term insurance too but most of them don't solve this crap because nobody believes in this garbage except the life insurance people nobody anymore nobody there's no one in the financial arena in the financial spaces as by whole live life insurance or by the cash value insurance of any kind of there isn't one out there\nThere's a just cause some math is just so horrible and you figured that part out but this guy's doing smoke and mirrors and hadn't the pea under shell and keeping you confused as to teaching you\n'cause he knows if you've ever understood at that you drop it in him to probably so I'm thinking you need a new advisor and you need to get some term insurance in place and you need to drop this garbage that's what I Would do thanks\nFor the

you must have been talking about it even before marriage tell me your story\nSo we have an interesting story we feel like you're going to like this one a lot we um we met about four and a half years ago in Sunday school\nAnd my brother was him and his wife for the coordinators for FAU class at our church that started like fall time that you\nA million Haley we're the only two single people in there and so when we had to partner up to figure out who the nerd was and the free spend or we just partnered up together and we started dating later that year and\nUh yeah so um we we were both doing individual budgets before we were married and of course when we got engaged a leading up to our marriage\nWe sat down and had a conversation about exact numbers and the debt and we we made our goals and so when we came back from the honeymoon which we cashed load\nAnd the wedding which cash for we sat down and had our our first official a budget mating and set a goal that we were going to be out of the debt completely but for a second wedding anniversary\nI'll tell you what this place to meet a woman in a financial piece class [laughter]\nIt's a joke based romance I Love it [laughter]\nWe always say where where the poster children for Dave Ramsey that fee you show\nOh my God I don't know how you could get any more doctor needed than that that's pretty much [laughter]\nAs wound down to\nWhere you're trying to figure out earlier today I said you know one of the best thing about this as we've never had a money five ever and I would say we're probably in the one percent and she said it's probably less\nYeah you know has made couples that ever ever or new to never argued about money\nWell I don't know how many I've met that actually met in a financial piece class [laughter] we're gonna have to start a financial class for singles should slash dating most yeah\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] oh knowing\nThe arguing down on the on the after the ... after the wedding is over there you\nKnow well I could think of a worst place to find a spouse I'll tell you that [laughter]\nThat is awesome guys well since you are experts in indoctrinated through and through what do you tell people\nWhen they ask how you get out of debt you paid off a hundred and fifty three thousand twenty three months no matter where you met that's not easy\n[noise] well it's not I I think that they get fired with having a packet and having a plan together and they think of that plan\nAnd it safer for me I think that you know I just feel that we're wherever the willingly left and the fact that um\nWhile before we met and I could look back at my financial history where I made bad decisions after we met we got on the we got on the plan separately we've we've never gone through those dumb decisions\n[noise] um we had a track right now that's forty five Taliban and al ... and your household income is what I'm way out here you know\nGet rid of both them and just get you to be years from now while you get dismissed cleaned up it's not a forever car\nIt it's just a short period of time but if you can ... the huge amount of money you got going out the door on cars and the huge amount of last year taking every day and appreciation of how fast you're going down in value is just destroying you guys so I I Would just moved down to like to five thousand dollar cars and\n[laughter] you know even if you got a little bit on those and you've got a little bit on where you were upside down finance it over to credit union or something will cover their mouth that you're in the whole it's still a lot less debt than you've got now and you stop the bleeding\n[noise] yeah I I got a lot of you know a little\nWhile here on my walk you through it okay let's take the thirty two thousand dollar car that's the data on my car correct\nYeah let's pretend that when you look that car up on Kelley Blue book that you can private cell that car for um like twenty eight thousand which will be like four thousand in the whole\nI now where we get to four thousand well you obviously don't have any money you're broke right so you're going to either borrow that from your local credit union or your bank\nAnd you'll be four thousand dollars and that instead of twenty eight digital thirty two thousand dollars in debt\nSo that's huge progress right there okay and the and then a let's say that I come up to buy the car I hand you a check for twenty eight thousand you put the four thousand you borrowed from the credit union with it and pay the car off that get you the title to give to me the buyer\nMy okay and that's how you do it now who are your loans with on the cars\nWent after credit and want to throw out\nOkay the allied deal will will work just like I talked about just now the credit union you may be able to sit down with them and convince them by sitting in person in the manager's office are only so it's not a telephone conversation\nBut you may try to say hey look this is how far we are upside down this car which means that you have a partially secured loan\nYou have a loan that secured by this much the value of the car the rest of this one was an an secured loan right\nYou understand what I'm saying yeah OK then the up\nAnd so Mr manager all we're asking you to do is to admit that it's an secured by giving us an inch beard loan for the amount that you're there were in the whole I Want to sell the car\nAnd get out of this debt okay\nAnd then you got a five thousand dollar loan with credit union whenever the differences are you know at the credit union instead of a forty five thousand dollars or whatever the word whatever the numbers work out to be but I Would dump both of these cars get into some very very cheap cars for a period of time while you're clean this mess up and it's going to take you a couple of years clean this mess up\nOh yeah but five years from now you'll be driving anything you want to drive you pay cash for it\n[noise] and it's not what health and\nIt's not open I mean you you can do it mathematically if you just take the steps and sacrifice to get there but you've got to amputate I you know these cars I mean you have thousand dollars a month car payments\nAre more probably twelve hundred and um you know it's just it's choking you to death you're gonna feel so much more free when you get rid of those stupid vehicles and then later on and get your whatever you want your drive like no one else or later you can drive like no one else you live like no one else or later you\nCan live and give like no one else ... is with us in San Antonio I'm Betty Lou how are you\nCan you hear me now yes ma'am how can I help okay cool\nUm I was telling your comrades that I felt like on the poster child at sixty two are having a bad financial decisions and not by a semi retirement and the reason I'm calling because I I Am working full time on sixty two um I\nWant to find out how to leverage my situation my income by saving fat or I have found that to ensure at least a reasonably comfortable retire at which I plan on at about eight years\nShould end it got too much do you make I make a sixty six thousand a year good or how much debt to your house\nI add twenty thousand fairly that and I am twenty eight hundred do online vehicle which our pay off by Tobar\nMhm okay so twenty two twenty three thousand dollars in debt making sixty six that's good All right and how much money do you have saved not counting retirement\nOkay so I have the government's version of a far on K which is called ... and I'm sure you're familiar with it and I have about eleven thousand in it and I was\nYou have any money other than that saved\nI have a thousand dollar fine\nOkay good All right cool what do we stop adding to the tea SP temporarily\nYes I I I well I took it down to one percent\nStop temporarily and could rally concentrate on there's twenty three thousand dollars worth of debt with airline then you've got squeeze every dollar out because when you don't have any payments then you have control of your most powerful wealth building too\nWhich is your income right now it's all going out and student loans carpets so we get rid of the car payment you're a student loan payment that we build an emergency fund raising the thousand dollar up to a three to six months of expenses emergency fund baby step three and then maybe step for is saving Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement\nAnd um you know where will that leave you is the next question so we'd like sixty six thousand dollars\nLet's just pretend for a second\nAnd Fifteen Percent of that is Ninety nine hundred a year twelve to ... says eight hundred bucks a month\nGive or take nine hundred bucks a month something like that going into retirement um and we start with eleven thousand for those living in putting this and the calculators were mumbling All right when the calculator and we're going to do this for say I'm\nI'll just put ten years in there for the phone I was just to see what it does see what kind of money we end up with here that would be about a quarter million dollars\nThat you would have at retirement and you would be Seventy two at that point um and that's not counting any kind of match from the government a lot of most of us but you don't have a match 'em and that's not counting any raises you get during the next ten years while you're working\nBut if your debt free and buy them in your house will be paid off too by the way um and so if your debt free one hundred percent and you have two to three hundred thousand dollar sitting there\nYou're going to make it I'd like to have you have a lot more but it's not as a whole bunch of for peace from social in security is your only way to retire\nUm and you certainly don't have to buy the cookbook Seventy two ways to prepare outgoing love it you'll be able to eat so you put the income for three hundred grand along with um\nThe income from Social Security in your early seventies and everything is paid for\nI think you'll be okay uh we're we're past panic mode anyway because we now have a plan I'm going to send you a copy of Chris ... book

I Want to learn about Seventy five hundred dollar idea and try that a couple of times I'll I'll gamble a little bit with the medical profession if I'm In your shoes in other words\nAnd that helps me if I'm In your shoes go\nHey we're going to take a couple of months off and we're going to take ten thousand dollars and and then we're going to go back at it again on the debt while we see how that works out and then if we need to stop again and go out ten thousand dollars and then go back out the dad again that'd be fine yeah OK but my wife will be very happy here to\nYeah I mean I Would do that but but don't just except\nThe one guy as the only way to attempt this okay in terms of ... not not in terms of medical procedure I'm not talking about that I don't know anything about that but in terms of the pricing structure and it has to do with you know the the the\nWeather they guarantee you know multiple tries you know you buy a package of five or whatever all that kind of stuff I've heard all kinds of ways of getting up to us and it's kind of weird to talk about it that way but but that's really what's going on\nAnd so just learn a little bit more push back get some other opinions from other pricing structures and then based on that yes\nYou know if you want to take a month or two off of the baby step to and you know I have the cash to do whatever you're doing and then go back out the baby step to again and then if you have to stop again and try another time that that's fine I don't have any issue with that but um\nDo we just say oh no it's thirty five thousand dollars like discussion the other day which is absurd and we're just going to stop everything and go do that 'cause we've completely lost our minds and uh because this was an emotional subject and it's very very important to have babies and I'm completely with you might be the best things on the planet I mean it's awesome I Love it\nSo I you know that that's what I Would do if I were in your
