enjoy your show hey thank you had a quick\nQuestion I'm trying to gain some a little bit of understanding and and I I mean I Know deep down what the answer is but [noise] ... from a logical standpoint let us know few years ago Mr Obama\nFiled federal suit against the state of Arizona and Governor Brewer for trying to enforce immigration laws they successfully argued that immigration was the sole per per view of the federal government [noise]\nWell now we go back and at that time ... the state of California and a few other states joined with the federal government to win that argument\nWell no that Mr Trump is they're trying to actually enforce the immigration laws some of these states are suing saying oh wait we can do our own thing as well such as California with the sanctuary cities yet\n... it's ... it's because it's when they don't they ... people need to understand about liberals\nThey don't have a set of values they stick with its the values I think at that moment will help them the most that's the reason why they're willing to do whatever I mean there are millions you a liberal it's easier to be a Democrat in politics because no one will ever criticize you for for ...\nNo one will ever criticize you for doing one thing or saying one thing one day one day during the complete opposite the next day me in\nThat part was the part where I'm confused as is if is what the court to who sit there and argue the whole the whole notion of story defeat system stuff like this yet those same courts are stepping back when in reality they're decisions don't stand ...\nWell you got to remember we're talking about ten years ago when Obama was talking about enforcing the border and that that issue Democrats thought was less popular to be anti border security now they're they have to go all in on it Rick because if they don't eventually I think they'll keep losing the Republicans like Donald Trump\nThey need new voters in here and they need to give out amnesty and

it and talking about it and saying great things and so I decided to download your audio book subtle money make over ... I started listening to it and I think that turning point for me was when I got to the point about the debt snowball and lifting your debt\nBecause up until that point I had been just doing everything they tried to avoid thinking about it it was stressful I just I didn't even want to it you know deal with it and I logged on and I saw that in the past three years I had been pain about Thirteen thousand dollars a year\nAnd about Fifteen thousand dollars a year it was occurring in interest every year so I really wasn't even making a dent in the student loans and so I knew something needed to change I Need to get serious especially being\nA you know in my late twenties at the time and single I didn't want to have this burden looming over my head for the next decade or two and certainly if I got married and had a family in the future I didn't want to bring that burden into that\nWilliam paid off a ridiculous amount of that with a ridiculously wonderful income show you hum wow okay so you you finished residency\nAnd really about a year went by before you started this right yeah roughly year okay did you come straight out and go into ER yeah yeah Microsoft with emergency medicine so you were making bucks already ... but then you just when you shut down to the math on this you went oh I can do this\nYeah I just realized that something absolutely needed to change because I just I couldn't live like that anymore\nWow look at you and just dumb and you just do them now do you take a lot of extra time at a yard to in order to get the income and this was one of the ... you know our position makes\nSo I actually went to my boss and asked if I could work all night shift and the ER and I did that for the entire twenties too much pointing months because it paid significantly more to work nights\nYou know is it it's it's that Governor double and uh it's about twenty percent more in our twenty percent more yeah right but wow so you're really sacrifice to get this done people think you were losing your mind I mean your family your doctor your enjoy your life I mean yeah the one thing I heard a lot of\nWas in regards to buying a new car because I was still driving a used car for

how're you\nDoing good how are you doing better than I deserve washed up on the question [noise] and investing so\nI guess a short a review I'm I'm thirty my wife's thirty three\nA combined income right now about one Seventy five ... I'm only is mortgage I'm a car payment and then I'm a little bit of student loan that we've got the cash to pay it off a which was about to go ahead and ripped the band it off the U.S pay\n'em even after that we can get at least six months of\nUm you know emergency extensive setback emergency fund um I've got four one K. and a pension she has four one K. and profit sharing and my main question is what are the extra income every month\nAnd who should be so good at something that's strictly tied retirement which is what we have a lot of or is it will be better to put that into something more accessible like a like a managed a like us we have a managed fund that can be accessed prior to retirement if if need be\nYou know we call those bridge funds um yeah at some point I Would go there but I think you've got some cleaning up to do y'all been pretty sloppy you make a lot of money to be as broke as you are um how long have you been making that kind of money\nOn the last couple of years okay\nIt's it's it's time to clean up the rest of this mess then yeah let's rods from checks today and pay off student loan the car you got to pay off both of them\nYou do yeah good let's do that today\nAnd then you need to have your emergency fond of three to six months of expenses not income three to six months of expenses and uh that's what we call taken you through baby step three which lays the foundation for a solid financial plan your debt free and you have your rainy day fund\nExcept your home okay then we move on to what we call baby steps four or five and six do you have children no not right now okay\nThen ah we would baby steps for is Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement that's not much what what you guys make\nBut it's a good start and it's not going to keep you from retiring in doing the British stuff later which I'm going to come back to and actually do what you want to do but I'm gonna do it in the right order um [noise]\nOnce you're doing that then the baby step father's kids' college that does not apply here baby steps six pay off your house early I'm Marie job or knock the house out beyond that which is has the same effect\nTo your net worth that the bridge loan does because having your home paid off frees you up and and ... to need a lot less income\nTo retire before you can access the retirement funds okay now then once the house is paid off which really do how much do you own your home\nAll equate to eighty\nOkay if you do what I'm Talking about here probably in about five years maybe seven before you're\nOr to your house is going to be paid off and by then you're probably making two two and a quarter if you're on a normal career track maybe even more okay so your income is increasing your ... one hundred percent that free before you're forty now we can do a lot of stuff\nI have a single parent in the world mathematically with one Seventy five two and a quarter or whatever it is coming in\nNow you max out retirement and you build other wealth which will have this effect you're looking for of what we call the ... bridge financing has or bridge savings or bridge investing bridge between age fifty two and\nYou know if you wanted to have enough to to do some stuff with before that but the whole idea of being that we're going to build wealth as a result\nOf having no payments\nTo go with your fabulous income uh your most powerful will building tool is your income we've just finished a study here that Chris Hogan is doing a book on a ... of the largest study of millionaires ever done and what we find is as they pay off their home in an average of ten point two years\nMost of them do not make as much as you make\nThe vast majority of millionaires don't make as much as you make\n'em and then they steadily invest in there for one k.'s and once that's maxed out they do other investing in just good mutual funds or by some real estate that you pay cash for the income producing or something like that where you've got some other money that you've got access to\nThat is not return not all caught up in retirement\nAnd so you're thinking right I just put it to the back of a line as to the front of the line on when you're going to get to it\nUm and you'll get there faster if you'll do it the way I'm Talking about in the way you're talking about ... to clean up this mess you make

sizable increases unless you unless there's some kind of a promotion path that you're on and so I don't know yeah you're you're gonna have to have a different housing situation unless you've got a different career situation\nBecause you know you can do again you can do this for a year you could lose for two or three years but you cannot do it over the scope of ten to Twenty years and prosper\nBecause you're you're ... poor at that point your your your house was draining the blood out of your life\nAnd you you just don't have anything left here you have no margin you're no wiggle

not as expensive I Know California real estate expensive I understand I'm In ... in and out of California in and out of Manhattan all the time I understand these markets I Know the markets but\nI mean it's almost impossible to live on the island of Manhattan unless you're making a hundred dollars a year\nUm you just cannot afford the rent even on a studio apartment and so that's what you're facing in your market there uh and then the ... you know we're talking about this in San Fran and the other day when I was over there you you cannot afford to live in Silicon valley\nUnless you make substantial money and so I mean so there's and Silicon Valley as a result is having a real problem staffing service type jobs\nBecause nobody the service type jobs for typical service type income can afford to live there and so you run into all kinds of people are being busted him to do\nLabor type jobs and a ... you know because we can't afford to live in Silicon valley and and that's that's just a mathematical facts of the situation so that applies to you and you've got to make some decisions are is are we going to do something with our careers that allow us to live in this house or\nAre we

career questions we got the man here the phone numbers triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five welcome back in thanks for having always fun to be with you the smart conference in Kansas City last weekend phenomenal you did a great job presenting that really connected didn't it\nThank you yes it uh it it was exciting to see people jot down some of the things we were talking about that practically allow them to get where they want to be you know that I mean we can all his vision a mountain top\nBut then it gets real scary when we started thinking about how do I scale that mountain top and as we talked a lot about the proximity principal and gave people some ideas on the right people are going to be around and and the right places that need to be\nBecause if you want to do something you need to be in the proximity\nOf that thing here it is so proximity principle simply says in order to do what I Want to do you feel like\nThat I've got to be around people who are doing that and in places where that is happening so think about that when I'm Around the right people they'll point to the to the right places and then when I go in those places and were specifically looking for three things in the right places where I can learn or I can do and where I can connect\nAnd date when I'm In the right places I inevitably\nMore of the right people and so it becomes this cyclical process that is so profoundly simple\nIt should demystify the path to getting where I Want to go you're an example and here's what's great about this no matter how successful you get your always practicing the proximity principle you're continuously looking to get around the right people whether it be for personal reasons are professional reasons you like to sit down billionaires want to learn things about these men and women\nYou know and you're constantly thinking about what are the places I Need to be an where does Ramsey solutions need to be\nThis was a very simple principle that no matter where you're at life if you want to get somewhere\nYou have to practice proximity you know I've noticed that happening here\nIn our little a burger outside of Nashville Franklin, Tennessee has has ended up becoming a melting pot for people who write\n... in the self improvement space to understand who ah who speak and the self improvement space\nI mean I've been here all along a Mike Hi it a ... has been in the ... a friend of mine down the road Donald Miller moved here in the last couple of years uh in from Oregon ... from the road to any ... moved here about the time that book type took off there's probably a handful of others that I'm just not even thinking you're mentioning right now\nUm but a ... a lot of movement and it just seems to be this thing happening\nAnd it's like an almost like an artist community like Asheville North Carolina very much an art community now and you get around the things and the people\nAnd the places that something's happening and then you have a better chance of pulling it off that's right and it's not that the Donald Miller or die brands your Mike Hi it interact are already in every day we certainly don't but we all know each other and we've all interacting and we've all helped each other that's one way or another ah sometimes it's just a drop by nothing real fancy\nBut it is a very much all within about five miles of each other here you know as an example\nYeah it it it here's what happens when you get around like minded people\nThen there is a natural\nA force if you will it's almost magnetic that they are going to pull you into their or of a little bit just by their example and you you know there there's a guy that you and I both admire I never had the chance to meet him Charles tremendous Jones you know there's a famous saying that said you know who you are five years from now is largely\nDependent on the books you read and the people you meet and we've also heard the age old colonialism that nobody can attribute it to anybody but it's not\nWhat you know it's who you know who you know so again what we've done here on the show with with helping people try to demystify or take away the fear of getting where they want to go is by showing them this is a process is not going to happen overnight\nIt might take you four years of putting yourself in proximity to the right person\nFor me to have you know my story you watched it from afar eight years\nEight years of small itty bitty baby steps a of putting myself around the right people in in the right places doing the hard work learning being humble hustling staying in Hungary and then you get an opportunity at some point everybody's story is different\nPhone broke up an interest in what\nAviation pilot okay gotcha okay\nSo um I might add guy and I have um\nSaved up my American the fun I have ... children three and five and I'm just wondering if I were selfish can go through all the training and to becoming a pilot\nBecause I feel like it they're calling for me but I'm not positive and I'm just wondering if I said\nTap into that world or if I can do and what I'm doing in saving and then retire I mean that's pretty much where I'm at right now and I don't know I don't know what to do it kind of stuck\n... what would be wrong with becoming a pilot\nUm well I researched it now that\n... and what do you make money out now\nI make fifty five\nPounds make a lot more than that show you got your show if you spent eighty and you made twice as much as you make now there'll be a good return on investment so that's not um ... what's the rest of the problem\nUm I get away from the family\nNow that's real as real but let's look at that do you have you done the research what is that going to based on the cost and you're going to do with cash so that's another issue you're going to do this cash so it's going to take a little\nBit in a while but are you willing to do what it takes to be in the air and fly\nI think I have to put my foot forward and at least attempt to try and see where it goes up at your pilot light Obama's grant that's right if I felt like it would I Would probably say yeah\nI see to hang its or is unequivocally yes I don't think it's probably is I think your heart is so clear everybody on the air can here\nHere's what I'm telling you you don't need to feel any guilt here's why\nYou've done the Dave Ramsey plan you're doing the play and you're going to continue to work in a job that's making you fifty five thousand you're going to castle as you go\nAnd because this is going to take maybe five seven years up making that up whatever it is you're going to do it as you go and that means you're not going to sacrifice that much time away from the kids number one number two you're not going to starve because you're going to stay in that day job while you're pursuing the dream job\nAnd by the time to get ready to be gone from being a pilot the kids are going to be a lot over\nAnd the kids are going to see that mom set our mind to something and pursued it the right way and\nIs happy and fulfilled what a tremendous life lesson an example you're going to be I don't see why you should have any guilt at all in fact I think you should be fired up about it and take one small step today\nWe might even guilt you if you didn't [laughter]\nExactly [laughter] I really appreciate it\nThanks for the call now reality is we're going to be a corporate pilot today she might be going a lot that's that's where I'm a little kids' books and that might not be our lifestyle the fish but this is a process for it's not it's not a snapshot these are not instantaneous that's where I can just push a button and decide your pilot no this is going to take some milk on I turned it\nBut let's let's let's play this out real quick folks you heard this if it takes her day five to seven years to ... between the eighty thousand cash flow plus the the classes and all the training that requires to become a pilot\nShe could still stay in that day job begin to do things on the side maybe she fly some tours on the weekends again the kids are still maybe early teens but just five years removed from that they're out of the house and then she can do full time but she can actually fly part time\nI mean we have to look at the big picture and this lady wants to be in the skies and she can do it\nWell I got to tell you the problem with that thing is it's addicting from what I hear oh ya know stark 'cause I Know I mean I Would give us a vast car so I Know you can't imagine how bad are get sucked into that that would be a bad idea ... says no don't yeah I can tell some things I don't need to start because I don't have to finish them\nLook it's a bird no it's ... it's a pretty scary out there in so many ways barbers on Instagram can she says I Am over Twenty years of experience should I have a two page resume with all my jobs listed instead of the suggested one page\nNo which is why suggested one page but let me explain why [laughter]\nI Love those costs you know we fought this thing through here's why\nThe average hiring manager David spinning somewhere between six and sixty seconds skinny interests me\nSo they all see all two pages anyway so if you look at the Ken Coleman show resume template how to fix your resume to Ken Coleman show dot com it's absolutely free\nGive it to read because we actually show you what to do but we explain why you're doing it that way and it's based on research so for hiring managers looking at that for less than sixty seconds\nThey want to see what's the most relevant to them to see if you can help them win that's all they care about they don't want to be impressed with you they want to know can this guy or gal helped me when and so\nI recommend is not your mother but I don't care they don't ... it all started all the honey Sony hillside ... Institute of God's ...\nWell you heard the phrase what have you done for me lately yeah think you ought to apply that to your resume we don't care about what you did Twenty years ago unless Dave it's relevant to the current roll your\nDo almost never is [laughter] I think that's safe to say almost never so no I think you should do one page\nYou know we've designed this resume tell but to be a brochure because folks that's what it is I graduated with a degree in computers in Nineteen Seventy four\nThere's no hope today exactly you can't even spell computer now it's completely different it's a completely different world show or what have you done lately that involve the computer or starting all relevant it's everything about the Ken Coleman show dot com\nYou can download the resume template but resumes by themselves are worthless\nThey're completely worthless and I love that because it's shocking people that they've you know this is true Ramsey solution it if you can give the data are the reality is folks that if someone's out walking your resume in to the person who's hiring for the job and said hey I Know this person through a friend of a friend or I Know them personally\nAnd I think they're solid individual to give them all your buried inside of a pile and it's like playing the lottery to get your resume noticed so that's what we mean when we say you got to do the work\nTo get a connection so the relationship is attached to your resume\nFifteen thousand applications here last year we are two hundred people case in point ... and ... is is logistically impossible for us to look at every one of them ...\nAnd not to mention you motivated is each one of us to go fight eagles to bring into this organization you want to keep crazy out so we're incentivized ... just to bring in somebody that we know\nCan fit the culture and can obviously fit the role that means competency character those type of things culture fit so that's why it's so important that you have a relationship\nYou can download the resume template but don't use it by itself that's what we're saying and completely free at Ken Coleman show dot com if you have questions and you want to talk to Ken on his ... show or on his podcast which are the same thing put out there on the phone number is eight to four four\nSeven four seven\nTwenty five Seventy seven you can follow him on Facebook or Instagram\nPet Ken Coleman show a or at can Coleman on Twitter as well he's got a book out called one question life changing answers from today's leading voices\nAnd against serious one Twenty one and one eleven is where you'll pick up the show and I'm sure you're sick Sam ... thanks for stopping by always fun day say always good to have some help for folks out there trying to get their\nCareer aligned with her passion\nShe runs the show in the book she'll be back with you before you know in the meantime remember there's ultimately only one way to financial peace and that's like with the prince of peace and Christ Jesus [noise]\nIt's like the production officer for the show and\nRevamp Dave Ramsey show app\nDid you know there are more than two million real estate agents in this country two million when all you want to do is\nBuy or sell a house you don't have time to sift through ads on line or email twenty different people to find a few agents you want to interview our real estate EL peas have years of experience and are the top agents and their markets in fact\nWe recommend less than one percent of the agents in the country that's why many of our listeners have success with an lp\nRichard in Mississippi did and this is what he had to say there are so many real estate agents today than it is refreshing to find someone like your ... the bill is experienced trustworthy and knowledgeable bill contacted me within a few hours of requesting information and was so professional in his presentation an approach\nIt was a no brainer do select him over any other agent\nFolks don't waste your time searching for the top agents in your area go to Dave Ramsey dot com and connect with an E.

that my wife and the ... parents trashed would be dispersed you find this to all the fisheries\nIncluding him we both agreed to front about Ninety percent of what the what we see with the understanding that he would immediately pay us back when the ... some of the logic was it they were ... they were already ... her parents trash\n'em as it today we have not distributed that money but it's getting it's getting a little stick here here it's going to be distributed next couple of weeks\nWe wouldn't do what you do in the meantime they've they took out I'm a ... a a a thousand dollar loans to pay off for months of overdo rent the otherwise they'd be I'm addicted and I got her life just does not want to work to help out\nSo my angle is interested in ... mirrors and because they have not demonstrated responsibility and came back to our loan I have strongly suggested ... and I I think that's about as far as that goes to my wife died that my wife write the check to them having come over and over ...\nAnd we would write them a check for the balance of what they didn't ... how do we didn't we didn't find them and it seems simple and we know that if we approach it that way that would be successful\nAnd lemonade the temptation I'm using a hundred and Seventy not clean his backers agreed and ... they might be more proactive to solving this\nShow how much a nine thousand

[laughter] I don't know five hundred six hundred hurt your household income [noise] uh I'm thirty maybe\nOkay right and let me just say oh you know here's my opinion this is all your fault\nMy fault yeah OK you loan the money that we're broke and don't handle money well and went against everything that you were supposed to have been taught by us which would you loan family money right you're the one made this mess\nI okay I take your job now and trying to correct or they're not making it worse yeah and so I'm\nWondering you could do as you say forget it I don't pay me back forget it I'm an idiot actually given your money I've never given you any more ever under any circumstances\nRight right it she she believes that that we should just be trusting mail the check to them and then hope they'll reimburse us\nEither ... or ... that my ... a hundred percent are not going to not soft and legally ridiculous assumption\nThat is not gonna happen you mail a check\nThem you're never going to see this money and then you're on the side of you know speak to your own show me the money or not it's just the crap you get into when you're alone family members money all your fault\nMaybe you want to if she wants to walk you through that that's fine but don't ever do the skin\nAbsolutely ludicrous\nFor all the trouble you cost you cause every minute\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities\nFood and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to sand or insurance dot com recall eight hundred three five six\nForty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and\nResponsible it really does make you the hero of your story and they put you on course for better things ahead\nNeeds me Ramsey news radio ...\nWell ...
