solutions Jeff from Washington DC drop by Jeff how\nAre you I'm doing great Dave how are you better than I deserve book how can I help you to ensure\nSet in the past few weeks or I've been thinking about my personal lives my personal professional wise and I'm I'm also in the process of building a defense contractor and building up a business you know within that\nMy question is are those same personal professor ... professional wise I'm able to be forklift it over to business wise is that it is that a good way to make a foundation for business um mission statement\nYes um it directly or indirectly your your business your career mission statement as a subset of you\nRight guy and so you've got a personal reason for a living or why what is it um what's my Nobel will cause me to nobility right what\nWhat am I doing this for one of ultimately and we know as much power money okay the reason we're piling up money is what you know and what are we going to do with it what is that we're trying to accomplish that's your personal thing and then a subset of that is your\nYour why in the different areas of your life the reason for your your mission statement so yeah you'd have a a personal mission statement so to speak um that that attaches to who you are and then your career your marriage your parenting your\nPhysical activity uh your intellectual growth your spiritual growth are all subsets of that then\nUh and so you create a holistic look at things but no they're not compartmentalize our department of laws like you don't count at work saying you know no it definitely forklift a over a in other words my personal\nDrive is underneath of this one this organization's mission statement and wise and reasons for doing things you know um and so\nYeah it's a neat question I don't know ... Noreen by asked that but that's that's my view on it um and of course my opinion is always worth what you pay for it but uh it just seems to me if you had a\nBusiness reason for being that was different than your personal reason for being or was not somehow connected it would be income grew it really\nDoes that make sense absolutely I mean it would be at cross purposes with each other if they weren't somehow running ... grew in parallel or subset or something but ... the way I visualize what the easiest for me a subset\nThat makes sense it does thank you very much thanks for stopping

two years ago my family was there and you're lobby and we did a debt free screen and a and then I feel like we've really been able to you know clear outfit opened up for our income to double in and out of really positive spiritual or you know directions that have opened up to us\nUm and those are you know that those things but we really thought it was sort of a recovered opening up because we were starting to do things right really what I see now is that he was preparing to throw it was ... it was about to come which is that we have a we have three boys the youngest is ten months [noise]\nAnd ah our youngest has Down syndrome\nAnd so uh well right now actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church and we're just getting to the part oil ah we're working on it will do it and so because we have this special needs a issue we we get involved or attorney in getting our will together good and through that conversation\nAnd also the valley of the home at that time what would be somewhere in the upper nine hundred to a million dollars [noise]\nUh what is the ah to go home so for ... and within a two or three block area of your house\nAbout the typical home and there's not really a typical home in our area it's\nAll over the place because of tours property there's you know Fifteen\nUnder square foot home and then there's also three million dollar homes across the street so I come from my home is about four four ten or twenty\nYeah that wasn't what I was asking I was trying to determine if you're trying to over build the neighborhoods doesn't sound like a no causes scenario not an area that's got this wide diverse a price range and that doesn't mean that goes I don't want you get building nine hundred thousand dollar home on a six hundred thousand dollar street\nRight yeah and I couldn't get out and we do have a to point three million dollar home just right around the corner and then there's an eight hundred and Seventy catty corner to where I Am at you know when does the baby I'm baby it'll do in the end of January\nOkay well sure when it started before then\nNo lower or have you go and play\nHave you got some plans for our own yet [laughter]\nI I've been working on that with an architect um were were you know running around what we're ... we want to do but or just um you\nKnow I've never spoken with any expert about this and I'm not sure if\nThis was a building you know I mean there's two or three factors one is um you don't want to build the neighborhood we address that too is you want to seek in your family handle you know construction noise\nFor a whatever time it takes you to put this thing up shouldn't be a nine day project maybe so two or three months can they put up with that well they ought to be able to leave her by just said so that's what we're going to do 'cause moving is more disruptive than that\nBy and this project that we are considering doing just because of the the industry that I man or thinking of going to it's more like a fix one project so I mean we're we're considering adding almost four thousand square feet to the home\nOh wow you're just almost rebuilding another home\n[noise] we had to basically tripling the size of the home now you know\nUh so you're going to end up mortgage when you're done then\nWhy a bigger mortgage or maybe I think we're gonna end up somewhere and the four twenty four thirty\nAnd what's your house I am\nHousehold income my my wife makes about ... about fifty five to six grand a month and I'm self employed so very that can go from\n... last year\nLast year we were I was somewhere in the ... area\nOkay what are you going to fly so worried about her income and you can afford a mortgage on a Fifteen year fixed when you're done but basically what you're going to be doing here is getting a construction\nLoan and then you're going to um reset the construction alone in a permanent mortgage is almost like you're building a house correct\nAnd you can tell you when you're done you need a fully you need a regular\nFifteen year fixed rate mortgage or the payment is no more than a fourth of your take home pay and if that's where you're going to end up and you've got a process to get there then yes I Would do that um I don't see any problem with it it's just a massive project in your living next door to it um yeah that probably is going to take six months um\nMost of the time when I think of an addition I don't think about four thousand ... ... four thousand square foot addition to a Nineteen hundred square foot house gender is weather's intact\nCannot Hi ginger how are you I'm doing All right good how can I I don't want to know\nIn my husband and I we have work constantly are ... ... and we have finally paid off our market share all of our cars everything everything we own our great we have so much I'm\nStill working that we are we have ... I thought OK charity math or a ... a year and me I'm a ... year next\nMhm and I couldn't tell me hey I'll wake up and say well now last night we had been saying all that entertaining mhm last\nNight I get hit by we had been putting our income that we weren't at saving living off of the security okay my question to you and when our retirement or our wetlands are fighting\nA that was out mhm and what I don't think it would be fine how are you here with our income on security\nWhat when she got much retiring at the end up next year\nYou know how old are you ... how old are you I'm sixty six seven okay and how much do you have in your ...\nOkay and the one we had a hundred and twenty thousand in our next act we have a lot at another hundred thousand\nMhm okay that's two hundred and twenty thousand yeah in a dish round numbers I mean if you made 'em ten percent on that between two thousand dollars a year okay okay\nI figured\nYou know and so if you invest and then we did that if you invested in it did that and then you add your Social Security too that um I mean you're not going to be living lavishly\nUh I mean you you have a few thousand dollars a month live all but I mean you got Fifteen hundred Eighteen hundred bucks a month coming up this money is what we're talking about here and I'm ... and plus your Social Security and if you can live on those numbers then you can retire if you want to\nBut a ... that's not going to be an easy I mean it's not going to be retiring in luxury\nUh but you should have fairly low expenses because everything's paid off so that's good\nUm I Love for you to have another hundred in there anyway but if you can work a little bit more in lock out that might be up not be a bad thing but if you guys are just you know you're done and you want to you want to live on that that's fine but I Would not set up a thing where I'm draining down\nThat two hundred and twenty systematically just to retire now because that's there's an end to that game called hunger and I don't want to get there\nYou don't want to destroy this goose so you just live off the gold and eggs only so whatever you know you sit down with your\nInvestment professional if you don't have one sit down with one of our smart vest her prose and talk about investing there's two hundred and twenty thousand in a way that you do that creates an income that you can live off of that plus your Social Security\nAnd if you can do that then you're in a position to do it\nAnd um but again it's not going to be um\nA a a a luxurious retirement you're not traveling the world and\nUh you know and that kind of stuff on this income um but but but\nI think you can do it it just a matter are you willing to live that frugally and what's your budget\nTogether and said these are the numbers and I'm going to live on less than this and that's the only way we can retire and then again sit down with us from Manchester pro clicks Mart best or they Ramsey dot com and

as dumb\nI Know I Know it I it's crazy to think that in fact like maybe not a country\nAnd ... they're broke yeah and I'm Wondering\nLike saying that's like saying I'm overweight and I'm going to lose weight and I'm actually doing it and all my overweight friends or making fun of my plan that's kinda dumb yeah\nYeah\nYeah I mean who cares what they think argument I won't even discuss it with them like somebody's been married sixteen times and they're going to help you with your marriage problem\nMan they got the honeymoon down they ain't got the marriage thing down\nYou know what I'm saying

marketing and emulate those things that's called best practices in business is the same thing here\nSo I mean I don't really care what you're broke French thing about money\nOr stupid [laughter] at all really I don't yeah\nSo what you've got to decide is do you have sufficient evidence that in your spirit in your mind and ... and and\nThat that the system that were laying out makes sense and you're really going to go do it and if you if you don't have sufficient evidence then don't do it but\nBut you know you shouldn't that would be unwise on your part I don't want you to blindly follow some voice on the radio that would be weird to you know but but you know read through the total money make over go to the financial ... class or something like that and then sit there and use your own critical thinking skills but don't let peer pressure from broke people tell you how to handle money\nOkay\nThat's not logical at all I mean they mean well but they're stupid [laughter]\nIt's not that they're you know they don't ... their life doesn't have any fruit in it you know I\nMean you have a friend that's really really bad at selecting the men that she dates advocate laugh I mean you would like would you take their advice on whether or not you're dating a good guy\nNow and I know all around there man meters broken right in the same\nThing here it's just it's just not logical so I I think you're asking the wrong questions of the wrong people or the right questions of the wrong people you're trying to get affirmation\nFrom a group of people that are not going to give you information because they don't have the\nThe uh the capacity to they don't have the knowledge to do it and their their life proves that so far I'm not it's not say they couldn't turn it around after you do\nBut um don't take financial advice from broke people so bad plant so hold on I'm going to send you a copy of the book the financial our total money make over and read through that and then you

you have a in your nest egg\n[laughter] well I have basically can ... the two pensions which are say it will be about forty thousand I have about\nA hundred and twenty thousand rental property that's equity mhm oh I have about fifty thousand in a ... ... um\nHow much do you own your mortgage\nI owe about sixty thousand all my primary residence which is also the farm which is probably as a two hundred thousand plus barrier\nMhm okay and what are you in in and um your your mortgage is on the rental too right\nI Do get so much um\n[noise] let's say two hundred and eighty thousand\nOkay so you need two hundred sixty thousand bucks to be debt free\nYeah I kind of plan on selling those was kind of my thinking what are they were a a\nA little less than four you know depending on the market street it for four different properties so\nSo are you married yes I Am as your wife work outside the home\nUh no she ... she has not worked for about three years she had knee surgery and then we took care of my talk show and she is a little older she is sixty one will be eligible for Social Security next year to the tune of about ... served in order to\nHave you sell the rentals and pay off your house you got about a hundred and fifty a hundred and sixty thousand bucks to your name is all was paid for farm you know fifty five years old and um and you got a pension or forty grand\nYeah OK\nAnd when you die what happens to the pension and it goes away right\nAh probably would go to my wife is she still living would would continue to receive a lesser amount that's probably because I could take I can take it as survivor and probably get more\nYeah but are you healthy yes\nI Would take it as no survivor give more by Fifteen year level term insurance to cover your wife if something happened to you it's a better deal yeah go ahead and take all the money you can get you know\nOkay I currently have a four hundred thousand dollar term policy so\nOkay yeah then that she's probably All right without the survivor benefit because that's going to replace your forty thousand dollars that you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay that that that invested ... percent will be forty grand so that that's pretty good\nYou're in good shape and you can probably do it this way um I Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\nYou're you're in a way above average shape I'm In good shape as is his way above normal 'cause normal just sucks okay you got it way better than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life for the next forty years is going to get old\nOh shallow wanting to go get a loan from the bank and by the car right\nOkay um\n[noise]\nWell I mean there's two there's two things that people here want one is she's grown person and you know we don't tell are grown kids what to do with merely try to influence them but the other the other thing that's a pool is is what I Do something\nTo what I participate in an activity was one of my children that I thought was bringing them harm even if they're grown and the answer to that would be no and you are working to get on a day your son is working to get out of that\nYou guys are made the decision that being in debt on cars on the other thing is is a bad idea it's not good for your finances and to turn around put her in debt or participate in an activity\nIs on an act of love\nAnd so um I appreciate her\nSentiment that she's standing on her own and she can do whatever she wants she is right but as your mom if I'm Ninety and you're eighty five and you're and you're Seventy or whatever I I'm Still going to love you and I'm Still not going to participate in an activity that's bringing your arm\nMhm I Love you too much to do that and uh you know and if you don't understand that I you know you have the right to be mad or you have the right to think\nThat I'm outlined but I'm just cannot in good conscience participate in an activity that's not good for you I Love you\nKnow I wouldn't sell it to her okay if\nIn power in your shoes I'm just thinking through how I Would I've got grown kids and one of them\nAnd to me and said you know I Want to do this thing and you're going to participate in this thing that that that I don't agree with and that I don't think is good without good for them that I'm not going to do with I should buy or five thousand dollar carpet cash for it\nMhm\nNow how much debt do you have not counting your home\nI mean we have a hundred thousand and what is your house or one eighty\nOkay so how quickly are you going to have a hundred thousand page do you think\nWe're looking at two years\nThat's about as low as it should take ... within fifty a year making one eighties not exactly deeply deeply sacrificing I'm now given all of those numbers four thousand dollars doesn't matter much you could just show or the car for four or five thousand\nOkay and not you know but no I won't sell it to you where you go into debt I'm not going to participate in that activity okay but if you want to sell it to our country and just help her um because of four thousand dollars doesn't move the needle much and out of a hundred you follow me what\nMy son and a lot of a hundred is you're getting really emotional about deeply sacrificing and using the huge income you have declared there's that really really fast so given those numbers I might\nGive up you know some of my value in the car or you got to scrape together five hundred and you pay me cash five thousand you can have the car I might do that but hunting I Am not going to participate you going into that\nYou're going to have if you're gonna do that you're going to do it somewhere else because I Love you too much to participate in something that brings harm to you\nAnd that's even if my kids are grown and that's not me interfering in their life and that's not me being a control freak it's I'm not going to participate in anything that I don't think is good for you that\nBrings you harm because I care about you and if they can't get that statement than they are option little rebellious twitch\nSeriously I mean that's just I mean if they can't hear love coming from you that way then there's something wrong but I in your case what the numbers I might if you're on your show to them cheap that's okay too\nBut he's in one's fine with me but no going into debt is not an option Amy is with us in Spokane, Washington Hi Amy how are you\nGood Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I've been listening to you for a couple of weeks and all of a sudden I started filling out college applications with my daughter my son's already in college and\nRight now I'm just like how did we get him into much debt already he's in two years\nThat he started his second year of school and my daughter will start like I said in the fall but he already has um like ten thousand dollars and a\nAnd school loans and then we have fourteen thousand and apparent PLUS Loan [noise] mhm\nAnd it so I'm just struggling and know how do I get through this thing how do I get them through college\nWhere Izzie in school a Washington state university and kind of what is the tuition\n[noise] ah about well the first year at twenty seven that ... it is um around\n[noise] I Can't even think\nTwelve eight twelve thousand okay felt that probably pretty close down a little off\nBut it should be about there in state tuition at school or something like that the national averages about ten but I think Washington is a little bit higher okay and so um that's the tuition only and he's living away from home on campus you\nKnow he's not living on campus you know the thing in a house race paying very minimal for rent\nOkay that's good news okay is it working\nYes he works about twenty five hours per week right now but it does make about fourteen dollars an hour\nThat's decent okay good good okay\nAnd we got to get him on a really really tight budget immunity to be applying for scholarships left and right yeah you got to help him sit down and figure out what you can contribute to the equation ... between his hard work between the scholarships and you can your contribution and the fact that he's in a reasonably inexpensive school\nUm we just sit down and really are and the wrinkles out of this and figure out how we can\nPull it all together and make it happen with no more debt and don't add any more debt\n[noise] okay so then my question is we had the third we have a car loan where\n\nWe have a car loan for Thirteen thousand five hundred dollars and then I got he's got the ... PLUS Loan now do I start hammering on the parent PLUS Loan or do a camera on the car loan Karl\nI'm a car loan and then the parent plus on yes\nOkay because I didn't know if that 'cause it you know when you go down your um yeah um I didn't know investor kids was\nThis number five but we're not investing for now trying to cash flow with them yeah help him get through with no more new debt you're you're not you're past the point of saving for college or trying to get through college now\nAnd then my daughter who's starting in the fall she is selling out scholarship she does have we do have some money you know not much but a little bit of money saved\nSure I'm\nGood just work like an animal and she has only out like ten scholarship applications a day\nAnd again she chooses an inexpensive school the least expensive option possible because you guys are broken you're trying to hold us together as a family and get these two kids through school it can be done but it's going to require a lot of work a lot of scholarships and choosing the inexpensive school and there is no shame in that game\nWill be will do it every day and other people go a hundred\nThat puts us our room to show in the ... we got to know what it means um remember there's ultimately only one way to me and that store dating with the prince of peace prize ...\nAssociate producer invoked trainer for the ... the pay this hour the show is over but you can find our podcast on ideas are good will play where everywhere every year to surf yeah\n\n\nHey I'm Christy right and I'm all about equipping women to make money doing what they lost one of the questions I hear all the time\nIs how I Know what business I should start some people have a ton of ideas while others have a hard time coming up with one finding your idea can be overwhelming\nBut it doesn't have to be I can help I'm so excited to tell you about my brand new course business idea boot camp for stepped course you need to go from dreaming to doing in this course I'll show you how to brainstorm all of the ideas from the most important areas in your life\nHow to identify which ideas to focus on\nHow to test and narrow down your ideas\nAnd how to identify action steps that bring your best idea to live by the end of this course you will be ready to chase their dreams and turn your idea into income I Can't wait to start this journey with you I Want to help you find your best business idea\nSign up for business idea boot camp at business boutique dot com that's business boutique dot com WTC chaos so that\nBy heart radio station now Fox News radio covers the world on news radio Ninety seven points out an\nEnding his citizenship policy I'm Lisa ...
