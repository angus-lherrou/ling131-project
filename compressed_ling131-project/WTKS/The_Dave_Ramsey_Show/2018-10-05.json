the time you were doing this or how long did the hundred and fifty two thousand plus or a hundred ... it took us seven point eight years love it [laughter] and your range of income during that time we\nStarted out David a hundred and eight thousand dollars a year and now we're north of two hundred thousand which is awesome\nYeah yeah or the kids are all gone yet\nWe have one at home but we never see her he just started her freshman year at nursing just thinking as your income\nWent up you got rid of all the payroll yes we're saying we love it love it and got rid of the dead on top of that so

thing top to bottom yeah weld on and live life while you're doing it with college and cars and the whole bit yeah [laughter] wow very fine\nSo tell me the story what got you started on doing this seven point eight years ago\nSo I'll take this one [laughter] so I was at work Dave and I was talking to a good friend of mine named Josh and he was telling us about his ... story and I started reading I started listening to you and I came home one day and I was just mad well and\nHe really wasn't mad he was passed I don't know if\nI Want to step past ... yeah I was pissed off [laughter] so tish I said\nThey we've worked so hard I'm and\nGod's blessed us so much and here we sit and we got nothing to show for it yeah um and you know it\nYou know it just really tore us up and so that day we went out and we bought a home study kit\nAnd we forced um all four of our kids to go through the Thirteen week home study kit with us while I'm and we did it and what's awesome David all four of our kids now live on a budget they're all just kill it and they're doing what we should have done when we were seen in\nTwenty yeah so how they like to say we were torturing them I'm sure yeah like I say Ramsey is a cuss word Thirteen weeks that he felt it was even longer torture sessions you should have been at the Ramsey house when we made our kids go [laughter]\nThat was nasty\nIt was ugly wow well why do you guys so it took so what was the biggest thing you learned that you tell people this is how we got out of that we did this this and this\nAnd I love to use them hope but I like to use the across steak for help um I think first being honest with yourself and saying you screwed up you did this you got to get out of it right\nI'm looking for options and opportunities if you don't use it sell it and if you're not working go to work and pay for a plan to do the budget due this year ... budget do the baby sat and do it in order don't don't become a genius on your own you know and then he\nThe laws change or something called net metering out there where you make more power than you need when the sun's out your meter\nEffectively turns backwards and so you're kind of put in power back in the bank how I roll over minutes used to be on on on that night\nHe pulled back off of those ... those watch that's going away you'll you'll save on the power you make while you're amount it you know but but you won't put anything in the bank so I mean that would return on investment meal virtually nonexistent when that happens ruin it goes how\nAs not enough it becomes a lot less than half and right now it's about a ten year rate of return\nAnd all that is too long anyway so I Would also do the ...\nIf I don't add to it I should have practice that there's a lot of start up stuff that's in that first ten thousand [noise] and then it cost the cost to go forward from there\nI wouldn't have to live with it if it didn't have a five year break even\n[noise] so it didn't have a five year break even don't even less what\nI wouldn't do it because here's the problem technology is changing so fast\nAnd the marketplaces changing so fast I mean solar panels five years ago versus several panels now solar panels ten years ago versus now\nOn the ... light years different oh yeah in in what they do and what they cost for that matter and so I'm number one let's pretend you were sitting debt free and I had like a pile of cash in the bank um I personally wouldn't vote for the ... even then\nIf it was just extra money laying around like only a five year break even I wouldn't I don't think it economically makes sense but aside from that discussion you just don't have the money\nThat is true you're in debt\nAnd or if you can get there by the end the year you can be dead free have your emergency phone in place and then by these things\nBy your starter system if you want to get in and you can do a five year break even that way but I don't think you can hit all of that with what you're telling me that is a lot yeah and so I just I I Can't tell you I I mean I I'm a fan of solar panels in general\nI'm but I'm a fan but the only way obviously I Would tell you it's by pay cash for it and I wouldn't tell you to take it out of your emergency fun to do it so doing it instead of an emergency fund is the same thing sure and\nSo I I you know I Would be inconsistent and I got you know the answer questions or what would I Do know what I Know I got ... ... here's the thing Jeff I have laid these principles in place in my life personally like I don't borrow money like we don't use the emergency phone except for emergencies no matter what ever\nPeriod and it has caused me to walk away from some things\nLike that I really did want to do like you really want to do this and you're going to walk away from it at least for now unless something changes in after our conversation right\nBut um you know if you do what I tell you the you're going to walk away from his cause me to do that and I kind of went yeah gosh ... lord what are you doing here come on God show up you know you don't mean don't you like solar panels go I mean\nYou know seriously and um I walked away from some stuff and then thirty six months later\nFour years later I look back and I go oh that's why I wasn't supposed to do that\nYou know that that that that rearview mirror hindsight is twenty twenty\nI mean you can tell what was going on when you look back but you don't know going forward but I Do know that want to violate the principles I always lived to regret it using the emergency fund for something other than emergencies\nAnd I've not done that because she earned and I got burned so bad and we went broke the scars were so deep the lesson was so thorough that we don't borrow money\nFor anything ever\nAnd we don't even use the emergency fund for emergencies I mean much less anything else because that fund is like\nIt's like sacred to her because of the scar that is in our lives from having gone broke she just it's been Thirty years and she still can remember the taste in her mouth that that terror\nBrought that level of fear brought and so we really we don't even use the emergency run for emergencies\nI mean it's you know we got a big pile of cash and for no apparent reason other than it's S. W. I. Sharon once it you know and and you know even then something comes up we just either we cash flow it or we wait a little bit because we don't even do use emergency funds for emergencies so that's that's\nServed us so well over song long a period of time Jeff I think I Would be doing you a disservice to tell you to do something I wouldn't do even though I get while you're doing this and I intellectually grasp your argument or your your your um\nYour conflict in this discussion so I'm not against solar panels I Want them to break even quicker and what you pay cash for a\nMatter of fact I'm a fan of solar panels and I've been divorced them in several cities but that's the case thanks for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Bridget is with us in Dallas Hi Bridget how're you\nHow bad hey what's up\nI'm going to be a program in last night I could add a beast got wind and started our they each got too good and then I came across and medical bills that were in my ... he paid off and\nLet me that we now have a healthy to count and I've only been listening to the show trial few weeks and I haven't really heard much about how the ... I was just curious if I can pay the bills to health savings account should or should I say that as like a\n... my emergency fund and we do have three small children and I didn't know they get a break van ...\nLike there are ... you know I'm you know we wish we spent some time with staples in the emergency room with our kids as part of growing up but um I think it is anyway it was it rained jail but uh uh so uh yeah\nI Would use your ... your H aside to pay medical bills with and there's two reasons\nIf you take a thousand dollars home and pay taxes on it it turns into seven hundred dollars and then you pay medical bills with that if you put it into your a chess say the whole one thousand can go towards your medical bills so it's as if the government pay three hundred out of every thousand for you\nBy by running any medical expenses through the ... say and um and you can always go back later and more to it when you get further along in your get out of debt build up my emergency fund baby steps plan but for right now I think you're on to something I Would how much is in the just say\nI'm right now they only have ...\nAnd how much in medical bills do you have\nA guy that came out\nOkay so it's not going to wipe it out or anything you're still ... yeah I you know that's six hundred bucks is a tax free methodology to pay your bills and medical bills and any other money you can dump into that age essay through payroll doc loaded up and run it back out to pay that other ten thousand because you're saving thirty cents on the dollar\nUm okay so I was under the impression that I could hear a check for bail family acquired we've had a\nCall now that may be true yeah okay yeah so it would have to be something that came up after that but now you can you can ... you need to double check that out I think you're right but I'm not I'm not an expert on that part I could give you a wrong answer and you need a better\nAnswer than mine because I could screw this up but I I think well I think you're right though but I Would double check it because there's some money on the line you know\nBut anything any medical bill you can run through that age as he is going to save you roughly thirty cents on the dollar and so anything that does qualify I wouldn't do that no question about it a good question I give her joining us with version having used a new listener and not about what's this particular our in the book\nOr something to drink jobs like Thompson's our senior executive producer killing Daniels Russian there's room phones Springer I'm Dave Ramsey or [noise]\nSo we have\nYou guys hear me say all the time\nThat if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else I'm so excited to introduce our brand new book\nEvery day millionaires how ordinary people built extraordinary wealth and how you can to written by number one national best selling author Kris Hogan his book is based on the largest study ever done what ten thousand millionaires and the results will shock you\nYou weren't going to keep hitting me with these negative things and you know I the only problem is I could make you Bethany is it's worth it to fight for it\nIt's hard but it's worth it\nBecause when you get the other side of this you'll be like a lady I met the other day I was down in Melbourne, Florida speaking at a a calvary chapel they're taking their whole church through financial peace university and when I finished speaking on Saturday Night a lady walked up to him and she said you know about your age I'm In my fifties and\nI just want to tell you what happened I've been working for this company thirty seven years and they laid me off last week no notice just drop me kick me to curb black next week's trash\nShe set out her mad driving home tears running down my face out scare where am I going to do I've lost my job\nAnd then she said and then I thought wait a minute I'm okay\nI've got several hundred thousand dollars a month for one guy I've got six months or my merges you from I don't have any payments I've been doing this day Ramsey financial piece stuff I'm living the hammer handling money God's rush and I'm obey okay\nAnd she said all of a sudden when I just add to the reality of my situation and then I got twenty thousand dollars in the bank for my emergency and I got a couple of hundred grand and my four oh one K. and I got no payments I took that reality and I thought you know what\nI'm going to be okay\nAnd you know what will happen is you'll find a job making more than she used to make up the place they kicked her to the curb best what'll happen to her and that's what we prayed for her that night that that would happen\nSo she's the other side of where you are Bethany she's pushed through and then when something bad happened and Murphy shows up\nOne Murphy shows up and you're out of debt and you have your emergency funding emergencies no longer an emergency it's an inconvenience\n\nYou you know when you get your act together it change Murphy had does not have the power over you that he used to have\nBut when you're broke and I remember being broke when you're broke every little thing is a big drama is like everything that can go wrong will you live looks like a country song you know what I'm Talking about\nI mean it when you're broke it just seems like there's no way and you've got to do something to fight away from the broke land I mean you've got to get out of the land of the broke right\nSo that when Murphy shows up you can hit him with a baseball bat does he does show up\nHe shows up and all of our watch\nOnly difference is whether you're ready for him [laughter] so you come and buddy [laughter]\nYou're not fully you show up at the wrong house we're ready for you\nSee that's a different situation isn't it and what we've learned is over these Thirty years of coaching people in walking through this ourselves is that our mindset the way we look at it at our level of hope causes us\nTo sacrifice to win and if you live like no one else later you're going to live and give like no one else\nNo discipline seems pleasant at the time but it yields are harvester righteousness the Bible says\n\nNo discipline seems pleasant at the time but it yields\nHarvest of righteousness pretty simple idea and Bethany on which hard oh I can promise you he is worth it

life and your money [noise]\nJohn is on Facebook what do you think of group life insurance is is a life insurance today um\nGroup life insurance means that you're buying life insurance through your company that's what you would have to mean by that that's the only type of group life insurance that is because you can't buy life insurance on the dark roof\nYou buy a lot of insurance on individuals you could be it can be furnished to you through your company as a benefit and or you could buy it as a part of your group health insurance benefits package or life insurance benefits package um\nI it's okay to buy that\nEach usually if you are buying it now if it's free of your employers furnishing it frees free shut up okay but if you're paying for it it's usually not and that much cheaper it's maybe a tiny bit cheaper the big problem is is not portable and what that means in the insurance world as you leave the company\nYou can't take it with you so let's say you had a\nCancer scare or a minor heart attack and now you're not sure\nYou get diabetes now you're not in ...\nAnd you leave that company you got in a life insurance that you can't take this with you so it's okay to have a little at the company but I wouldn't have it all their lives is that I Ramsey show [noise]\nAll big giant extraordinary things start from ordinary things that may start from changing the ordinary

alright regulations they very nice so what happened after twenty seven years after twenty five years twenty six months ago the started this\nUm [noise] well it really does go back a long time um\nFor the first twenty something years of age we really didn't have what you call do an income problem mhm I was always trying to cut the budget he was always trying to increase the income ... um and so that led to a lot of credit card debt\nAnd then we decided to increase our income by going back to school but unfortunately we did that um with student loans and then we had ... in student loans and then in two thousand fourteen we finally got tired of the credit card debt and cut up the cards and that afternoon way talent broke his ankle\nSo that required surgery as soon as he got off the catch is our son fell and broke both of his arms and that required surgery had credit card that school loans and ... of course yeah and so I'm In two thousand Fifteen\nI sat down to do our income taxes that

when she does you pay attention as right yeah I hear you very cool\nAssuring Ramsey is not a crier either a and if she does some serious was going on so you are stop and take note very cool boil congratulations so obviously know early you been doing the budget all these years or trying to\nAnd when you drug into financial peace university the free spirit pasture here uh did you uh what what happened then with the two of you on your interaction about\nMoney the change that process it has improved\nOh yeah I did if I'm the first night of finance because university I cried through about half of it you know the Holy Spirit conviction along with you know the message that was coming through just them\nIt changed and and you know it really\nIt takes a change in mindset is what I say I just had to change my mind set you know the Bible says that were transformed by the renewed over mine and I had to have my mind renewed\nThe funny thing is I was working at FedEx part time delivering packages and I would listen to your show mhm I wasn't doing a thing you said there's nothing you after you every day you know so the fees are being planted but now when that time came as news time\nYeah the entertainment squid and the actual listening began as\nFun very cool you know that's what what I signed the ... ah the total money make over book with the scripture I use Romans twelve to to be transformed by the renewing of your mind and don't be conform to this world they're crazy out there don't be don't be like everybody else they're nuts and\nMy pastor always so don't let the world teach theology and you know and\nAre so good stuff you guys so what do you tell people when they find that you got forty nine thousand dollars worth of debt paid off what do you don't like the keys to getting out of debt are\nBut like I said one of the change in mindset um you know I uh I always wanted to drive a new car I never bought a brand new car but I had that mindset that you're always going to have a car payment and so you know you pay for a car for five or six years and they would against you think that we get another payment and uh so we have not had a car payment for four\nYears we were driving to very old cars one is sixteen years old the other one's eleven years old while\nBut we drove it up here from South Carolina this morning and it made it fine so it made it finally gets us where we need to go and you know never again never again\nWell now you don't really pay much you can save up in ... bottom below a better car that's right yeah what about you know early what are usually the keys to getting out of that are\nAnd I'm In of course it's very front loaded the first three or four years all of the extra that you're paying instead of going to savings goes to fees and so you get no cash value build up for the first one to three years\nSomething like that and um and then of course when you die the only thing they pay even though you paid extra create the savings account\nThe only thing they pay is the face value and show the money you paid in a savings account you'd lose so you have a savings account that has a bad right of return and when you die they keep your money that's just not a good plan um the uh the universal life is the newer version of that um or the next newest version\nOh I'm the oldest of the cash value plans the universal life was in an attempt to make it a little bit better and\nIt pays a I'm a better rate of return typically I'm most universal life will average net of fees around four and a half to five percent right of return uh so it's more like an annuity ah and I was an insurance company more like a fixed annuity top of a product\nAnd then the the biggest downfall with universal not only that keep your money when you die but the other downfall is is the you pay one set amount per month\nAnd the insurance\nCost the amount that goes to insurance versus the amount that goes to savings the amount that's going to the insurance goes up every year as you get older so that by the time you get really old with universal the amount you're paying may not even cover the insurance\nYou have zero going into savings and sometimes some of the money is coming out of the cash value to actually support the policy because you're not paying enough to pay their insurance premiums because insurance costs ... universal goes up every year a but even with that it's slightly better\nThan whole life or both you know it's just one socks and one such worse you know that's all it is and then the next one up the next version that came out was called variable life\nAnd if you ever hear of that that's another version and basically what they did there is in the savings portion that put mutual funds in there and you can choose the mutual funds inside your very alive policy and you get a much better right of return\nNet of fees you'll make about seven percent usually on that\nBut the problem is those mutual funds were paying twelve to Fifteen and you're making seven which tells you what the fees are they charge a lot of fees on these things\nAnd so I'm sure there's just a fee everywhere every corner you go around where you're dealing with an insurance company so the bottom line is with life insurance anytime you're saving money\nWith life insurance companies you're going to get feed the death you're going to get a sub standard rate of return and an almost every case they're going to keep your money when you die\nAnd so that all makes it just a horrible place to pay money into a savings account that when you keep your mouth that they keep your money when you die and so that's why we recommend and always have recommended than I personally have always bought\nOnce I got my head screwed on and understood how the math work um I actually bought whole life one time from a rip off company called northwestern mutual but I was in my twenties and I was stupid\nUm do a lot of stupid stuff in my life and that's one of the stupid things so yeah I'm\nUnbelievable but ah and they're like the most expensive one of the worst ones out there you know so horrible horrible products so we buy term life insurance which costs about five dollars a month instead of a hundred dollars a month or one twentieth\nFor the same amount of insurance and I put my other Ninety five dollars anywhere else\nFor investing I put it in a fruit jar and I come off better off than those guys and so I put it any anywhere else and\nAnd so what you end up with is eighty percent of the people that sell life insurance for a living and that's all they sell or out of the business in one year\nYou have an eighty percent turnover in the whole life life insurance world and here's here's why the business model is basically this the general agency hire someone in order to get to their friends and family\nAnd the News New insurance salesman is used to get to friends and family\nAnd then once you've worked through their market what's called their natural market uh then their ability to sell insurance to strangers is ... is just horrible it's it's never happens and so they very seldom may get once they run out of their list\nAnd so they milk the their list they milk their relationships and then they turn over that's why there's such a high turnover rate and that's generally the business model now I Know guys that are northwestern mutual agents or Pacific Life agents or New York live agents that have been in the business for twenty five or Thirty years but they're the ones actually learned how to sell insurance\nAnd they don't and some of them are generally agents and they you know they hire people to work their list is what it amounts to knowing that they're probably not going to make it after they run through their list\nBut that's kind of how that business works and it's kind of an old model honestly it's pretty much dying or the old whole life life insurance is kind of a Nineteen fifties sixties even seventies thing but by the eighties nineties and certainly up into the two thousands\nI mean no one tells you to buy cash value insurance anymore anywhere that is a credible financial mind except people to sell it\nThe only people that recommended or those salad\nYou just can't find anybody that's an independent third party like me I don't know either one I don't care what you buy I endorsed ... term insurance was cause I Believe in term insurance and no I don't own Zander insurance Jeff Landry rooms and her insurance she's an advertiser\nBut a whole life couldn't buy an ad on this show for any amount of money we wouldn't sell it to them because it's not good product\nJust like a payday lender written by ad on the show when my you know me endorsing enter a car leasing company couldn't buy an ad on the show because they're rip off products credit card you know we're not gonna have a day Ramsey credit card coming out I can just assure you that and they all kind of fall in that same category it's a rip off it's a bad product\nAnd do it and you know the reason is a bad product is not a moral judgments\nIt's a math judgment the math is bad\nYou know when you borrow money it eight hundred percent interest on a payday loan\nThe math is bad\nWhen you ... when you save money in a whole life policy die and they keep your money your savings accounts that dumb the math is bad\nWhen you run out the cost to Capitol on a car fleece and you find out the average person who could pay cash for a car but instead is policing the car their costs to Capitol translation their interest rate is up or to fourteen percent on a typical car place not someone with a one credit\nAnd so the math is bad it's a bad product\nThe Consumer Reports smart money magazine my calculator will tell you the most expensive weight on the cars to police it right and so the math is bad so if you sell those things and you know the math is bad that puts your morals and your ethics in jeopardy\nIf you don't know\nAnd you're just honestly stupid and you're just honestly stupid I've been honestly stupid time or two in my life been a long time I don't ... I certainly don't do it anymore but\nI mean I've done some not I mean some things that I didn't know there were bad for\nI Believe they were good and I'm telling everybody go no you know for go borrow your mortgage I did that when I was Eighteen years old and my little stabilizes you'll get your dirty your mortgage what else do the math is ... and you have bad advice from an Eighteen year old over engine run you you want to actually go right\nAnd all that stuff oh God do them I\nThis hour Ramsey show in the back with you before you know and in the meantime remember there's ultimately\nFinancial base and that's the one day be price Jesus\nGuy like confidence senior executive producers David and show this hour the show is over but don't forget about her YouTube channel where you can submit show why weren't\nOn the show is live it's part of our commitment to make a show of\nAll it takes is one emergency trip to the dentist to blow your budget quickly now I'm not a fan of dental insurance I think it's a waste of money but there is another option it's called one dental and it's not dental insurance one dental as a discount program that functions like a membership\nClubs think of it like Costco you join for a small yearly fee and you say big time every time you use it I'm Talking discounts on all procedures from routine cleaning ... all the way to root canals plus\nYou can choose from tens of thousands of Dennis from all across the country including orthodontics for kids and adults and if you've already been told by a dentist that you need a procedure but you haven't gone yet it's not too late to safe and join one dental schedule your appointment with a one dental provider and save big instantly\nKnow waiting just instant membership and\nMore of that kind of get up in fact I mean I I don't want to ... you know he's got to talk to but I think yes we accept the responsibility\nNow I don't know that you are necessarily hard to talk to you just abandoned her\n\nYeah you ... your laughter out in the cold she was doing the best she couldn't she screwed it up really bad and was really a shame to tell you it sounds like that's the way it goes the reason I'm asking\nAnd the reason I'm poking at you a little bit is because it changes what to do with the twenty nine thousand okay now the other possibility is and I don't think that's what's going on here but you tell me because I'm asking you is the other possibility is a this woman is a ... fever she's a liar\nAnd she's running around hiding stuff because she's fine whatever she wants and there's an arrogance to this not repentant still dish\nI don't think I don't think I hear that no okay\nIt all we got to do is commit both of you to say never again and every time there's something really stupid and it leaves a big mark on me you know leaves a big scar I always get a never again out of it\nYou know like never again do I do business with American Express cause I called my wife one time when we were going broke and ask her why should stay with the man they wouldn't pay his bills and she called me crying because she was thinking the same thing right [laughter] I don't think this was American Express never again never again\nThat was thirty five years ago I still remember I'm Still redneck pissed about it right so never again never again do I borrow\nMoney never again do you to\nGo a single month\nWithout both of you agreeing on the spending and knowing where the money is and where it's gone to the rest of your lives both of you are managing this company called you incorporated\nTogether now one of you as an administrative gift that will actually write the checks more than the other one but the other one whoever that it is that probably is her actually it sounds like um they might be you I don't know who writes the checks I don't care but we're going to be in agreement on paper\nOn all of our spending for the rest of our lives and we're going to pinkie swear and spit shake we're never going to spend over five hundred dollars again without talking to the other person ever under any circumstances because we're married and we liked and we'd like to stay that way\nYeah okay if you can do that then pretty simple we'll just take the twenty nine thousand and start working our way out of this mass and you've got to start doing the budget together jump on every dollar I'm going to sign you up for every dollar plus I'm a pay for it\nBecause you guys need to be on the same page on each of your phones you can put on your phone and connect it to your bank accounts and every time they're spending it'll pop up on each of these phone gives you this built in accountability built in agreement that the budget is being executed has agreed\nAnd we ride up the budget on every dollar\nEvery month before the month begins every dollar has an assignment we decide what we're going to do with it together and then if one of the rights of checks us fine but to gather and we don't do anything ever with money except what we have agreed to on this paper this paper is a contract before the month begins you're following me\nCall and if you guys will do that now who's ... who's a free spirit who's the detail person which one I\nMean you're the detail person yeah administratively gifted okay and you ask the free spirit to do the gift to do the accounting on menu double dip and um okay so you got to do you're probably the natural person to write the checks out you'd like detail she hates them\n\nCorrect yeah so I mean you ... if if we were going to hire someone for you incorporated to do the accounting we would hire you to do the accounting not heard of the the accounting and it's not a male female thing it's an administrative gifting thing\nYeah okay so that's probably what Rene but we're both going to be an agreement in other words we're not taking all of this away from her and giving it to you to do without her input we're not going to swing the pendulum the other way both of you agree on all of your spending\nAnd I mean it's tight Ninety Days of doing this you'll get in a rhythm\nUh six months of doing it your trust and communication will be\nTwenty five fold what it is right now in your marriage is really going to have a positive impact on your marriage because Jesus said your treasure for your heart is in when you spend your money together\nYou're agreeing on your dreams you're agreeing on your fears you're agreeing on your values you're agreeing on your priorities and when you're in agreement on that it's it takes a great it takes a good marriage and makes a great\nAnd I really think you're ... you're probably I probably got pretty decent marriage are you where I Would have killed each other for up for you call me\n[laughter] yeah we we got a great marriage that and that's what I Want to look forward to making it better and then doing this together and like I said not not leaving her out to dry you know that was definitely my fault I appreciate that poke\nYeah well I mean are trying to figure out in that\nA number one I mean she screwed up to ... okay I I Do some on her but but I was just trying to figure out who she is because now we just take that point on thousands and we start working the baby steps which means the forty ... most of it to the forty thousand and start clearing up these credit cards and drop 'em all up into little Biddy pieces [noise]\nHold on we'll get you signed up just to give him a year of every dollar floss okay I'm not even sure how to do that but we'll figure

debt free congratulations\nHas our call anything like that phrase scream\nLove it how much of you guys paid off\nFour hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars\nHow long does that say about twenty four month man and your range of income during that time\nYeah we started off at about a hundred K. and then we picked it up to about three hundred thousand\nWow what are you guys do for a living\nSo I'm an executive recruiter for GE and then um I also teach part time with a multitude of uh on line universities\nAnd and I miss that she had director in HR for gateway turkey in South Texas\nOh God that's my friends very cool so you're working for Robert okay cool that's a good for you guys were great income four hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars what kind of that was that\nYeah it was basically student loans the majority of it about three hundred and Seventy about actually render a sixty nine thousand of dollars about student loan to them tax bill we had about twenty nine thousand and then are too small credit cards about forty five hundred and then we cash flow to wedding about Fifteen thousand man\nYou guys are a lot of student loan debt he thought oh yeah [laughter] yeah or you know things where you just overwhelmed by that that oh yeah oh yeah that was it so ah did you cash flow every bit of this\nI yeah yeah we did\nI mean you just that that's an amazing number in twenty four months even with the fabulous income you've had that's still very incredible very well done so tell me your story what happened twenty four months ago\nI made that fell and she and I were engaged and and we had to came to the table with like his college education and then my college education\nAnd and it was astronomical so we just realized like that with and settling and very easy for us now pretty much when we first started and our marriage we immediately got on the bandwagon to pay off and are standing around\nAnd my sister and she had actually introduced um you two are the only about Fifteen Years ago and I remember\nFeeling I remember that feeling of being overwhelmed and I told her she was like ... and you know they ran the really helped a little with just the budgeting to get this out of their way and so we just kind of knew like this that we didn't have the peace I'm really for it to just live life with his own\nShow and we both made that decision to just start off and really from the very thick anywhere like we're going to do the same thing while extreme but we are going to do that\nI mean you guys you had an extreme situation so you brought extreme measures to deal with it\nAnd he ... he has\nVery very short while\nAmazing so what do you tell people the key to paying 'cause I mean you're the story everybody's talking about you know in in the news and all these these young people are overwhelmed with student loan debt they're all dying they're gonna you know their whole generation is stunted and all this stuff and yet\nTwenty four months later you're done with four hundred and Eighteen thousand you're impressive\nThat's amazing so what in the world what do you tell people the key to getting out of debt is\nUm I Would probably say just getting on the same page um you know we've been married now for about two and a half years and I think\nJust getting on on kind of just getting out of bed and being on the same page in terms of our money I think that was really huge um you know just getting on the same page and also not being afraid of hard work um you know I think one of the things that you say constantly and I really like it you say that\nYou know when you decide to get smart with your money it's kind of like God look down and said hey I can trust that one and you know I think that's something that kind of happened with with us 'cause\nYou know a lot of different opportunities started coming our way in terms of just income and and just of course a lot of increases came our way as well and so God just begin opening those doors than we were able to pay off with a much quicker are a lot quicker than we thought because\nLike Virginia even mention in the beginning it was definitely very overwhelming I mean just looking at all the student loans we thought how you're going to pay this off are we going to get home do all these different things start a family but um you know definitely go with our side and and of course you know he was able to open up those doors for us to get on the same page and be able to pay off this in a pretty good time\nYou know how how do you explain to other people will cause I Know I Know what the answer is but\nHow do you explain to other people the level of intensity that is required 'cause you guys I mean it was not panic but you were focused to the point that you sacrifice so deeply that normal people looking at you all had to think you lost your mind I mean you guys were on your game on", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Savannah", "day":
