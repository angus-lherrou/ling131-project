Want to talk to all of us live a nights are big family or a big town hall meeting here why do you work every day\nThose of you who are retired and you spent decades working why did you work everyday\nTo take care of your family\nTo provide for your family to take care of yourself this is what you were taught this isn't a very very important American tradition\nWhy do you go to church or synagogue or your mosque or so for why do you do that because you're believers and even if you don't many of you have faith is not most of\n\nYour faith do you believe in family what else do you believe in you believe in your country the United states of America you're proud of your country\nYou're proud\nOf your declaration of independence and your constitution you're proud that this is an exceptional nation you're proud of our history warts and all\nYou're proud of the fact\nThat we fought in World War one and the good guys one\nYou're proud of the fact that your country and some of your family fought in World War two undefeated Adolf Hitler\nAnd ... and ... at great cost you're proud of the\nMen and women who have served this nation and war after war you're proud of the men and women\nTo protect us on our streets and in our communities you love this country well let me tell you a little secret there are people who have exactly the opposite view and they're trying to\nUm well I mean typically a Christian school is a private school and there's going to be more expensive and then the question you've got to say is if we go that route it pays off our home in\nSeven years if we go the other route it pays off our home and three years is it worth four more years or whatever the number is you just run your numbers out I just made those up okay\nBut in other words is going to delay the mortgage being paid off if you go the more expensive school route in order to get that world view which is fine and um now I Will tell you having educated a paid for the education for three kids that are now adults\nAnd having participated in this discussion a multitude of times with friends that are Christians and and we are obviously to um [noise] that you need to be very careful if you're going to invest in a a a a private Christian school that they are actually\nImplementing that belief system\nThere are some that have a Christian heritage that are no more matching with my value system that fly to the moon\n[laughter] just ... they once had something that was Christian and on and sometimes they are still holding themselves out as Christian schools but the values that they're tenured professors are bringing into the classroom and nothing to do with the values of miles\nAnd show if I'm going to do that I might if I Will be on the enemy territory I might as well know that I'm On enemy territory\nInstead of a wolf in sheep's clothing kind of thing so if you're going to invest make sure you're getting what you're attempting to get here I'm not saying that can't be done it can be done there are great Christian schools that do a great job of a quality education with\nThe quality of value system but you just gotta make sure you can't just assume because such and such was a ... or such and such with Presbyterian but that might have been many years ago and there and you know they've got that in their heritage but there are no more than fly to the moon anymore\nUm and so you know that then you just pay for an expensive school\nWith a questionable quality you know so they're not the second part of the equation as this and this is not the challenge you it's just a kid help you with your critical thinking and you decide which one you want to do in the process my three kids and sharing and I all went to University of Tennessee\nA public state school\nWhich there is some bizarre stupid but stuff that happens on the campus\n[laughter] okay I mean crazy and some of those professors are proof tenure should not be there you know I mean there is some nut burgers run around over there at my university campus okay and I love University of Tennessee but there's some stuff happening over there that just make your hair curl you know so my kids went there though\nBut here's the thing we figured out that our kids spiritual walk was not based on what happened at school it was based on what happened at home\nOkay and so our kids plugged into young life while they were in a public university setting and they already had their values and backbone and apologetic established\nBecause of how they were raised inside the rambling house so they were equipped to go into\nThat environment and not quote unquote lose their salvation in the process now I'm not saying no Ramsey kid ever did anything stupid I can promise you Ramsey kids Ramsey are pretty much known for having done some stupid at one time or another but but uh but but you know I you know you can do that in a Christian school too you know that right\nMhm right yeah ... right off campus was a bar\n[laughter] every one of those and so you can go get you can go get just as drunk at a Christian schools you can and the state schools all that to say I don't eat there is no bubble that protects them like your home does\nThe preparation you give them at your kitchen table is their insurance policy it their fire insurance policy it's not you know the name of the door of the school but that's not to say you should never do ... I think it's perfectly fine as long as you pay cash for it and you're willing to say we're going to pay off the mortgage a little slower\nBecause of that and how would investigate and make sure that the values are actually taught in the classroom I put my kids in a private Christian school for two years when they were in uh elementary school and I found that some of the teaching they were doing over there and I'm like well this is useless as a complete waste of money\nThis is a mainstream I mean you know so I figured out it's going to be made that does this was that I rent a\nOne question I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance is to replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse or you have kids yes you need term life insurance is the only way to protect them until you're out of debt and to build up your wealth\nYou're only digging a deeper hole if you waste money on cash value plans says it robs you of the ability to make real progress\nAnd that's why I send you to the sand or insurance and I have for Twenty years that's where I get all my insurance and they only offer the plans I recommend it is not expensive it's not complicated and Zander will be there as your guide every step of the way visit sander dot com recall eight hundred three five six forty two\nEighty two you need to get this taken care of I can give you the advice and I can tell you where to go but it's really up to you to take an important step to get your family\nProtected that's Zander dot com or eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two\nHey this is Rachel created that is always drilled into us that you can buy quality things and he'll get a great deal that's why I Love touched needle mattresses captain needle offers amazing matches his for every budget\nAnd now they got a brand new mattress called ... they took their best mattress and made it even better it's incredible try testing needle for a hundred nights risk free at ... dot com that CNN dot com I don't remember it ships for free at the end dot com\nEra's some exciting news simply savers now valued at one billion dollars folks this company used to be just five guys working together now they protect over two million people and here's why simply say ... system is easy to use and takes just minutes to set up there are no contracts are hidden fees and twenty\nFour seven monitoring is only\nFourteen Ninety nine a month\nVisit simply say direct dot com my listeners get free shipping and free returns that simply save direct dot com\nThis week find great deals at Walgreens like buy one get one\nFree on hundreds of vitamins and supplements the healthy stay healthy and get ready for that big game with Mickey Nelson blue diamond on regularly nine Ninety nine now just five Ninety nine card looking for a sweet deal select Hershey candy bars just two for one dollar with card get great deals on the essentials you need right here at your neighborhood\nDo you see on\nTV [laughter] uniformed entertain news radio Ninety seven points you haven't and twelve Ninety eight [noise]\n\nHere over the phone like five five to five you jumping up by your life and your money I've\nWatched all of the day comes from blind spots on find out for yourself why blind spots on is the number one online retailer of custom window coverings or\nYou'll get free samples free shipping and with the new promos they run every month you'll save even more used to promote code Ramsey to get the best possible deal\nToday's question is from Brenda in Colorado a she comes to Dave Ramsey dot com and says is dental insurance for my kid I was a gimmick or something I should keep paying dental insurance is one of the most easy insurance is to figure out that they're charging you more than you are getting\n\nA donut I better than I deserve so what's up\nA good question um maybe a better course Gary Coleman about my career uh I'm currently in the food and I'm a welder I worked at a town\nI'm Mike around a hundred and forty thousand a year mhm and um I've got opportunity to go work at home but the pay is about a third of what am I working out of town\nAnd I'm just curious if you thought it was crazy to take a job on that um I'm not married yet I'm getting married next month\nSo you're making a hundred and forty and you'd make like fifty\nYeah OK at home um my aunt no where are you where are you working out of town\nA member going on now come on I'm actually we're we're on um you know my own they own mocking right now I'm On\n... and they find out later than a flower mhm mhm okay well\nI think the answer for me would always be see none of the above ...

you're a millionaire around here\nOne thing we found for sure as millionaires think long term but I don't think thank God it's friday oh God it's Monday\nThey're looking out for word and they're thinking and there's two things that millionaires do they play all fence and they play defense all fans is they do the right things to build the wealth they do the investing to build the wealth\nYou know investing in your mutual funds and your four one K. investing and paid for real estate they do these kinds of things the defense is avoiding stupid stuff that cause you to lose everything all the progress you've made\nAnd so that stuff like the right kinds of insurance the will all that kinda stuff and so having a good solid financial plan is both off ants and defense and that is one thing we find one of the data points we find with all these millionaires they really good at defense\nNow that one way I'm drawing mile\nOkay and the the wear and tear you're going to keep it up so you're not going to have to write a check when you turn it in fourteen months from now\nNow they're both saying that well that one in great condition\nOkay good good yeah that one or you see how did that analysis\nYeah yeah that really clear that Amtrak I mean we were really struggling with what you\nKnow keeping that one and you know what I Would do is move on past a baby step to\nOnce you've gotten rid of the the big car the more expensive one and once you've gotten rid of all your other debts except this but if you still have this one with the two thirty payments were just written a car all the way through the end here and you might as well keep the car you get no advantage to turning it in our early\nRight right you're going to write the three thousand\nTwo hundred and twenty dollars worth of two hundred and thirty dollar payments no matter what you do so you might as well drive the dad gummed car you know and um if you want to put thirty two hundred dollars aside extra in your emergency fund just to make sure you got that plus your emergency for uncovered the call yourself in baby steps two and three then that's fine\nBut that's how you do the analysis on one of the key police or not and um\nMost of the time unless you're close to ... unless you're close to the end of the lease you're going to be selling the car and that's what happened with the more expensive one there\nIt's killing you now that one was beach who'll bite ya\nSo good question thank you for joining us ... ... if you've never heard the saying it's kind of a country saying you're getting ...\nWhich means it it's it's like a a a sheep getting its for removed that's where it comes from your getting ripped off us roughly ... means that's why I call them car fleet says because if we take the value of the original\nMarket value of that car that thirty three thousand dollar car on the expensive one there for those folks and I put that five forty two into a calculator and then I put the end of value into a financial calculator with residual value at the end in other words the residual values what you can buy the car for at the end of the lease\nYour your games up number at the end of the leash you put those numbers are able to calculate comeback out what the effect of interest rate is\nIn motion of the time it's around fourteen percent they call it cost a capital and they don't have\nTo disclose the interest rate the AP are to you you know if you get a car loan you get this there's truth in lending sheet that the Federal Trade commission make ... makes them show you the a PR the annual percentage wretched you're being charged but when you're leasing it's technically not\nThat under the law [noise]\nAnd so you 'cause you're renting the car and so they are not required federally to disclose the cost of capital or the interest rate but you can figure it out with a calculator and it'll make you view [noise] I mean it's ridiculous that's why we call it's leasing it's the most expensive way to operate car the car leasing is a disaster [noise]\nIt's a disaster as a financial issue [laughter]\nYou know the map you can understand what I'm saying\nThis is the rams are shared\n\n\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make\nAs an

mostly a drive I work as a scientific researcher and my wife\nAnd I laughed operations manager\nOkay very cool very cool great careers great income excellent and a man what seven eight years here right\nIt's really two phases for us the first ah sixteen months was we got married\nWe're our pastor says you know you guys should check out financial peace with what's ah and my wife read the books you read the told him I make over and she says you should you should check this out um and I got red on board pretty much right away I was excited\nI'm I felt like I needed a a plan I was ready to go um so the first sixteen months was eighty nine thousand we just had a really hard we were used to live in like students that we just kept it up yeah and then we would walk right up the baby steps we bought a house in two thousand eleven and a paid it off and uh April this year settled this house and everything this house and everything\nAnd your your did this in about eight a little under eight years\n... years four months I think yeah yeah okay well over a year Jeff excellent why do you get all\nEven still have a second job says now we actually got a second job now that we're free which is an odd way to do it I actually just joined your ah I took a financial postmaster training this summer oh why oh why did we lead four or five a few classes wow I'm so I'm I'm a few months into coaching I Love it it's amazing um\nThe word from Boston so I called the being town money there you go it's it's been amazing love it my wife just felt like she uh you can tell your story ... butler\nYeah I mean I I just think that the ... line I'm On I'm doing we only have two kids we've got lots of free time I mean I came to already full time job and they actually I think that's and counting\nCare on the side and but I Love my job we both watched fame place and the pharmaceutical in Cambridge and we've been really blessed I mean part of our ... is on just filling\nLearning to live on much less than what you can make that we've been blessed along the way I'm asked they give a shout out tonight parents may help us out so much I okay we didn't have to pay daycare for the first\nCouple of years wow she's amazing amazing wow very and all that without a lot in the Boston area that they can\nIt's a big deal anywhere\nOn balls or sure how much of the four forty eight was your house or three hundred and Seventy eight okay All right wow\nYou were able yeah yeah\nHow old are you guys I Am thirty four years old and I'm thirty six where the paid for how ... how I feel it's pretty amazing actually I think you\nTalk about a lot that idea of something relaxing when you don't\nHave any debt that you maybe you didn't know was there and I think for us that's been surprising I think I think I'd academically understood but I Do think that there's a sense of peace that you get that I mean you got it right on the financial piece that something relaxing you didn't know was there\nAnd all of a sudden we we don't feel like we're at the end ... at the beginning oh yeah I mean I think I didn't realize baby step seven is a real step of the end we get to actually build wealth and do all kinds of fun things now and I think that's what I'm most excited about\nA man and having such and having kids that are so young to know that we can do whatever we want and we're not we're not tied down yeah you know\nWe don't count it I mean you're making two forty here you've got no payments that were Thirty years mark touch gr eight yeah and I\nYou know we had some hard times we did not happening was not easy you know it wasn't it wasn't a just a cake walk the whole time but but we uh we work hard and I think it brought us together for sure we um we always had a goal that was\nThat was right in front of us and that that was one thing we didn't fight about I mean like any other company we fight about stuff for sure but that one we were I Know that one being one of the most important ones we were not around the same page\nLove it yeah that's one of my biggest thing even with a town people I mean when we're hosting a leading a few classes biggest thing is I get on the same page and we never enough money mhm really\nSo do they listen when you told me\nShe she paid the mortgage on the house I paid a foreigner that's just the way that we had been doing things and then we both agreed to go in and tackle this so that we can own a house you know within\nFive or six years mhm um\nIt was probably may this year I bought a two thousand Eighteen foreigner and so the upgraded package so it was like forty one thousand we put eleven thousand down with a trade in and everything I'm about thirty five thousand on it together we have about twenty thousand and saving a she\nEssentially what I got from her that she wants to skip the baby step three that she doesn't have any other day that they are only ... the foreigner in the house ... um she got a wife gets the baby step three to\nPrepare to get out and so that would put her paying you know the normal mortgage and he um gets that all my bills that we have and fading everything out until she gets out of the military she's still she teaches dance on the side as well so she's got additional income\nWhat's your question um I wanted to know if we should tackle this foreigner together mhm and get this thirty five thousand out of the way or if you think that we\nJust keep going about it the way that we're going to let her continued to save and then meet\nTackled a foreigner and that eventually when she\nI think you're running in the natural tension that occurs when you're trying to\nAct like you're married but you're not you 'cause you're vacillating back and forth between acting like a married couple are acting like room mates\nAnd your and your ... so it's my bills her ... her bills but we did this and we did that and yeah under in a legal sense from ... from the law perspective there's not a week\nYeah you have a roommate from ... from the perspective of the law you see what I'm saying and so if if she decides to walk out the door whoever's names are on these things or who's going to be holding the bag\nWhoever's you name or any savings accounts which can be there so you're in relation Lee you're struggling back and forth and vacillating so um do you guys can do what you want to do obviously you're grown ups and you've done very well you're making a hundred and twenty year congratulations [noise]\nUm you called and asked me so I Will tell you what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes okay yeah\nI Would get married tomorrow\nAnd then there would be no you're for one runner your savings account you're this it would only be weak and then I Would work the baby steps exactly as prescribed\nOkay\nThat's what I Would do I think you're making really good money I think you pay the stupid for rent or off or get rid of it before she gets out and I want her to one another I Want her to line up her career\nOr for what she's going to do as she comes out of the military\nBut you know the thing is you you just can't vacillate between you know ... looking in the refrigerator and going well that's my mustard how 'bout that mustard um you know back in ... or no that's our mustard because we're we're doing this together oh why can't decide and there's there's it it just polls at people part is\nUm there's all kind of\nStatistical research that shows you're going to have substandard results in your finances as well as other areas of your life until you but marriage in the equation\nAnd so you do what you want to do I'm I'm just an old guy advising you I've got several reasons for that advice but um that's what I Would tell you ...\nIf you were my little brother that's what I Would tell you to do I'd say get married and stop trying to play both sides of this coin just do it and you know you've been together forever anyway you're doing life together it's a technicality really but then you have to say from that point forward we\nWe have a foreigner we have a house we have a savings account we have a plan we are going to submit ourselves\nTo the baby steps we are going to stick with this we are going to go that route and and you become French at that point we week right [laughter] and so that that's what I Would do it cleans up everything and then walk right down it and if you want to say well\nYou know we're facing an emergency with the loss of her income and so we're not going to work the baby steps right now we're just going to pile of cash and get ready for a baby step that's not really skipping the baby step three that's just saying we're not gonna do anything right now in Palo money if you want to make that decision you can 'cause you're panicked about the loss of her income\nI don't think I'm panicked about the loss of her income though I'm\nDoing because a I think she's going to have another income lined up she's got from now the June to figure that out and be I don't know what percentage of your income she of our income once were married that she represents so that that's the other thing you've got to look at the variable will is with us in California Hi Will welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nA day driving me sure what's up so\nI I've got a four home that I own a three hour rentals at this point uh was I was my primary residence two of those trials are paid off and the third I owe about one Seventy on I guess my question is\nI have the cash to pay that a rental property off completely I'm Wondering if I should versus what the ultimate goal is to get more investment properties so I was wondering what your thoughts are on that\nOK is the ultimate goal to have a bunch of investment properties and a bunch of debt on them or a bunch of investment properties that are paid for\nA pay for of course okay then let's start with that okay\nThat's what I did um the second time the first time I had him on debt and I lost everything but the second time I don't borrow money and more and so I I you know paid off all my properties and I used the increase cash flow that was resulting\nTo buy the next property and by the next one and of course every time you buy another one you got that much more cash flow the debt free cash does I mean these things cash brought like crazy when you know what I mean that\nRight [noise] right it changes how much do you do your residence\nOr my primary is about to forty okay the rental rental is one Seventy\nAnd you have how much cash about two twenty okay I'm a parent my primary first\nYeah the primary first yep yep and are\nEither way what either way you're encouraging ... well the reason is simply this your your heart is part of this equation it's not simply a math equation\nAre and when you're homeless paid off for you think differently you can't keep yourself from doing it you will make different decisions um it ... it calms you down\nUm you know you just chill and not in a way where you lose your ambition or something like that\nBut um you relax or because you're walking around the back yard when their shoes on and you're at it the grass field different under your feet the bar or really is labor the lender of experience that and I've had many many many people experience it over the years that I've talked to millions of people\nAnd of course that frees up that two thousand or whatever dollars a month what's your household income\nOr about one forty five good you've been doing great man how old are you\nA forty four you're doing well you're doing very very well so either way without\nWithout these psychological I guess it's kind of what your cars that are there that right on the money on it oh you should be my primary residence it probably will be some point so if you take the emotional equation out of it doesn't matter which one you pay off her says the other\nThe emotional equations part of the equation\n[noise] so yes it matters is personal finances personal it's not just find that when you try to do your wealth building process\nAnd don't involve behavior and don't involve relationships and don't involve emotions and don't involve spirit your spiritual walls and you're you're you're you've got a substandard plan if you're doing it only on my off\nAnd you're gonna miss it you do whatever you want that will
