has a job yes my dad has a job or does ... while\nHe makes so I think a hundred thousand dollars a year maybe\nOkay so she doesn't have a ... she didn't have to work to eat\nYeah okay so I mean what if she just didn't want to work\nWell uh I feel like for her type of bending that's the problem she likes to spend money mhm\nMhm and how old are you I'm Eighteen okay All right\nWell there's a rule that we have discovered in these types of conversations and it's called the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder but they don't really want your opinion about money or sex and so your mother is not going to take an Eighteen year olds input\nOn her spending habits you don't have standing you don't have credibility with her to have that discussion and that's what you're discovering am I wrong\nNo you're not wrong at all\nYou know it's just difficult now you know when you're fifty eight and she's Ninety six or something yeah she may take your input those days right that's a different that's a different parent child relationship than an Eighteen to whatever and so\nYou know you have to build some credibility so the only thing I Would tell you that there was a couple of things um one is I Would not bring up her spending again unless she brings it up\nOK okay too I Would tell her lots of stories about the times that you used to mess up mom I used to spend and do this and I used to do this and I and when I got on this budget I got on this humble up system I got on this plan to get out of debt I'm doing so good and you just tell your story\nIs your story is not condemning her\nIt's just lose just holding up the idea that there's hope right\nTo tell your story and talk about how you're winning doing these things and that changes everything for you then the second thing you can do is is is there anyone like maybe your dad who could sit down and talk with her and the two of them actually start getting their act together\nWell I'm actually yes my dad had talked to her he's actually one of the people that we should call and we don't watch your show\nMhm okay well this was his job not yours is what I'm saying and sunny ah this would be like a husband now calling now that's a little different standing and he puts his arm around his wife and says look we got a problem here you're spending like you're in Congress I mean we got to stop this there's a problem here\nAnd when you sit down and work through this issue together and we've got to put together some kind of a plan where we have a good life and we have a good life meaning we spend some money now and we invest and save\nSo that we have you know we live like no one else so later we can live like no one else but really this is on your dad to do this is not on you you real cause you're he's got standing he's got a position in the household to have a discussion\nWhere as an Eighteen year old you don't and um it's not just you obviously are very sharp and you can do all kinds of things for you I'm not saying you're not good or you're not whole or whatever I'm just saying in your mom's ... you're still that little baby she used a diaper\nAnd it's just hard for her to take advice from you but now her husband that's a different thing\nAnd um you know he can sit down and if it was a mile from the Chernobyl to shut down when I have a discussion going this is this is something we're not doing here and there's a problem\nAnd we've got to work through this and so he's put up with is a long time and it's time for him to deal with it now that that's what I'm saying hey thank you for the call

who who knew that they had editors are those body it's okay we're we're proud for y'all world are how much of your mind off we pay off almost a hundred and twenty four hundred and\nTwenty thousand seven hundred and forty ... forty two dollars in one when I got it and how long did this take well it took six years but for three years when we really started following\nYour we are finally on the same page at that point so we are a little faster then\nYeah I was a dragging my feet got it and your range of income during that time well we were broke twenty twenty five twenty five thousand and we just accept a new jobs and right now are making a hundred and twenty five and ... what do you do for a living\nI worked for advertising agency in Oklahoma City and then on the store manager at the coach store at I'm In Oklahoma City very close to your wife like sandbags early booming\nYeah she's got a pretty good collection [laughter] she deserves anything should get right up with me so well done you know gosh you're you know how long you been married seven years in All right so a year into marriage you start within three years later you kick it into high gear for sure tell me about the journey what happened and and show other people how it's\nDone um right after we graduated we had so much in school that and and we just we need to get rid of this and and\nI grew up in a single family home and my mom worked really really hard and so I wanted to say I want to take advantage every advantage that we had and get our you know get everything in line and be successful early on so\nAnd I felt entitled like I deserved a jeep wrangler and I work too hard and so we really were fighting and I just felt in title I was acting like a little boy and I needed to be coming in and I just well I she deserves better and I just I had to you know let my pride down\nSo what happened what what was the breaking point what kicked into gear because obviously you flipped an obvious is she the way she looked at you just then when you said that was admiration respect you and it was it was really the way every man wants his wife to look at them know what you just did was incredible so tell me about that one half well\nMaybe we just argued a lot and we wanted to have a very healthy and happy marriage and I just remember standing in the kitchen three years ago and he held my faith in his hands and he was like we are going to get rid of the best and I think um\nWe just finally got on the same page and felt like we were connecting ... um because you mentioned a lot that when your priorities are nine and your budget your priorities are aligned in your marriage and so for us that was kind of just something that was really important Mm\nYeah and I just I didn't have any hope I didn't think we can do it what what ... what we got this we're going to do this what happened\nUm I just I\nI think I just didn't want to hurt her anymore Mm hurting I Love her so much and I just don't want to it just wasn't fair to her and I was the one who's spending money and going out to eat doing whatever I Want to do and so\nAnd I was hearing your not important yeah finally were like ... year the most important thing in on us and we need to get our finances in line and be on the same age and our our life moving\nForward and so at that point it's game on yeah and what what kind of income or are you making at that point three years ago I think between eighty them about eighty okay so you're still come up from ... to one twenty five during that three years yeah hurry impressive very cool so then okay you've made the decision were on the same page then what happened make\nA budget and it kind of\nIt was I felt constricted up first and then I kept listening to your show and it's like almost like gave me permission to spend money and I felt safe to spend money it wasn't like oh this is going to cost me a night on the couch and felt like okay we're on the same page and I felt an acting more when I found is happy and I was like you know what stuff doesn't make me happy anymore and I don't need\nA jeep wrangler I Need new clothes and they don't need to go out to eat like I'm just happy this is more important than anything else\nAnd a lot that fat sixty five like it takes seven eighty or the year ... second day when I say it's five thousand\nWell there you go you're under funding it automatically them so that's perfect yeah yeah I Would I Would put the whole five thousand through there which is going to save you about Fifteen hundred dollars a year\nThat's a nice benefit definitely thanks thanks appreciate the call Anders next in Canada hey Andrew how are you\nAll are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nOkay so we have just recently paid off her house and yeah so we are completely debt free and I just wanted to ask you a question about next steps okay\nHey so we live in a two bedroom townhouse pretty tight we have a family of four and the one on the way\n... so we\nAre a ... here for a little while but in the next few years we want to say about them pay cash for a larger point is good\nSo my income\nIs roughly a hundred thousand a year my wife know that she is on liquor is really really isn't making anything\nIs she going back to work she won't eat no okay so you have a hundred thousand dollar household income ... worth\nTwo hundred and forty to fifty\nAnd when you move up what what price would you move up to\nRoughly four hundred\nOkay she in a hundred and sixty thousand it's gone up in value during that time so you need a hundred and something thousand dollar how long has it gone tricky to save a hundred and something thousand dollars\nFor our question is I I Am quoting a wave the Fifteen Percent a month long ...\nOn my employer nachos four percent ... so we have the Nineteen percent ... that's going Nineteen percent of my income is going into retirement mhm my question is what makes sense to go back to St baby step three D. no and no you know\nWhat a what is your age uh\nI'm thirty and my wife is going on in okay\nWell you got plenty of time you're going to be okay I'm In two here here's what's gonna happen during the next three years five years whatever it is your income is going to go up and the value of your town house is going to go up or slow value what you're trying to buy is going to go up to right but it's so we're not dealing with a fixed\nItem to do forecasting with the fix died um your your income is not fixed it's you and you're going to see some increases and the value of the town houses not fixed and of course your target is not fixed\nUm and so we don't know exactly where you're going to end up there\nBut um no I I Would say at Fifteen Percent if I were in your shoes and then I Would just save aggressively I Would take extra jobs any other money that comes your way inheritance is bonuses anything else the role that in the house fun don't consume it anytime you can get your hands on anything just do it in the house fun though in the house fun though it in the house fun\nAnd um but we know if you save thirty thousand dollars a year\nThat in\nThree years and some change you'd have another hundred thousand but with this town actually almost be there\nSo I think your three I think you go through your plan you might have a four year plan something like that while doing the Fifteen Percent but it's going to be tied to be a tight budget to do that but you ... not going to send you back into that you know that and you didn't have to go back into that either smart man\nCindy's in ... bill Mississippi Hi Cindy how are you\nHigh for Mobile Alabama I Would\nThink so I'm looking at killing going where are you from woman okay can I help\nWell we're new to the financial peace University We're entering our third week and my husband is the fiduciary for his\nBrother who passed away he was one hundred percent disabled veteran and he left quite a large estate\nMy husband has an attorney and mobile who is I'm taking it to the court at least to six months and then it'll be distributed and um my husband I'm just concerned that the Veterans Administration will come around and and any day or maybe three years from now and say no we need that money back\nBecause it wasn't used for my mom and I don't\nKnow ... money that came from the VA is right in the hugest state yeah so they gave him a lump sum due to his disability\nNo he was one hundred percent disabled in every month he received money on the Veterans Administration and I had been paid all his you know care bills and everything like that mhm\nBut because Mike would give it away on the first day he got it the Veterans Administration family member to watch over his state and so my my husband's doing that for Twenty years oh my lousy so the state grew\n... it's not they're not going to come after that they're not paid paid a disabled veteran for being destroyed and yet a family member managed it well for the good of the veteran who has now passed they they've got no standing whatsoever to come after that okay\nAll right no I I think you're fine is your husband the show later\n[laughter] no no he had written a wheel with my brother Mike written well with my husband's help to give some to his nieces and then distributed amongst is dividing brothers and sisters\nAre so much was the size of this but\nI think around two hundred and fifty I think each of the three siblings are going to get Seventy and the five or five six nieces will get\nTen thousand each from I'm not really sure there's also some gold coins\nYou know your husband is a good man and he\nWas he was very much and we ended up taking my to all his Veterans Administration point in the last year but because the VA health care was not the\nMission unless my cat are represented there 'cause like one hundred percent disabled him and we miss him now that I'm back in the money\nYou know definitely definitely but your husband took good care of it that's what I'm saying\nYeah it was like it or was there but we're going to get there because we have financial peace university honors and

Fox News as the FBI investigation continues into judge Brett Kavanaugh for allegations of sexual assault President Trump sticking by him at a rally in Tennessee in support of congresswoman Marsha Blackburn president\nWhat they can do says James ... hunt a consumer federation of America as life insurance actually where they pay a premium\nAnd they thought they paid for life and now they're facing extremely high premiums to keep them going recent wave of lawsuits which we're getting cropping up around twenty Fifteen of targeted universal life policies sold in the eighties and nineties ensures offered an attractive\nAnd guaranteed minimum interest right the policy holders of about four to five\nPercent supported by higher interest rates set by the federal government during this time but a decade of rock bottom\nInterest rates in the wake of their financial crisis hurt insurers profitability reducing the return on the bonds an underpinning their products and so they jacked the rates so here's what happens with\nA universal live policy why these things are happening why people are pissed off about it so you're told that if you pay a premium you'll have the policy of your whole life a portion of the premium goes to pay for the insurance and a portion goes into your investment called the cash value\nThe problem is these things are based on the insurance and some of them is based on A R T which is an annual were noble term\nIf you think about it every year you live you're more likely to dodge statistically forty six year olds more likely to live to die statistically than a forty five year old on average Seventy six year old is more likely to die than fifty six year old on average statistically speaking so they charge more\nIt costs more because of the probability of death to ensure someone who's older or by get that and so if the let's say you had a hundred dollar a month or two hundred dollar a month premium okay and if it started\nOut at age thirty five\nAnd the cost to cover you at age thirty five was fifty dollars a month of the two hundred then you'd have a hundred and fifty going into investment that should be just fine right but then what happens is over time\nThe cost to cover you let's say ... let's get you up to age sixty might be two hundred and fifty dollars which are only paying two hundred\nFifty dollars coming from eating your savings up that you put in\nAnd so your insurance costs goes up every year to the point that it passes the premium it eats up the savings when the savings is gone the insurance company comes to you knocking on your door and says now\nIt costs three hundred dollars a month for you to just have insurance no savings because not only have as the increasing premium\nOr eaten up what you were paying or the increasing costs to mature as eaten up your premium but it's also going over that and eaten up your savings now there's nothing left and we're not going to cover you anymore unless you pay this new\nHigher premium for insurance only\nYou just got screwed by buying a bad badly designed horrible financial product and so when all these guys are\nBut if you don't understand the index universal yeah flexible premium yes\nI Do understand that and I've seen this happen I've met with these people when they're sixty five years old and their insurance that they paid into for forty years has has completely self destruct did and now they're standing there with nothing\nAnd they paid huge premium is if they paid a one twentieth as much they'd had term insurance over all that same twenty year period of time and\nThey could have invested and then nobody's going to tinker with their investments and steal their investments to buy insurance premiums to some\nDead gum insurance company if it if your if your insurance product has\n... if you have a life insurance policy that has a savings component to it it's building up cash value you're getting screwed\n[noise] the worst of the worst for

and once it cost a forty five thousand than you\nSolve a condo and you rent and you use the money from the condo to live on while you go to school and pay for school\nI was I was actually thinking about saving up some money and the next year to put down on a house in your loan and um so you know buying buying a mortgage\nAnd how are you going to pay for a house if you're not working\nA well that was hoping I could have a some saving some of the funds from the condo go toward um living expenses for school a cutter\nYeah you're not qualify Murray mortgage if you don't have an income\n[noise] outdoor out they'll be working part time out that we make it about forty five thousand a year oh okay your wife work outside the home\nShe told us and she makes what I'm about twenty five\nOkay and she or you ... are you going to be in the same city doing all of this\n... okay\nI'm not concerned about homeownership until three years from now if you want to if you want to do this and just keep all the cash available and make sure you hit your goal\nThat's fine let's make the turn with no debt and when we get out of the get out of school inland the you know nurse practitioners job and uh your income probably going to go up in that situation\nPretty substantially um then and you've done all of this for a hundred percent that free then you think about buying because whenever

allowing you to freeze a credit bureau without any fees now like you were allowed to charge you a fee to freeze it or an freezing\nUp until a late September twenty first of all shifted so um yeah I Would freeze it and and the only reason is if someone were to steal his identity give your Social Security number or somewhere and try to open an account of his name\nIs ... the company's trying out there are trying to open the account with checks his credit they'll find it frozen and they would it would prevent that type of identity theft and a fraud\nUm now if they don't check it it will prevent anything and only about three out of ten of credit card applications that they actually run the credit on auto issue the other seven so that's how the issue credit cards on the people in dogs because they don't even bother to check\nAnd if they check they'll discover you know a three you're a one year old with a frozen credit counseling and they'll go oh well this was fraud and they're not
