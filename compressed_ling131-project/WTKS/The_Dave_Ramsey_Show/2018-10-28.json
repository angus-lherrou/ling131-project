can uh be in charge of your health rather than having your health problems be in charge of you so I appreciate you tuning in I really appreciate your listenership and uh we're happy that you're here and the other person I'm happy with us here is uh my co host and or\nThe man behind the scenes the men who puts the shows together comes up with the topics develops the material ask the questions his name is mark save and\nHe's a he's a wonderful man he's an interfaith minister he's a father of two ah he's a marketing guru he's a he's an all around nice guy and we want to say welcome Martin welcome to when your health\nMedical things are the kind of introduction their dark Rick you know it's interesting that you would bring up the idea that that the the far end of the health issues as when you go into the treatment factor that that would be the orientation certainly that you would recommend people do which means\nThat the sequence of taking care of your health\nIs to begin with the idea of being healthy of preventing any kind of sickness and then if you have to see if you can get to the underlying cause of what has initiated that sickness in your life and and then fix that\nUm say you can get back to health so he can get back to health whereas what we've seen predominantly happening now in terms of what's going on in the healthcare industry is that you wait until you have some kind of full blown condition or\nDisease and then you treat the symptoms of that disease and tried to keep them in checks you try to manage your symptoms as a very different way of approaching health\nYeah because one's gonna fix problems and one's going to treat problems and the difference between fixing means that you solve once and for all versus treating is you just maintain\nThe condition [noise] uh in the state that it's in\nAh other than your ability to feel it so when they give you a symptom masking medication which is what most medications are your blood pressure medication helps to artificially regulate your blood pressure your cholesterol medication helps artificially regulate your cholesterol your diabetes medication helps artificially regulate your diabetes\nAnd nobody ever talks about at least from an AL A path a prospective nobody ever talks about well why does this happened and what do we have to do to address it so um that's the fundamental difference and and the purpose of my show as always to address things that the cause rather than treat the effect\nYeah and and there are significant health problems in society today I mean some of the problems arise [noise]\nA lot of the problems arise you might even say most all the problems arise when you can't process food properly and now every every fall and every spring you have a special doctors supervised program to help people get their digestive systems back on track so\nBefore we get into this illusion can we discuss what the situation is that most people are facing\nWell most people are facing a say a state of debt digestive system disruption\nOur digestive systems are completely out of balance they're not working the way that they're supposed to their their I'm holding on to more than they should they're screening less they're not processing things efficiently ah they're either process that things too fast in the form of diarrhea\nWhether processor thing things too slow in the form of conservation the quality of what we're putting into the body as an issue and our ability to digest absorbing assimilated is also an issue and so\nWhen you have all these issues related to just a simple extraction of nutrition from the food that you're eating for the purposes of health [noise]\nUm you're going to develop health problems for sure\nI mean there there's I mean there's virtually no way around eating some foods that are unhealthy I mean [noise] ... and yet you're human body is pretty well adapted to process most of the things that we consume\nWell not anymore and mark we've ruined the or\nAll of this what the over utilization of medicine the artificial ... and ah that this and that and the destroying and genetically modifying our food the disruption of our ability to absorb foods through our digestive system um interesting I was I was up in New York recently and I was listening to a\nA program called doctor radio and they were they were advertising on the show to tune back in on a particular day because they want to talk about the latest greatest for breakthroughs in the understanding of the micro biome which is\nFunny because it's something that you and I have talked about for years and I've slowly and so it's nice that they're actually acknowledging it but ah my my concern is is that you as a patient or you as a consumer need to understand that they're going to find a way to manipulate it\nIn an effort to monetize it so that they can make profit off of what should be balanced and maintain normally by you to begin with\nRight and and then micro biome is really the your your your ... your digestive tract is filled with a variety of different organisms and enzymes that help to break down the solid foods you eat into molecules that your body can absorb\nYeah and if you're healthy that happens and if you have a health concern than the answer is no that's not working properly for you and that's probably the first and best place for you to start looking\nIf you want to address the cause of a condition whether it's high blood pressure whether it's high cholesterol whether it's diabetes whether it's auto immune disease whether it's heart disease whether it's cancer whatever the case happens to me\nYou want to start looking in how your body takes the material that it takes in assuming that it is quality material and what's your body does with it and does it do it efficiently or does it have problems doing it and uh I think it was Hippocrates that basically set all fall health problems began and the guy\nAnd I think that's pretty universal in a lot of the traditions that you studied in terms of medicine that looking at what's going on with the food you're taking in is the source of health\nRight and if you fixed that and if you give people quality ingredients and they're able to process those ingredients and that's that's also a big point which ah hopefully we'll get into\nIs is your body processing them efficiently or are the filters that helped to differentiate between what is usable and we should let in versus what is a unusable and we should keep out there's a filtration process there and you're filters need to be efficient\nAs well as eating high quality food if you intend to be healthy\nAnd even before you get to those filters I mean your your body part of the what your body has to be able to break\nDown the foods so that they that they can be adequately filter right absolutely you've said I think before that all all health problems are related to the foods we eat\nThey are every health issue that we have every disease process that we have is related to and can be traced back to a nutritional deficiency\nNow the challenges that nutrition is not part of a medical doctors curriculum ... so to ask a medical doctor to look at things from a nutritional standpoint\nIs like asking somebody a who only speaks English to look at things from a a Mandarin Chinese language standpoint there's just going to be a huge lost in translation and uh you're going to grab a hold of maybe the words that you understand and you're going to neglect the rest of it and and unfortunately\nA again listening to this radio station for a week while I was up in New York's\nShowed me and helped me to appreciate the lack of understanding that the the medical profession has with regards to food now I\nAlways understood that to be true because I Know that's not part of their curriculum but to hear them talk about health issues and not even equated to nutritional deficiency causes a is quite perplexing to me\nWell what are the issues that we have is that not only do we have the deficiencies but people tend in the American diet to eat to access imagine that\nTrying to make up for what you don't get\nWell we think that it's a little good more must be better ... but that's not the way God made food and that's not the way we found things in the garden of Eden the garden of Eden everything was already in this pristine form in the right ratios\nIn the right amounts related to I don't know Apple's versus oranges versus blueberries versus carrots versus you know squash or whatever and and eating those when they're around ...\nDuring the seasons that they're around is the natural rhythm for which ... and how we should eat food now we've simplified that by transporting food from one part of the world to another part of the world so that we can get exotic fruits and exotic vegetables and\nUh we can get things that aren't in season uh because we've moved um from a place where they are in season to a place where they aren't in season to create variety in that sells more and that's all good and fine\nBut in the process of doing that we've changed the quality of our food and an effort to allow for transportation in an effort for the the shipper and and the manufacture of it to still make a profit why because when it arrives at the store is still looks as good as it did when we packed it challenges is that\nIf it's real it should start to denature it should start to perish because it's perishable food and when you're getting the perishable food in a forum that's not even\nMature like you know I have a banana sitting in front of me okay and what color is the top of that banana mark it\nGoes from green yellow to little brown spot right\nAnd it's like okay so the top of this banana isn't ripe yet\nThe middle of the banana is probably about where I like it and then the lower part that's been a ripe and for longer because it's further away from the source means that this is actually degenerating\nThe end is generating and losing his nutrition the middle part probably has pretty good nutrition and the top part which is still green actually hasn't even matured yet and this is one banana\nYeah markets us that the old adage profits over people in and\nHow much profit does one need to be happy dysfunctional people in places of power is a recipe for disaster and we see it in the arenas of healthcare and in government we as the moral majority that that actually have ethics and morals and our scrupulous and can think clearly and understand the purpose of being a human beings to support other human beings\nWe need to weed out these uh unscrupulous people and we need to get rid of their profits over people mentality and we need to\nPut our brothers and sisters first and let's take care of our society as a whole we are one human race and we need to treat us as one human race not the has versus the have nots or the people who are in in control versus the people who are being controlled and that's just you know that's something that we should all be moving to\nIt is something we should all be moving to I mean it's it's now become so difficult to find we were talking during the break about how difficult it is to find good healthy food\nAnd that's because good healthy food doesn't exist anymore and mark they've\nThey've companies coal companies like Monsanto and and other companies that have created a gene manipulation and genetically modifying our foods and our seeds and and\nCreating foods that can withstand uh the harshest of pesticide so that we can kill all the bugs and\nAnd we don't understand that the natural balance that nature is in charge of and we're trying to intervene in nature and what we're finding out is our intervention into nature actually creates problems for us as a species I mean we got\nThings called global warming we've got a\nYou know we're losing so much of our our natural environment by what by plowing down a big swaths of trees to put up a tent him in order to put in a mall or to put in a you know housing development and all of that and it's like okay well\nFor every tree that we take down we should be planting three yeah why so that we have good oxygen to breathe easier to revive but if we if we restrict the amount of oxygen that we have to breathe and the\nThe a a make and sell us a breathing machine that's going to supply oxygen to us then guess what they own everything at that point\nYeah well I mean I think we we we if we focus now on what it takes to be able to overcome some of the things that are set up in our way I mean there are all these things they're doing to increase crease their bottom lines and and they're putting people before profits but\nOne of the things that you need to do for yourself to be proactive in to get healthy is to get out of the cycle of eating food that's not healthy and bring bounce back to your diet so is is that a hard thing to do\nWell it's hard based upon what a you know the person's focuses if they have the proper understanding or if they can get the proper understanding\nNo disrespect to one of the most of the richest people in the world who who has the ability to influence so many people through what she's done and what she's created than I'm Talking about Oprah Winfrey and Oprah is wonderful in the sense that she has the the ability to influence lots of people [noise]\nThe one thing that everybody knows about Oprah is that she has always always had\nA weight management issue and she is reinventing herself or at least twenty times in my lifetime her lifetime ah with all these different newfangled ways in her most newest ways is promoting a she became a a part owner of weight watchers\nAnd ah the whole freestyle program and this that and the other thing and and the challenges is that even Oprah with all her wonderful abilities and and all the different people that she can touch and influence and help out et cetera um she doesn't even have the understanding that she needs she's a business mogul she's a billionaire\nGod Bless her she's very successful but she doesn't have the right understanding of what it takes to be healthy and nobody on her staff that's going to be a yes person for her for her whole life is is going to give her the right understanding and a ... nobody is asking the right question so\nEven in the face of that you know there's there's stuff out there that that people are being given the wrong information so people need to find a resource that actually can explain\nIn simple terms what it takes to be healthy and what the imbalance as a person has why they have the imbalances most importantly why they have their imbalances and then what they need to do to change that\nSo I mean if you want to try to address is I mean here you're talking about this very famous very wealthy person\nAnd when you get into some of these programs like a weight watchers or some of these programs where they have prepared foods for you you're not necessarily getting the kind of fresh food that you and I are talking about a little bit ago that would actually be the best thing you could do to make yourself healthy\nRight in other countries mark when you go to get food you typically go to the corner market ... and you pick up fresh food every day\nFor that was brought in the morning proved that was harvested that morning brought to the corner bodega if you will and and and put out more the fisherman you know comes in really early in the morning and unload the fish from the previous day\nAnd you got fresh fish and and it's like okay so in Europe you go pick up your fresh food or if you go to a restaurant to eat\nYou're picking your food and they're making it for you and it's all fresh food and we really don't get a lot of that in this country\nNo I mean the cells of the supermarkets are filled with this lasting through this long shelf life food right it's what you find everywhere\nAnd it's interesting because ah where I used to live for I still go up once a month to treat my New York based patients uh they they read the local supermarket\nAnd they put a fresh spin on it and you go in there and it's it's completely revamped a new but the aisles are still the same the same crap food is still available on the aisles and I looked at their flyer or the other day and they're flyers still you know giving people bonus discounts for crap food\nBut you can go in there and you can buy ... are already prepared food you can go to the you know the deli counter and get a whole bunch of this that and the other thing whether it's a prepared salads or or you can even get pizza and chicken and all of this stuff and find you can do all of that but at the end of the day\nWhat kind of quality is it even if it's already prepared for you and I understand that trying to solve the equation well how do you make food readily available but how do you make\nReadily available food healthy available [noise]\nRight and if you try and and one of the issues that people are having as people become busier and busier is they're looking for solutions to be able to feed their families that don't involve spending the time that it takes to prepare fresh food\nRight and when I interview my patients and they fill out their die in history and I looked at what they're eating I'm like okay well we need to make some tweaks some changes to your diet because the way that you're eating setting yourself up for failure and that's why you have your health concern\nAnd so one of the things that we talk about uh in the process and they're like well\nWe would do I need to do some kind of ... and I'm like well you probably will need to do some kind of Clinton's we've got to set the foundation first before we have you do what Clinton so that you can get the most benefit from a Clinton's buttons is there's only two times a year to do a clans and that the there during the spring time where you can do a full body Clinton's\nOr in this time of year when we talk about the fall clean up and I think we should probably get into that\n... I mean that's that's that's exactly the kind of where we are oriented towards ourselves and and what part of the reason they want to do that as you want to get rid of the toxins that have a chance to build up and I know that there's a difference between the spring or the spring detox program and and the one in the fall the one in the spring is very\nComplete but now when we do this cleanup um can you just go through and describe a little bit of what's involved in the fall clean up\nWhile in the fall clean up this is the time of year where the energy is highest in your what's known as your mental element and you're aware of that but the listener may not be aware of the ... with the the mental element the mental element is one of the five elements associated with the Chinese five elements theory of health and in the fall time\nIt's the metal element and that relates to your lungs your large intestine and your skin and those again or your three external filters and those are the filters that keep things from actually getting into the body\nSo it's like the air filter in your car it keeps the air that gets into the engine clean or as\nIf you have the gas filter and that's clean it helps to make sure that any impurities within the gas don't get into the engine that affect how the engine runs or [noise] or same thing with an oil filter so we have these external filters the lung large intestine and skin\nAnd this is a time of year that you want to create the largest amount of change because the energies highest and they are cued up for the largest amount of change possible\nSo the fall cleanup program focuses on those three specific filters or those three specific Oregon's and so the spring clean up is twenty three days\nOf clean up is only nine days so it's it's two days at the beginning of getting off of regular food to start taking the stress out of the system\nThe middle five days is actually flushing those three filters and then the last two days is re introducing food that's not going to start clogging those filters right away and in the course of those nine days of cleaning all the filters\nThe ex journal filters you start to feel different in terms of your energy you're clarity of thought\nYour ability to a complete cycles regularly to get out of bed without feeling like you're dragging yourself out of bed or you'll fall asleep better yet you have more of focus throughout the course of your day and you just are more productive as a result of the three filters being cleaned\nFor states to do and some of those are Best Buy and staples suggest really do your research up a bit before you just start driving around and things like do you want my computer 'cause not everybody's going to want it\nThis is the money that home improvement show we want your calls your questions to our show post them online at ... dot com or pick up the phone and calls right now and one of the money but\nAll right let's get ester on the line from South Dakota with a better question how can I help you today\nWe need to reach our rain gutters are ashamed of all I really feel that old house uh Portland net shank off and third the papal that are the three companies that I've talked to about replacing rain gutters\nThey tell me how simple it is it just lift up the asphalt shingles and put their strapping than anything that's in it\nAnd I think okay at fault as flexible but I Can't think of my crack\nSo how do I find someone who knows how about preserving shingles and think\nWell I I think there are weird number of ways to install gutters you can put straps or that go up under the asphalt shingles but can they can also be touched directly\nSo what you're going to want to do was attached those gutters directly to the ... and instead of using males you're going to want to use cutter screws there very long lag bolts lightweight ...\nUsually have a heck's head on them and the nice thing about these uh these gutter balls so to speak is that once you put them in they don't pull out sometimes the nails the gutters spikes that they use will pull out\nBut these gutter screws will not pull out so you just need to use a different fasting system\nOr and if you have you had physically had somebody at the house to solve this configuration or they just going to telling you this on the phone\n... we had just moved to the area and I like going down the yellow pages you know trying to think\nWell once they get to your house they're going to figure out the best ways to attach the gutter but rest assured there's a number of ways to do this and no you don't have to take her shingles apart\nBy the way as long as those shingles those roof shingles look good and then there's no reason to replace them ... a roof shingles are very durable the reason that most people replace them as they tend to grow a lot of algae and moss and they can look nasty after a while but if they're still looking decent and there is not leaking and you're good to go\nYeah good and as a whole pile of a or a little palette probably two or three hundred at them down the basement\nSo boy they had to work and go fishing Ari that's thanks so much for

now than it did just that and I she's from Virginia and she writes I have never clean out my gutters and the twelve years that I have lived in my\nRoom there aren't a whole lot of trees around but my gutters and a roof are unusually high and very difficult to reach the last big rainstorm I noticed sheets of water falling from the gutter on one side of my home look\nAt best way to clear it considering the difficulty of reaching my gutters what color [laughter]\nCalled a ladder that's how you get up there I mean look\nI get that you been able to avoid gutter cleaning because you don't have so many trees and they're not the kind that maybe drop a lot of debris but your time has come ... you have to join the rest of us now with doing a good job cleaning these gutters now\nThankfully because uh you know you've never had to do this before you know you may not be aware of the fact there are pros\nThat can help you do this and they're pretty affordable\nUm I've used them from time to time around my house when they do like going to stores and yet the gutters so you do need to clean them you need to make sure that all the parts are attached to denounce bachelor extended because by the way you let those gutters go and you get a lot of water over flows them\nMany bad things can happen for example in addition to the water falling all over your\nLandscape that work and saturate into the foundation in cause a basement you can also destabilize the soil and leave the foundation cracks or if the water\nGets in the soil for the first see three or four feet some stays there and and so freeze like in the winter can span and crack the foundation wants to just a couple of things of the many things can happen if you don't maintain proper gutters in\nIf you're listening to this kind of tired of cleaning gutters you might want to think about putting larger gutters next time we did this project on our house we replaced four inch gutters with six inch guns or moral commercials size gutters\nDeeper or white or off the house\nIs both wider off the house in a slightly deeper hold more water but the key is that the down spouse are much wider and so they don't\nObstruct nobody Kong like the forge hundreds used to some really happy with these governors I've never really had to clean them out 'cause they got blocked they really never got boxes and putting them on a clean them out because he gets some breeds six in the bottom but I've never had one that actually floods and say did this up do you put in the larger gutters and leader so\nJust a couple of chips to um\nIf you are aware of how important is to keep those gutters clean and it's certainly don't do it yourself rough millionaire but but higher pressure okay good luck with that project\nOur next that we've got to put a check from Joe in Florida who's thinking of selling a house but wants to find out what's required for us to kick the can of occupancy and he can make any hair repairs or upgrade that's marked think about that before you let\nIt is and what you were to do is really two things first of all you can check your town because they're going to have a set of standards requirements are moral point only to the homes in your town meal would be something as simple as making sure you smoke or not in Texas but secondly I Would recommend you get a professional home inspection because this way you'll know what the condition of your home is in the eyes of potential\nBuyer and you'll be able to make those repairs up the before the buyer mom was always a good time to\nI feel like there's something to being honest about that in the negotiating process like I Know it need that climate so let's talk about that like rather than being like oh I'm hiding the death you know it's good to know these

and house and often found burn marks very frightening burn marks on the framing the surrounding it\nSo you definitely want to be active aid that wiring you don't have to physically pulled out of the walls as long as it's known electrified and then of course you want to update that was new modern wondering that's consistent with current electrical code\nNow for the kitchen you really want to do something different than what it would have been done when the homeless originally built it hadn't wiring but it had all the kitchen I'm sure on one circuit\nAnd that's why an older home sometimes when you're in a kitchen you often see the lights them when the refrigerators kick 'em 'cause they're both major appliance enlightening around the same circuit you want to have one circuit for your appliances your dishwasher your your your\nRefrigerator that's even more than one circuit for that and then a separate circuit for a lighting and an outlets and of course all the outlets also should be ground fault protected because this is what location and ground for protection protects you from receiving a shock\nOr if you were using and the plants the shortage or had any any other type of electrical incident that occurred so you are smart to be concerned about this um it is something that you should take care of what do you do it\nOne room in a time or the entire house at a time you

had been done\nBecause I have at ... ... ... and it stopped me in the outlet and he just ran for lunch the next and I get ... seconds breakers downstairs and all that kind of stuff that I'm\nOne of the things that when I Do have I think one wall habit and then I thought um but when they have the wires that are out the big black wires plant crops or any of the wires and I don't want to get behind a wall to camp out and getting the law but I Need to put that metal coverage of it and if I could put the ... going down so I don't\nWell if if you have a if you're talking about the original ... being big black wires you can't very that\nHas very unsafe and here's here's why nominate two wiring the reason it by the way for those that are not familiar with this if you've ever seen an old house we're wire seem to be strong on little ceramic posts let's take off the side of beams\nAre those are the knobs and then with the wires go through the framing there's a ceramic too and that's the two that's what it's called knob into and the reason that it's six off the beam\nSandra is because it has to be air cooled so that's why you can't ... under trim you can't even put a insulation around it because it makes a double e unsafe\nAt big box wired and I know I've got that original ...\nI wouldn't have your electrician come in and determine where that wires being energized make sure that if it's not going to ... is completely disconnected and then run whenever you have to do from there and if you can only do a one room at a time you'll be just that much more safe but if you can do the whole house and just do it okay\nGreat thank you You're welcome Sandra Good luck with that project\nCame in on the line having some issues like what\nWill have a Nineteen twenty eight Britain than

saying correct and you have compensation inside those windows because they're not very efficient so there's no insulation in the windows and all\nThe correct so when we when we have a change in temperature that's when the ...\nForest yeah because if it gets cold outside and you have more moisture inside strikes the windows and condense is\nAnd that's why you get the conversation so the only way to change that scenario is either insulate the window which you don't want to do or to potentially reduce the amount of conversation and in the inside your house what kind of heating system do you have is it forced hot air\nIt's a central air and have\nOkay so you could consider installing what's called the whole house the humidifier this is a an appliance that's installed into that duct run and when it to activate it actually takes up quite a\nBit of unity in moisture out of the year uh some of the ones that are seeing in the couch like fifty sixty pounds of water a day so a lot of water and come out of that and it's not inexpensive but it is a solution other things that you could do\nWould be to take some steps to try to reduce the amount of moisture forms in the house by improving grading the drainage with the foundation perimeter because as water is just around the house\nSo some of the foundation and that ends up converted to water vapor in as the unity inside the house and

right now with one ... money that\nTony in Tennessee is on the line who came home killing Jerry ... tell us about it and hopefully that wasn't too much damage\nI'd been gone for about a week I turn the master water ... off the water supply to my house go for about a week came back with him it's a split for your pretty fire size house\nOr so came into the garage came in to strike too in the man's day in and out here the ... water which is obviously never a good sign up so I go back to the far end of the house away from the garage and the whole day of stairs has substantial amount of water in it\nAnd I look up and it stripping down from the ceiling and really directly on come on ... TV that point that I got to know not good what's up the stairs so it's all very far end of the house a is our washroom\nThe washing machine\nJob is full of water and overflowing and that was the source of\nWashing you mean like the slot sink\nWas that taking the discharge the washer was a washer itself or film or falling washer itself\nSo you're basically saying that you were away and when you came back you found this water had collected\nInto in the laundry area because the washer was filled up with water and that was overflowing leaking down through the house right on your flat screen TVs are correct we got it right that's correct but the but the main water valve was turned off\nYes and when I when I looked at all if I thought I'm I'm not sure I ... I went to the nearest faucet turned it on\nNo water pressure everything there was there was no water pressure and the lines of my house\nWell that is a mystery is it not\nOnly theory is that when you come in the garage downstairs there's a bathroom there and that's where the washing or a correction that's where the hot water heater is\nSo it's basically middle a mid mid range of the house on on the bottom ... level right the washing machine is on the upper level far into the house and this was about a five thousand square foot house are pretty good stuff has\nOnly thing I can ever have come up with ... created somehow some type of a soccer fan right they have siphoned water from the hot water heater all the plumbers everybody talked to said no way no thing possible us will give me your alternative and nobody ever has\nLike a [laughter] that is the ministry\nWhere friend quite a mystery there would be water in the pipes but didn't seem like it's enough to do what you you what you're saying did the other thing I was thinking about is whether or not that was waste water and backed up from the street because that's not controlled by how\nThere was no odor to it yeah\nWell I mean it it depends on how on how the plumbing system is designed if it's only one waste pipe you would be something even if you had a great where I Would not be stinky um but I don't have any other ideas ... than that I mean I I was talking to the ... an idea but it's still an extraordinary circumstances never happens again is that right\nIt has not again I've always now since and turn the violence off so the yeah no water to get to the washing machine right\nNow the smartest way you normally would do it yeah because I was gonna say is that I I Know that sometimes even when he turned faucets off you can get you can still get water there leads through because I've seen this happen um in fact my mom\nLives in Florida half the year and one year she got a letter from the ... from the ... and she's ten thousand gallons of water problem was she wasn't there for that month and I'm like we're in a ten thousand gallons of water go and I knew that we had turned off valve well it turned out that one of the valves\nWas not completely off and it was leaking through the toilet so thankfully it went down the drain but you know even sometimes when you think the waters off it's not and I do wonder if if some is that could have played part of the scenarios use experience\nBut thank you for sharing it with us I don't have an a ha moment but I think I can speculate as good as the next guy and and that's kind of what I'm thinking this point good luck with that project thanks so much for calling us an age of the money\nBut when it comes to maintaining your home painting or even standing with and it's really important to keep your signing in training good shape well painting as a tack that really among them or they can do it yourself projects and also one where a simple mistake can lead to a really big headache\nYeah and the key is it comes down to preparation weathered surfaces needs to be clean and anyone who's paint needs to be removed before even think about open a can of paint them if not here's what's going to happen\nThat new paint is not going to stick to that old pain and your efforts will be totally wasted or it might take the pain but at the paint is that the would guess what it's all going to peel off including new pain so prep is really key\nMixed it's only smart to apply a coat of primary first a lot of people that they don't have primaries formulated differently than paint that's meant to be that top probably better decision here it's going to stick to the old preventing new paint peeling\nAnd third for the best finished look you want to make sure you choose the right kind of paint brush now natural bristle brush his are best replying oil these peace but for latex synthetic bristle brush used to live with the best result in they're going to help maintain the value of your home", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Savannah", "day": "28"}
