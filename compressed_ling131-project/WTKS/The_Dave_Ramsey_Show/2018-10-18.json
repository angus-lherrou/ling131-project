didn't list a debt it can still be bankrupted did they not put anything down for this long at all it\nDid it on I mean credit it as a student loan and we were under the impression Dora attorney that it wouldn't matter whether we put it down or not I mean we are getting ... everything that I'm\nOK doesn't matter if you're attorney thought it was a Sallie Mae your attorney was telling you that Sallie Mae's or not bankrupt ... that survives the bankruptcy if it's a private loan it's just like a personal line of credit is what it isn't it completely\nWas bankrupted okay so did you put down chase student loan some amount on your matrix yeah I'm not worried about it it was a banker right it was bankrupted up your bankruptcy was discharged yeah\nOK than if someone comes up you go and says we your sister in law and you say no that was bankrupted a stun originally chase and that was what was left on the bankruptcy matrix and nobody can find you people but you know it's clear it should be clear it I don't know why your attorney would think that's not bankrupt that I think they must have thought it was a Sallie Mae loan\nPossibly I mean like I said my husband's not very organized by I mean we did say it was a private loan I Know that\nI don't know a a a private student loan is basically an secured one\nIt's just the one that was used for college okay you just use like a personal

there are two years later American Express came at me again\nOn a similar situation that was listed on the thing but it wasn't they didn't get notified because of the way it was listed they don't have to be notified\nUs federal law and for the courts and bankruptcy court federal bankruptcy court and so I sent them bankruptcy papers and told him you know just remove the account don't report on the

one way or the flu\nWell that day the best football team play on that but I Do yeah I don't think that our our guys would agree with that there was a bad day it was but ah so you you've done that travel several times you've done some other NFL work as well so some of the other teams have called and you and Chris all going to both been available to them and and helping them when you're meeting with those guys I'm\n... and they're asking you money questions what's coming up\nYou know day this is the main thing that's coming up hey I'm young I'm twenty two years old I was only making maybe five thousand dollars a year my first check with Fifteen thousand and I'm gonna get another one next week it\nWhat do I do ... how ... how do you keep from being overwhelmed overwhelm money with the pressure with family how do I tell my mom no should I tell my parents you know how do I tell my friends know um should I go by this car\nAlmost any names but there are some um rookies out there that have had the opportunity to to mentor and they're you know they they they are going out there and buy some big things and other rookies are seeing that are saying well wait should I Do that and I'm like no no no do not do that and save your money live on a plan live on a budget\nAnd with the coolest thing was with the ravens I can say this was all of them sign up for every dollar a couple of weeks ago um and all of them get every dollar play and so there was like ... how do we do this and it was surprising to see that a lot of kids did not know how to budget\nEither twenty two year old Twenty one euros making nearly um on average sucking the low end is about Fifteen thousand dollars a game so it's about sixty thousand dollars a month to about two hundred thousand dollars a month and they didn't know how to budget that so I'm just excited because I'm seeing them saying hey I Want to help\nYou know these guys are tech to me they're they're calling me Kate how do I do this how do I invest what is Dave say about this you know it's this real cool to see these young players want to be good on a field but they also want to make the right decisions off the field as well\n[noise] I was telling a leadership team this week that I was talking to the river passers we're with yesterday that aren't you can't attribute\nA life skills book to someone just because we're successful in one area\nAnd so if you got a twenty six year old music star yeah um well they're good at music but what happens is we see them being very successful there even me I'm fifty eight I Know better I've worked with NFL players for Twenty years off and on\nAnd um I Know this is a a a world class one half of one percent athlete\nUm but they are twenty two shifts there and the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills or develop they are the size of a key uh yeah but that doesn't mean that their life skills have developed at the same level and you know so\nIt it's it's kinda weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps as like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um because he still is football skills are are the best on the planet you\nI'm In his physical ac human his physical uh IQ the things you can do with this body in mid error or it's just circus like it's amazing what those guys can do it but what happens is when you watch that skill level especially if you're just watching on TV\nWell I have that I I I Would think an unusual question but maybe not I have a twenty year old granddaughter she is living on her\nOwn now um she was working full time ... more than ... ... jobs when she lived in the war\nBut uh [noise] had can move and so she's renting a room for hours away from the Denver area and she was only able to get part time she is still making her bell\nShe does she does know about they ran the I I've been trying to get her into a class I Will at some point um and she does have a car payment cheese making that she's you know has room rental rooms she's making that [noise]\nUm but just barely as you can imagine I'm working at a rally it's part time so uh the problem is that she is making it but now she just found out she has five not four or five wisdom teeth in her mouth all of which have to come out and we'll be Wellington that's out\nThere why our ... why did she move away from her income\nBecause um it was a dangerous area her house with being shot up her father's crept with blown up at ... at a house on it with a life threatening situation um she walked into the house twice and we sat being and people were in\nThe area I got that burger I had jobs right\nHe had a job\nAnd she ... she moved so far away that she couldn't do that job when you can move out of the hood and move into a decent area and keep the job\nWell she couldn't find a rental in the Denver area that which within her range she felt yeah I don't yeah I mean do do\nThat in Denver at the very very expensive ... area and show she moved somebody offered her room over in a\nFaith ... shows so she got into a mess 'cause she overreacted and I'm jumped away from her income without an income set up on the other end and now she's dolled up well\nSee I\nHave to tell you that the company she was working for promised her they were transferred to fulltime even their home so when she when they had told her yeah we'll we'll give you a full time day or\nWe understand and so she got there and all of a sudden it with a right now it's part time it will working full time but now it's like I\nGot ya so she didn't she didn't move thinking she was having all got ya okay fulltime\nSo Bob are you asking should you help her with her wisdom ah with some situation\nOh I Would yeah I I Will help her as much as I can with her with him keep situation um is there any other ideas I mean what this money ...\n... yeah I Know yeah his job to my\n... you have to let her\nShe made the decision so she has to live with the consequences of that decision understand you want to help her as a granddaughter but at the same time as young millennials they need to start feeling the weight of their decisions if they make a bad decision\nMom and ground pirate grandparents should not come to help them out all the time I made one bad decision Dave my dad kicked me out the house\nAnd he said hey you're going to learn from that cost acquaintance because he knew that the only way that I could really become the young man that I was going to become so we brought a ... I wouldn't help her as much I agree with ... she needs to get multiple jobs she left a good job\nHave friends in Denver I understand you're saying it's expensive but it's not that expensive to where she had to move that far away for a good solid career path that she had going on\nYou know so until these people come in with a fulltime you work through those things you waitress you ... you know repeat sushi babysit your dog walk you do other stuff to backfill and and that'll get her where she can eat and if you want to help her out with the wisdom teeth expense there's nothing wrong with that\nUm but I'm not going to go along with the idea that somewhere in this process she was forced right\nAnd she's a victim over circumstance or she overreacted or circumstance gay and um when you tell me that that people cannot live in Denver because the rent is hot on there's a whole lot of people living in Denver proving you wrong proving yeah and I'm a show you know you've got that ... you know\nShe just use that as an excuse and said I'm outta here I'm going to another city\nAnd did not have her feet solid under but worked three four jobs and then the other thing comes in its full time job and you can drop a couple of those and maybe you can help her with the wisdom to help her make to make the\n... the turn their financially Ted is with us in Kansas City Hi Ted you're question for Anthony\nAnthony um [noise] I have two daughters they're both doing very well eighth and ninth gave her four oh one K. question neither one want anything to do is that\nBoth fabulous favors and givers I'm ... I'm the one is making a ton of money she's a welder she's on the road she saves money great and she's starting to do the four oh one cave my question is should I advise her\nTo just go to a Edward Jones or someone or a or one of your piece or do her work ones and keep transferring now [noise] um\nDo you know for work with are matching matching her as well as well and and I that's the question\nDoes she get packets she'll she and her she's a welder she'll she'll run by she could be there for three months you can be there for six months so but they do all we send to their retirement pay or country may lead to get into that so I guess that would be the question if they are matching it would be worth rolling it over every time you change your job\nExactly yeah yeah that's that's exactly right absolutely and then in addition to that on the side the the two have stability peace in their ... with us more of us are pro and each time but you're saying she's working short stance and so she's going to end up with ten or Fifteen of these little for one by before one case some day\nShe could write so should cheat each time she leaves were over there and to the table one she has\nYes yep yes always take your four one K. with you and do direct transfer roll over when you leave always do that but at that they technically or won't each one will technically be a separate account number but you can still look at the whole\nYou know your whole portfolio in one place than from all the different rollovers stuff as you go along so good question I Would question\nEighteen years old that's amazing that is amazing yeah that that free welder she's making anywhere between eighty two hundred thousand dollars a year and already starting to invest into our four one K. day that sounds like an everyday millionaire to me I\nThink it is talk of the dad in every day and he is a very good well he's taught um well I mean they don't have that and um and they're not afraid to go to you know do a trade a trade you're paying a\n... a day they're out there\nIs a technical stuff and stuff like welding and and in the construction world and that kind of stuff the trades are paying big\nYou know you know Dave I just had the opportunity to go to the White House a couple of months ago and that's one thing that President Trump and his daughter talked about was we went to see that trade sealed active there are so many jobs out there that are hiring and uh I agree with Dave that trait to go right now\nAnd will mean if if you don't do college and you can do that and if you do that you might not want it to college I mean it's it's you can go and direction you want to go these days there's a lot of opportunity out there and the job market is definitely a on your side if you're looking\nFor one of the term Anthony ... where are you speaking again this weekend one more time I'm In Durham North Carolina at world overcome Christmas church and I'll be there for ... for services so come check me out if you can fall for on Sunday off for Sunday perfect\nGood stuff for the O'Neill Ramsey personality joining us the pain entrepreneur tool box teaching your teens how to start and run a business and the graduate survival guide five mistakes you can't afford to make a call in college or Dave Ramsey saw ...\nMind but I think today thank you America\n\nHey guys just ... production officer for the Dave Ramsey show this hours up you'll find more on our YouTube channel where we have over six million YouTube views each month you can find debt free screenings millionaire our clip de France is so much more\nHere are struggling with money relationships career you name it you're stuck and you don't know what to do\nWell I've got great news for the first time ever or you can experience our Ramsey smart conference from the comfort of your home that's right you can now purchase our most popular live a ban on DVD and stream it on the go for only thirty nine Ninety nine in our own lawn store a day Ramsey dot com you'll get four and a half\nHours of life changing talks and two complimentary work books this brand new live of inexperience has led by me and world class communicators including Dr Henry Cloud Dr less parrot Dr ... maker Chris Hogan\nRachel cruise Christie right Anthony O'Neill these folks are America's leading experts in money leadership personal development career parenting in marriage take back\nThe key areas of your life get our brand new Ramsey smart conference on DVD and stream it all go in the online storage Dave Ramsey dot com double duty chaos savannah\nAnd high hard we feel station now Fox News radio covers the world\nOn news radio that he's seven points out an\nLooking for answers ...

to a model but yeah I imagine okay I'm sure you're going to let you got your plate full here's this here's the thing um we've got to figure in order to have a career\nLong term in either one of these things health care management or pharmacy you're going to be able to work full time on a true yes how are you going to do that\n[noise] well um I haven't really thought of it like you know future wife but like you know I I'm kind of focused on trying to finish based on\nTheir ... and the reason to finish the degrees is to get your income up right yeah we're not collecting degrees your mom and her\nOkay we'll we only need degrees to be able to ... to make more money and you can make more money unless you're a bowl or you put your life in a situation where you can work fulltime and that means that you're going to arrange for other care for your mother orchard\nYeah\nLong term not today but as you graduated from either one of these degree field in order to take advantage of having that degree you're gonna have to be able to work I'm wrong about that\nSo yeah\nKnow so I don't want your going into bed any further or don't want you\nAre collecting degrees just to collect degrees you say you did I Am part broken that you've got this close to the finish line on that pharmacy degree and basically paid for it but weren't able to finish it I I Wish you could get back in line on that at some point because that's a hundred two hundred and fifty thousand dollar you're\nJob and your life changes dramatically and you've got the money then to actually hire someone to care for your mother but actually the money that she has coming in from retirement would pay for a caregiver\nUm you know in her situation and you may have to go that route you may not have another way around it so you just got to look at that and think about long term okay five years from today where am I going and step by step how am I going to get there the hundred and eighty thousand dollars doesn't scare me if you're making a hundred and fifty a year\nI Want you to pay it off really fast is really bad but it doesn't scare me it does scare me if you think you're going to make twelve thousand a year for the next ten years in and stay in your mother's home and care for her\nThat's not a plan you're gonna have to do something else shoe box yourself in the corner here short term you you took care of your mom much there's a wonderful thing you did a long term or you're going to take care of your son [noise]\nWhich involves [noise] arranging other care for your mother I think unless I'm missing so

future um we have about Seventy five thousand dollar debt collectors we um we own our home outright uh we have a vehicle that is being chased Seventy five thousand probably make a decent money and we have in Iran\nAre about to get in it for the question I'm Wondering what's decent money\nOr she makes about one twenty and I make about eighty okay\nSo the question that I that I have to pay that we have is um her mother and father passed away last year and uh she was not an inheritance that inherent in she has to take a certain amount of distribution every year for tax purposes my idea for the inherited money I'm is who\nYou all are going to do but that's what I Would do um because\nI think there's a lot of cooks in this kitchen\nThere's a lot of opinions flying around here and you guys have got to get inside this and to as a couple of decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do and show them telling you what to do and it's a different different situation so I think she inherited the financial advisor to\nI don't think you picked him and um and that's really a bad medicine\nAs well Ninety percent of the time are you guys need to pick them or you need to re pick him and hiring again and this time he worked for you\nBut I think he's still works for grandpa even ... dead and that's where the stuff works usually bad bad medicine Travis what I Would do just catch the whole thing out pay off all my dad's and invest the money\nWas watch less that's what I Would do and I would take your wonderful

off as a penny pincher and you know is building generational well so\nI'm very lucky and it's amazing your great grandfather wow Joe\nI'm ... and ... are you single\nI and I've got a girlfriend but we'll see how that pans out right\nOkay and um what do you make a year\nAh about sixty right now\nGood for you and how much debt do you have I have not\nLook at you and your great grandfather's kid that's excellent [laughter] he's proud of that I'm sure I'm\nAll right um how old are you I'm twenty three okay good good okay\nTypically what will occur in the next five years statistically speaking it's not a requirement is certainly not a law it's just an observation of the way life unfolds or you'll get married and buy a house\nTypically okay you might not you don't have to like I said it's not required I'm not saying that but the point of that being those are two major events and uh\nBoth of them will require money and so we need to keep that in mind why we're doing this we would always tell you to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses so I Want you to have brown Fifteen thousand bucks or so set aside for that um\nIf you want to buy a home and pay cash for it at this stage an inexpensive home a that's not a bad thing uh I I I Would expect that when you get married you probably wouldn't move again\nAnd that's not unusual it's not bad it's just you're kind of expect that so I'm\nJust generally after you get married you find that you bought their own home so [laughter]\nYeah I I'm anxious to buy a home my older brother is buying a home at this point but I just don't think it's right for me with you know with how accessible moving as for me and my field I Am a nurse I'm you know critical of moving anywhere\nOkay and you don't you don't have to then that's cool yeah there is not my point is there's no rush\nAnd I I I'm personally with you I think it'd be cool if you wait three years to buy your place in kind of quote settling on or whatever number of years and so once you've got your emergency phone in place and your debt free then there's really nothing left to do with this money except three things which is what you should always do with money\nOr you should enjoy some of it\nI'm a small portion of it not much you make enough with no debt to enjoy your salary or you should give some of any money that you have and you should um invest some of it and so the majority of this money\nAnd if I'm In your shoes is going to be invested and uh the ... the portion that you know you're going to leave alone you're pretty comfortable that you're going to leave alone at least five years\nI'm just going to buy some good mutual funds with it I invest in four types of mutual funds in my retirement and in my long term investing which is five years or longer and growth growth in income aggressive growth and international\nI probably would set\nA hundred hundred and fifty of this in something or a little more conservative than that that is growing some but I'm probably going to pull that money out in the next five years in a house with it\nAnd um you know something along those lines again it's not a requirement and I would make sure I was settled in you liked the um\nThe flexibility that you've got now and I think that's a bad I mean I think that's a good thing uh I think you're on hold on to that flexibility for a while I don't want to look up and find your thirty five years old and still having not bought a home\nOr in especially in your situation 'cause you're in such a great situation so I Would give some I Would enjoy swimming I Would invest the majority of it\nAh some of it towards a home in the future maybe just a simple index fund and asking the five hundred no load and there's no commission just let it grow um\nIt it's going to go it's going to follow the market whatever the market does and then the rest of it I Would invest longer term than that just to build wealth with if you start at your age say with 'em\nAround two hundred thousand of this and you invest it you know and it sits there for forty years in grows a stock market rates of return which has been eleven point eight percent since it started you're going to be so wealthy is going to be unbelievable and it's it's a wonderful way to\nUm honor your great grandfather's legacy so I don't sit down with us more of us are pro is what I Would tell you to do ... dot com bubble dropped down a list of the smart Mr pros in your area when you fill in your stuff you pick out one you like or two or three and interview them I don't care\nAnd go from there and sit down with someone and start to learn about mutual funds how they work what they are how to invest\nAnd uh I think it's good to have two buckets of investing here one with a five year mindset for buying a home and one where the forty or mindset for just becoming on the leave a blue wonderfully wealthy\nA art asked is whether it's in Charlotte North Carolina Hi asked him how are you\nI'm doing great how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nWell I'm I just recently about three months ago started that every dollar at love it I mean with the smart pro investor this week good I'm from a personal finances are all great but my question isn't on the individual ... thing\nIt is on the church or nonprofit side of things I was curious if and\nYour opinion or prospective ... are there are ... for churches and nonprofits to and for them financially\nWell somebody will call the being Dowd a we're a university is typically a situation where you would see that happen um and that's where there's a large enough sum of money that the investment return off about account\nSo you're out of ten million dollar endowments that had built up and that money is invested in the ... the returns off at ten million dollars will operate the thing then perpetuation\nAnd so then the nest egg causes of the nonprofit to live in perpetuation off of that are you most often see that in a um\nA formal large a\nNonprofit or in where you really see a lot of the university\nOr were there and going or even a professorship there's enough money in this one account that the income is providing is paying the salary of a professor in whatever field okay if someone really felt like they wanted to make sure that the university was able to\nUh pay that professor in perpetuation and going forward and that kind of a thing in the local church I almost never see that\nA special the evangelical world okay the tropical church now or ... or ... has a lot of assets\nAre the Vatican is very wealthy and show that's a different a different mindset on it but in evangelical is the vast majority of the time those of us sitting on that church border that elder board which I've done many times would say the investment is not to be made in um\nIn earthly investments but instead and\nThen the people and causing people to make Christ and grow and crushed and that that that's the investments that we want them and so the only actual wealth is retained as the paid for properties that the thing operation or the awesome retained earnings that are sitting there are some\nSavings just to make sure that there's an operational buffer but\nUm but in terms of building an actual in Dallas in that setting find all of that helps answering questions that both of our of the day rooms

Fox News secretary's day my ... from Saudi Arabia in Turkey where he met with leaders to discuss the disappearance of journalist your mouth is Yogi\nThe secretary of state says if he is going to give them the Saudis and the Turkish government the room to investigate this entire matter and that the United states is going to respond once those investigations have concluded and in doing so and the secretary of state says the administration\nOkay All right well I mean it sounds like you're going into something you're inexperienced in\nAnd um I I obviously I'm going to tell you don't borrow money to do it whatever money you might put into this may go away you uh you know from a business perspective you've just got a very narrow demand a product line that the general public is not aware of\nAnd um so it's not like you're you know cow hides leather obviously would be a completely different thing brought more of that and um or\nWill obviously there's a broad market for that and so forth but if you've studied the market and you understand who's thing I I don't want to just trust the guy who once raised in alpaca halfway around the world and\nHis family did that for two generations or something that's that is a bad idea I mean you're in the United states and you you think about it you need to understand exactly how this is going to turn into money\nAnd how likely it is because you're talking about a business here but you can't get an armored with a hypo allergenic narrow market stuff 'cause your kids have allergies that's a good way to lose all your money\nSo you need to look at the business aspect of this where does this turned into money and what how many steps does it take to turn into money and how much money does it turn into and how likely is it to turn into money and cause it scared the crap out of me you're in a really narrow market a fad like market\nAnd it sounds like you've got a guy from another country who has come along and told you go to the alpacas worked in another market in another country and now you think they're going to\nWork in Columbus ohio I just I don't know I'm again I'm not an expert but it's just sounds weird so um\nI Would want to know a whole lot more about that somebody brings something in here that feels weird to me usually I found out the reason it felt weird because it was weird\nAnd uh so you just kinda gotta get down into it and go okay what's the problems with this what am I not seeing what am I blind spots and really study it because otherwise every dollar you're putting it riskier could be gone\nVeronica
