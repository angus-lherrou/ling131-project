world the hillbilly Dave\nRamsey connected to a sophisticated it looks like yourself I'm not sufficient [laughter]\nTell me what happened twenty three months ago well first of all I just thank God I found yet\n[noise] um well I'm I'm\nBut this is my ... from Costa Rica and my friends to live in a infant on Saturday does that come into simple may wow and I've been a single parent since my ...\nAnd I'm obviously his father's amazing and he supported aspect financially it's been a big struggle mhm [noise]\nUm so we took in um southern students to try and help me and my income which is the son and um it really helped me that and\nI spent many evenings just looking at my income and my aunt carvings and ah it's all very stressful there just wasn't enough money\nWhat happened twenty three months ago so twenty\nThree months ago um I got into um a lot of debt\nAnd and that was maybe my downfall was when my bank gave me now is ... ... a full ... pounds whoa yeah and uh at the time I saw the odd one left me because I didn't have an emergency fund\nAnd I had a lot of 'em get the news to the new St critic count and not you say I felt like I'd done something diet and actually done anything I just moved my debt from one place to another mhm [noise]\nAnd now they're starting to struggle and um\nI was at the bank is challenging may ... so I was being challenged about ... fifty pound demands on the interest and um I just still\nOn I just need to get out of this uh this just yeah struggling panicking now how did you get hold of Bush\nAnd well I'm sitting out in in the ... mine now I just and on you chose trying to find out how to get out of debt and I come across ... mhm [laughter] and I saw ... nothing not even England [laughter]\nAnd if possible way [laughter]\nI Know some of the ... and I was just like oh my God this is this is it ... and actually\nI sat in the God now there's crying because it is the first time that I actually felt how ... and the I I could get out of debt wow\nAnd so the next day I got mine bought bold and I got all my debt which was that it just a shell mhm and I put it at the top mhm [noise]\nAnd I still want you to get my manages he signed together or not I mean I'm fifty seven and I've never had an emergency signed and I'm One of the things I\nKnowing that the five thousand are mobile home gonna be worth three thousand dollars but they're gonna lose ... uh and that's their form of rent while they save up money and pay cash to build a house on that land\nPeople do stuff like that that's fine but this out there you go about Seventy five eighty a hundred thousand dollar fifty thousand or a mobile home and call that a good long term plan no it's not a good long term plan it goes down their value it's simple\nAt a buddy of mine owns a huge mobile home operation and he's always give me a hard time would you say in the day when I said well they wanted which being true of which we've got some that go up in value around when when when when I see that as an across the board thing yeah\nNo I Will tell you this manufactured housing is what they always call it somewhere in one way or the other there's all kinds of manufactured housing sometimes that means mobile home sometimes that means the wall systems were built in fact are there stood 'em up and it basically looks like a stick built pouch\nAnd so it's treated badly purchasing public\nLike a traditional home\nWhatever you're buying well I don't care what words you use to describe but the question you ask yourself is when I woke up in front of it do I say all\nOr do I say house if you walk up in front of it in your house\nUgly house pretty house but it's a house\nRight then then that's going to go up in value in a mobile home with the wheels off sitting on a concrete foundation that looks all permanent still looks and feels like a mobile home when you walk into it\nAnd as long as people think it was that it's not a house it's not going to go up in value because that's how the market perceives it\nAnd that's what you've got to look at so whatever you're putting into that you're throwing that money away\n... ... what do you think about living in a mobile home for a year to save for a down payment if you're doing that five thousand are mobile home on bike export and lived there for a year while I save up some money that's fine because you're just given up you know some of the five thousand dollars\nNot turning not allowing fifty thousand on something that's now worth thirty\nWhere you get upside down and the thing um or if you're talking about renting something that's what you want to do sure whatever wherever you want to rent okay rich cheap rent is cheap as you can rent does that means you can save more for your down payment James's in Lexington

mean by the time we double your age is going to be a lot\nOf money while way to go very cool so how did you guys get started on this whole financial peace program ten years ago tell me about that\nWell ten years ago we had a ... a three year old and one and a half year old at home and we were\nGoing into a savings every month just to get by and it we we didn't want to do that anymore and my brother introduced us to total money make over ... Ryan read it and two days and I said yeah let's go ahead and I'm not a reader [laughter]\nAnd we just got after it and it took us thirty month to pay off that initial fifty five thousand dollars a net ... and then we've built our emergency fund and started getting after our house you know and not really believing we were going to\nPay off the house and I'm as quickly as we did but uh\nEven when life got in the way we just kept sticking to the plan and here we are and we're just incredibly proud of where we're at\nYou ought to be well I mean if you have a guard rails you know if you're bumping up against them yeah and I want to so I got I got a game plan here where the houses the house and you get knocked out a little bit then you get back up at school houses the houses the house and enter your ten years later you started when you're twenty eight and every thing is paid for you don't have a single\nPayment now how's that for you\nIt well I was just thinking this morning as um I don't know when when bill day comes around it it's so fast 'cause there's nothing to pay for it yeah yeah it's awesome build day\nAnd we were able to ah you know start putting that money towards the future and agreements rather than a choice we made fourteen years ago and that is it's just a huge blessing\nIf you've got your future standing around your kids\nYour retirement and uh your your wealth building your generosity that's all future now they're still paying countrywide\nWanting to go you guys very fun who was the mortgage with\nA it was with country and they got a bunch of ... out or had few different ones along the way they bonds are only good for you guys so you said you've led classes financial ... over this ten years so now that you are the coordinator that has paid off their house people look at you like wow yeah\nMy hero yeah how do you do that what do you tell them what's the key to getting out of debt\nI think it's the budget you got to start there um and I think now on this side of it you just have to believe that it's going to work and just keep plugging away at it um and small steps add up to a giant stuff at the end though\nAnd I I Would add to that ah the giving them the ties in um was really court I mean where when we started I\nUsed to routinely saying click while we're driving in church like boys what we're given what we are tied into the church today you know we could do this or do that and I'm just slowly over time that's changed and I don't have this um you know deficit mentality any more aware and taking away it's we've learned how to Liz\nYou turn around and borrow more student loans because you don't have the courage to go to school you didn't gain any ground you're just ... dollars\nSo it makes sense yeah\nSo I mean first thing we got to do is make sure you have enough to pay cash is that what you're talking about that you're going to happen up an pay some down their student loans or what\nOr that's what I was trying to figure out like you have a foul something between Fifteen and twenty grand between now and then the next fall when I go back to school and I've got knocked on the loan so I didn't know saving\n... and the first thing is the first thing the first goal is complete school be a hundred percent sure have way more than enough to complete school with no new debt now when do you finish school at the end of next year\nIt'll take about a year and a half\nAnd your degree will be and what\nAre your business management is\nOkay and I'm\nWilling to move you up in income immediately are you working now what's your story\nYeah I've been I've been in and out of school I've got a management job now but I don't really see it being able to advance means like higher leadership all all that kind of my reasoning for one could go back to school to finish\nOkay well it's it's not a bad thing to finish up what you're doing I think that's a good plan but yeah the the first goal is to finish with no new debt and make plenty sure you got plenty more than enough to do that but let's say that you add it up and you say I Need twenty thousand dollars to finish all of my school\nAnd then you save up thirty thousand\nAnd then you save up another ten thousand I wouldn't know what I mean Thirty's more if twenties all you need thirties plenty that gives you a pad then everything above that you start paying off the debt if you got really really into the money you see what I'm saying\nBut I mean I wouldn't be I wouldn't have two dollars extra I'd want to live a lecture to make sure you get through school with no new debt that your first\nBig goal now when you get out of school then we're going to attack this debt with a vengeance and that's going to be the process but um that that that's just what we tell people don't don't go further in is your first call Jeffrey as in Atlanta Georgia Hi Jeffrey how are you\nHow you doing better than I deserve what's up uh I work for a company that had the leaf it for a while and\nI Will be paying if I give to the program I Will be paying one twenty I pay period to be there to lead a program but\nThey weren't in my car manufacturer maybe your work or what do you work for a BMW okay that is not a normal leasing program this was an Employee Benefit order and it is excellent\nBecause they furnish the car at a cost that there's there's no way you could have hardly any car for no more than you're paying I mean ... ... you said two hundred and forty dollars right as three thousand dollars a year okay if you bought that car will go down three thousand dollars and twenty minutes in value\n... author you see what I'm saying so that is a bargain and do they not they furnish liked a Tarzan oil and\nStuff to ... ...\nIs the gas even furnished in that they can't remember no no no one on one of the car manufacturers even version but it's it's ... it's called it's all the maintenance and the tires though\nRight everything is the insurance and that to ya author see that's a deal of a deal I mean you can't buy the tires and the insurance for three thousand dollars a year\nBut that's not a leash that's not like a standard okay they call it a lease but it's more of an Employee Benefit\nOther words BMW is losing money\nOn this transaction with you to your benefit because you're an employee it's an employee benefits either and they want their employees drive in one of their fine automobiles and you guys do make a fine automobile so it gets there yeah and\nIf I remember ... you have what a selection that for that is that the price of a certain car or is that the price of a car up to a certain amount\nOf a car okay the one that you liked or whatever yeah okay All right well dude it's a deal I mean seriously you know ... you can't hardly buy insurance for that\nMuch less the tires and maintenance much less all about the loss in value but that's different than Joe walking off the street and leasing that car which he did it probably seven hundred dollars a month okay you\nKnow and that would not be a good deal he should maybe by a BMW if he's got a lot of money and pay cash for it 'cause it's a good car but you're you're getting an Employee Benefit and it's a sweet deal for you I Would definitely do that if I worked for ...\nIt's a bargain it's a great deal and there are several of the car manufacturers that have really good deals for their employees but you just kind of have to think about it of if I was driving you know if you're out of ten thousand dollar car man\nYou can't do that for three thousand dollars a year\nWas what we're talking about here and you're certainly not driving up ten thousand dollar car what we're describing your probably driving forty thousand dollar car\nSo a good question ma'am thank you for calling in and um again there's a great deal appreciate your joining us a Amy is on Twitter at Dave Ramsey is there an item or items that you refuse to pay for or by\nEven though you could afford it now\nYeah sure I can afford\nMost anything I Want to do nowadays I mean not anything but most ... thing and some things just feel weird to me I feel I just don't want to have that invested in that\nUm I've got a friend that is worse um\nTens of millions of dollars and he's a watch guy and he bought a um a hundred and fifty thousand dollar watch which sounds just nuts but I mean he's got like ... million dollars that's a it's like most people buying a biscuit okay I can afford to do that it just I just\nI don't know it's not me number one and I um I I might spin on a boat [laughter]\nBut not on a watch so I mean you know it is just being authentic with you you know but uh\nUh so\nThe boats bigger than watch does that count [laughter] so yeah it just is something that hits me funny but it's not really a value Judgement to say that\nMy point is is that I'm not mad at him for spending that much he's got two hundred million dollars\nAnd if he spends a hundred and fifty grand watches nothing okay that guy's got plenty of money it's like most people bought a biscuit he gives away his is generous generous artist huge he helps lots and lots of hurting people and that's a very very small percentage of his world but emotionally I have trouble\nEven though intellectually I can get there and I'm not judging him emotionally yeah I ... I Would struggle doing that um but that doesn't mean it's wrong to do it just 'cause I Can't grasp it\nAh emotionally it it would be wrong to do it if it's high percentage of his world and that's why we tell people like on your cars and stuff don't get into a high percentage of your\nYou know your your financial world where you've got you know you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year and you've got eighty thousand or for the cars well that's just stupid\nThat how can make a value Judgement on missions just mathematically dumb but when something is a small percentage of your world there are still some things that emotionally you just don't feel right about but it doesn't mean that it's a more immoral for someone else to do it is my point\nAnd so and really a lot of you could learn that lesson 'cause some people judge other people because they can't emotionally grasp that [laughter]\nAnd just because you can't emotionally grasp something doesn't mean it's morally wrong there's a difference here and so anyway that's a good question I talk about a lot of that kind of stuff in the legacy journey book and only book I've ever written about well\nThe books I've written about money and so that puts this hour that Iran's you show in the books we will be\nFine with me on the number there is ultimately only one way to financial\nDaily and with the prince of peace and\n\nOf course we'll hear you ever talk to people who say things like becoming a millionaire was impossible these days\nOr people are only millionaires because they come from already wealthy families will we just got done with the largest research ever conducted on American millionaires and the simple truth is everyday people become millionaires all the time\nHow did they do it the overwhelming majority did so by investing consistently and with the help and guidance upper professional\nThat's why our team has already done the hard work for you\nWe've vetted and interview thousands of investing professionals all across the country who are committed to helping you reach your goals get started today go to Dave Ramsey dot com slash smart dresser and look up the smart buster pros or in your area\n...

it's it's weird that's why something feels weird\nAnd you know yeah ex husband living in the basement qualifies that sort of the weird column yeah I'm with you and and so you know what I Would do is ... and what I Do in situations like this is I just lay it on the table and let everybody look at it\nAnd so I'm going to sit back down with her and her husband for our her and I go okay\nI don't want to be rude and I'm not trying to be tacky or anything but we're is a small business so we're now we're pretty close together and um and I got to know because ex husband in the basement that's just

coming up ... ... ... ... problem problem problem you know and so you can find out about about these people as to how they feel about that now if you don't think it's weird and they don't think it's weird than you would probably work well together\nBut I think it's weird and they wouldn't work well here so that's kind of how you look at it and you just\nYou just call stuff out and go strange that's strange that's we're you know my husband and I been separated for sixteen years but we've not managed to get the divorced on why he that's weird you know that's strange or something
