you're in a weird situation there that if it hasn't\nBut I'll give it to another year or two or whatever and let's get it recovers wants to write a large check to get rid of it I'd rather out a

help I well I hadn't and unusual\nShannon and I've been pondering it for a while\nI'm after my divorce I moved to a guest and started working and I moved in with friends in their garage apartment mhm so I have used the kitchen restroom and laundry on normally think she would renting a room um but I came across a condo\nThat are wandering the realtors own and I had an opportunity to buy it\nFor about fifty two thousand and its values anywhere from sixty five Seventy ... and it ... and lives rented [noise] when I bought it for a couple of years ago and it makes about Thirteen hundred dollars a month\nAnd my rent where I Am in only five hundred and this one's going to be available for the end of the year and I've been pondering do I want to move into it make it in my own home now that if they can\nShow you bought it and it's rented right okay and what's your income oh average about thirty five thousand a year commissions\nMhm okay well I ... the way I answer questions what always ends up happening with me on stuff like you're describing is um what feels good in the short term might not be taking me to my long term goal\nAnd a show or when I'm always asking myself as warm where am I going to be in ten years in which of these decisions takes me there okay now obviously you can live in a garage apartment how old are you\nI'm not fifty five okay and you could live in a garage apartment till you're sixty five and you could make the transactional spread here I'm making next door some extra money doing that is what we're saying and then you the question you ask yourself is is that worth it to you\nDoes that get you some place that you couldn't get otherwise um my tendency personally would be to do everything I can to increase my income during the next ten years and be living in that condo\nOr I mean you landed in the garage apartment as a a a place to heal and and get reset after a divorce right\nBut that really wasn't ... it's kind of camping well when you're not a college student [laughter] I mean this was camping that's right you know and so this isn't like your destiny it's not where you want to be long term but ... and so my point is just because of the numbers work on something doesn't mean it's right\nSo if you feel and you've settled you got your found footing under you again which I'm guessing you do that you bought a condo um probably moving into that condo but the ...\nWhat am I going to be doing ten years from now like me Seventy thousand to the thirty five and what track 'em on there what am I gotta do to get my support a healing is believing in yourself again at a way ... our our believe in yourself in a way maybe you never have to where you put yourself on a career track to get those in comes up long term\nBut a ... if that's where you are that's where your head as I think I'm going to move into the condo now if your head is saying you know I think I'm probably going to the solemn ever going to do I'm just going to ... thirty five thousand into retirement\nYou might want to rent garage department or the other money in your pocket but I don't think that you\nI'm not really like to purchase a house yeah keep ... rental income now well let's get it paid off is paid off oh good that'd be awesome them you will by if you get an extra money to about ... to buy a house with\nI'm saving not at the moment not okay\nThen living in a condo with no payment at all you know you can do that and again getting your income up get you into that go faster so um I I'm going to be working on the income side of the equation and I'm probably going to go and enjoy that paid for condo\nIt's a it's kind of like saying uh I'm back\nYou know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay yeah you're back yeah they all use back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house of them will pay cash for 'cause my incomes going to go up and goes back and uh yeah I'm I'm not gonna camp\nAnymore fifty five it was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but that but you're you know you got past that stage now\nYour back is that okay yeah cool thanks for dropping by saying open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Claire how are you\nA good day how are you know good how can I help\n[noise] um I have a question for you so with all your data sets for a little less in the air now and I feel like we are on I had a retirement but we're behind on college savings for two kids show how old are your kids you\nBut it's not a huge one I mean it's going to produce Fifteen twenty thousand dollars a year in income and um then they've got the other uh Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars a year coming in from Social Security give or take ... and they got to live on that otherwise they burn through this nest egg and they end up having to sell the farm in their old age right\nAnd I don't want him to do that so as long as they'll keep\nA spending less than the income that is produced by the two hundred\nAnd their Social Security stay on a ... household budget that's below that then the game plan you and I just talked about will run in perpetuation no matter how long they live okay\nIs that is that logical to you yesterday as long as they do that then yes I Would do it in a heartbeat a cause I Love the idea of going into your you know your latter years will everything paid for especially your home box when your home is paid for and you're sixty\nSeven you stabilized\nFor the next Thirty years till you're Ninety seven your ... your your housing costs and your housing costs as the largest cost in your budget\nSo if you're renting your rent goes up every year for the next Thirty years if you're sixty seven and and that sounds like homelessness to me later unless you've got a huge mistake and so by owning and by\nOwning with no debt you've completely stabilized your golden years Tyler is with us in Oklahoma City Hi Tyler our you\nHey Dave I appreciate you taking my call sure man what's up [noise] well my uh wife\nAnd I did our debt free scream last year in July so we're on steps four or five and six ... when I got back to the Oklahoma City area ...\nCouple of months later he started to change my job an employer and after a ah what appeared to be a better job of it for us our family at the time and it produced nothing but a year worth of turmoil and so now I just lost my job on friday last week\nI'm working through the debt snowball and all my student loans [laughter]\nI think I pretty much burned myself out of my career path and so\nI'm a pharmacist and light training is is skilled in such that I'm new at this point I don't see myself as as marketable for other areas and so that's why I'm trying to figure out I been reading books like crazy this last year [noise]\nBecause I'm passionate about um group small business I have an entrepreneur heart and I still like working with people that work in the health care sector has just\nEating my lunch this past year and so I'm trying to figure out what to do\nNow is not actually doing pharmacy or dealing with the customers a chew up it's the bureaucracy and show how is there another way we apply your existing education skills to the market that rather than just work in a CBS\nMhm correct um\n\nI don't know but I I Would think that there's got to be some kind of ... year apostolic airy idea out there kind of old school ... high\nEnd delivery or something that is not all insurance based in driving me crazy\nRight you know like ... are you saying that doctors got some of the doctors ... go to the country or model right mhm correct where they lower the number of patients that they see and you pay a flat fee and you've got like they'll do house calls and everything and they actually know their patience now\nRight that kind of thing where they ... they did a different kind of practice management is the I Wonder if there's that kind of application to your world I have no idea I'm making this up right now so I'm flu\nPharmacist job marketing saturated um they've they've been dumping pharmacist more and more pharmacists and ever since I graduated\nWeighing that CBS in Walgreens is just they're just stamping it out that's the ... world so right and that's\nThe world I came from you know a smaller smaller sector and you know here I Am I lost a hundred and forty five thousand dollar income and I'm thinking well you know what next door obviously I Can't pull the Lee I'm so to the doctor the doctor long and I\nWell I mean there's ... there's two things one is I'm trying to think through if I'm you a business model cars you got an entrepreneurial itch to scratch that\nIs some kind of high service ... low insurance no insurance\nApostolic airy model where you use your licensing and your knowledge because you're a very specialized in very valuable knowledge right and that's not what's your burned out on your burn out on the corporate crap\nRight and uh\nAnd so is there another way to be a pharmacist in today's world that you invent even if it's on a small scale I don't care I'm right I'm going to begin to investigate business model ideas like that around the country and see who's doing\nLike an old school of public area I'm almost thinking like a soda\nFountain and the thing like the old days you know kind of thing we're stuff but I don't know I I'm just making this up in my head sitting here I Know that ... here's the thing I Do know about the marketplace the very very high end high service a luxury markets are booming in every sector\nThe uh low end the bottom end which is all price based is booming middle grade product lines of services are not booming in any space\n\nThose are people I mean in other words cheap hotels enriches or doing good the ones in the middle are struggling\nRight and so get off on one end of those spaces you figure it out the bottom and other commodities how spacious killing you so we're probably going to some kind of high end thing is they're the ... to rich people model some way I don't know I'm making this up\nI'm just asking questions out loud now while we're discovering that I might go back in under another year or two of the grinder\nTo put away two hundred thousand bucks to go live my dream with\nOkay\nBut I'm not going to submit myself to Thirty years of this grind\nRight okay\nBut I put up with all kinds of crap for a little while to get to where I Want to go\nThis last year has been so brutal and my wife and family that you know they they know the one I saw um you\nKnow a year and a half ago it's\nBrutal on their wife and family just your time you're ...\n... my my morale\nOkay what's your memorial has everything to do with what you're looking towards you thought you were stuck there I can I don't want my Morales bad if I'm standing and poked my knees okay but not bad if I'm standing ... money's cause I'm walking through that shoveling to use it as fertilizer to grow a crop\nTrue okay you see the difference if I can look past it I can walk to anything but you couldn't look past it in the last year and a destroyed your emotion germ your gas tanks empty\nRight I'm kinda glad that I should that chapter you know turn a new page yeah because\nMy point is you could walk back into a similar situation if you knew you were only doing it for two years because at the end of two years we're going to do X Y and Z right okay\nBut you got to have your X Y and Z defined and I'm I'm not capable of doing that in this setting in you know a minute and forty five seconds on the radio but I mean at least get you started there so you got

twelve Ninety am W T chaos [noise]\nAAA eight to five five two to five Preston is with us in Jacksonville, Florida Hi breast on our you [noise]\nSo I'm doing great day thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nSo I'm currently on baby steps four and six and I'm calling about my house and whether or not I should start throwing all my extra money at it that swept in my budget um because I'm thirty I'm Single um\nWhy are you ... you know when I when God does provide made a woman at coming up right and my goal is to have the highest paid off for a if I get paid off maybe she doesn't want to be here forever hold and I'm not sure that I'll stay here [noise]\nSo does it make sense to start throwing all that money to get paid off early um two years into the mortgage goal to pay it off by the time I'm forty one and I do think it makes sense after all that money out every single male not sure if I'm going to stay here forever\nAbsolutely sure throw the money or that here's an interesting thing we're not spending the money when you reduce your mortgage and you're homeless paid off and you sell your home they give you a check\nAnd all that money comes back to you so it's not like you're throwing the money away you're actually investing it at the rate of interest that your mortgage interest is\nHow much is your mortgage interest rate\nIs proof point through Seventy five percent fair\nTo say you have a three point three Seventy five percent savings account that you can't withdrawal from until you sell it\nIt just I just ... I'm Sorry\nJust chunk it in there I mean Fifteen Percent of your income in baby steps for going into retirement live your life\nAnd my extra money that you find or squeeze throw it at the mortgage until the houses paid off if you do pay it off and said young lady comes along and you got to choose not to live there or you just do not live there\nYou sell the house they give you a check all that money comes back to you we're not spending the money the money's not leaving it's just being deposited into the house\nAnd see the difference Yes sir\nIt's not going anywhere so yeah yeah I'm going to go ahead and pay on average no downside to this except that you can't get to the money without selling the house which is actually kind of a good thing Cindy is with us in Houston, Texas Hi Cindy how are you\nHave ideas\nAnd better than I deserve once\nWell me and my head and currently ... baby baby steps one can lend wet and okay we we instantly hell of a wedding anniversary yeah hey\nHey hey what they eat up for what ... and ... and paid on credit\nFor it that way you know and I'm Troy Detroit keeping it or we can all\nI don't understand how his brain works [laughter] [laughter]\nI thought you said the two of you were working on a plan to get out of that\nI that we were yeah\nI'm more concerned about the fact that he's not on this plan than I Am the ring\nI agree\nBecause what my next week he's going to finance power tools\nMhm yeah and then he's going to come home with a new ... three weeks from now\nWhat have I think a lot more that you go there you go what's finance that six thousand dollar drawn their lawn mower you might be a redneck give you a payments on you're riding mower you know I mean Syria ... did you see the breakdown breakdown is we can't get out of a whole hour digging out the bottom\nCats I told them so I'm a lot more concerned about his lack of grass that this was the family goal that I Am whether or not you keep those ring ... personally I take it back I mean I've been married thirty five years and\nYou know it'd be nice to have an ice rink and you can get another ring I mean there's just stupid rings everywhere I mean there's not a big thing it's not like at your wedding ring or something and it was a an anniversary gift that you all couldn't afford\nClay and hate sweet but dumb you know right yeah I think\nSo but I think the thing is here yeah I'm probably taking it back but more importantly I Want to take his brain and ... back and a little bit better you know in the to you all the ... are we really doing this or not because otherwise you're you're never going to get there\nBecause apparently he's not on the same page or on that's big thing I mean Ninety percent of this question is around that ten percent on one of the keep the ring or not\nSo young and so this ring is not going to make or break you get out of debt plan one way or the other but this behavior will\nA he'll be twenty eight [laughter]\nOkay um is what\nIs one of the nature what's the nature of his disability\n[noise] um [noise] a losing land okay I'm In a a in a concrete labor accident\nGotcha okay leg or arm what leg okay All right and I'm\nNot to minimize that 'cause that's a horrible thing but that's all\n[laughter] yeah and you know I think basically what's been happening is there's been any different disputes back and forth in counter stewing going on by lawyers\nAnd that's all that's all behind us you think now you think this was coming to a head\nI think it's I'm finally getting to the point to where there's going to be actual real settlement um talk and um there's just been some shady things going on in the court cases\nWell what else what twenty million dollars is they're gonna they're gonna mess with it you can count on that [noise] yeah okay\nWow\nAll right so uh and what is his emotional and mental state\nI think honestly he just wants to be working he wants to be back at work\nHe doesn't want is going to get what a prosthetic leg and he'll be able to do something with his mind now only won't be doing heavy lifting things or something like that probably right\nExactly that's that's the hope except for he's got a desire to do those kinds of things so it's really killing him to around\n... around but I mean I'm you know you usually actually make more money with your mind that you do with your body anyway\nRight as a career path so generally speaking and so that's forced upon him here which is I'm not not a bad thing is what I'm thinking so I I think he he gets to sit down and ask themselves the question what do I want to do if I could do anything in the world because now he can do anything in the world\n[noise] right right\nAnd so I'm going to coach him on finding a career that he loves and I'm going to spend a very small percentage of this money because they won't take as much of that ... percent of that much money to do some kind of retooling as far as education goes\nAnd saying okay I'm going to get a degree in X or y or I'm going to get some training an extra y and I'm going to learn to be one of those things over there or whatever those things are that he wants to do so what's he want to be when he's fifty five years old that he's made his life's work and his career and he\nGets to choose that now that's awesome can be a self employed track it could be a A R track of uh some kind of a a a I don't know I mean anything but it's obviously not going to be something that is physically um demanding okay\nRight that's okay that's okay in terms of technology though um he's kind of wanting to start his own business now he's getting all these ideas and they have no water that acts implications on something like this that you've donated be facing with\nIt depends on how the settlement is structured and you'd have to talk with his uh uh uh attorney and was from tax advice to find out how it's structured in California as well that's correct down\nThat that's the first thing you need to figure out what's taxes are going to be and what the lawyers' fees are going to be and then you know what you're going to have met the second thing then is figure out what we're going to I Would I Would urge him to pretend like this money's not there by and large\nMenu if let's say there's twenty million after taxes just use the number okay and you know if you've pulled a million out to start a business and to coast for a little while emotionally\nAnd that leaves you're Nineteen million that you just pretend like you're not there\nThat makes sense that's pretty bad yeah I mean you could buy anything you want to do with that right that's a lot of freeway money okay so absolutely something along those lines and then what I Want him to do is to build himself a uh the Bible says in the\nUh in ... in the abundance of counsellors there are safety in the multitude of counsellors there's safety so he needs to build himself a little board of directors\nA needs an estate planner\nA that's a lawyer he needs a tax professional probably that as a lawyer but at a minimum is a CPA um [noise] a needs and investment person in his corner\nI'm ... probably you when someone else sitting there that will look at him and telling me stupid when he was being stupid and he needs to commit himself to\nGathering information from this group of people before he does something\nDoes that make sense because yeah white people lose money like this is is that they go off on their own and they don't have the tools mentally to to manage this and you've got to put some people in your life not that do it for you but that coach you\nAs a group to do this I don't want one person managing your weather and that's how I get shy strict right and and I don't want you doing it by yourself\nThey're probably not completely equipped but we're going to put a group of people around him if he wants to do some real estate and he has a high quality real estate person sitting on his little board right but we got a CPA we gotta stay plan or we got a tax person\nMay be a real estate person may be an investment person in the mutual funds world and then we're going to build a game plan here this is what we do with like an NFL player that asked us what to do\nThey get they get a ten million dollar signing bonus and they're really good at football but they are not really good money\nAnd so they don't if you don't end up on the front of Sports Illustrated be one of those stupid people that lost a million dollars here's how you do it you put some people in your corner that teach you coach you and God you as a group\nYou don't have one person doing it and then you gradually over the years become very adept at managing twenty million dollars\nWith the help of these people teaching you and they all need to have the heart of a teacher they don't need to be arrogant and bossy\nBut they and they need to say they need to look at him and telling the truth and kindly but go listen here's why you don't want to do that you can do it but here's why you don't want to do that and then and he needs to commit to keeping his hands off of the bulk of it and put it in investments forget it's there\nAnd he can live the rest of his life easy easy but if he goes into size to open a twenty million dollar technology thing he's going to lose it all by the ... three years from now all the money will be gone\nYeah that's what I'm afraid of too yeah I'm so don't do that you know don't don't don't open a twenty million dollar business don't open a business that takes up all this to open a business is very small\nHe's got plenty of money he doesn't have to prove anything okay take your time to be the tortoise don't be the hair and just take your time put a group of counselors and the multitude accounts for their safety put a group of counsellors in your life that are professionals in the different areas that can speak to you teach you and how old is he today\n... ... so the goal is by the time he's thirty eight he has a clue\nOkay yeah along the lines of managing twenty freaking million dollars\n[laughter] it'll it'll take ten years for him to intellectually an emotionally get his arms around it and he'll lose it all if he starts trying to do one or two plays with all that money\nI'm going to open a traitor pizza parlors all gone it's all gone you know I'm gonna I'm gonna be the next Facebook no you're not it's all gone\nIt's all gone OK so take a small amount of it and get yourself back to work to give you the dignity of work and to create an income where you really don't need any of that money any way and it's just sitting there growing and then this horrible tragic event\nTurns into a financial blessing that changes his family tree for the you know for generations to come\nBecause he's wise with it does that make sense\nYeah thank you very much appreciate all the if I\nMay that's exactly what we would do if we were in the

and a hundred and Seventy thousand with our wonderful state it lands from a private Christian university\nExpenses passes\nIt yet [laughter] oh okay so this you drop some coin and yeah All right and um then six and a half years that's a long time to pay off the student loans I was thinking maybe it was the house when he told me six and a half years so there has to be a good story tell me your story\nI got a really funny story actually um when we went through financial piece at our church at the time\nOne of the things that you mentioned in your video was or take cash with you when you when we were we were newlyweds when we first went through and he said take cash what'd you when you go to a furniture store to buy a car and and and flash the cashing in and talked to them that way so\nWe were at a furniture store and I'm a very non confrontational kind of guy kind of a free spirit and she told me hey let's do this let's put this to practice so we took cash in and I'm Talking to the sales guy\nA bad we're trying to buy up for our department at the time and I'm flashing the cash and saying hey I'm going to walk as if we can't make this happen right now and he's like I'm I'm Sorry that that's just the price and so I just went out in the car and set down because I couldn't swallow my pride and buy it but then my wife ended up by\nUs to talk of that that that's just the to show that\nThere was a lot of negotiations in the beginning we were really um when we were dating and engaged at the time we were sitting there with their finances and we were actually writing out the numbers and it was just this\nPet feeling in her stomach those were just indebted to these loan companies and we're going to be in our fifties before we pay 'em off and\nUm so and so we started the class we now down to budget and did the envelope systems we were really um persistent and faithful with envelopes this down and just really got serious about it and\nI think the big part and for us for as far as deciding to really try to work on maybe step too as\nWe paid by car off a relatively quickly and then he had gotten his first pretty big bonus from work and so we were like okay we haven't really gotten to travel before kids let's take a really great trip to Europe with this money we deserve it\nAnd we were sitting there one time we were like oh we're we just did our budget you know a few months ago and said that was the first step we use that bonus money instead of a trip to Europe which who knows if we'll be able to take that ever and that's okay but we uh\nWhy wouldn't you like a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in debt and\nOur first uh you know we have two kids so it doesn't take away a lot of kids in your\nCountry [laughter]\nSo yeah that that was the big you know turning point for us when we put that big lump sum of money and our first a student loan payment and there was an awful feeling that hurting but a good feeling\nTo show how much of the six years did you make closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years a product of the last year last year the incomes doubled down right ... and so that's a relatively new figure correct then and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right there so you really have been doing this ... okay and then the last year or kicked in about the time you saw the light at the end the total income comes up ... yeah yeah what what was the hardest part of this for you all six and a half and a good\nAnd I think for me the hardest part was I'm starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see the hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of
