men\nStudies show a family's financial health is also likely to be severely weakened even if they have insurance some people never do recover medical bills are the number one cause of bankruptcy according to a number of surveys and insurance may not help as much as you might think\nWe know that from surveys people say they are in deep financial trouble even if they have coverage so both of you read the insurance policy carefully and if you talk to people about what their experiences our insurance at this point doesn't offer real protection\nThat Dr David ... distinguished professor of public health that the city University of New York at Hunter College\nIf you're actually sick most people are faced with such high co payments from the ... that they are in deep financial trouble even if I have coverage so many of us have policies that have a thousand or even two thousand dollars deductible before the insurance\nKicks in and even after that a lot of policies say you have to pay twenty percent of our cost if you're hospitalized or have a major procedure and hospitals steak can easily run up to a hundred thousand dollars so that could leave you with a bill of twenty thousand dollar even if you have insurance\nSo while millions more Americans have insurance now than did a few years ago as a result of Obamacare your share of the cost of any illness is going up\nMore than half of people who get their coverage from their employer now have at least a thousand dollar deductible in this country and that was a tiny fraction back Fifteen Twenty years ago so deductibles\nAre rising and co payments are rising as you say out of pocket caps are rising as well under the Obamacare policies which\nHave help people but it's still left them\nIn deep trouble a lot of the policies have an out of pocket cap of six thousand dollars now for most families of six thousand dollar hit that comes when you're sick and frankly in danger of losing income because you're out of work means that you're really not protected\nBut how common is it for families to get into financial trouble as a result of all that what's the average bill for example that's left for someone to pay out of\nMarket when they go into the hospital a new study and the American economic reviews sought to find out\nAfter someone goes to a hospital we wanted to know what are the financial consequences of that and does it depend on whether people have health insurance or not at the time they go to the hospital\nThat's what led us to do this really time intensive effort of merging consumer credit reports just like you and I would get from one of the credit reporting agencies we merged all of those credit report records with\nHospitalization records and that allowed us to see what happened to people before and after they were in the hospital\nThat Dr Matthew no to dig do associate professor of economics and strategy at Northwestern University He's also co author of the study which searched millions of hospital in financial records he\nSays there was a wide disparity between patients with insurance who had virtually no extra charges to pay and those who were caught by surprise but the average hospitalized patients with insurance fared pretty well\nWe do see some unpaid medical bills even for people that are insured not incredibly large amounts of money but it's a few hundred dollars on average\nMan their interpretation which I'm going to rely on because they're the consumer finance experts is that in some cases people may either be struggling with the deductibles and co payments on their health insurance plans which could lead to these unpaid bills that we're seeing on their credit report\nBut another hypothesis they had was that some individuals just might not understand exactly what they need to pay or there could be ongoing disagreements about exactly what they need to pay and some of those disagreements might be resulting in unpaid bills or debt that's been sent to a collection agency", "show_name": "Radio Health Journal", "year": "2018", "city": "Savannah", "day": "07"}
