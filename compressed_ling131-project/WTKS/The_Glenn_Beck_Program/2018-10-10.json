I mean because I saw lots of\nTea partiers going to the Supreme Court in banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to hang on the laws the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because they're supposed we're supposed to be in a civil society right am I trying to remember\nI'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their children you know and the homemade signs how many people they chase down in restaurants and surrounded cannot think of one exam in fact if you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do during the health care bill\nShe and a was a John Lewis marched out in to the crowded in to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't\nDo you remember where they tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they\nLinked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to they were trying to get the Tea Party to become a violent mob they didn't\nCan you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington DC you would not have been pretty it would not have been pretty and by the way I mean you know you can\nTalk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob there like charging cities and they're taking over that's the I shouldn't that's a riot that is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob please look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make sure we know what we're talking about\nMob mob a large crowd of people especially one that has this orderly and intent on causing trouble or violence okay and and the quote is a mob of protesters that say that their usage so is this\nNot a disorderly crowd of people that are trying to what it would be a ... percent on causing truck in tents on causing trouble\nI mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not causing trouble I mean if you're going to go down that road I guess in that that doesn't does it say there and unless you're right\nIt just says intent on causing trouble right it doesn't say you know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm\nSaying though is that the media does not see harassing conservatives\nAs causing trouble correct that is the issue correct they see this as a currency that says like the you know there it's basically you know charity we're at right I mean that they're they're doing good for the people you're stopping\nThese evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that [laughter] things but uh yeah I mean they try and the Irish guy who runs this other art [laughter] let me tell you leave the white people white people really do ya [laughter]\nReally bad oh really [laughter] okay so let's listen to a couple of things first we have ...\nLet's just go through they'll just go through this because they say this isn't this isn't our time\nThis is this is the Nineteen thirties and forties\nOkay uh the ... the u._s. isn't a massive topic each a tepid economic recovery following a catastrophic downturn millions of Americans continue to feel left behind yep that's that's been proven now we're not in a tepid recovery are we some turn their anger on corporations and Wall Street yes that would be the left\nThat would be the left and others target non white immigrant workers\nWho's doing that\nI mean I guess they would claim that like border enforcement right\nLike yeah that's border enforcement that'll offering than ... yeah that's the law they're claiming we do not know who's in our country and we're also worried about terrorism I'm a charismatic media personality with a populist message attacks religious minorities who could that be [laughter]\nI I I Know I Know I went to stand with Israel if anybody's attacking religious minorities hell with that\nReligious majorities it's the left conservatives denounces the president and his allies for flouting the Constitution's during the United states toward socialism yep did that one because that's what's happening that's what did\nHappen I ask a Alexandria Ocasio Cortez yeah that's a it's a crazy accusations rice\nPoint many on the left warn that fascism is taking root and America no socialism is taking root in America socialism\nYeah I mean people in the less they fascists every time someone do something they don't like write as much as ... fascism it that is it\nSocialism that is sweeping the nation remember the headline where all socialist now that's what sleeping is sweeping the nation are\nParallels between the two areas aren't perfect but the late Nineteen thirties I thought oh that\nIs an understatement of the year ... a lot of the parallels between the two hours aren't perfect they're not perfect but I did one way to describe you've just done yeah about three quarters of them are completely inaccurate\nBut as an aide to a night late Nineteen thirties as today political rancor social division and the threat posed by alien ideologies sparked widespread unease\nWhat is the alien ideology of today yeah of today or back then I mean the fact that\nOne of the two major party has embraced democratic socialism is already alien to me yes the the the fear back in the thirties was communism\nOr the ... and the left said no it's fascism\nWell okay um\nI guess I mean it was Adolf Hitler and Mussolini that said that ah FDR is one of us he is a fascist so maybe it was bad but there's more ...\nIs news radio Ninety seven points at an end twelve Ninety am union chaos and um\nFox News I'm Chris foster hurricane Michael's getting even

I Can't remember which one it was but it was a communist organization that was against\nA all of the um all of the American legion Z and they were coming up so they're they they go and they protest I think it was a parade and they actually end up rioting and killing people okay good then you look in the Nineteen thirties and forties\nIt's essentially it was a an industrial workers of the world by\n... thank you okay Minneapolis or Minneapolis Teamsters strike Nineteen thirty for the auto light strike the west coast long shore strike do you even know what that one was that when that happened that may ninth\nThrough October twelfth that one's shut down San Francisco bay a the ports in California\nPortland and Seattle Mm and who was behind that one uh probably some conservative thing yeah no no the textile workers' strike of Flint sit down strike the battle over the overpass the republic steals strike almost all of these\nAnd including many of the race riots have\nCommunist and Marxist fingerprints on them\nPlus I mean it's it's a fundamental to the ideology right rebel yesterday is fundamental to the ideology\nSource and not surprising that this was happening again so I just I'm I'm really tired\nOf of hearing a or I should say it this way I'm really tired of the media and their lives\nIn a violent but it's going to make it worse I mean what Ted Cruz did was when\nRight what did you did tell me Ted Cruz lost that they did we lose the cabinet I think that we didn't we didn't come out in the streets and and and scream and beat the crap out of people would Kavanaugh is he in the Supreme Court we would have lost the Kevin okay yeah you would have lost that you would have lost you would've ... certainly were lost Jeff Flake he was dying to vote no but we didn't give me the opportunity\nYou went through and handle the situation right now Kevin I was on the Supreme Court handled well\nWhat's and what's the next level they're going to go out\nAnd I don't know we'll have to wait and see you seem to want to predict it an act on it now yeah and I'm I'm I'm not with you on that believe me I Will protect my family and I without\nMy security guards I'm Sorry I my threats are a little bit more than getting dirty looks in the grocery store what to do the Kroger though have you ever had that no I've never had ever said manager Kroger look at my shirt [noise] ah so I I I Am sorry that you don't have a my security\nI'm I Am sorry that my family has to go through this the threats I just wrote to a friend I just wrote to a friend this morning who said hey I Want to come and stay with you guys are you know just hang out with guys over the weekend blah blah blah I said my wife\nDoesn't do that anymore I've been trying to get my life but my wife to\n[noise] to push her guard down we don't have people over to our house anymore we don't have anyone over at our house anymore we don't do things like that because our life has been so unbelievably chaotic\nAnd yes a little more than Kroger I Am not mocking you for what you have to go through\nI Would just like to remind you that Martin Luther king went through a lot more Abraham Lincoln went through a lot more\nAbraham Lincoln if you don't think Abraham Lincoln as a man wanted to make that South hey\nIf you don't think he did you do know history if you think that our greatest founding fathers said\nExactly the same thing we do not want war we do not want bloodshed\nTake it take it take it until they couldn't take it anymore and they then wrote the declaration of independence which did not lead with why they were so mad instead they wrote up please this is who we are\nAnd will stand\nYou just seem to want to fight I Am not with you by look to win\n[noise]\nBarring [laughter] I Want to tell you about pro flowers if you need to send somebody in a sari nuts pro flowers I'm a one eight hundred flowers dot com if you need to send somebody uh flowers you need to apologize to somebody who you view you've screwed up with your wife for whatever\nSend one eight hundred flowers dot com they have your back send the flowers right now they have a special that is happening right now if you use the promo code or back you're going to get a dozen red roses are multi colored roses for twenty nine Ninety nine but if you use the ... they'll give you another doesn't so two dozen roses\nAbsolutely absolutely free the extra doesn't end the free glass base go there and now one eight hundred flowers dot com it's one eight hundred flowers dot com use the promo code back [noise]\nLike back and get more on Sunday from ten to one on news radio twelve Ninety and Ninety seven point seven W.

risk of isolated severe weather including isolated tornadoes increases worse whether first time it Thursday keeping you updated on WTO see this afternoon I'm cutter Martin double duty chaos so bad\nRan along on your retirement your leaning land and program\nI Want to thank and a ... or he is he's a guy that we had books last hour and a kind of went in a different direction but I did it fits right in to what we have been talking about today I had a caller uh about an hour and a half ago who said that you know when is it time that we are going to fight back\nAnd we should fight back we should fight back in the polls we should stand the crew and steady we have to speak truth do not forget the things that we were all taught and we all know\nAre true to be civil and kind to one another but we were not in a place where I think you grab a gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst heads stats are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books on outrage\nOf a nice time and good talk about outright\nAnd we did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime and rage and outrageous in headlines of articles all the time\nBut it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case talking about how Christians might engage the age of outrage and I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think\nYou know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate your responded\nA and mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is Dan's response is I mean that just said I'll just say it I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people feel right I Know you are there's a lot of built up outrage\nThat is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center\nA well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage\nIn a world filled with outrage or and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up to bring in that case up even today\nBut it but I but again I I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll though he was in the end Victoria's\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution\nUh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings\nThey're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened we're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment for them you know not every we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation has face their challenges\nBut this is our moment and in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart in some stats up some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our\nCable news network or we don't need to be a shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he he was in the temple and he turned over tables\nBut he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around to the American woman at the well\nAnd I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to get like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know we don't stand up for things don't I mean even you said\nYou fight but you fight or a you know for example or you can't war at a people\nAnd reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're user title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nTo not participate in creating photo and falls crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court ... Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways ...\nKnow we're winning it's not they're not performing mobs and going out and and you know ah trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are it it it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm so for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life you know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the gold those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling\nThat's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot and Christians in the age of outrageous is to I used to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some\nApproaching an income for what it's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all just strategically you lose\nBut also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack\nAnd our art type has always been Moses and Jesus and we take Jesus Moses out who are we modeling ... Moore we modeling who are we striving to be we cannot forget our art type back in just a second\nWho I mean I I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you I'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're going to come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit\nAnd we're gonna crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said\nWe understand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with pita yeah unbelievable what's happening\nWell we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating upper called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate 'cause you know Vickers right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent\nAnd and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about trying to hold back the advance of course to either pagan\nAnd he says this I'll watch the pagan priest neglect the poor the hated galleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these in pious galleons empire ... not only feed their own poor but I was also welcome them into their about by\nThe name of the book is the name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage pick it up meat is well worth the read\nRush is next to a new now more back on news radio twelve Ninety and Ninety seven points to have in common UT chaos a\nBox news radio when Chris posture parts of the Florida Panhandle are already getting close to sixty mile an hour wind gusts gusts near the center of hurricane Michael are hitting a hundred and sixty five miles an hour with Limbaugh expected\nIn a couple of hours time to evacuate and coastal areas has come and gone Florida governor Rick Scott up to fourteen feet of water could come up on shore does\nStick around to experience star search don't typically lived to tell about it unfortunately\nAdministrator Brock Long Sears has hired advisors we now know to help get ready to file for bankruptcy\nWall Street journal says and three partners has been working on the possible reorganization for weeks those Sears is still working on ways to avoid bankruptcy\nSeries is facing a loan payment it's CEO hedge fund manager Edward lamprey has helped it to avoid bankruptcy so far by making the payments himself Fox is Janine cars sold in New York\nThis is Fox News [noise]\nPay again it staying with that Kurds flooring and I still get asked if we're still matching Home Depot and Lowe's prices ...\nYes [laughter] it doesn't matter how free there this and that is or their labor or whatever you're paying for it even if it's free\nOf four to five times I talked to folks that have gone there before coming to see us and it turns out I can cross over the products exactly and at least match the price if not beat it it's funny the only ad I ever hear from them it's all about free free free price price price\nBut never about quality now I guarantee we will explain the project better show you how the install will happen better coordinate with you in the installers better and leave you happy with that you gave us a chance to be Home Depot or lows\nWhether it's carpet hardwood collect vinyl products it is my goal in life to take whatever I can from those guys\nWere always right behind the green frogs sleep center and the carpet savannah dot com or give us a shout at three five five six two to four\n...
