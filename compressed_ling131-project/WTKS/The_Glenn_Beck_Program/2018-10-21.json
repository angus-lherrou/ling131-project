{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "And and I think the kids have a right to to to say what they want and we need to do something about it and frankly we haven't done much about it since Columbine except write more gun laws and tried to ban guns and and and of course as the n._r._a. fault so\nThat's what what bothers me is I think these kids are being misled because they're being organized by these left wing groups that are that are organizing these marches and never let a credit crisis go to waste type thing but what about those those active shooters in in a school I'm I've always been in favor of of arming teachers\nBut if I if if I have my gun out and you show up\nAnd I'm I'm trying to get how do you know I'm not the bad guy with a gun instead of the good guy with a gun\nAnd that's an issue is um you know we trained for this stuff just like I think in this incident the um the shooter actually tried to go in and hide into the air out and so you know we're constantly evolving our training to make sure that we address these issues like you say an arm civilian um stuff like that and\nYou know one of my things that I always say is um you know having young daughters\nTeaching them how to drive I had to go through all kinds of steps to say okay they can parallel park they know three point they have to take these um I have to sign off on all these training things\nBut I Do is walk and get a gun and there is no training there is no we talk about our rights we need to talk about our responsibilities yes on you know I I I talked with some of our staff the other day we've had over a dozen guns stolen\nFrom unlock cars\nUnlock cars you're going to leave a loaded firearm and unlike car and those guns go right into the criminal element and that's where we need to talk about responsibilities people security or guns don't let you know people if you if you have somebody in your family with mental health problem or mental illness\nThey shouldn't um those guns should be safely secured in a safe and and same with the car wash cars\nAbsolutely and and it's you know and and you're right a soul and right out of unlocked cars I seem to seem the ultimate irresponsibility and people ought to be trained with ... I've had the active training I had military training as well\nBut I've had the active training is like you said with with even with your guys who get the training all the time and you practice practice practice and somebody said once you shoot him in the foot once you shouldn't have a leg you go for center mass you you don't have time to to sit there and take game like the like when you're shooting at the paper targeting moving and they shouldn't back at you\nSure but I Can't tell you how many people have walked into my office and said hey I bought a gun can you show me how it works [laughter] I Am old I'm asked me you know the old urban myth\nUm can I shoot him here can I shoot him in the house outside of the house and I go you have a thing that's capable of taking a human life and you have an educated yourself on when it's appropriate\nUm and some people use it you know we we see these road rage incidents where everybody's brandishing it waving their guns around and um you know we've got to talk about conflict resolution we've got to talk about when it's appropriate and and that's something that we're not doing is is talking about the responsibility of owning a gun\nIndeed I Am ... and the question that's assisting that's hard to keep his how many times guns have save lives we have one of our callers are a few years ago call up and said he was filling up his car at three in the morning you've been working late\nAnd the three young gentleman started approaching him and ... they weren't carrying any books or anything so he didn't figure they were going to ask for help with their algebra homework so he just pulled out his glock and started polishing up a little bit and all of a sudden they didn't seem as interested in talking to him anymore\nSure and and you know obviously we want everybody to have the right to protect themselves but we we just like you said you have military training you have experience with weapons we want everybody to have that and so one of the things we'll probably look at it in the future is um having more citizens um gun training um so that they are responsible with these weapons and uh\nI Would encourage everybody to have\nYou know everybody thinks I'll put it between the towels and the upper part of the closet and my kids will never know and I'm anybody who has kids know that they may rummage through the house and they find these guns and then I've seen a lot of kids accidentally killed and I'm playing with guns\nWhat a shame what a shame um we're talking with mark revenue the savannah police chief what do you think um the ... what kind of training to your officers go through on on active ... active\nShooting oh we we train every year in the schools um\nWe put them in real life situations we actually um shoot back at them with um what we call simulated firearms and it hurts um they have all kinds of protection and all that yeah but it it\nIs is close to realistic as you can possibly get because we want them in that stressful situation we want their heart rate up we want their nervousness I'm\nTo be a factor so they can remain calm and go through these schools and get to the problem right away and we're so much better equipped than we were when Columbine happened you know back then that the the attitude was surrounded contain now it's save lives\nYou know because I I I thought that one of the biggest tragedies not on Columbine was there was I think there was a teacher that bled to death he would probably have we gotten gotten to him almost right away he would've lived but it was a two hours before before they went in and got this guy\nSure and in it but it's not only schools that were training you know we've seen these incidents in Aurora, Colorado at a movie theater and we've seen that these other events so we're looking at all facets of the threats men were trying to stay ahead of the threats\nYou know what what what's the best training the officers have and and what do you what do you like to see in your officers especially when you're when when somebody graduate from the academy when the when the young ... when the rookies come in what's that what's that process going through you know it's all\nAbout having a great mentor you you can you can teach them and put books in front of them but having another experienced officer just learning how to talk to people you know officers encounter\nUm ... and everybody from doctors to homeless people and having that ability and I was lucky with Bush ... out there and poor he he had amazing ability to deal with all walks of life and he treated them all fairly respectfully and and we we he preached that to me uh we've carry that\nAttitude throughout you know poor and um and that's something but yeah our officers go through an academy that we send them through another two months of patrols go where we teach them these techniques and then we put them with a field training officer for several more months\nUm but even then there are still green and you know and they need a mentor and that's a there's an old saying departments only as good as its sergeants the sergeants are the ones where the rubber meets the road and they're out there and they're correcting these you know issues um it it for example just little stuff like um\n[noise] if you give somebody a citation\nAnd you say have a good day they're not going to have a good day no matter how nice you mean that it's a sarcastic and do you teach your officers don't say have a good day ... you know that it it you may need it yeah but they're not gonna take it that way and um and I used to get that in polar was a people call me and say you know I was really mad I got a citation\nBut I just want to say I can't be mad because your officers were so professional respectful towards me explaining it and that's what we teach them is is you know I have a saying I'm every what we have a saying a good people do bad things sometimes\nWell there's you know and and there's another you'd do quarter to great Chinese proverb a while ago but there was an old saying that the good judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment we learn\nMistakes yeah and and and that's something that we see a lot of times is uh when we make a mistake or we see another department in another area like they are looking at this um Florida shooting 'em we take those and we use those as training episodes to ah see what they did right what they did wrong and this all\nWell just constantly evolves or training and it's very expensive to keep these officers trained and informed\nChore and does it help working with we're about a minute left to working with the school police but Oh absolutely\nAbsolutely chief economic and his staff or we'd been working with them extensively on this uh played walk out but now that I'm planning on the shooting incidents and stuff like that yes we train extensively with all the municipalities our state and federal partners\nMark ah it it's always been a pleasure know when you're working with the with the with the poor police department but I think they made a very wise decision of getting used to retrieve while they look for the for the the new guy or gal for that matter\nWell thank you bill and I'm not there to make change but ah hopefully I'm like in you know I Am saying to make it a campground leave it better than you found it\nWell enough that you love the attitude that you have and and we were ... we hire good people let them do their job\nAnd get out of their way lower um and that's hopefully I can keep that\nGo ... one of the ... when I was doing sports when there was ... Herzog was a manager of the Kansas City royals at the time I think\nAnd George Brett was a ... on on a track of hitting four hundred back in the early eighties I remember and somebody said what are you what kind of pet do you get the George British at I just don't know where to hit George ... current event [laughter]\nSure well we're bombarded as you know by all kinds of information and all kinds of media sources or\nA you know people ranting and raving on the radio and television and newspapers and magazines law that stuff is competitive and people are very wary about it you know they they're they're biased detectors or have always working uh you know even even when I listen to their their favorite\nCommentator they're still kind of you know it's you see the human hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans are ... are headed out when\nPeople are you yeah of course but when people are using it\nTurns out my research shows other research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine\nThey turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause they think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm and I can trust a subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what's higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product\nIn search results uh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed him in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it and that we've done with for national elections involving you know\nA more than ten thousand people a I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes with no one having this latest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track\nYou do that is scary\nIt is you um you lead us out in the in the um creepy line I'm about how Google has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda [noise]\nUm and then uh how they have ... you know\nThe ... when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou were you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrectly you have absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national study in the U.S almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy thing there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias so you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you\nUh we did a a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen\nNinety nine point five percent of people in the study or could see no bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism or and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs\nAre in their voting preferences so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability\nTo shift people's thinking and behavior worldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and it was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs or around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and without leaving a paper\nTrail because when you're showing something someone search results have felt like a news story than just stays there for people to look at it's generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\n\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know we'll send in Bernays a in\nWorld War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that\nThis is the\nThis is the system that they would have dreamt of for propaganda [laughter] [noise]\nOh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article\nA called a can a ways big tech can shift\nMillions of votes in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA that's just one of ten ways\nAh that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment ah that these big tech companies have to shift votes\nAnd that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before uh and they they they're I mean some of these effects that that that I've a disk\n... are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd they're ... years and there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\n[noise] well in two thousand sixteen early to say I have a sixteen\nA working in secret uh I developed a system for actually monitoring what\nPeople are seeing while they were using a the Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system as it was a first ever\nCreated and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton who am I favored by the way\nAs you mentioned a in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty blatant that's pretty extreme wow or sees leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nA you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them and uh I don't think we should be surprised\nUh that we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time will actually\nBe able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point uh you know our issue we well I Wish we could be fully up and running\nAnd time for the midterms and uh at this point I'd say that's not going to happen but\nWe will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at\nMore than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nOr that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which\nGlenn oh\nBut I Am I in trouble [laughter] [noise] what\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news for you\nOkay I'm ... [laughter] All right\nLet's let's say that are a very good and the good the good news I mean the the good news is that um\nThat Glenn Beck dot com right yeah and your email service that you use a ... is is you are not sharing information you're sharing your emails with Google Now interesting\nLapse in New York Times\nThe times of London the economist wired magazine slate I could go on and on and on may share all of their emails\nAll the time with the Google and other sensitive documents too and so reporter is when they're doing you know very sensitive investigations on something they're sharing everything constantly with Google and I wrote a piece about that was in the Daily Caller a couple of months ago it's good news is you don't do that\nNo no no no no no everyone said Einstein no one's\nEver seen it oh okay [laughter] so [laughter] [noise] excuse me uh so you were just about to give me more good news\n[noise] [noise] well no the good news is again you you you do not share your emails with Google a lot of major news organizations like the New York times and the Boston Globe they do but it's bad news is\nThat a Glenn Beck dot com uses Google Google Analytics and so what that means is everyone who has ever visited your website is tracked every single thing they do on your website is tracked by Google\nSo here's a here's the problem is a business owner Google Analytics or the best\nNow do you how do you how do you do business without Google at times that's that's always the thing that gets you in\nThe yeah for sure but you know ... you know this is this convenience thing over and over and and the products are so good so but you don't realize that these aren't real products they're just surveillance platforms that's the only reason they run them every single service they provide as just another surveillance platform\n[laughter] uh I Do have a little bit more good news though which is that film that you mentioned the creepy lie has a when ... when\nYou had a my ... one of my new very good friends Peter Schweitzer on your show recently of is a uh he's the one who would who really got that film running\nA ... if it wasn't available but now as of right now it is available both on Amazon and on I tense for for rental or sale and it's it and it really is a fabulous film\nAnd builds Google it just go to the freebie lying dot com when you came out about some of this stuff and again you were a Hillary supporter when you came out about this ... were you you were blocked by Google for a time where you are not\nWell when I when my research a first hit the news and the Washington Post\nA you know I found that starting the next day I couldn't access any\nGoogle products I couldn't even access to Google dot com so [laughter] I have these amazing screen shots that they're just shocking to people because you can't even imagine not being able to access to Google yeah I have to screen shots showing getting these time out saying no you know you can't get their sorry\nIt's amazing okay let's go through some of the\nUh ... some of the uh affects that you are monitoring we have about about a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there was the last\nSeven ten or ten of these\nThat you're following ten altogether okay out an altogether okay so let's take on one real quick\nBegin very good when ... here we go this is called the SST or the search\nSuggestion effect when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you typed so if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon\nRight away they'll start slashing suggestions at you and Amazon it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that they are flashing asked you to turn a fifty fifty vote among\nA fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety ten split with all my one having any idea that they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my gosh okay\nWe're gonna come back and uh and go through the others if we have time he'll talk\nAbout some of the other things Google is doing and what we're supposed to do about it you need to know about it you can see it in the ... the line\nIt's a new documentary the freebie line dot com the freebie line dot com um\nHe's news radio Ninety seven point seven and ... am W.

what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned it was definitely fun fun right hum that he misses\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway right out of that um but yeah so we learned our lesson we we took the criticism we got from that to heart ...\nUh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead\nWe committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use paid to publish journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't\nCharge like a hundred dollars they charge like a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope people continue to\nAddress it a secondly we decided that um we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if our if we hadn't gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and voted that we were wrong but it's it's not what happened um and uh early\nOn in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already so he's on the recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and since he's been recording us I mean clearly what ever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when a project where it came out to the public eye took\nMay be that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nOn my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I talked to hell in the other day yeah\nAh so this was in in in the men's amount of work required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers of typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work there was an insane amount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of\nBackground in some of this but this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers and striking us are only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of the the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do and the research side of their career is to get papers published in well established journals\nAre for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper in and I paid ... is a feminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight looking at the academic community that that scholars imbedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement\nBe qualified for tenure um our paper spanned the ones we wrote spend Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo did you at the un and ... you had twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and then this came out and so you you pulled those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven and Thirteen would have gotten in in the end we not gotten cold\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so so are we as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and credible where they got a little gold star for [noise]\nClaims that\nYou know that the ... when you watch on demand\nThat the dot com slash TV you can watch every episode uh for

or not the dog they go home to want it or not because how could\nWe know that as being ... and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little video we put out to announce the project\nThey're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um\n[noise] and going out to what what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... what I mean\nYou got me man\n[laughter] and then it was done in the privacy of a of a veterinary office [laughter]\nOkay um let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nIs that the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which fat is displayed politically so that fat as just considered another to issue a that equal was muscle\nAnd to say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people pat phobic as they call it\n... and that was accepted\nYeah that was accepted that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um especially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity or who wrote that who we claimed that paper and he actually has a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something that I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind of this guy being the author of this paper for fat body building was just kind of hilarious\nBecause that's another thing to do a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking what it would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean those kind of a is this is a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship ... stand or fall on its merit not on who did it and so\nA lot of people are are making that point and we deliberately chosen names that would be hard to find in a Google Search in a district which was very common names on purpose I actually used\nA a a I roll dice to pick a fight off of a list of\nThe most common name for certain years and the way that would blend in with lots of people\nOkay hang on and I got to take another break and come back in and finish up why why you thought that was important in and go through some of the [noise]\nThe other studies are back in the back and just as\nGo on and on and he was ready to move savannah Don Young\nMobile weather or Mexico or that I record setting Saturday with your baby neuron sixty five Seventy perhaps need her eyes mandate forty six Seventy three and sunshine TSE personal or whether team meteorologist Jamie ... oh [noise]\nI'm\nGlad that\nWe're talking to Dr James Lindsey author of life in light of death or he is or even follow him at consensual a conceptual James a on a on Twitter he is one of the ... if not the mastermind behind a the a\nPapers a lot of record that were were being written\nA for for a feminist studies and queer studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique but\nI'm not really critiqued in a way that most people would I'm just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we are going to discuss here it's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive stack\nJames tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it does not get accepted the journal was inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey did it says this is a sovereign act says it's a solid as say that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged few are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field\nTo be in a very privileged\nClassroom learning environment and\nThe problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign teams and they used to watch it with compassion\nThat re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and there's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being contracted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make a terrible scary idea properly evil\nAnd that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what already exist in a great deal of the a feminist than race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were a bit concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly paper they claim for example that we grew on too many concepts and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nAnd so on but um but the idea that that giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken\nOver interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\n... what what if this were published and they were real if this were published ... what what would that\nMean to the university system would would what does that mean\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm\nThere will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year so this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting\nClassrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working and social justice size field topics courses I guess that's the best way to to say that\nBut also probably into some of the general ed stuff\nWould take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but we'll just have to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to the gold standard journalist wasn't some fringe of journal and education this was the gold standard than is philosophy journal ... that we were working with here\nOf all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to ... all the ticks and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media is here as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't really remember you know you are an American I'm an American your person I'm a person\nWe have ... most of the things that we think\nIncome and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society in a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working out the details and I really hope that you know that our project kinda reaches reaches that point does that make sense\nIt totally does I I I Am I I hate to say that too I'm Out of time it could I invite you to come down and uh and do a pod cast with me you know we spend an hour and a half

completely uh you know individual scandals can change these things as well but the Republicans look like as of this moment there in really good shape to control the Senate\nAnd a really bad shape to continue their control of the house\nI mean look at the ... dream policies that the left is looking to push in through the Democratic party free health care [noise]\nSingle payer and I'm Sorry single payer health care free health care free college\nI'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for an even bigger a infrastructure package than what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero he was the only one who publicly supported now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten or ... democratic candidates which by the way will not be enough to contribute to cover the field there's going to be a lot more than ten I think\nUh but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and\nIt does endorse Medicare for all\nAll the big names are for it already there are many of them are co sponsors of the bill or it seems to be this\nI mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racists for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are ... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYeah we were scare mongers and racist for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stories will go through this tomorrow but\nI ... to ... um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college\n... no that is a fundamental um a a a fundamental aspect of what brought the states together in the first place\nThe state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything\nWell then ... what do\nWe have it can't be that way\nSo we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter\nIt will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore that pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the\nFounders thought about the idea of people being elected right I might have to do is just just appeal to the big cities and by the way this is a this is an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college I Know Trump supports that for example throwing um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but\nUh there is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe this is the right way to go which I mean you can get you just basically a country run by cities\nI mean as you know it'd be which have been that wants that like as a Republican is certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\n... says you should run themselves in the city is going to run whatever they want and the rural or you can do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make that although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them but I also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous right and it's ... by\nThe house and Senate both exist suit to give balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the audience out right\nAnd it you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could have raised the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThe way they got elected yeah it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things can be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed\nQuickly then the next the the first check on the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for wreck I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was under a bronco bottle is center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they would be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president and the president\nIs only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it was well you know that's the opposite opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional\nIt's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\n\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed\nOr you just arguing for king right with these several stories in a row the mic give you the argument for a king\nRight I mean okay really they failed or have we not been using them properly\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife and saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and slid lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed or no you're\nNot using it properly that's not what it was meant for and I would also argue the failure park right and you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented\nBut the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane absolutely insane\nAll right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland\nMayor who the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland or Portland but that's how I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry\nSo you know the ... the Portland mayor ah refused
