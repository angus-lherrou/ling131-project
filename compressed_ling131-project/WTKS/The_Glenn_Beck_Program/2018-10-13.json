talking about your homes Steve welcome\nAfter just fine\nMy name on\nYour feet on the right right and it's about the show they're I guess some crack it runs\nA mortar round [noise]\nOkay so this is running from the garage door to the utility door yeah OK in is this ... just along a mortar line or is it correct through the brick and at an angel to or what the border line just them orderly and how big is that correct 'cause they're mortar that's actually mounting\nCome over to the rich should do more [noise] more back right after about two years story or what [noise]\nWell ... you know ... his intentions were correct um I don't know about the execution of it so you know ... when a mortar out\nA is a you know that that's what you're going to have to do 'em that crack is fairly sizable fits quarter in ... there are certainly talking you can put in there Steve\nA but ideally he did it the right way choosing out that border grinding the mortar out and then putting mortar back in now having said that\nA couple things that would fail if it wasn't done properly first of all this year has been extremely hot and if he did it on a really hot day and he didn't really hydrate that joint\nAny put in mortar or the moisture would whip from the patching mortar\nOut of the patch and it wouldn't nearly be as strong as it should be in it would cause it to fail that's number one number two you also need to put some sort of a\nConcrete a mystery is he served in with a mortar patch a mortar doesn't stick while the mortar concrete doesn't stick well the concrete\nSo that I'm a that additive to it will help it bond um\nThere is a product called zip it mortar\nWhich is a patching material that already has the adhesives in it a huge ... without you hydrate the joint if it's a really hot in you do exactly what your buddy did\nI'm now having said that so those are things that can go wrong and execution the other thing is\nMaybe there's some movement there on that one pillar where that brick is it's weird that it would crack in that same joint usually if it's a settling problem\nThe crack is diagonal it would go through the brick and mortar it wouldn't run the mortar straight line it would stair step they go a little bit then they go up the uh uh the vertical joins then we'd go horse ... vertical and hors on I'm\nNot going at it it's pretty much enjoy\nAnd so there's probably a little bit of stress on there and maybe the patch wasn't done as well as it should of I you know I hate to have to follow them I I but but I don't know what else it could be\nUm [noise] I don't think it's any shuttling rich that is\nYeah I don't think it's settling either if it's a straight line there might be some stress on it but I don't think it's settling because it would definitely stair step if if it was settling\nMore\nIt's called zip it zip it and mortar comes in all three pound it looks like freezer beggars right it's all the products all all when they're ready just in water and you need the bag and you're ready to go\nTo different right All right good enough thanks take care Bye bye bye alright quick break and then back to your question here at home with Gary sell the\nLevel of
