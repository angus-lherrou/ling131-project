America and I fail on that all the time we all do\n\nBut what counts is the effort what counts is are you crying are you crying and are you better today than you were yesterday\nHave you found any answers or are you only shouting things down\nOr you just out in the street directing traffic\nBecause you feel it's your right well have you even look at what your rights mean where do your rights even come from today I saw think progress write a whole article about how the constitution has failed\nThat was the headline the constitution has failed and then it goes on to explain how it is really a slavery document\nAnd the three fifths in the constitution all lies all lives\nNow you can argue that\nOr we can begin to teach our children you can argue that\nAnd you can throw it back in their face with some sort of ... your\n\nName calling of some sort\n\nHere's the question that we all have to answer\nIs America a force for good or a force for bad that requires real thought and discussion\nBecause it is neither in my opinion it is both it has been a force for bad and I warn you\nIf we leave the bill of rights we will become the darkest force ever on earth with our technology we will make the Nazis look like rookies\nMake no mistake\nWe have been bad we have rounded up the Japanese we rounded up the Germans and the Italians we rounded up the blacks\nWe told people they couldn't vote including women\nBut we're also the people that freed the people\nWe ... the blacks and we fought for it we fought and died\n\nWe fought to free the Japanese\n\nWere brought to free the Germans and all of Europe and the world we fought to free Russia from the tyranny of communism\n\nAnd we failed in the time of peace\n\nOr are we good where\nAre we bad is the declaration of independence still a viable mission statement because that's all that is the declaration of independence is a mission statement period\nDo we still hold these truths to be self evident forget about the past let's talk about\nThe future we have never ever reached\nThe heights demanded by our mission statement\nBut have we gotten better is it still worth striving for we hold these truths to be self\nEvident that all men are created equal that means we're born equal we all have an equal\nChance don't judge somebody by the color of their skin but by the content of their character\nDo you have\nDo you have everything the baby laying next to you has when you were born\nAs far as human rights and dignity do you still believe that\nAnd I'm not talking about well or not the way I Am asking you as an aspirational mission statement that is the mission statement of our country\nDo you want to live in a country that's thrives and falls short but picks itself back up again\nDo you want to live in a country that says all men are created equal and they are endowed by their creator why would you have to throw got into it too I don't care what you put there\nIt just must be bigger than manned\nThe\nWhy the creator is important is if you don't have something bigger than man then man we'll print and take away rights\nSo if you want to see the moon the attorneys\nLook great cause most whatever\n\nBut he didn't doubts each of us with certain on changeable rights and those rights are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness now there's a lot more\nAnd that's where the bill of rights comes in do we still believe in this\nAs an aspirational statement we're only talking about the past we're talking about the mistakes of the past you cannot fix the mistakes of the past with out saying where\nWe're going so where are we going to fall you want to terrorists down there now I read your website I rejoin mission statement I strongly disagree\nCapitalism is not the problem capitalism that is that has no morals sentiment\nIs but you don't fix that by a state run economy by\nCo ops it's always fails no\nYou and your allies in the press refused to point out that that is exactly what you're looking for\nIt's a failed system this one has been this one has failed us because it has been usurped\nThe constitution no longer means anything the bill of rights no longer means anything why\nBecause it's not talk to anymore anybody who takes the oath of office in Washington Ninety percent of them are liars not even not even intentional liars\nThey don't know it they don't believe in it they will tell you they do as was told to me by a very powerful individual once looked Glenn we all believe in the constitution but you know you gotta do what you gotta do\nNo no\nYou do not to do what you have to do that the ends justify the means we either believing this or we do not and that is the question America do you believe\n\nNeutral half assed not sought out sitting on the sidelines\nAll of those answers I mean nothing in the end only those who know it who understand it who have done their homework who can intellectually defend it\n\nThose are the winter soldiers those will be the ones that restore freedom for all mankind\nEverything else is lip service a game and actually a tool in the hands of those who wish to create chaos and destroy all we have\nA ...\nThat monologue and so much more is actually the beginning of part three of my uh book addicted to outrage\nFinding our lunar ... what is our purpose anymore we're to talk about that with you and those who have read the book if you've read the book uh eight eight seven to seven be easy Kay All right our sponsor a this half hour\nIs who Marissa who's our sponsor today\nA blind spot calm I won't tell you

let me go to ah let me go to a Scotland in Nevada hello Scotland\nHello Glen\nI'm I just wanted to say that we can be outraged about anything so what we need to do is to turn that negative and positive actions like when President Kennedy challenged America is you get to the moon we need to turn or negative thoughts and chew the positive thoughts\nWell I don't think it's ever been easier do you I mean we're just ignoring all of the positives that are happening to us I mean you know what a moon shot OK you learn must go into Mars twenty twenty five\nI mean what's bigger than that it's just not a national project\nDo we do we need to wrap it up in national money to be able to get excited about the future because that's what that was all about the moon shot was all about doing things because we can\nDoing the hard things not the easy things I mean that that was just that was the whole goal and it did galvanized people\nThanks Scotland you know what people don't think about\nIs Nineteen sixty eight is when we went to the moon\nSame years Woodstock mhm\nWow yes we are weird yeah so you were either rolling around in the mud or you are reaching for the stars there were two Americas\nWell where is the America that is reaching for the stars where is that America that says no not gonna stop me I I I ah I saw post today that I that I had to answer a\nIn my Twitter feed let

my identity and I belong to it whether I'm aware of it or not and even if I'm not this is what I've known for and I'm kidding myself to think people actually think of me primarily as a writer and speaker rather than a fat\nPerson imagine living that way I ... I responded ah ah to that\nAs a growing member of the fat\nCommunity I find the real problem is when I look at myself in the mirror and I define myself by my body\nI Am more than my body you can define me any way you wish it's your loss what you say after I Am\nIs much more important than what others say about you so which are we going to be America because the choice is here and the choices so much more than Donald Trump or Kavanaugh heat is so much bigger than this\nWho are we\nAre we the people that role in the mud and are constantly looking down and ... basing ourselves\nOr we the people that look up\nAre we the people that look to the future\nAre we the people that say I am getting better every day\nI Am part of a positive community that is going to make a difference to ... million plan\nGet more on Sunday from ten to one I'm On news radio twelve Ninety and Ninety seven point seven W.

you're on the Glenn Beck program\nBy Glenn how are you good how are you\nDoing well so you know what can you you you mentioned earlier that are really that the opposition are the people leading this leadership but the Democrat Party\nOr or we'll have this right Nineteen eighty four was the inter party and out a party and what I see happening with my friends on the on the left his they're our party members they work every day and not involved in politics but they get sucked in on social media\nAnd being manipulated and it's a huge chunk of the American population being being a pulled up for the left agree and I want to hear your thoughts on that\nUh I think you're absolutely right and it's why we have to be a difference and unusual and ... year people I'm On uh the Internet because if they see if all they see our people on the right punching back the people on the left\nAnd both sides suck while they're they're going to stick with what they know if they are seeing their side being unreasonable violent you see anti FAA the way to answer and so far is not\nWith uh the militant people it will come out of the Nazis to come out and find them in the streets\nThat is the moment before we lose our humanity that is the moment that Martin Luther king walks through and just is peaceful and gentle and you don't strike back it works at this point but at this point is going to slip away quickly\nAs we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer a A R a Judeo Christian country\nWith those kinds of peaceful values you missed the moment and then it just becomes you know either communism socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group\nYou have to act while they're still is a Judeo Christian value and we're losing it quickly\nSo to get to the far left will never do that but get to the people like you're talking about you have to develop ways to be peaceful and not part of that angry crowd it's what I've talked about for Twenty years there's going to come a point where\nEverybody's going to be running in a certain direction and you're gonna have to have your credibility your kindness you're gonna have to be able to stand up and say no wait don't don't go that way you're not going to stop the whole crowd\nBut you'll be able to stop enough thanks Anthony will send you a

agree with every I bet you've said that we need to at least have a conversation about\n... because of it and I you\nKnow I think we need to be careful about even considering the I I think that there

you know we've run into this in the past and all the other\nTechnical right I'm not ... ... where\n... you know the ... they were afraid that technology what's going to come and direct place their ... their problem correct and so\nUm I understand that hey I is definitely coming and it's going to change things but it's not going to take over everything all the jobs you know in addition obviously to the people that want to create a machine thing if they are running\nYou know there are certain things I just can't they don't like I'm being a ... a leak in or climbing in her house probably not going to do that\nUm as far as service obviously I think McDonald's is a great example where am I yeah I don't think people are going to be upset if they go to McDonalds and not have to deal with anyone that chick fillet isn't known for their service and I ... that\nLet me ask you this let me ask you first of all just and I believe there's ... I don't mean any offense or anything I just want to know um how up to speed you are on this um ... or ... what books are you reading on a a high ... or you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general if I could not than they work unless I'm so I'm coming just for you know different perspectives are having done that research that I Know that you have sure on that but\nYou know just my feeling like a a I is going to absolutely be able to diagnose cancer um quicker and more accurately than a doctor\nBut are you going to want to sit in front of a robot and have a robot tell you that you have cancer and cleaner options\nCase so Heather are there there is a very and I can't remember the name of it on the ... on this particular subject but I Will look for it uh there is a whole\nBook based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in someone and being able to reflected in face the reason why\nI'm a that that we don't connect with robots is because they cannot see our emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection um it's going to take a while but it while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world ah and I think that's a long while\nI'm so there there are those uh those ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment that no one has to work\nThat everyone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made yes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that true a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to\nGo through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died\nThey'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message much better and much more personal than anyone else\nThe bigger problem is on a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about three four years ago [noise] the uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board\nAnd what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that has seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it's it's I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please\nSo you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen before\nAnd we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty and the world will not be like it is today you started your comment about the section of the book where I or there's a chapter where I talk about ... universal basic income\nI Am against universal basic income I Do not think that that is the way we should go\nBut we as conservatives must be willing to listen to the debate and I'm not talking about the people who are socialist in Washington I'm Talking about the people who are studying\nOr the culture studying humans and studying technology to gather that are now looking for what is it that will give people value what is it when we do hits high unemployment if your goal is one hundred

there were many more opinions and voices brought into our conversation listened to the following exchange between two mothers Anna progressive and Mona a Christian conservative\nAnd see how many people's opinions and perspectives are brought into the mix other than their own\nOn my side what I hear and\nOh you don't infringe on any of my right and I don't want any restrictions on myself and it's kind of and I'm not going to cut you off but I think that's kind of debate at Penn and play\nReasonable ideas we can come up with that I'm going to inconvenienced\nBy and you're right there are
