Fox News radio covers the world on news radio seven point seven and\n[noise]\nThis is a Fox News alerts an eleven packages turned up this one in Florida I'm Dave Anthony and it was also\nSent to a Democrat Senator Cory Booker intercepted again in Florida looking similar to the other ones that bomb like devices inside the envelope stand Fox News has learned as another suspicious package of being looked at it a post office in New York City\nAre false but also the media has been under attack by the White House for very long time it's not an issue with just the\nCurrent administration and stop making it one President Obama was historically a nightmare for the free press and you refuse to\nSay anything about it the crazy thing is today the craziest thing is is that\nThe media gleefully gave Obama a pass even though he was ... the FBI and the de OJ against the press\nDonald Trump has gone so far as just calling them fake news and they got their feelings hurt forget about the oh I don't know threatening to throw us all in jail\nThis president is calling us fake\nNews yeah well he kind of has a point just if you even look at how President Obama treated the press compared to you know President Obama was putting new people in jail he was what\n... the government against you and you failed to stand up and say anything\nOh\nAs a media was gearing up for its outrage over being called fake the New York times was publishing an article\nOn the very same day these pipe bomb packages were delivered now I Want you to remember this is watching it just just put this in your pipe\nAnd smoke it for a little bit\n\nThere being called fake news they're being called liars they're saying\nNo no no no we're not we don't publish fake news we don't have anything against the president it's not a vendetta\nAnd while this is happening the New York times is printing ... an article titled five novelist imagine Trump's next chapter\nFive novel lists imagined Trump's next chapter\nThe main image at the top of this story shows the White House on fire and thinking into the ground as President Trump waves goodbye each novelists had one assignment\nRight out what you think happens after the bowler investigation is completed okay [laughter] so let's come up let's go to fiction writers and come up with what they think is going to happen with Mueller's investigation and what's gonna happen\nAfter Andy you mock me you mock me\nRe single one that's going to come as a surprise and they found five fiction writers are going to do it but every single one wrote a short story depicting a scenario where the president was found guilty\nEvery single one isn't that amazing they couldn't find one in fiction writer to write something where Trump was not\nGuilty it's crazy\nOne story had Trump's signing the twenty Fifth Amendment a and another even had him being assassinated by a Russian agent with the help of Secret Service\nYeah well\nWe can write about the president being assassinated were advocating violence I don't know what ... what are you are you kidding me know that it was about the Russians that wasn't about a coup yes yes okay Secret Service was involved but that's not about a cool\nThis is the New York times\nYou know the ones who are leading the way saying oh my gosh the talk of violence is so horrible [laughter] oh my gosh and we don't print fake news you're supposed to be investigators you're supposed to be neutral\nI thought that was the idea let's be neutral\nNow I understand that everybody has an opinion but five for writers and no one can come up with anything other than the guy is guilty and maybe he's got to be killed by the secret service\nThis is unbelievable\nHow is it that two hundred journalists can sign a letter claiming that everything is the president's fault when the flagship of the American media is writing this bull crap while the pipe bombs are coming in\nThis this time space exhibit a\nFor why journalism is currently dead in America it is dead in America all of you dancing on the grave of Megan Kelly really what was her was her big thin she asked a question that\nOh my gosh lock her in a tower\nOh my gosh she's got to be chased out of the public so you can ask a question don't you dare ask a question\nThis is frightening America fact\nFinding is gone the media has already made up their mind they know the answer and if you disagree they will\nChase you out of the public square they have no inclination to actually at even attempt to find the truth even attempt to understand\n\nYes there is a little righteous indignation and me it's not an anger is it is righteous indignation\nBecause I have called these people I have talked to these people I have gone\nTo them over and over again we've had in hand and said listen you need to understand\nHow half the country feels\nJust have a conversation you're making a huge error and yes I made all these airs oh my gosh I'm the worst person in the world I'm with you just listen to me please you have to hear what half the country is\nSaying they won't do it they're not interested they don't care and now they're quite literally making it up what's the difference between a novelist and the New York times journalist I don't know\nMedia\n[noise] this is a radical concept and I know you like radicals you love radicals\nYou you feel like there's nothing wrong with being radical mob yeah those are those are just people that feel passionately so I Know you love radicals\nBy here's a radical idea if you don't want to be called fake you might want to just start with literally stopping publishing fiction\n[laughter]\n... ... ... ... backer program [noise]\nSelf awareness seems to be dead at this person in the media in particular Glen or maybe this one what is the one thing that if you're conservative Trump makes the ACA criticisms of the media they say\nHey as fake news hey these guys are lying hey they're the enemy of the people and they say that famous violence\nLike you're you're you're you're creating ... coming after us right now I Can't go there yet they can't I Can't I got to take a break I Can't go there yet\nA cat I Know where you're going and\nBoy does it need to be said I Can't do it yet had\nA cab you needed to the news I just crank that was that we are now he thinks that's it again I'd been telling you for years to get to your alcohol if we can reignite that it's going to be a good ratings\nMost time can I tell you something the blackouts I Need the blackout right now I Need them so desperate alright it would be so great I forgot about everything that they said that was so stupid yesterday [laughter] I don't even recall it at all I Love that idea I Need\nTo take a break first let me tell you about car shield car shield is uh is is going to save you from a lot of trouble they're going to save you from taking your car in and\nYou've got something wrong with it or even an oil change and then it comes out and they're like her going to have some bad news for you know we found some extra stuff and it's going to cost and you're like what\nLook these are surprises that nobody wants and everybody gets but if you have car shield you don't have to worry about it\nIf your car breaks down after the warranty expires you could be out of pocket for thousands of dollars just to get it fixed but if you have car shield\nChances are you're not gonna have to come out of pocket for anything\nThat if you if you want to take your car into your favorite mechanic or the dealership usually people go to the dealership\nOr I mean what lately to put it this way why do you avoid the dealership after your warranty expires you avoid it because you can maybe get it done cheaper a by your favorite mechanic and maybe he's not using you know the same parts or whatever you'd have a fix by the dealership near warranty expires if you have ... no problem\nBecause they pay for it they pay them not you so you don't have to go and write a check and be out of pocket they do it car shield save yourself thousands of dollars in car repairs and the future 'cause it's going to happen happens to all of us\nUh some bomb technicians who studied photos of the device that circulated on social media suggested the bomb sent to CNN had the hallmarks of fake explosives kind more typically depicted on television and movies rather than devices capable of detonating almost like a Wylie coyote kind of\nBomb almost a digital clock was taped to the middle of the ... of feature that experts say it's typically shown on fictional\nBombs in an attempt to ratchet up dramatic tension but on the theory in real life I'm\n... in fact the fact they go on the New York times in fact bomb makers generally avoid attaching visible clock their devices really\nCheap from tipping off they're targeting no about when the bombs are said to explain it was just a like a nice little clock they were sending to these people for their death [laughter] that's what I thought oh look at that and you're like that's not a bomb here's here's a bonus if you survive\nIt that I got an alarm you don't want one hundred percent survive ability so far on these bombs\nOne hundred percent survive ability\nWe're it is weird outlook it could it be a I think here's a plausible scenario that someone on the right did this okay someone on the right who really does not like all these figures decided that they wanted to send a message to all these figures but aren't actually or murder they wanted to scare the hell out of\nThem but they didn't actually want to kill they want to let a poor you want to know what you could be due into this country let let me show yet and they're crazy they were wrong wholly horror despicable and everyone they weren't murderers and so they built this to look like bomb\nIf you look on I mean you get this example of it on social media all the time I mean if we counted all of the death threats and horrible things that you get on social media as real all the time\nYou'd have to have a staff of salads and checking them all out and instead you know most of the time people say crap on social media that goes way too far and that they're actually intend to do they don't intend on a you know you always have to happen to for example Dana lashed right like has to take all those things seriously when she was on TV\nUh she got all sorts of threats on her family and they did take them seriously but like\nAs far as I Know at least no one actually acted on those things thank God right so you have these serious threat that come into public figures often and and sometimes they don't wind up panning out most of the time right even ego to look at terrorists\nI mean the the amount of ... people in the middle east who say that they would uh execute a terrorist attack\nOn on people who are on you know people from another country for example you and I neither state it is so high it's incredibly disturbing you almost would never walk outside if you realize how many millions of people will tell pollsters that yes I Would kill American citizens\nHowever obviously they're not doing it right whether it's because they're not capable of doing it or whether they're a in reality they just want to send a message or they really don't like them but I'm not going to go kill someone whatever the reason is and that could be the situation here\nCould be the same thing from a someone on the left\nWho wants to make the right look bad a week before the election uh sending me things around with no intention of killing anyone but wants to make a ... big media circus you things are all plausible possibilities we have no relatives and know that other than the fact that these were all political figures and none of the bottom seem to work and they're really all that's all the information we have right now\nWell but I Know that's that's pretty much all the information they had on the race dog fire and um I don't know about you but I think the Germans behaved admirably I think the Germans did exactly how to do with you on that one no\nBut isn't the rice dog then communist did then right Graham\nRush is next it new and now more banging on news radio twelve Ninety and Ninety seven points that have a double duty chaos\nFox News I'm Chris foster the FBI and local police have been

imprisoned yet I don't think so and she needs to be she dangerous\nWell she has you know she is violated something that NBC feels ...\n... about to do well he started to they didn't feel that passionately about it when Jimmy Fallon dressed up in blackface as Chris Rock wait what he dressed up and imitated Chris Rock and yeah but I'm from what network though I'm well over there\nThat was on NBC always end and the NBC that end up paying network ... worked for ... dress up and blackmail no no it it might be okay for Halloween the if you are not making fun of someone\nRight so he wasn't making fun\nWhile he was he was kind of making fun of course he was he was ... a ... you know it's even more agree just than that though and it's it's ... it's despicable that we have to play this game and it's okay for all of them uh the Jimmy Kimmel thing with good oh ha imitating\nCarl Malone do we have that audio yet Sarah my gosh I Am not one has agreed oh we haven't even haven't listened to this is Jimmy Kimmel in blackface [noise]\nSometime and night home alone look up and sky of heroin on welfare reform live on another planet\nPhoning home like wow home loan rate on TV about white people getting out to buy our way of thinking all on a halo effect on family\nHome alone ever seen a flying saucer his cell phone if you do ... spoke at times\nAlmost say say I mean ...\n... hanging out that's Jimmy Kimmel it's unbelievable unbelievable we talked about you imagine even even talking that way no without blackface just talking that way it would be our last day\n... you know I was talking to a of a couple of different examples of blackface are being used in comedy fairly recently like sending in Philadelphia was one of the examples we brought up and it's an insult was sending in Philadelphia they did it and they did it as for a minute they're making a point right like that only be more on ... characters on this show would think that that's an appropriate\nThing mhm this gimme came up with is just saying hey I'm black and I'm Carl Malone it just him mocking a black person yeah a mind the way he ... and the only thing that speak\nThe only thing that's funny about that is the way he speaks yeah yeah that's it mhm I mean play that again tell me the joke in here other than the way he's speaking what was it the Ebonics isn't that what they call them in person it's the only other I think he's doing right now listen to this\nI mean the joke do sometime and night home alone low carbon sky and say what the hell's going on out there for another planet\nPhoning home like in the home loan rate on TV about why people getting the violin taken all kind of hello Sam soccer down\nI mean they're not a single joke you know he wanted to sing retiring as Karl Malone always did no not always but often did referring to himself in third person and it's a random topic of the only other part of that ... yeah and even black face right like that you don't believe that they get\nCut again at the end the Jimmy Fallon work has Jimmy Fallon has not a political enemies and Kimmel has put himself in as a political commentator so it's really agree just for him but Fallon who is I think there's no ill intent by Jimmy Fallon doing that but he's friends with Chris Rock writing\nBut the issue here is it on the freaking NBC yeah\nYou can hear it is a wire legally for mentioning it but you know let Jimmy you're going to give Jimmy found the top but place in your network so what\nShe said was weight but if you are if you are holding somebody up if you're if you're making fun of them okay but if you're holding somebody up like this woman who you know with\nDiana Ross she liked Diana Ross you unlike Diana Ross for the night and she's not making fun of and she's not making fun of Diana Ross\nWell isn't that what Fallon did actually didn't ask the question teaches ... yeah\nThe first amendment\nOn member of the press is being silenced by you\nFor asking a question now you may not or you may not have agreed\nWith this question because I can see how corrosive how dangerous how awful that question really was but God help you when you ask\nA question that

seventies one or two of those storms may become a little strong too they\nKeep their severe weather alerts turned on and the WTO see but the rap I'm first alert meteorologists cutter Martin double duty chaos so bad\nAnd the high hard station now Fox News radio covers the world\nNews radio that seven points out that she had a lot [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is a Fox News alert it's up to a dozen suspicious packages now I'm Dave Anthony to more intercepted this morning one sent to a democratic senator the other and ex Obama intel official turn Trump critic Fox's Rachel Sutherland does more life from Washington\nA it was started by what's his fat face loud mouth guy what's his name to do a no no no uh Alex Jones sixty five percent [noise]\nWhatever it is a you know and I and I talked to Bush about this on TV and extensively and he basically said factor that's my strategy I'm not changing it okay so that's number one so Donald Trump could have done that easy\nBut he chose the fight back trumped it and he said I'm not going to let these people marginalized me 'cause it'll never end and the American people uh see me as a fighter\nThey see me as a person who strikes back one attack so while I'm going to do that so then you have to say okay well who started the fracas who started this\nAnd you can make a case that Trump's bombastic a tax on his rivals in the in the primary process um started it you can make a case for that\nHow how he's he's assuming people names yeah he's a symptom the American people have never been this way we've never been this way no no no is it to them on your feeling be ... and ... to death\nBy being called racist and homophobia and everything else came later\nIt when it was apparent that Trump was a player and could win see what people don't understand is that in the beginning the press didn't think that Donald Trump could do anything you want to have a chance he was he was like\nEntertainment All right let's bring out the dancing bear\nThat's how the press saw him but then when he started to win the whole strategy changed and it I I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does okay so then it was destroy him\nDestroy ... that that would be orders that came down from the editors of the New York times not in those words but it was very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post CNN MSNBC\nAnd like Facebook I mean they're on their ... their on video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered how does Trump\nCounter what does he do he doesn't it surrogates I mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it so he does it in a very blunt\nAnd sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what is his choice\nWhat if he doesn't do it they are going to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah and the liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that but he has a growing I Believe growing number of people supporting him\nAnd the reason he has it been is because it gives them no quarter yes he fights back\nBut now they're turning it around saying well your your fight back like Kavanaugh Kavanaugh fought back oh he's out of control oh that's not a if not fight back shows he doesn't have the temperament oh come on you're you're being destroyed by these people you're not allowed to show emotion\nIt's the same thing so now with the bomb thing oh Trump did it where where CNN were not responsible for any of it or not us\nI'm hoping that the vast majority of the American people understand what's happening I think they do because CNN's ratings are so terrible no matter what they do no matter how they ratchet it\nStill very very few people watch that so I'm hoping they get it\nWell they're not going to um so so bill uh\nHow much trouble or are they in I mean the New York times literally paragraph thirty five\nIn the New York times talks about how this doesn't look like these bombs were made by somebody who wanted to actually kill anybody this was just a statement of some sort of what happened that from the job of course they're cartoon bombs they are leaving it it\nDoesn't ... this is a the gang that couldn't shoot straight or gay or straight this ... this was a\nPress we're going to do this to get it into the press because we know the media will go hysterical\nCorrect and it could be somebody who was on the right and didn't want to kill anybody but wanted to make a statement and they're crazy could be somebody on the left who wanted to do the same thing could be somebody who is just a really\nUnbelievably worse the bomb maker known to man which I highly doubt it could very well be somebody who thought you know what we're going to send these to the press were to send these to all of the all of the enemies of the right obviously sway an election\nObviously crowd contrived to get media attention to influence them in terms of putting my money on putting\nYou [laughter] [laughter]\nHow do how does the uh media respond when it turns out that ah it's it's either a prank with no political motive or it was politically motivated or by the left\nWell that would be an amazing story when that was why I'm hoping the FBI can you know flashes up pretty quickly\n... how would depress handle what I think that they would um look you have to understand it every morning out of the Washington DC think tanks progression think tanks and stuff\nTo Anderson Cooper and and Rachel Maddow and these people they get stuff\nSo that they'll they'll sit down and all K now how are we going to spin this may be the person sending it was insane or you know that kinda thing they'll never

this was a benevolent mad so I Believe that these kinds of people I Can't prove it because there's no accountability and Honduras but I Believe they're behind a big ... big money behind as everybody knows\nA bill I and I invite you to read what even the president of ... saying\nI'm this is this is backed by a cube of ah Venezuela a and ousted president of Honduras\nAre that are blaming the United states for all of the unrest ah the former president says that ah America's gonna have to pay for all of this or they'll have to accept our citizens\nThis is just an ongoing internal battle a in Honduras that has quite honestly lied to many of their people um and said that America's gonna have to take you and they're going to because they're responsible for this mess\nThis is a Marxist a revolutionary\nUh that uh has tried to take Honduras by force the Supreme Court two branches of their government found what he was doing to be unconstitutional and kicked him out and he's been causing problems ever since and now\nHe Venezuela in Cuba are together and what was formerly known is all about but they are tests that the United states and they're the ones financing at least the beginning of it\nThat's how it started now ... others may be involved but I haven't seen any evidence of that yet but I Would not put it past them\nRight and and it would be interesting to see if there is a pipeline of cash going into ... so this is what I say I'm skeptical of everything and I agree with you there has been no hard evidence put forth of George Soros or people like him did this but if you know it's it's\nOne of history's things they've done in the past yes but the\nThe government of Honduras should be able to trace ... foreign money coming into that country back they should be able to show people this is what has arrived here\nSo I Hope they do that if they if they believe Cuba and Venezuela actively involved in subverting their own country on doors and then by extension hurting the usa they have the ability to find that out\nThere or to let's go there are two other groups that are being formed now are two other waves that are supposedly following this one uh and I would love

radio covers the world\nOn news radio that seven point seven eleven o'clock [noise]\nThis is a\nFox News alert to more suspicious packages of turned up in the mail this morning I'm Dave Anthony one was intercepted in Florida address the Democratic senator Cory Booker the other was sent the former director of national intelligence turned a Trump critic James Clapper found that a post office in New York City\n\nI remember a story are being told by an instructor in the military being told of convoy that was ambushed after having a Humvee take a hit from an IUD\nHe was treated um he was a treated or in the wounded man and needed to carry one of the soldiers off to another Humvee to be met in fact out one of the soldiers had his arm severed just below the elbow when he was in shock\nHe handed the soldiers his own arm after applying a tourniquet and told the soldier he needed to follow him as he got another soldier out that he was unable to walk the man looked at his own sever an army and his hand and repeatedly told the medic that\nThat helped him that his arm was fine and this was in his arm sometimes we just don't know how to deal with things\nFor two solid weeks I lied to myself and my daughter was fine and this didn't happen didn't happen to her it didn't happen to us and I broke down in tears finally able to process what had the fall and my now seven year old daughter\nMy wife forgave me for spending those two weeks it wasn't until months after\n\nThat we would figure out who had done this terrible thing all I wanted to do after she told me about this\nWas fined\nSo that the sky and cut off the offending appendages\n\nAs it turned out it was a twelve year old boy he was in my Sunday school class for ten months\n\nI had been teaching this boy in Sunday school\n\n... hated and wanted to have this young man I wanted to ruined his life before it even began\n\nI wanted to let you know that in the height of my hatred I downloaded your book addicted to outrage on audible\n\nWho's the last couple of chapters that I heard you speak that I I realize that my outrage was justified but it was also toxic and it would become a force to be used to destroy me\nI needed to forgive this boy because we are required to forgive all men\nI forgave him in my heart\nAnd as I did I felt the burden of my outrage and my anger lifted yes the pain of what happens still lingers and the reality of the situation is still very real but my outlook in my spirit or no longer held hostage by my hate\n\nI just wanted to thank you for writing this book it literally helped me pick myself out of darkness so deep that I thought there was no way out\n\nI wanted to let you know that your work has helped save at least\nOne guy Christian\n\nChristian as a hum\n\nAs a man who has gone through a similar situation recently with one of my children\nAnd I thank God we caught it before anything happened I understand I understand\n\nWe knew the address of the man who um did this to my son\n\nAnd I think if it would have happened and I wasn't home my wife may have killed him\n\n\nI think about it all the time to think about my children all the time and\nYour email has reminded me\n\nThat it's not just me or I haven't talked to my wife about it\n\nFor the last few months and I know how much it still bothers me\nHow we're responsible I had been to not realize\nShe is probably dealing with it as well\nThere are things that we don't want to think about\nThat are truly frightening and I think when we look at our country when we look and we really realize\nWhat we really stand to lose it's not our job is not our money it's the unsinkable\nIt's something that doesn't happen to us that happens to other countries but it doesn't happen to us\n\nAnd it's so scares us that we avoided and we talk about other things\n\nBut that's just as dangerous as the outrage and justice talks toxic\n\nIf you said there was somebody if you said to everybody you met and the next two weeks you know you look like you could use some cheering up I think you'd be right about eighty or Ninety percent of the time\n\nAcross all income levels across all colors and boundaries\n\nWe're all struggling with something and we all have something big to forgive that man we don't want to\n\nBut the reality is we need each other\n\nMy kids hated the fact that I talked about in difference when they were growing up that endurance was one of the virtues that you had to have or you're not going to make it you have to endure endure life is endurance\nLife is about the long run not the short run\nEndure it to the end they hated that that you're always so pessimistic no I'm not I'm telling you\nThat there's a lot in life so you're going to have to endure that you're going to hate life is not what do you think it is when you're a kid it's just not it's harder than that but it's so worth it\n\nBut we need to be like a cross country team\n\nFor going to survive this we don't cheer the person who came across first we cheer the person who came across the finish line the last as well\n\nBecause we're all different runners we all have different things going on and it is truly about beating your last time doing just slightly better than you did last time\nBeing slightly better than you were yesterday\nAnd if we can help each other and cheer each other on\nWith that will make it and it gets harder and harder every day\nAlso know from postal workers that the package looked exactly like it resembled those packages that we have seen throughout the week the manila envelope this six excessive postage stamps with the American flag on them the block\nLettering President Trump just read the complain about the bombing coverage overshadowing news of Republicans doing
