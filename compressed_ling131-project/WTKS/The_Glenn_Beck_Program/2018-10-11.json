politics and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump can be about kneeling the national\nAnthem that can be about something that a celebrity status and an amplified and sort of turned up to eleven so that people get really heated about it Star Wars is in that category too and there might be some evidence to show that this is actually happening every day\nGives me the evidence this is incredible\nYeah so it's it's circumstantial in many ways but that's by nature of what we're dealing with here when you're talking about foreign influence and particularly malicious activity coming from the Russian ... or ... or ... pop it accounts\nYou were talking about a a moving target people who are deleting their accounts changing their information making new accounts staying active so that they can't actually be tracks to end given location\nAnd if Morton ... researcher at USC could prove definitively that these are Russian agents than he should be working at the CIA but he's not he's just a

what words do they use and then as their account there the next week when you looked him up again\nThese are sort of things that you look for when you're talking about foreign influence\nOn line and it might be Russians that might be the Chinese it might be Iranians or it might be some Floridian with a bone to pick with the rest of the country\nBut that so what did they land they live in what did they plant into our society\nWell in this case what they planted 'em there was evidence that there were sixteen accounts acted specifically being Russian linked a hundred and five that sort of had a question mark\nAs to where they could be originating from that are jumping on line in the last Jedi comes out and people are starting to debate about the movie and then they start throwing in the ... about the ... not the admiral admiral hold though and then they start throwing in tweets about how\nA masculinity is under assault because ... and was unable to lead the ship\nAnd then they started rolling and tweets about as jade W droid than the fact that there was a droid in the\n... remember those\nYeah and and so and but the important thing is that that comes from real people too and you can't really distinguish what comes first like chicken or the egg did the did the Russian you know ... or troll on line plant the thought in a conservative or you know activist or Star Wars fan on line and then they sort of echo it\nOr did it go the other way around um because it is reasonable to look at Star Wars and see some sort of like you know progressive fingers in the pot but there's also this discourse on line that happens where you sort of amplify\nAging exercise and everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you

slugging it they're just as an ex smoker because they're they tend to pick the right says in the late sixties ... as you all for their top shack day or\nA ... and and they can and it helps because and they have to get that or an old singing at the same time at the same message that they ... they would disillusioned with luck\nAnd disillusioned with religion and institutions and they they thought that they can access the big comfortable understanding that ... that had food and the top ... comments\nOff that well was that the full of empire oh they said is that these were crumbling and and there's a shift in society to try to understand all of the things that we saw with Tre\nTrace the pace nothing is it safe to a nice ... and he said\nThe reality is not something we find it something that we make and make it in the status of power so it is powerful great\nWhich had decided for us what his trade and they understood to be a white heterosexual which now and they should they should be um pick that\nLondon is when they think it has taken a and a cook out they said\nThat they want to say that they ... they wanted it sort of the ... show problems with it it wasn't until the late eighties early nineties when I lost of and\nTennis and critical they fit with cliff fix that just said well taking everything is all good and well the construct pay to see that every day actually constructed but we had some kind of reality if wake up and like I said we cannot face on poll address\nAnd when we agree that women are in that state says is that the kinds of\nA change to bring back some kind of a reality and that was of age and power\nThat it then they add a life jacket late from the aspect of experience with the assumption that we're looking at a power imbalance in any interaction between great\nOkay so let me let me let me go back and because I think\nPeople might be thinking why are we talking about post modernism how does it relate to my life\nThis I Believe is critical in it too if you don't understand this or at least have a basic handle on it you don't know what you're fighting you don't know what's really happening you don't know who's behind a lot of his or what the theories are behind it\nUm so let me let me first say post modernism the modern world is the world that\nWas created that chased out the dark ages it was the it to the world created by the enlightenment of of science and reason them period the empirical evidence or and and even I mean the ... when you hear people say mathematics is racist\nThis is because we're there trying to deconstruct anything that holds the modern world together is that correct\nYes that they they think that there has been constructed on that a lot of voices has been left out and\nThis relates somehow to look at it is I I think they have the problem with the idea that than irrational and I'm ... I'm known ages is that the public have windows or rent\nAt white people\nYeah that that is that is how it works\nOK I'm going to take you um ... before we move forward or I Want to take you back one more a step I'm a I'm going to take a break and then we come back ... I'm like you to help me on this because\nIt's my understanding that uh they're done fur coat or came over to the United states that this was really kind of shaped in frustration from the Nineteen sixty eight Paris the riots\nAnd in frustration that they're not going to be able to take this whole thing down unless they take it all down they got to take all the system's down they're not going to win through culture\nUm and that it was that it was actually much more strategic in its I'm planting above virus if you will and I'd love to hear your take on that if that's true or not when we come back we're with Helen ... [noise]\nAnd we also have to ask her about [noise]\nThe greatest praying ever a they her and to other scientists went\nAnd uh they spend a year just writing\nFeel this way you know with political correctness or you know I go back to the handy capable\nYou know nobody wanted to see if that really hurt somebody's feelings that that\nYou know nobody wants to do that are very few people want to do that you know it it does kind of say well the next generation is going to justice suit you know just going to attach the same meanings behind Andy capable is handicapped but you know so it's a little worthless over a long period of time\nBut I don't think anybody I think generally speaking people are fair what this has turned into is a oppression\n[noise] yes I mean I I think that's something that we have to hold onto it because when we accept that everybody is generally kind of the fact is cut Gemini kind to be good\nThat they're good for that scientists and they actually care that they felt like human beings then yes we have this situation might have to judge yet I still very much in line with\nLoving suppose and all of the ... right and we have to understand that a lot of people who have taken on any ten life a lot of the last night there is\nA size at trying to do good and trying to be sad that what we have to look at is how this is ... impact is that we are seeing\nA rising and Terry and is that is play and that type of having them from the from the activity\nGoing on these ideas which has come out this as the series I Believe\nThat the eighth floor of the population that it is more than\nThey kind of analyze it because the idea of the idea that that will mean April and they should have the same like everybody else is on the line and\nThey said the good luck to ... to\n... how bad can they say if they had the thing is I think they pay me I've actually paying for it is\nTaking us away from that we made in that so they both and I felt like ... and an equal pay for the women that they can write they should if I got to the extent that it it's really\nSomething quite different [noise]\nSo I I I Want to continue our conversation I'm On this and the and the notion that beer beer it's a race to the bottom you with the inner sexuality you are\nYou're flipping the pyramid just upside down but it is still a pyramid um where the the one who has a the most\nUh you know points in I guess in their favor of I've been abused with this this and this and buy these groups in this group and this group that they become the power um it it sounds like it's it's just not just the construction is constructing something that is the authoritarian in nature\nUh and I want to go there and I also need\nTo find out a little bit about the hoaxes\nThat Helen and to other scientists did who were just they were looking at these peer reviewed publications and saying\nThey don't even make sense I think I could write something that was genuine nonsense and get it published ... they had seven published in a year\nThese news radio Ninety seven points and an end twelve ... am W.

know it's part of our tradition but we shouldn't be paying for it\nUm and the multiculturalism that has made it a racist to even say yeah I'm proud to be be\nEnglish or I'm proud to be American I think that is being taken as racist where I don't think it's meant as racist by the vast majority of people they're just proud of who they are and where they came from\nWell I I I certainly agree with that I I don't see the problem as as multiculturalism\nItself I and I'm In London and then and we generally do quite well we're faced with that yeah the the different ... that a great range is a

bullish I'm lucky that the Dow is down down to twenty five thousand four hundred it was up you know well over twelve hundred flights I rode on that a week ago\nUh I like to buy these steps but um you know you look at the fundamentals of the U.S economy with the tax cuts the deregulation is that high employment I'm Still I'm Still really high on the U.S economy I'm Still I on the stock market especially at these low low prices right\nNow so what happened yesterday what what what's the scoop did\nWork good question where I'll scratch your head wondering what it was I mean Donald Trump seems to think it was the fat and there's no question that the fed interest rate hike a and their announcement that they're going to continue to raise interest rates certainly move people out of stocks and bonds because when interest rates rise than bonds are more attractive\nRelatively than stocks I'm usually those facts of of ah\nFat changes are short term so\nI don't I don't think you're going to see a long term effect from that although I tend to\nAgree with Donald Trump that here we've got this blooming economy we dollar shave real science of inflation although energy prices are rising but you know other commodities are are pretty stable or or actually falling price so I don't see a big inflation gain and ... I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth to this is\nThe fed and and uh John John Powell why take in a punch bowl away from this already just when it's getting boring and I tend to I tend to think that he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but just as good as the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that\nThat job is to squash shows a stock market rally and pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm an inflation watcher and uh and hyperinflation of leave lesion watcher guy I was I was really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and and the tax breaks and we haven't seen it\nWe're showing inflation I mean look I Would I ... I have to\nAdmit you know I I admit when I'm wrong I'm a I'm a conservative and that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but I did predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we are international trade we have um [noise]\nYou know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and trade and technology are two things that really keep prices down and affordable and so I ... my only point is I just take the fat act preemptively prematurely and raising rates\nIn in a in a way that wasn't that search I Am a little concerned by the way to go on about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like\nEquivalent of four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why hasn't gone up like a tax on the economy why is it going up\n\nThere to see when are you there yeah maybe I didn't hear what you just like okay why I'm a why did why is oil going up\nA good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the I'm In the middle east with respect to Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off as a result I mean a big rise in the price because people are really concerned about the uh\nYou know about the price of the global reduction in supply as a result\nOf tax that back on line bring Texans Becca bring Texas back on line well that's\nThe point you know I look I think oil prices are going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it when I mean I don't know where you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and ...\nOh it's it's a anywhere you can stick stick in the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next year or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again so [laughter] you know I think that the the big problem right now it's just here you know this\nThe stock market is driven by fear and greed [laughter] that's a true except for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and and by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred I said to my wife funny let's let's take some of these profits and and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me let me ask you this I don't know if this is true or this is an old wives' tale but the last president that I heard really take on the fed [laughter] was Ronald Reagan and we had Nineteen percent interest rates right certainly after that until\nYou stop talking about the fed when her\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lotta people say it's it's it's a a you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week I don't know why the\nPresident is the chief executive officer of the country right he is the one who was supposed to help manage our economy if he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't they speak out\nI'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fat correct I I think there's a lot of ... one of the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years that these are not some kind of or a falls on high at the fed\nThey act as if there was a temple with all of the knowledge and all of the intelligence but they've made so many mistakes\nYou mentioned I remember the seventies as you do when we had\nLiterally twenty percent mortgage interest rates that was all because the fed mistake and ah you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know what's the one that built up this bubble that led to the housing crisis in two thousand seven and they all yeah I keep thinking these people are somehow like jobs like\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know let me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement\nUh and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with China I I fear that Donald Trump really likes the trade wars are and we're not\nThat this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is you know great but do you think is it\nStephen [noise] that's what he really fundamentally believes that ... are good\n[laughter] here's my view and I've talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at his Rose Garden ceremony last week when he announced the new trade agreement and he basically said look I Will um I Will I'm I Am using these tariffs as a\nTool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I never trade strategy but I gotta say so far you know the\nThe kind of a top elliptical view has not happened Trump is getting some good deals you got to deal with Mexico we play candidate like a federal here where he basically said you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on the night before the\nThe deal will have to be seal candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe and then that leads to Canada I mean to China and\nThis is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with I don't know you and I haven't talked about this one but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheating\nStealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an actual property they're building up their military they're like you know the old Soviet Union in terms of a lot of the tactics they're using that's all I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nAh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction or when it comes to China then I'll let\nMe challenge you on that one or a you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way chop looks at it and I think he's right about this like if we can't trade with China we'd sneak\nIf they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia\nAnd I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't they were ... their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets mean damn near everything you buy and Walmart is made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that card and saying look we're not gonna give you unfettered access to our markets if you're not going to\nPlay by the rules I talked to company CEOs all the time if I Know basically say it's almost impossible to penetrate the China market and you got to give up ownership of your company has to give up your trade secrets ... I mean we can't live with that is right I'd write when he says look I had a stroke this trade deal this trade war they started at ten years ago\nI Would feel better if we also weren't big they also weren't our bank at the same time I would feel better about it\nHey Stephen quickly one quick question for you know you probably have a gotten a real insight on the ah the we were kind of talked about the steel tariffs in these things going on of allies\nOr any like Canada in ... as a way of negotiating bring these countries to the table for what was kind of like a ... a NAFTA to point out type of situation well that happened but the steel tariffs are still on Canada do you have any idea why or is this going to change in any point\nBut this is one of the issues that I find my you know as you know I'm a big fan of Donald Trump I helped write the tax plan with my buddy lyric I thought so but I I just disagree with this policy I don't see the wisdom and steal an auto and aluminum tariffs or auto tourists but especially not steel and aluminum because you know we have something like a hundred thousand Americans who are employed and steal an auto but\nWe've got six million other manufacturers who use steel and aluminum\nAnd what they produce I was over it and how is your Bush a couple of weeks ago they you know when they make\nA you know Budweiser is they're using a lot of aluminum for those cans and they showed their prices are going up and\nThe judge that's going on around the country our auto producers are autos are more expensive because the steel tariffs so my point that Trump is this isn't even creating factory jobs were going to lose factory jobs as a result of that so I disagree very strongly with the steel and aluminum tariffs I think they do more harm than good does\nThe mid ... straighter Brock Long they're an eighty mile stretch of interstate ... in Florida as close both ways until debris can be cleared President Trump says on Fox and friends about a Saudi Arabian journalist who disappeared after entering the Saudi Arabian embassy in Turkey\nWhere we're looking at it very very seriously I don't like it at all now you know you don't have American citizens but that in this case doesn't matter I don't like it I don't like it with respect to reporters is a terrible terrible precedent\n... he was critical of his country's government he disappears last Tuesday [noise] this is Fox\nSlanted Olive Garden make today's dean's list and the amount of an Eighteen month old baby Courtney ...\nRarely gets a moment of calm especially during mealtime but thanks to the kind of act by an Olive Garden waitress named the any writer Courtney had a few blasted moments to herself she was out to dinner with her family in Greensboro with the hopes of enjoying a hot meal but her young daughter\nHarlan was having a hard time sitting still feeling overwhelmed she decided to ask me any if she could take her meal to go but instead the kind waitress offered to sit with her little girl well Courtney eight\nCourtney says she was shocked and at the waitress went over and occupied Harlan as she ate her food\nLater that night they patched mom decided to share her story on social media hoping to read about the event would realize there are more people out there like her thank you and me any writer your kind gesture touched my heart and fellow mom ... diem pocketing\nWe're more on Florida coming up in just a second can we take a look at a also the ah ah the election numbers I think it's\nAbout time we started getting a you know your analysis do because I Know you love stats\nAnd there's nobody better\nLooking at the numbers than you thank you the polls are hitting and they're coming in fast and Ah yes there's a lot to ah to understand about where that's going to get into that I'm sure we start there or do you go to start with some of the hurricane stuff uh\nWell I don't know if I Want to talk to the somebody who cannot agree with NBC News that are not natural disasters these are man made disasters\nNow so it wasn't manmade that we want an entire decade basically without getting one hurricane hitting the let me ask you something about that sir yeah\nAh would you agree with me that over the last ten years in the last ten years mhm we have seen a dramatic increase in hurricanes here in the United states since we dropped out of the Paris accords\nYes sir no sir in as a yes or no answer\n... you're saying has it gone from zero to two and the time that I mean since he's been out of that or ... I mean the trend is not increasing that we we have one year that had more than another year is that what you're trying\nBecause I'm asking you in the last ten years have we seen a cup of these ... these so called natural disasters\nI Want to just in the last couple of years thank you for your question NBC there has been an increase from all over the years they give very much [laughter] that journalism these days it is here's what the PCC says\nRemember this is Al Gore's a favorite place to go for climate information that this is what they say about hurricanes numerous studies tours and beyond the fifth assessment report of the Irish ... eh PCC have reported a di\nDi di di di\nGreasing trend in the global number of ... of tropical cyclones\nAnd or the global globally accumulated psychotic energy there's low confidence regarding changes in global tropical cycle numbers under global warming over the past four decades\nThere's consequently low confidence in the larger number of studies reporting increasing trends in the global number of very intense cyclists the view and I pay cc report the latest the latest update to bring out of a boring un talk what they're saying is total number of a hurricane's going down\nAnd there is low confidence in any change in the I'm In ... like what they say it's like well because they used to say there's going to be more frequent intense hurricanes than they realize the frequency thing wasn't happening there it's got to be more intense they don't even have evidence of that and so\nThat gives me Mr ... here is this not the strongest storm a\nIt on record did that is hit value Florida Panhandle that is the report you sir I rest now here's the summary [laughter] ah the PCC\nOnce again reports that there is little basis for claiming that drought floods hurricanes and tornadoes have increased much less increased due to a greenhouse gases that exactly the story you're getting on the media when they're trying to say we have ten years though we\nHave renewed this they've they've they've up to their commitment and in response I tell them\nUp yours [laughter] so [laughter] ah [laughter] it is a pretty remarkable okay\nLet me let me ask you this as we get into the poll numbers\nI Believe there's a chance we see a red wave because of Kavanaugh than we were concerned that there would be this massive blue blue wave in both the house and the Senate I think we see a red wave not a tidal wave but a red wave\nIt's possible first of all I Would say Kavanaugh if\nIf the last two years have been any indication Kavanaugh will be ancient history by the time this election happens it's like three weeks from now I like these things go away for example uh the the Access Hollywood tape happened right about this time in two thousand sixteen\nRight about now with your Tobar eighth or ninth in September eleventh that I\nUh and that by the time the election came as we saw had basically no impact on news ... I mean this stuff goes away fast and I think there will I don't think this is because because it's not just Kavanaugh if they would've yeah left it alone\nLeclaire Williams but they're not they're doubling down Hillary Clinton yesterday we can't live with these people\nI'm a Eric Holder comes out that the news today that he says when when they go low we kick them and the crowd cheers and this and he follows it with this is who the new Democratic Party is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Savannah", "day": "11"}
