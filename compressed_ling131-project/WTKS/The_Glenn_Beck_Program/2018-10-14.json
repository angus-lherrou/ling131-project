{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "Alright to mark revenues are against this morning and he is the police chief of savannah\nAnd mark we've had in the course of the big headlines that have been in the news at least for the last month or so has been the the the shooting in Parkland or Douglas High school Seventeen students are killed and lots of others injured so when and the highest since the tipping point in this one\nThat all of a sudden they finally said All right we're we're mad as hell and we're not gonna take it anymore you're going to have student marches that are going to be going on this one a week from today people listening on Saturday there's one on the twenty fourth is going to be taking place downtown\nAnd and I think the kids have a right to to to say what they want and we need to do something about it and frankly we haven't done much about it since Columbine except write more gun laws and tried to ban guns and and and then of course as the n._r._a. fault\nSo that's what what bothers me is I think these kids are being misled because they're being organized by these left wing groups that are that are organizing these marches and never let a credit crisis go to waste type thing but what about those those active shooters in in a school I'm I've always been in favor of of arming teachers\nBut if I if if I had my gun out and you show up\nAnd I'm I'm trying to get how do you know I'm not the bad guy with a gun instead of the good guy with a gun\nAnd that's an issue is on you know we trained for this stuff just like I think in this incident the um the shooter actually tried to mingle and hide into the crowd and so you know we're constantly evolving our training to make sure that we address these issues like you say an arm civilian\nUm stuff like that and you know one of my things that I always say is um you know having young daughters\nTeaching them how to drive I had to go through all kinds of steps to say okay they can parallel park they know three point they have to take these um I have to sign off on all these training things\nBut I Do is walk and get a gun and there's no training there is no we talk about our rights we need to talk about our responsibilities yes on you know I I I talked with some of our staff the other day we've had over a dozen guns stolen\nFrom an ... cars unlock cars you're going to leave a loaded firearm and an unlocked car and those guns go right into the criminal element and uh that's where we need to talk about responsibilities people security or guns don't let you know people if you if you have somebody in your family with the mental health problem or mental illness\nThey shouldn't um those guns should be safely secured in a safe and and same with the car wash cars\nAbsolutely and and it's you know and and you're right a soul and right out of unlocked cars is seemed seems the ultimate irresponsibility and people ought to be trained with a guy I've had the active training I had military training as well\nBut I've had the active training is like you said with with even with your guys who get the training all the time and you practice practice practice and somebody said once you shoot them in the foot once you shouldn't have a leg you go for center mass you you don't have time to to sit there and take game like that like when you're shooting at the paper targeting moving in a shooting back at you sure\nBut I Can't tell you how many people have walked into my office and said hey I bought a gun can you show me how it works [laughter] I don't ask me you know the old urban myth\nUm can I shoot him here can I shoot him in the house outside of the house and I go you have a thing that's capable of taking a human's life and you have an educated yourself on when it's appropriate\nUm and some people use it you know we we see these road rage incidents where everybody's brandishing it waving their guns around and um you know we've got to talk about conflict resolution we've got to talk about when it's appropriate and and that's something that we're not doing is is talking about the responsibility of of owning a gun\nIndeed uh and and the question is assisting that's hard to keep his how many times guns have save lives we have one of our callers are a few years ago call up and said he was filling up his car at three in the morning you've been out working late\nAnd the three young gentleman started approaching him and they weren't carrying any books or anything so he didn't figure they were going to ask for help with their algebra homework so he just pulled out his glock and started polishing up a little bit and all of a sudden they didn't seem as interested in talking to them any more\nSure and and you know obviously we want everybody to have the right to protect themselves but we we just like you said you have military training you have experience with weapons we want everybody to have that and so one of the things we'll probably look at it in the future is um having more citizens um gun training um so that they are responsible with these weapons and uh\nI Would encourage everybody to have\nYou know everybody thinks I'll put it between the towels and the upper part of the closet and felt like kids will never know and I'm anybody who has kids know that they may rummage through the house and they find these guns and I've seen a lot of kids accidentally killed and I'm playing with guns\nWhat a shame what a shame um we're talking with mark revenue the savannah police chief what do you think um the ... what kind of training to your officers go through on on active ... active\nShooting oh we we train every year in the schools um\nWe put them in real life situations we actually um shoot back at them with um what we call simulated firearms and it hurts um they have all kinds of protection and all that yeah but it it is is close to realistic as you can possibly get because we want them in that stressful situation we want their heart rate up we want their\nNervousness I'm\nTo be a factor said yeah they can remain calm\nAnd go through these schools and get to the problem right away and we're so much better equipped than we were when Columbine happened you know back then that the attitude was surrounded contain now it's save lives\nYou know because I I I thought the one of the biggest tragedy is not on Columbine was there was I think there was a teacher that bled to death he would have probably had to have we gotten gotten to him almost right away he would've lived but it was a two hours before before they went in and got this guy\nSure and and but it's not only schools that were training you know we've seen these incidents in Aurora, Colorado at a movie theater and we've seen that these other events so we're looking at all facets of of threats men were trying to stay ahead of threats\nYou know what what what's the best training the officers have and and what do you what do you like to see in your officers especially when you're when when somebody graduate from the academy when the when the young ... when the rookies come in what's that what's that process going through\nYou know it's all about having a great mentor you you can you can teach them and put books in front of them but having another experienced officer just learning how to talk to people you know officers encounter\nUm ... and everybody from doctors to homeless people and having that ability and I was lucky with ... out there and poor he he had amazing ability to deal with all walks of life and he treated them all fairly respectfully and and we we he preached that to me uh we've carry that\nAttitude throughout you know poor and um and that's something but yeah our officers go through an academy than we send them through another two months of patrols go where we teach them these techniques and we put them with a field training officer for several more months\nUm but even then there are still green and you know and they still need a mentor and that's a there's an old saying and departments only as good as its sergeants the sergeants are the ones where the rubber meets the road and they're out there and they're correcting these you know issues um it ... for example just little stuff like um\nIf you give somebody a citation and you say have a good day\nThey're not going to have a good day no matter how nice you mean that it's a sarcastic Fidel you teach your officers don't they have a good day you know that it it you may need it yeah but they're not gonna take it that way and um and I used to get that in polar was a people call me and say you know I was really mad I got a citation\nBut I just want to say I can't be mad because your officers were so professional respectful towards me explaining it and that's what we teach them is is you know I have a saying I'm every what we have a saying are good people do bad things sometimes\nWell there's you know and and there's another ... new quarter to ... Chinese proverb a while ago but there was an old saying that\nThe good judgment comes from experience and experience comes for bad judgment we learn from our mistakes\nAnd and and that's something that we see a lot of times is or\nWhere we make a mistake or we see another department and another area like they're looking at this um Florida shooting 'em we take those and we use those as training episodes to ah see what they did right what they did wrong and and this all just constantly evolves or training and it's very expensive to keep these officers trained in for\nSure and does it help working with the way about a minute left or working with the school police Oh absolutely\nAbsolutely chief ... and his staff or we'd been working with them extensively on this a plan to walk out but now that I'm planning on the shooting incidents and stuff like that yes we trained extensively with all the municipalities our state and federal partners\nMark ah it it's always been a pleasure knowing you're working with the with the with the pool where police department but I think they made a very wise decision and getting use the interim chief while they look for the for the the new guy or gal for that matter\nGrin Hillary Clinton certainly astonishing\nProgram you know the nice thing though about Hillary Clinton everybody knows he's lying\nYou know what I mean every nobody buys\nNobody buys her act anymore no which is really nice to really well CNN Christiana autumn poor she's still buys into it\nYeah I I don't know that I Would really make that distinction who cares what she thinks really either of them\nI mean I mean it's a voice is that I I almost can't here I guess so little about what they say almost like they're cutting woods in a foreign head [laughter] and I are falling and nobody's airing it and I'm In the middle of a city\nYeah many many hundreds of miles away I cannot hear the trees phobia I Try to remember I watched something that was so outrageous\nWas it and I thought to myself wow I'm really not outraged\nI don't care and I just don't care\nIt's hard I mean there's a lot of stuff I mean they're you know the things that the people that are trying to Harvard this election and the you know the cabin on things are actually saying I mean they're incredible it's as if they don't care what the words they're saying mean well well\nFor instance let's let's use this because we're changing definitions of words are here is um [noise]\nUh here's Brooke Baldwin on CNN they're talking about how we we we've got to be careful because people are going to be hurt because we're too where we're seeing mobs start to form here it is\nI Believe it's the overreaction of a left when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the word totally a mop it is without\nA doubt that there's no other one is that it will go put a stop on the mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August they got no ice at what we saw chasing we've right what about the people\nWho were at the Supreme Court banging on the walls\nWhat do you call that civil protest or is that I'm off I think if he has a ... yeah and if there was a party or as we call it um out for ... come on I ... I mean because I saw lots of\nTea partiers going to the Supreme Court and banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the walls of the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because they're both were supposed to be in a civil society\nRight I Am I trying to remember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their children\nYou know and the homemade signs how many people they chase down in restaurants and surrounded cannot think of one exam in fact if you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do during the health care bill\nShe and a was a John Lewis marched out in to the crowded\nIn to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't\nDo you remember they tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to\nThey were trying to get the Tea Party to become a violent mob they didn't\nCan you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington D. C. would not have been pretty it would not have been pretty\nBy the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob they're charging ... cities and they're taking over that's ... that's a riot\nThat is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob police look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make sure we know what we're talking about\nMob mob a large crowd of people especially one that has this orderly and intent on causing trouble or violence okay and and the quota is a mob of protesters that than there used to so is this not a disorderly\nCrowd of people that are trying to what it was a ... truck in tents on causing trouble\nI mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not causing trouble I mean if you're going to go down that road I guess in that that doesn't does it say there and unless you're right\nIt just says intent on causing trouble right it doesn't say you know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying\nThough is that the media does not see harassing conservatives\nThat's causing trouble correct that is the issue correct they see this as a currency that says like the you know there it's basically you know charity we're at right I mean that they're they're doing good\nFor the people you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that [laughter] things better you know I mean they try to the Irish guy who runs this other art [laughter]\nLet me tell you leave the white people white people do ya [laughter]\nReally bad oh really [laughter] okay so let's listen to a couple of things\nFirst we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob me yes I'm going to call it a mob a now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protesters mob rule here it is\nIs guaranteed to a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us about the constitution they're trying to change the description of protests and call it a mob well\nOf this president is the poster boy a thought what a mob a protest that looks like he is a matter of fact\nHe's the one who has been violence in his speech he's the one that they had things like this I lacked punch him in the face Trump said that at one of his route as he said knock the crap out of them are what you and say okay ... I mean okay alright okay we\nGot it now that's what she's saying she's saying that Donald Trump is the one who's violence in their speech a let's go to Jennifer ... adults are at us and she's the network president and co executive director at the center for popular democracy here is what she's saying to the crowds\nLawmakers leftist continue to push\nProtesters guaranteed to\nSorry sorry [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nTill they go anywhere we see the Dow here's\nHere's the problem let's wretched things down just a bit and listen to somebody who says no I think there's real trouble underway and has reason to say that here's Rand Paul\nWhen people like Cory Booker said get up in their face he he may think that that's okay but what do you have to realize is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face what I'm going to be an state want to commit violence when I was at the ball field\nWhich basically was nearly killed the guy shooting up the ball field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot [noise] basically has almost ... he was yelling this is for healthcare hit a list in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill\nYou know what I was attacked in my yard and had a my ribs broken a pneumonia lung conclusion that these are people that are unstable and we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratchet down and say we're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK\nEver reason for or a means we're trying to think\nI feel that there's going to be an assassination I really worry that someone is going to be killed and ah that those who are ratcheting up the the the conversation those who are actually got thing getting their face we have to realize that they bear some responsibility of this old extra power\nSo to whatever the time when people like Rick Baldwin in CNN were lecturing us that you couldn't say you're going to target a district\nBecause that of course led to violence couldn't target district remember the lectures of your words have power because you don't know who's listening to them and we said unless you're unless you're endorsing this we are calling for peaceful rallies\nAnd they were and they were\nThese are not peaceful how many people were arrested from the Tea Party riots mobs\nHow many I don't remember any\nThere's four hundred just last weekend on the left four hundred that's disorderly that's not a peaceful protest your words do have power because you do mean violence\nAnd twelve Ninety am double duty chaos home two AM savannah with Bill in Laura savannah is only live in ... morning show\nBack [noise] so [noise]\nI read a story from uh the Fort Worth Star Telegram yeah\nAbout why calls for unity in American politics are just not enough something wrong with the rest of the Internet\n[laughter] I don't I'm not an object [laughter] of the story says look at the Nineteen thirties and forties\nThe U.S is in the midst of a tepid economic recovery falling a catastrophic downturn but millions of Americans continue to feel left behind some turn their anger on corporations in Wall Street others target non white immigrant workers a charismatic media personality with a populist message attacks religious minorities\nConservatives denounced the president and his allies for flouting the constitution and steering the United states towards socialism meanwhile many on the left warned that fascism is taking root in America\nOkay let's just go through they'll just go through this because\nThey say this isn't this isn't a hard time\nThis is the Nineteen thirties and forties\nOkay uh the ... the U.S does in ... each tepid economic recovery following a catastrophic downturn millions of Americans continue to feel left behind yep that's that's been proven now we're not in a tepid recovery our way some turn their anger on corporations in Wall Street yes that would be the left\nThat would be the last ... others target non white immigrant workers\nWho's doing that\nI mean I guess they would claim that like border enforcement right like yeah that's border enforcement that a lot more than ... yeah the ... the law that for claiming we do not know who's in our country and we're also worried about terrorism\nI'm a charismatic media personality with a populist message attacks religious minorities well who could that be [laughter]\n'cause I I Know I Know I went to stand with Israel if anybody's attacking religious minorities hell with that\nReligious majorities it's the left\nConservatives denounces the president and his allies for flouting the Constitution's during the I'd said stored socialism yep\nDid that one because that's what's happening that's what did happen I ask a Alexandria Ocasio Cortez yeah ... it's a crazy accusations rice point many on the left warn that fascism is taking root and America no\nSocialism is taking root in America socialism\nYeah I mean people molested fascists every time someone does something they don't like right as ... fascism it that is it socialism that is sweeping the nation remember the headline where all socialist now that's what's sleeping is sweeping the nation\nAre parallels between the two areas aren't perfect but the late Nineteen thirties I thought oh that\nIs an understatement of the year can you say that live out the parallels between the two hours aren't perfect they're not perfect but that is one way to describe yeah you've just done yeah about three quarters of them are completely inaccurate\nBut as an aide to a night late Nineteen thirties as today political rank or social division and the threat posed by alien ideologies sparked widespread unease what is the alien ideology\nOf today yeah of today or back then I mean the fact that one of the two major party has embraced democratic socialism is already alien to me yes the the the fear back in the thirties was communism\nOr the ... and the left said no it's fascism\nWell okay um\nI guess I mean it was Adolf Hitler and Mussolini that said that ah FDR is one of us he is a fascist so maybe it was bad but there's more hang on\nThese news radio Ninety seven point seven and twelve Ninety am W T chaos\nMobile weather and you'll have a beautiful Sunday to close out the weekend mostly sunny with highs and the mid eighties mostly clear this evening becoming partly cloudy overnight lows will be in the upper sixties and the WTO see first alert whether center I'm Ron Walters\n[noise]\nMm [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd the Glenn ... probably ... you know if you look at the the civil unrest in America and you really look at the history you will find that it is\nAlmost always the left and in particular the communist or Marxist left\nThat is behind the civil unrest if you look at a you know here's Seventeen eighty three to Seventeen Ninety nine and you know Eighteen twenty nine to Eighteen fifty the riots in ensue gets that you know a paragraph each\nBut after the communist manifesto\nWell then you start to get some interesting\nRiots usually called strikes now some of these things are legitimate when it comes to race\nBut a lot of these come from a progressive in office\nWho is doing something and stirring people up against one another for instance the greatest example is Woodrow Wilson where he's you know these practically heaping praise on the Klan\nHe shows the first to a movie ever shown in the in the White House and it's one glorifying the Klan\nClan goes through a resurgence and he was heavily involved in any way to the military and did all sorts of things so you see this all of a sudden you start to see this real uptick of race riots again\nIn the in the Nineteen you know Fifteen onward will that's because of re segregation and all of the things that a progressive planted\nAlright but let me just go through and see if you can find any\nPatterns here the Patterson silk strike the copper county strike the Indianapolis streetcar strike a the Seattle general strike May Day riots read this summer the Boston police strike the steel strike any of those\nSeems a labor related I was the last labor related doesn't it labor who I'm Sorry if you look these up almost every time you will find the international workers' of the world\nWho are the international workers' of the world of course are based in communist yeah most is it is the communist army here in America the international workers' of the world unite rise up against your oppressors\nYou also had in Nineteen sixty and the preparedness day bombing in San Francisco a you had a um a you had read summer which was about twenty of them you had made a riots\nYou had the scent trail yet massacre was what's interesting is the preparedness day bombing\nThat was the left and communist saying you you can't get involved in the war\nBecause it's so unethical and we're going to bomb you until you stop the best way to say that we're icicle is with a bomb right the ... massacre if I'm not mistaken was again the leftists the ... I Can't remember which one it was but it was a communist organization that was against\nA all of the um all of the American legion Z and they were coming up so they're they they go and they protest I think it was a parade and they actually end up rioting and killing people okay good then you look in the nineties\nThe thirties and forties it's a ... century earlier was a an industrial workers of the world is ... ... thank you okay Minneapolis or Minneapolis Teamsters strike Nineteen thirty for the auto light strike\nThe west coast long shore strike do even know what that one was that when that happened in may ninth through October twelfth\nThat one's shut down San Francisco bay a the ports in California Portland and Seattle ... and who was behind that one\nUh probably some conservative thing yeah no no the textile workers' strike of Flint sit down strike the battle of the overpass the republic steel strike almost all of these and including many of the race riots\nHave communist and Marxist fingerprints on them\nI said it's as fundamental to the ideology right revolution is fundamental to the ideology is not surprising that this was happening again so I just I'm I'm really tired of of sharing a or I should say this way\nI'm really tired of the media and there lies Under Cover up for history and truth you know Donald Trump says that you and media are the enemy of the American people well if you are knowingly lying\nI don't mean down like that I mean you know if if if it was here in his right to defend his family and his ... relation of violence\nFoolishly he would have been foolish to do it escalating violence is not a defense against the relation of violence that's going to make it worse I mean what ... did was when\nRight what did you tell me Ted Cruz lost that they did we lose the capital of the day we didn't we didn't come out in the streets and and yell and scream and beat the crap out of people with Kavanaugh is he in the Supreme Court we would have lost the capital K yeah you would have lost the last ... certainly were lost Jeff Flake he was dying to vote no but we didn't give me the opportunity\nYou went through and handle the situation right an al ... and I was on the Supreme Court handled well\nWhat's and what's the next level they're going to go out\nAnd I don't know we'll have to wait and see you seem to want to predict it and act on it now yeah and I I'm I'm not with you on that believe me I Will protect my family and I without my security guards I'm Sorry I might threats are a little\nBit more than getting dirty look in the grocery store or to do the Kroger though have you ever had that no I've never had ever said manager Kroger look at\nMy church uh so I I I Am sorry that you don't have a my security I'm I Am sorry that my

I Hope you still answer yes but it seems to be getting smaller than I Would agree with you on that but we have ... fire with fire and it's not changing any hearts\nIn fact it's doing the opposite is changing our heart\nWe are not getting stronger in our Judeo Christian values we are getting weaker we're getting more angry we are moving towards the edge of the best that others are wanting us to walk off\nListen\nTo this one explanation and you'll understand why I feel so desperate right\nNow why did Bonham for fail if you don't know ... you should look him up he was a pacifist\nHe had a lot in common with gone to accept he believed in Jesus but that other than that I think that's the only real difference\n\nHe was a pacifist he was a pastor he was in Germany he walked the streets on crystal knock and went\nIn to those doors with broken glass\nAnd bought things from those stores the very next day this guy did not sit down he was not quiet the day the fewer gave his inaugural address his broadcast was shut off because while that was happening\nHe was giving a speech on radio called the ... principal\nHe was speaking out to a nationwide audience this is wrong\nHe had influence he had power\nHe had position he was in the right place\nWhy was that voice not able\nTo convince his fellow Germans\n\nBecause they had already gone over the cliff\nThey had lost because of World War one and the Nineteen twenties they had lost their Judeo Christian values it was an empty shell there was\nThe thing left other than the tradition of going\nNow I don't believe that that's where where are you yet but we're approaching that\nIf we lose our Judeo Christian heart our values our principles if we lose our art type as a nation that Jesus is who we should try to be\nWe're done

the world is at its worst heads stats are just wrote that book welcome to the program at how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books on outrage\nSo out of a nice time to talk about outrage\nAnd we did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime and rage an outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case talking about Christians might engage the age of outrage and I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it\nBut not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and\nAs you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate your responded\nA and mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is Dan's response is I mean that just said I'll just say I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people feel like I Know we are there's a lot of built up outrage\nThat is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center\nA well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nOr and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but it but I but again\nI I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll do he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged\nAnd they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings\nThey're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a wry rarely ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment for them you know not everybody we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation of space there challenges\nBut this is our moment in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart in some stats up some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to hum we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our\nCable news network or we don't need to be\nA shape spiritually by her social media feed I think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables but he also showed this remarkable ability\nThat we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around the Samaritan woman at the well\nAnd I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to\nGet like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know we don't stand up for things don't I mean even you said you fight but you fight\nOr a you know for example or you can't war at a people and reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're user title were addicted to outrage right now\nAnd I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do both we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly to not participate in creating photo and false crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court but the Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president that would have stood up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\n... you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know are trying to get into people's face and getting them to react or out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are ... if it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attractive to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm so for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life you know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have the kind of you know they're the go those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life\nAnd then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some some self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life not yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counterprotesters\nIt it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death and they lived because they stood up with pita yeah unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate because you know victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about uh trying to hold back the advance of course to either pagan\nAnd he says this I'll watch the pagan priest neglect the poor the hated galleons devote
