Obama said he used to before he went to college now Bill O'Reilly is here hello bill [laughter] back how you doing I'm I'm I'm good I don't well how do you think this cat with other things going to come down\n[noise] or they confirmed um tomorrow afternoon\nGuys with ... as I said there's ... the forty at this time [noise] but I I think he's going to be very hard and the ... slashed\nUh yeah for any Republican vote against them because there's new information and I don't know whether you guys know the new information because the media is not reporting it including Fox News what in the wall street\nJournal I'm Dr Ford's people that includes her lawyers and uh her advisors or tried to get a woman named legal in Keizer to change her testimony that isn't the FBI report apparently\n... was the best friend to Christine Ford when this incident about Cabot allegedly took place and was named by Ford as\nAn eye witness keys are all along and said I don't remember anything like this I don't even know judge Kaplan well now the journals reporting that uh for its people and they name a woman Monica McLean\nTexted keys or and said hey you got to change your testimony you got to help Christine that's a\nHuge story well they're enormous store there is also another\nStory um that are in the FBI testimony that it shows the leak came from Chuck Schumer that it was Chuck Schumer his office in cahoots with one of the beach ladies that Ford or talked about\nYeah well I don't think there's any doubt about Chuck Schumer or Dianne Feinstein at this point that they are corrupt\nSo bill ... there were more than one language\nMonica McLean by the way this was the woman who Ford's ex boyfriend\nTold the Senate Judiciary committee that Ford tried to help her get through a lie detector test\nYet because she was applying for a job at the FBI there's now bolsters the ex boyfriends um account now this may seem in the weeds but if the Judiciary Committee and I I Believe wrestling may do this I Hope so\nHe could hall monitor ... Monica ... uh and uh others in affords camp in front of the committee and he could bring back for it and say you lied to us about the lie detector test if\nThat happens for it could be prosecuted\nNow I don't think it will I think it should it should and should to here's here's the\nAnybody capital allied or for allied anybody they should be held to account\nYeah here's here's the thing I don't care if it is mark judge or if it is a professor Ford right you lied yeah you should go to jail right that this this is too serious this tour the country apart\nAnd it a little what if this was coordinated it ... and I mean Chuck Schumer is well if Chuck Schumer lead to this\nHe should also stand some sort of penalty but anybody who was involved you know there was one guy who or what was it su he came out and he said oh I Know I have this evidence I saw this happening and as soon as he ... he's been drinking this morning bill you wouldn't believe\nThe IRA yeah [laughter] have him arrested yeah I'd like to be drunk for all of your interviews with us okay the rights to unlimited better state for you because you can't understand them sober\n[laughter] that's true that's fair so I'm ... ... there's there's one guy who came out and level the accusations and then immediately retracted them and admitted that he was lying everyone likes to focus on four but there's been five accusers\nYeah yeah this is the Newport Harbor guy yes but when you get when you get into a situation um and and this goes right back to the need to think here we're talking about did you see a list mulatto yes this week say\nIt doesn't matter if individual men get crushed\nIt doesn't matter because women have been abused for so many years and I have no sympathy for men innocent men who get crushed I mean once you're into that zone and we've discussed this before your interest Allen is\nYou are now we don't care you know if some guy didn't do something like Kavanaugh whoever it may be and and and you get it in your career and family and everything else was destroyed you know that's the price you got to pay because of the past injustices a against women\nBut that is that now that is the ... bill that's the combination\nOf post modernism and social justice\nSocial justice now is the vehicle for post modernism and the idea is it doesn't matter if she was telling the truth because others have been in her situation ... doesn't matter if he did it because others have been in his situation is what matters is\nIs communal justice\n[noise] that it is that other people are talking\nAbout in the media will never report on is it the same people\nThat organized a sponsor boycott against me when I was on Fox News are now paying people to go to the capital to scream and yell at senators\nAbout cabinet ... outfits are doing it move on leaves the league alright they've got the mailing list they've got all the information I mean I'm sitting there going deja vu yeah\nSame people so now in addition to insanity like Alissa Milan all individual insanity then you have an organized coordinated effort\nWith tens of millions of dollars courtesy of George Soros and others okay we're organizing sending people paying people to go in and disrupt sometimes physically\nThe process and Americans are basically in a dark they don't know what's happening back because there's a report it\nWill I Will tell you I I listen to that stupid New York times podcast and listen to it every day just to hear what\nYou know what's being they're putting on it uh and it was that it might it made my eyes bleed today I couldn't take the hypocrisy\nA ... but one of the things that we're talking about is you know I'm really concerned because things in the capital are becoming very scary they're very scary for reporters and for you know for these senators and and things are getting out of control the do you\nAnd uh what's already sold Seventy five thousand in advance a sales\nAnd you'll have that and you only have Seventy one thousand in the trunk of your car which is not yeah I Know\nAnd you know the gas is going up it's really\nYou know it's actually a really good book bill ... four minutes or to the vote senator Collins has just voted yes on the advancement she said will announce her final decision at three PM ...\nAgain I mean because everyone thinks that this vote is going to be consistent with the boat that would happen this weekend or are we really thinking that she's going to change\nThis and I know now know show for it all the Republicans\nWill vote for Kavanaugh because if they don't they're out of the Republican\nParty well LA cuts it like and he's already out of it you know he's leaving really easily [noise] that's\nTrue but I don't think flake wants to go out on that note remember flake wants to get a job as a lobbyist she wants to go around and give speeches maybe write a book if he's got the machine against him that's going to hurt him in retirement as far\nAs good burnings are concerned about where he is\nStill I Want to ask you honestly Danes is if for Montana's leaving to go to his daughter's wedding and I was ... there's this is a really important vote and who knows what happens in twelve hours even if something goes wrong but I thought that my daughter and I was like you know what I I Would totally leave\nOh I really my daughters I leave my daughter's wedding none of the right choice yes\nYeah I mean I'm I'm I don't know why they can't work out something on that um you know there are ways to vote 'em but I look you know if your daughter's getting married daughters get married\nUm maybe they could move the ceremony later and they could but I don't know I don't know but you're right you gotta you gotta family first\nAnd there's no reason why these guys have to be there why are we using Seventeen hundreds technology out of the euro some reason he could be on a phone\nHigh right right and they could make an exception I think but you're\nRight okay what else\nI'm All right we'll she's believe me I Know on that I thought were going that says if you want me to give you so now we got to give us two minutes on on killing the ss\nI look at the book is about evil and and my contention is that most Americans don't understand the evil my mother didn't she lived a very\nReal life yeah she's on me which is obviously\nBut she loved me and thought I was good\nSo they didn't understand evil right right\nSo we're seeing so much evil in America are we not\nUm you know people walking into schools and gunning down kids uh clerics abusing children um Chicago where thousands of people are shot by drug gangs and nothing's done opioid epidemic through the roof\nThis is all evil it's centered on evil and so I wrote ss with an eye on explaining to the reader\nThat these concentration camp guard and the people who kill babies and gashed innocent people were farmers merchants and and bankers they weren't anything trained to do this they weren't as Saxons\nThey were regular people and once the war started they put on the black uniform would the debt said insignia and went into the most horrible things

him it's not funny right what this guy's funny to me yeah so that's that's what I've experienced the harvest yeah\nSo uh you know one of the things that when I when I uh\nWas I feel like do they tell you that you look somebody\nDoes it do you want to do they do know that you know how bad it is somewhere colonel Sanders is like I look like Glenn Beck I don't know [laughter]\nThat was going to go to

uh\nAnd ... ... ... what year was a it was in the nineties okay yeah okay [laughter] that rational respond to write the nineteenth alright yeah I'm just trying to get an eye out here you have those so she said no and she said the reason why is because we don't have God in common and I said I'm you know I I Believe in God I'm On everything and she said\nYou don't go to church and I said I see you every Sunday after church for and every time you come home talking about the people who were honking at each\nOther or yelling yeah they're right in the park and oh why oh yeah yeah I Know it yeah it's crazy yeah\nIt's crazy how people are in church and they're finding that but they're like they're looking\nAt their watch like nobody was on ... yeah yeah yeah they want out which of these ... these video my ... ...\nThe rich and the church market a lot of like make all these some I make two videos a week and some of them connect and some of 'em don't just probably like your content of your
