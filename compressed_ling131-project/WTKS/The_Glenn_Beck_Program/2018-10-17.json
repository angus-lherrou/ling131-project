think about it before you actually have um in hand right and I think we say that our winters\nI'm In the past and going forward we always encourage them to get great professional advice that they're managing their money's well after they buy after they win these large amount says that wouldn't have incredible for Georgian I'm too when\nThe great thing as you know I'm with every ticket sold a

I knew I Would probably be a death sentence to me\nHe takes his fiance they get into a car and they uh drive up to the embassy the Saudi embassy in his ...\nHe says I'm going to go in I'm going to get the paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she calls his phone no answer nothing\nAs it turns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this happened\nUm but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent um but it\nLooks as though she was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow there's an additional update today we have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went rogue ... but it's kind of hard to believe\n\n[noise] the new information today you know is this coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly\nOr last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead um but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a U.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Nick then the Turks came out and said that\nThey had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation torture and killing\nI don't know if they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if\nThe Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story that this actually audio arrived first with his fiance\nBecause he had an apple watch and when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true\nFor her sake I Can't imagine especially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if as if it exists includes his interrogation\nAh and then uh the\nThe execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him you can't kill him in here or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... on conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true\nThis may be an Archduke Ferdinand moment down the road this may be the thing that sets the world on fire that doesn't seem like the thing that could set the world on fire but\nSaudi Arabia is our ally we are currently fighting the war on terror with Saudi Arabia we're currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen\nUm we are getting ready to sell billions of dollars worth of warm machinery to Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia is quietly supportive of of ah Israel now in the middle east and are taking strong stands to support Israel they are also a an ally with us against Iran they are a balance of power\nWhere where we could be facing an imminent threat\nOf you know a bomb going off in a place that kills a lot of people that you know we might be able to stop this is ... if this is this is a prosecution of a crime\nRight in our eyes and if if they have actually killed this person\nThey need to be held responsible however we don't need to make that decision tomorrow no we need to make sure that we get it right we need to actually figure out all the dynamics going on just because it has a media scene I'm today does not mean we need to make a decision today are we actually take it seriously than most of the facts only a media feed on because it involved a reporter\n... yeah and and and the story is so dramatic as you point out what was it wasn't at first Hitchcock movie rather window right where window I mean ... you know it's such a dramatic\nHollywood type crazy twenty four ah you know Jack Ryan story that you wonder I mean it it's capturing our attention which is it okay it's just that we have to make sure we're looking at where the stuff is coming from right now it's coming from people with incentive to make Saudi Arabia look bad my guest is\nBecause I think Saudi Arabia they're not our friends they've done a lot of really bad things um this ... I mean getting remember this print\nTook his own you know family members other princes hostage in a hotel and is likely a stole tons of their wealth including planes and these specific planes are the ones accused of flying in and taking their remains out in suitcases so these are the\nPlanes the prince confiscated from other family members [laughter] I mean as he held them you know in a you know rich Carlton prison\nSo it's a legitimate worry that this guy is an absolute Kim Jong own style maniac\nAnd if that's happening with Saudi Arabia it's a lot worse than it is happening in you know in North Korea and a lot of ways I mean we already have a relationship with Saudi Arabia they're very influential in that region we know they do this but we know this stuff goes on in this region already and we deal with all these countries that that do it right but we just have to make sure that\nThere's no reason to feel pressure\nTo not go through and intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation\nAnd you better take this tape seriously because if I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kind of ... around and calmed everybody down\nAnd then when everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I write but the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you the tape because that's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're knocked friends of ours they are not friends of ours\nThey are selling us crap that quite honestly I live in Texas\nWe don't need it we don't need it open up\nThe fields here in Texas start pumping again and bring the price of oil down and let's get off of Saudi Arabia we don't need it [noise]\nWill watch this closely a it's a ticking time bomb back in the sex\nRush is next it knew now more back on news radio twelve Ninety and Ninety seven points that have a double duty chaos\nFox News son Chris foster President Trump says there shouldn't be a rush to judgment about the disappearance and reported murder of a Saudi Arabian journalist in Turkey he says it also matters whether the Saudi king and crown prince were in on it\nIf they knew about it that would be bad\nIf they didn't know about it things bad things can happen\nOn Fox Business network South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham tells box\nYou don't have to be Sherlock Holmes my favorite line to figure this out he goes into constantly they never comes out we have entail that Saudi Arabia to crown prince was annoyed with this guy ...\nShow was critical of the Saudi regime marijuana is legal in Canada starting today in power was there when I shop opened at midnight in St john's Newfoundland\nFeels trace wouldn't you be super happy to if you're in a first person in line I'm so excited\nKennedy's the second country after your way to legalize marijuana nationally this Fox News [noise]\nGlenn Beck on news radio Ninety seven points to evidence will Ninety am Devon U.

just I'm just because I'm a helper I'm a helper stew you're a helper and we just want to help the Democratic socialist out\nUh we've got some extra spending maybe that they could consider some slogans necessarily think extra spending as possible or what their support them housing a barrier to do that I don't think they've taken every dime\nTrue I yeah I mean difficult to find more to spend on your front ways to spend them ... millions remember the classic documentary or from the Nineteen eighties and would share Richard Pryor was forced to spend thirty million dollars and thirty days\nAnd if he did so successfully from a from a inheritance humid received the full inherent it's a three hundred um this is an important moment or in our culture\nUm but it was difficult because he couldn't take it he asked that we couldn't buy thirty million dollar car right he had a zero assets at the end of it and the idea was kind of like the thing where you do with your kids were you\nUh you know they don't actually do this but like in the legend up like you have your kids smoked three packs of cigarettes you get sick and never wants to smoke another cigarette right round so that's kind of make sure you get sick of spending money so you're good with money from that on was the idea in in a documentary\nUm but how did he wind up actually there's a spoiler alert for Nineteen eighty three but how did he\nWind up spending all the money he decided to run a political campaign it was the easiest way to get rid of all of a buddy at ... or so I think ah you know this is kind of at the aspect where the uh the the Democrats are which is can they figure out another way to spend\nMoney we may even do a little roosters millions or where you come up on stage and you are a a democratic socialist [laughter] and you have to spend\nSixty trillion dollars\nTo do it harder than you think it is harder than you think can you do it\n... the socialist already have but can you do it very difficult right is very different ... over that I don't think we're going back dot com slash tours the athletes to go by the way to get to grab your tickets bill O'Reilly's coming up in just a few minutes and

said Republicans should be brought to the\nGuillotine on November So\nThat's a that's okay that's it that's not as bad as saying you want a targeted districts to take her right\nRight yeah yeah ... is I mean you know that's common language people always say that are bringing a gay a teen we get ... but those you know whoever into a gear team\nNow I assume ... I hate to say this but I assume they're not actually building get changed but Republicans and I'm not sure I'm not a hundred I'm not sure it anymore I I think I Do think that the FAA you know could be talked into it pretty quick all yeah\nAnd if I probably could be a Roger Williams or the congressman pointed this out in an op ed he wrote for the Dallas Morning news talking about how he was a I don't know on a baseball field being shot at 'em and kind of remembers that in and it's maybe not so a positive on this new\nDemocratic um a way of thinking where they are saying ... or Eric Holder when Republicans go low we kick them\nI'm Cory Booker says get up in the face of congresspeople Maxine Waters harassed members of the Trump Administration Hillary Clinton we cannot be civil or all of these things are ... are are maybe a little bit more impactful to someone who was being shot at by a Bernie Sanders volunteer\nA baseball field and then watching Steve ... almost be\nKilled but what's worse but what's worth those things the guillotine or horse face seriously what's worse wow that's a great I mean one of those things deserves\nTwenty four seven coverage all I Know which one it is I Know what it says on Twitter right it's a yeah it's horse race and certainly it got to be a serious issue and we all know that you know saying or space\n[noise] [noise] you know saying\nIt I mean I mean the question is what's horse horse face or the Rwandan genocide I'm On the fence on that part of it I'm not sure there are so close right and deserved an equal amount of coverage by the way our space will get more coverage than there are wanting to genocide ever did yes yes it already has had already had already had to do and funny uh I Believe horse face\nMay have already beaten the baseball shooting coverage as well ...\nThese news radio Ninety seven points that an and twelve Ninety am W.

outrage like you are\nAmong ... addicted to\nOut a ... and I know\nThe bigger picture here is this um the Democratic party\nIs confused now they don't know what to do right I'm Juanita Broderick claimed that Bill Clinton tried to rape depression never in a million years is going to give that allegation\nAny exposure at all non stop going to happen so you can talk about it I could talk about whatever\nShe had much more I mean she was credible she was okay it's\nJust not gonna happen than not going to get back into it um and they didn't report it when it happened\nOr why are they then getting into the Monica Lewinsky thing\nBecause they have to at least acknowledge that Hillary Clinton beyond all rationality is that is putting herself out there in these positions where she is the re litigate this stuff\nNow the reason she's doing it is she wants to remain relevant so she can run again for president\n[laughter] no I'm Serious come on come on back I'm I'm really you\nYou know that I'm the most brilliant political analysts in the country now I don't I Am telling you that she wants to run again for president and\nTo know I Know she wants to run do you really think she will\nIt depends depends\nA lot on Biden it depends a lot on um whether she feels that the field against terror is weak which it is absolutely week but the bigger picture is that the Democratic party doesn't know what to do with Bill and Hillary Clinton\nThey don't know what to do with them\nAll right so Bill Clinton and Hillary going on a road in there and and talk to their devoted supporters\nThis isn't an accident and this is a is a trial I mean to see how many people show up how enthusiastic they are a below say look when I was president we did all this and Hillary was a great a first lady as she did all this and then she was a great senator and she was great secretary's day that's what this is\nIs it ... it up across the country to see\nHow it's going to fly but if you think Hillary Clinton is just going to go away quietly into the night she's not she wants to be president and she realizes that the Democratic field as it stands now is extremely weak who's going to vote for Elizabeth Warren\nI mean that a non\nAmerican Idol [laughter] know rushed her a horrible\nCrime rushed to the Boston Globe thought it was doing a favor by saying oh yeah we got a little bit ah blood on average and then the Cherokee Nation the Cherokees themselves give us a knock it off where she's not Cherokee um this is a total Rosen fraud\nKnock it off the chair and then themselves crazy OK and war and he used\nThat ruse as I say in my message of the day I'm Bill O'Reilly dot com today [noise] use the rose to advance their current and academia so and this is a woman who thinks she's going to win an election she's not\nOnly in Massachusetts that may be at Oregon you know these days that she can get into the Senate but as a national viable candidate in a way\n... as in the ... the number one political strategist ... uh do you ... how could she come out with this whole thing Elizabeth Warren without having someone on record from the Cherokee Nation to support or I mean I see how she got the ...\nShe has her grandmother who once told her when she was three [laughter] the jihad high cheekbones and that's because way way way way back\nUm uh she was a chair or as a mother or\nYou know was a source of all of this but look I'm getting back to to backs a Hillary Clinton scenario um Hillary Clinton is a woman who is obsessed oh yeah\nSo she doesn't fit in to the me too movement obviously she doesn't fit in there because she has her husband um and she doesn't fit in to the far left even though she pander to them all the time because she didn't really\nShe lets them\nYeah she's a system uh uh Paul would they call in New York She's a tall so but she she and her husband and I spent um I was at the Yankee game and I talked to Bill Clinton about twenty minutes a is I mentioned to you last time I was on um she and her husband say you know what\nThey may not like us they being the Democratic voters but we're so much better than what is up there now I mean Michael Bloomberg is going to run for president of the Democratic ticket\nAnd you know outside of New York nobody knows who Bloomberg is very smart guy by the way stream Lee intelligent All right but he doesn't really have much of a chance but he's got a lot to do a lot of money and he'll be in there but other than that you tell me if Biden doesn't go and buy it and I think it's going to be Ninety eight years old next year\nI'm ... and older senior citizen I I Will\nTell you this bill you know who I think is positioning for a run and I don't think in twenty twenty but I think the only twenty four I don't think it's going to be Hillary Clinton there will be the first first lady that becomes president I think it could be Michelle Obama\n[noise] maybe I I'm not sure whether Michelle Obama has at the drive but certainly\nShe would be formidable and then there's the rock and it's the it's the reverse you know ... they're they don't have the resume I mean the Obama is if you even if you don't like 'em I mean NATO conducted themselves pretty well\nPersian new year to the you know I'm not sure you need the ah the resume I mean I heard I heard the rock say you know if I'm going to seriously do this I I you know I've got a I've got actually runs something or can't just be in movies and I I thought to myself I'm not sure that matters really doesn't matter anymore\nJust smash that but it's certainly a plus for Michelle Obama because she doesn't have any little attachments\nAnd and so that you know that's not going to be a diversion so you might be right there I mean I I don't know that well I met her a few times um I Know she was very powerful in the White House ...\nExtremely powerful and that was kept very quiet and and I think you're right\nYou might you know this is in her time the next time around you don't want to go up against Trump a certainly doesn't want to do that but it took twenty four absolutely she could uh if she wanted it I think the Democratic party would rally around her\nYeah All right when we come back I Want to talk to you about um ... and what is going on in the streets of Portland more with Bill O'Reilly from Bill O'Reilly dot com and don't forget his new book is out killing the ss which\nIs fantastic uh pick it up and grab my book at the same time by him as a as I said I guess I think that's what Amazon is recommending people who bought this brought this to a so grab 'em 'cause they're both really good alright ... liberty safe liberty saved the number\nOne save manufacturing in the nation they have sold more than two million saves\nAnd they've done it for a reason liberty safe leads the industry in technology and innovation offering the exclusive features like military military style locking bars heat expanding fire CEO which is really important all in all of the full size safes come with a lifetime warranty\nIs this America you would think the people Portland, Oregon would rise up right\nThat they would go out in the rose city which signs condemning the mayor\nAnd antifa and mass tens of thousands of them\nThey gather by that while I'm at river with their size this is not the city we want you got anybody out there doing that nobody so this is the problem the problem is that we all are the problem is that in ... the problem is the people in Portland, Oregon\nAnd that's why I wrote killing the ss 'cause I'm saying we better wake up here in America we better wake up and confront evil and ... is evil\nSo I get my ... I think you did and I've got a lot to ask you about on this but let me let me start with this\n[noise] [noise] why do you suppose\nThat there isn't a an uprising a ... in Portland or they are the\nBlind to it for some reason or do they actually support it are they afraid to come out what is the what's the real readership\nAnd they ended in Montgomery County so\nIf I were still working on channel two I be doing commentary going okay I'm going to be out uh on the banks of the war I'm wherever I'm going to be there at the turn in the morning on a Saturday I Want y'all come out and support what I'm doing okay nobody's going to do that there's nobody in town going to do that with any visibility at all\nThe ... to um unfortunately\nBecause there are many many many good people in Portland in ... county and I have friends there most people are selfish\nAll right they're into their own pursuits they're doing whatever they want to do and you know what this is the New Orleans but I don't really want to spend time on this and then maybe a lot like me and maybe people hit me or I'm not going to do it\nIt's a selfish thing and it's not just in Portland, Oregon I mean we have to really as as a people we really have to start to rise up and say hey you know what we want to process\nWe want a presumption of innocence we don't want ... on the streets and mass beating people up and telling women that there has been should rotten the grave and we don't want that\nOkay so in Portland do we have any democratic 'cause it's all Democrats a hundred percent got any politicians ... the governor of Oregon doing anything about this saying anything about it no no no no ... and that's how far we've come that's how far we've declined\nSo bill I Want to talk to you a little bit more about this and just one thing on and when you say we've got to stand up and fight this I'd like to hear your opinion on on what exactly that means a but also when we come back I Want to take you to Saudi Arabia\nThings have gotten even more bizarre and now now now they're saying that the a shaggy was alive and aware as they were dismembered bring him a it is just\nAn amazing story I'd love to hear your take on it and also if you were the president or advising the president what would you do when we come back [noise]\nKnow when you can always on the news radio savannah dot com\nFox News I'm Chris foster the first lady Melania Trump's okay the plane she was on had to turn back to a joint base Andrews ten minutes into a flight to Philadelphia reporter on board says there was a haze of smoke and the burning smell it got stronger crew members as it came from an overheated communications you had that hasn't been confirmed from the White House yet they're getting a new plane ready for the trip\nThe secretary of state Mike Pompeo has met with leaders in Turkey about the disappearance of a Saudi Arabian journalist there the\nTurkish foreign minister saying he and Mike\nPompeo how beneficial and fruitful talks on pay and there's also met with the ... president they ... as a newspaper in techie publishes what it says how details from an audio recording allegedly capturing Jamal ... being tortured killed ... men that inside the county that Saudi Arabia has described allegations along those lines as\nNicely socks assignment on one\nComing out the best day since March stocks are down to start the day on Wall street\nKeeping you updated with Fox News and on top and bottom of the child news radio Ninety seven points and then we will not give them you can do better\nYeah I don't mean to climb down combat\nBill the frustration is growing in America the press is excusing or antifa they are excusing everything the Democrats are saying uh than another Democrat up in ah Minnesota came out over the weekend and said it's time to bring the gear teams\nOut for the Republicans I'm I mean it's it's it's remarkable what is being said and dismissed when there is actual violence on the streets you um you said in a minute ago you know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\n[noise] well I Do a peacefully number one and I think that uh various ah people have to say you know let's get a little group together and um maybe we'd go out and and stand in the park with some signs saying whatever\nOr maybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper\nAh with five hundred signatures are attached to it\nSo the Oregonian for example a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have um some space for not bad we have a community group and this is the way we feel about it\nThere are things you can do to be visible in your local community it doesn't have to be a big national thing 'cause that's almost ... possible but I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in America which is you know what killing the ss as really essentially about\nAnd and a lot of people still want to look away at it they they don't want\nTo engage and um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive the most and arts elements in our society the press sympathizes with all of them\nThey sympathize with open borders they sympathize with legalized narcotics they sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes there's the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive causes so\n... that's a big difference we didn't have that what was left wing press we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's why we have now\nLet me let me ask you this um uh I beg to differ with you on the on the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties or some of them we don't have it we did we've never had it like that\nIt is but we we have had it in the in the past if if somebody stood up let's say as a you know some group with standing in the community\nUh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... for justice and non violence or whatever I um and they followed the king I'm a rules where you just never swing back\nAh that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties\nThe press played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody else\nWill take a cell phone video and throw it out there\nJust what happened is that an over the weekend is that in the group\nDoing that would have to hire security\nHave to hire people to protect them um you can do this it just takes\nIt takes leadership it takes organization but but on the press thing look let's let's segue into Saudi Arabia now because the press is actively trying to go you saw it on sixty minutes you solidly still try to do with\nTrump into basically dismissing Saudi Arabia alright well ... they want to not trade with them they want to crush\nThat nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad okay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad\nBut Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran and the middle east it's the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt it runs terrorism\nAnd destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading the charge so why on earth is the American laugh wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we outlawed ourself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that\nBlinds dot com ... rules and

partly cloudy this afternoon we may see a few showers bubble up early evening much cooler weather in the forecast tonight into tomorrow details and the WTO see what the rabbi meteorologist cutter Martin double duty KFC\nAnd high hard with yo station now Fox News radio covers the world\nMore than likely the full three years of the ISIS occupation in Mosul and they were done they wanted to leave they wanted to get out of there because at the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS\nYou know supplies and food and water we're becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so living behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolutely health for these people so they tried to break free and run away\nAnd so when these people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacred I think that day there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by ISIS\nHounded um ... the ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of society is that true [noise]\nWe we did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there um and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground\nYou know and and it it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that we were seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens\nAnd things like that and and the reason for that is because they they have no choice but to fight and die\nThey can't assimilate back into society they can't run away because you know they look like me are white guys read beard ... and they can't they can't get away so\nThose guys had to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care and so\nYeah so you went from that um to a saying I I've got to do I've got to keep doing this\nUm and that brought you to Burma mhm right yes\nAnd now you're working with an as Rene fun yes in Burma yes and last week talk you were the only one in Burma and you started telling us about what was really happening mhm and do you have an update\nFor us yes absolutely so ah\nAlso to clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from than as ...\nOr ... you were telling me that you were trying to organize a mattress people yes and you were going to bring them all\nTogether slowly and I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago and met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border\nAnd they they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to have the ... okay now this is a group of Christians\nYes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist looking out all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe 'em and they are all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning and at the end and it's it's it's really really good thing um\n[noise] and so I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in their eyes are done several trips but the ... fund in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to how this because\nWhen I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the um civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with the ...\nAnd then the the Burma Army moved all of those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people alive\nSo why why are they doing this why are they doing this to these\nTribes [noise] it's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic Berman to control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma they want to control all the high lines they want to control the entire region and so if you're a different ethnicity\nYou can ... they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject a surf class you have to basically serve the Berman and also\nThe for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so they're\nIt's a lot of that going on plus they don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just adds a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because we're the ... there's liberty right and these and so because of that the Burma Army attacked them even more tell me what you wrote me so I brought I brought with me several photos\nHave somebody I'm over ... their apologize I think okay so I brought with me [noise] several photos of of what I see all the time when I go to these places\n[noise]\nAnd these are I brought I brought with me photos [noise] sorry\nOf of one particular um attack that happened\nUm this is actually only from this is from two thousand ten writes it seems like a long time ago but this is these are the only photos that they were able to get out to me I was asking you had any photos of what's happening and what's going on and in these photos you see dead civilians you see\nKids dead a baby and these are not accidental collateral damage these or intentional executions of these people\nThese are some of these are it's that's a that's a ... that's a baby\nIntentionally and killed and that baby didn't die right away I'd survived for about twenty four hours and then died and this just looks like it's in the woods yeah they're out in the jungle and these people have nothing and the ... still wants to attack them and take more from them and so every time I go there every time\nThe ... shows up\nWe're stopping that from happening and I'll tell you I'll tell you a quick story back in back in may I was there and I can't I Can't divulge exactly what we were exactly the artist for security operations exactly what was happening\nSuffice it to say we save a lot of people's lives\nAnd a villager who had been pushed out of his home by the arm army him in his family have fled the army and they and they had built they built a a a new hot out in the ... out in the jungle in the middle of nowhere um\nHe he heard that the ... was there and he came and found me and said hey I Want to I Want to I Want to thank you please come to my house for dinner tonight so they gave me on a motorcycle and I drive at this man's house in the middle of nowhere\nWhen I get in there his wife is cooking pigs that for me to eat because that's the big fat and rice and ... and ... and so we're sitting there and he's like hey I I when I was like I Wish I had more to give you like this is all I have for a snack and he pulls out a bag and it's literally tree bark it's bark from a tree\nAnd he's like this is all we have a snack on while my wife prepares food and he gave me tree bark to eat and I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark with this guy and he has nothing is literally nothing and she wanted to give me ... because that was the best that he had and so I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark with this man\nAnd I I was I was so overcome was just like\nIn his gratitude is the level of gratitude he showed for us for that for the mouser infant being there it was it was unbelievable it was so touching and then later on as I was leaving as I was leaving the jungle\nAnother man barely speak any English um he's um I'm On a motorcycle and he's driving me out of the jungle and he ... he as he's driving he turns me he says thank you\nAnd I said oh like oh good English or what I'm trying to pin him and talk more about um [noise]\nUm I'm about ... what it used more English and so I was like oh like what what do you what are you grateful for what would you know yeah and he's like is that this is amazing he said thank you for giving my people hope [laughter]\nThat's what he says to me this kid who's maybe Nineteen years old\nThey know nothing but slaughter an aspirin these in these terrible things but we're there to bring help and we're there to bring help and it's it's an honor to be there was an honor to represent the ... it's an honor to do what I Do every time we go out\nWe save people's lives and it's it's it's an incredible thing that we keep things like like those photos that you're looking at you can't even show them we keep that you know what I'm saying ... happening born on\n\nIt doesn't become real to people until they see it and then you don't want to show it because it's it's awful it's awful it's horrifying mhm um\nI don't know what to do with them ah I think\nI think I'm not sure but I think we have them on the ... dot org if people want to go over there and see first hand like what's happening I Believe they're up there if they're not and make sure that they get on there today there were over\nThere yeah don't go for um you know if you if you ... I mean it's it it's their children and the baby and it's not pretty um but if you are if it will help you wake up to what's happening\nIf it will help you wake someone else up then I'm pleased go but we would sure we would sure appreciate your help 'em an answering phones has turned into this global thing that is just remarkable um\nAnd ah countries all around the world now know its name as\nA as a as as a beacon\nOf hope and indeed we are thrilled now that you're part of it\nHard to believe that [noise]\nThis stuff is going on today in the world that we're living in\nDid you see what to China said yesterday\nThat came out about the uh the Lakers and the concentration camps that they're ... I'm Sorry the the vocational schools they're building helps make life more colorful yeah that's what they actually said we're just trying to help make life more colorful they've got a million people\nAlready behind these gates razor wire fences they are concentration camps that's what they are um and you're scooped up off the street in in China and you're put behind these walls and you're re educated\nUh and uh it's frightening frightening what is happening and the world is not standing up and and more importantly just look up just looked up at CNN\nTrump says he's not to blame if GOP loses but who cares I mean CNN ... can you just get over it for ten seconds is there nothing else important going on in the world\nThey're not the only ones guilty of this but there is CNN in particular a treat like Donald Trump ... like almost the reverse of a teenager and a boy band it's like the obsession level is is incredibly high now they're looking at it as a negative instead of a positive\nBut like they just are obsessed with this person yeah I mean it's seemingly there ... all that matters are dominated by him yeah we all that matters the whole thing about living rent free inside someone else's head I mean is so on display with CNN right now they can't talk about anything else even when they're talking about other things\nSaudi Arabia Trump Saudi Arabia now Saudi Arabia he's in trouble you know draw does Trump have ties to Saudi Arabia he's talked about his ties to Saudi Arabia\nI think they caught somebody up alive alive they butchered him alive caught him up and put them in a suitcase and you're looking for a way an angle to get Trump what is wrong with you people as wrong with is like\nLegitimately like a sickness for some of them I thought if not only on CNN but I mean it is it as a network as a whole they can't\nFigure out a way to discuss any other topic is really incredible I mean he really doesn't dominate to their lives every aspect or at least is at least they're public life I don't know maybe they go home and don't talk about it I don't know but when they're on TV they're talking about it all the time it's like there's got to be something else interesting in the world there's got to be\nWell just looked at the headline at Fox they're talking about Elizabeth Warren and you know are Cherokee heritage\nReally\nAgain like all of the story they lived with Warren thing is is interesting 'cause she's gonna be running for president it's a day or two story um I think it's at this point I'm I'm done with it but it was interesting to see her I mean real flop here we're talking about what the all time political flops yes she's tried\nTo get ahead of this or again it is a ... it's an important political story for somebody who is going to run for president yeah\nBut really with Saudi Arabia [noise] going on right now with that and what that possibly means should we take a pause and we'll get some of the stock market anybody know why yeah anybody talk and all that why is it now hearing\nHis name was radio Ninety seven points and an end well ... ... am when you ...\nFox News I'm Chris foster the first lady Melania Trump's on her way back to Philadelphia to give a speech at a hospital the first plane she was on this morning had to turn back after ten minutes is a reporter\nOn board could see a thin Hayes a smoke and smell something burning that smell quickly became stronger one of the crewmembers told the reporter it was from a malfunctioning calms unit that had overheated but the White House has not confirmed that\nBox is John decker at the White House Canada is now the second country after Europe way with legal marijuana sales nationwide justice minister Jody Wilson ...\nWe introduce candidates act because we know that strict prohibition does not work under the previous approach it was easier for a teenager to gain access to a joint and a bottle of beer well as we said criminals reefs huge profits or at least\nA hundred eleven shops opening today and websites run by provinces or private businesses for mail order this is Fox News [noise]\nGlenn Beck on news radio Ninety seven point seven to twelve Ninety am when you see chaos [noise]\nWellness program so glad that you are here um we're going on tour here soon and we would love to see you grab your tickets now to Glenn Beck dot com tour were coming to a theater near you it's Richmond Hershey Pittsburgh Cleveland Kansas City\nUh Tulsa Tampa Orlando and other cities around you make sure that you grab your tickets or you can do to Glenn Beck dot com slash tour or we're going to see if you can spend\nAs much as a democratic socialist a game show that I don't think you can win no I\nThink we all those in the end and you know the sad part\nOf sometimes do Democrats can be very positive for Republicans sometimes democratic candidates are big win for Republicans really and we're seeing a case of this here it appears in Texas where Beto O'Rourke or Robert Francis or if you know as his parents wanted him to be known\n'em is going to get by as he used to call themselves going right when it was cool when it when it's beneficial to be called Bobby called himself Bob yeah now he calls himself at All right so Beto\nIs running here in Texas and if you don't have a new haven't seen that you haven't been watching any national media as far as not just politics I'm playing outside of that Ellen and coal bare hands free where CNN town hall coming up tonight just him\nUm again it's bizarre the reason why it's helpful for a Republican is\nBeto O'Rourke has drained the Democratic donor base\nOf thirty eight million dollars and going to have gone to close races ... you know it all seems like Cruz is a winning here and winning by significant margin though we don't we obviously we still have a few weeks ago we noticed could change but\nLA could produce the pictures of his father actually pulling the trigger on JFK and that may need to be actually may need that yeah well they might have and I never know they might\nUm they're talking now about a a fifty to forty three margin is the so seven point or sees me fifty two forty five is the\nIs the margin now with cruise leading by seven points this is from by the way the the same company that is hosting the town hall with Beto tonight CNN at their poll think to forty five\nI think he wins by twelve and maybe as high as Eighteen\nI mean that would be a real surprise or no it would be but you know that one yeah I mean is what really what happened last time Ted Cruz ran I mean the polls are are hard in Texas I I don't necessarily believe or believe the polls here in Texas\nYou know it'd be great if he won it would be one by three but I I just think that there is is something\nThat ah\nYou know when you get when you when you get right down to it Texans are going to say yeah I ... I tend to think he's going to\nWin as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think they think tens possible though I mean a nine or ten is definitely possible um interesting in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for ah governor here in Texas is winning by a much larger margin a usually is there I don't have the one in right in\nFront of me but it's it's over twenty points every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here just yeah I Know there's so much he's\nUp by age Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were Abbott is that by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results of the same poll is\nIt the same people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for a Greg Abbott that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um\nThe you'd think of it break bread country right in Texas ... however are the poll shows the fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance and only forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters words a forty nine forty eight\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas it this\nWay try this on for size\nOr a\nDonald Trump is everywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like Iraq Obama was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh it luckily not talking about today and I don't want to talk about the ...\nYou know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life\nTed Cruz was a very big picture or big big force in everybody's life two years ago but", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Savannah", "day": "17"}
