seven points out of that\n[noise]\nOh court appearance today the death penalty maybe later on Dave Anthony Fox News that's Robert Bowers future the accused gunman in Saturday's synagogue shooting spree\nThat's why the nation of Israel exist if people don't understand that is why no one ever wants them no one ever stands for them they're always the last in line and so\nThe world just cited let them have this scrap\nOf land they say was theirs because of the Bible let them have it it's uninhabitable it's it's just nothing but a desert there's no oil there's nothing there just give it to them\nAnd the Jews happily took it restored to their homeland as the only nation on earth to be wiped off the face of the map and then to be restored to two thousand years later exactly as for told\n\nIsraeli exists because no one seems to want them Israeli exists because they have a right to live\n[noise]\nSo let me go back to Russia and our musical friend\nIn Nineteen eighty nine forty years after the battle of Stalingrad the Hebrew immigrant aid society was helping Jews get out of the Soviet Union and go to Israel and to the United states and they provided lawyers money to find homes food even language classes to help them assimilate in their new country\nFor the first time ever\nGregory and the rest of the Jews that he had known that had survived both Hitler and Stalin couldn't concentrate on something more than just surviving\n\nThey had a right to pursue their happiness they could practice their faith they could be proud\nOf who they were they could finally live\n[noise] [noise]\nThe group that saved him the Hebrew immigrant aid society it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world let me say that again it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world\nIt was established in the Eighteen hundreds and they're responsible for assisting thousands and thousands of Jews\nAnd a few years ago they open up their services not just to Jews but people of all faiths all faiths that are persecuted\nThey need to be rescued\nTheir currency a CEO was asked recently why they decided to do it\nHis answer couldn't be more perfect\nWe no longer help refugees because they're Jewish we help refugees because we are Jewish\n\nReason why I'm telling you the story is this is the organization that I'm mad man went into Philadelphia to try to stop this is the organization that was attacked on Saturday morning at the tree of life synagogue\nStory never seems to end the eleven people were killed in the deadliest attack on Jews in our country's history\n\nStories like Gregory filled the synagogue that Saturday morning the\nHorrors that collectively endured unimaginable to most people and yet here we are\nAgain the group of people\nWho now have to concentrate just on one thing\nSurvive\nAnti Semitism is evil anti Semitism is a disease\nAnti Semitism is as old as the world\nFrom the moment gods said I Will make you my people there has been anti Semitism and it is on the rise as it always is in times of nationalism and socialism\nTime the Jew is the canary in the coal mine they are always the first and if the world doesn't pay attention at that point it's washed in blood\n\nIf the world decides they need to come for the Jews I proudly declare myself a Jew\n\nThe world makes promises all the time and they don't ever intend on keeping them\nBut I Do\nWe said never forget\nI told you you are the audience that will envy and restore the republic save the republic and it's not going to be through violence the world is going to become more and more violent\n\nWe must be a unique and peculiar people because the vast majority of Americans know this is not who we are\n\nThis is not who we want to be\n\nAnd we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish brothers and sisters\n\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with her Christian Brothers and sisters in the middle east we will stand shoulder to shoulder with a Muslim that is being rounded up by the Chinese\n\nThe cycle of hate\n\nHas been gone again and it's not Donald Trump and it's not for rock Obama\n\nIt's a cycle that has been running since the beginning of time and the world always acts the same way because it always comes in a time of chaos it always comes in a time of fear it always comes\nIn a we cycle when the forget the individual it's what's best for all of society if why our founders\nCame here in the first place it's why our founders defended the Jews\n\nWe're a different country where a different people we're not better than the rest of\nThe world we just see things differently and if we don't shame on us\n\nOur pilgrims came here thinking that they were completing the journey from the red sea\nOur first great seal of the United states was the pillar of fire and pharaohs horses and the party of the red sea\n\nI don't want to just survive I don't want to do something to earn a living I Want to live\nFDR said this generation has a rendezvous with destiny I echo those words\n\nOur generation must be the generation that breaks the cycle there is no one else in the world who will do it who will stand against this onslaught who will stand against their hatred in the nationalism and the and the the collective wisdom\nThe extermination of people that just aren't good enough we are headed that way we are headed that way once you cannot talk to your neighbors once the other side has nothing to offer\nYou have to eliminate them because they're the devil\nThey're the devil and you cannot deal with the devil\n\n\nWill the sixty to eighty percent of this country stand up\nThey never ever have never ever have it was twenty percent twenty percent for the American revolution\nBox is David ... in Pittsburgh the man accused of sending explosives to critics of President Trump appears in federal court in ...\nIn each day saves are say access fifty six year old accused ... will make an initial appearance in court today it's not expected to last long probably just about Fifteen minutes the judge will ask him if he has an attorney and they will discuss the charges he's not expected to make up ... at this point in court he'll likely be shackled by the arms by the legs\nAnd by the way the thoughts of Steve Harrison in Miami this is Fox News [noise]\nThat Glenn Beck on racial Kevin Kevin White dining am [noise]\nWe welcome to the program Mr a path gray a hello pat how are you hello Glenn comes\nGood that was a good how's your weekend a it was a it was not great ... why why why not\nIt was a you know a bad football games uh experiences everywhere I went\nAh what do you what do you experience everywhere you you're not having a hard time talking out and speaking\nTrue you know that would cause the easiest thing in the world right now sure sure it is sure it is this uh this weekend a I had to really I really\nHad a difficult time I mean I just did you guys watching the news all this week you\nKnow as little as possible I write a little bit because of the shooting because it's like I get the updates but yeah\nYeah so only to get the updates and stuff I I don't know who's watching cable news anymore\nYeah I I never watch cable news never mind the highlights I get the clips but I don't I don't actually sit there and watch Fox\nNews or CNN heaven forbid and MSNBC or CNN\nJet why don't you don't want to lose I don't know who's doing that and they do I really don't know who's your\nFans watch Fox you know 'cause uh it's a safe haven mostly unless you're watching Shepard Smith\nUh [laughter] but that's always been that way but I don't know I'm just\nCNN I don't know who does cause that's\nIt's an ... it's the people who hate Trump right yeah I guess the only reason I ever turn any of that stuff on it sort of the show you know because we're supposed to be aware of it right and do you do that occasionally but I certainly I\nIf I was not in this business I don't know why I Would bother with any of that oh I wouldn't I Would listen to him talk about early do now a synagogue thing is he's oh literally it how many questions ... comedy questions that is until they can get to a question about why Trump's ... Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of very slowly but surely but he's like you know did he he didn't go there to help with today is the first question was ah you know but what about that what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I live in a country\nAs a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning center in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt some anti Semitism my entire life\nHe yeah he he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah this is a terrible tragedy then they're like well\n... ... what part of of that do you think is is the the climate of today and and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear that this shooter\nA outwardly hated Donald Trump\nYeah we did not like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or has nothing to do that don't tie him to it yet but he's got more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall are just courses pretty terrible at the moment but it has nothing to do with this and all\nThese cable news networks are ... that were telling you that it does mhm they're obsessed with telling your wife well\nWe don't want us to blame it on a Donald Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nRight [laughter] that's really is really that's what they're doing never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever that guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot\nAll of the geo ... and another guy and tried to tried to bring to kill thirty Republican heat that's tenth of the Republican was working\nFor Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault no we never said that and neither did I say and either do today yes of course not they didn't even talk about\nIt because they had a very balanced view of that one re understood that individuals who are responsible for their own actions that time that's right he understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them in and they always complain about this course isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes\nWe can sit there and both of these things right when if a Republican and now the python think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt\n'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie Sanders situation\nBut both situations we said the individual is responsible the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individuals shootings and I'm going to do with it and you do not you ... discourse does not commit murder doesn't happen so\nThe reason why Rob ... pad in this morning is because uh you know he he sees doing more on trivia and uh and pour a trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a bet\nYeah it's it you know it's a chance to get away from the discourse for a little higher like an hour a week as and just be mean to yeah and just be mean to\nAnd don't you dare apologize for that\nSo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know on that one I'm never going to end on that one\nFact repeated it consistently gets repeated and it was fabulous and again it was you know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nThank you thank you so are you coming to the show in a Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's Hyundai becoming\nNo we're going to be out of town is going to be out of town really 'cause I got a free tickets but seriously oh now all of a sudden you're interested can change I I ... you change your plans I've got free tickets for if you want if you'd like them\nAre you serious I Am serious goes my ... that\nThat would I change my plans okay All right All right good thanks Suzie we'll see you or what\nIs the Sunday uh ...

Shapiro before is that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like what Ben Shapiro said they will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal\nAnd they don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people can you really not understand I mean we all know cannot do it and I it's not all understand that they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives they're anti Semite\nWe you're telling me the way the uh you know Sheldon Adelson right here's a guy who is one of the biggest financier the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic ... it does not it does not you can criticize just like\nWhen they criticize Clarence Thomas or they rape\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas this legal opinions because they don't support what they believe\nIt's not about it it is trying to make these into cartoon arguments ... is such a\nA ... ... again this is another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're calling everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they\nSay it anyway 'cause they don't care [noise]\nThat that that is exactly what they they they claim to be again and they do it every day wow I didn't hear solution there too [noise]\nYeah go to a battering I don't know what I advocate for ah we're we're going to talk about one when we come back\nLife back get more on Sunday from ten to one on news radio twelve Ninety and Ninety seven point seven W T.

violence\nNow this one should terrify you\nBecause fifty seven percent now say they want a third party they want unity that number is even higher\nBut I'm not sure people actually mean this\nI'm not sure what unity even means they say that we no longer really uh agree\nOn the core values of our country which I think is actually true we don't agree on core values but what are those core values\nAnybody know what\nAre the values that brought up what are the things that were actually arguing about now\nWay things are going in the United states twenty five percent are satisfied fifty eight percent dissatisfied the state of politics nine percent satisfied Seventy seven percent dissatisfied Thirteen percent or like a ...\nPercentage that say Americans are United in agreement about the most important values Fifteen Percent\nFifteen Percent of us they were United on the most important values my question is\nWhat are those values\nSincerely what\nAre we fighting for our we are we fighting for lower taxes\nHere's what the the here's what the surveys the shows where we divide on our quote the most important values\nPolitics in this country it's politics of value um moral ethics in our country\nIs that a value\nRace relations gap between rich and poor the state of the news media the way things are going in the U.S the environment the way things are going in your state\nRights for algae beat the status of religion homeland security\nWith an exception of a couple of those aren't values those are issues that is a political campaign and perhaps that's what we're missing\nSee I I firmly believe and I I I wrote this in the book addicted outrage\nWe have a few things we have to decide we have to decide one is the western World War it's saving his freedom as our founders saw it is it worth saving yes or no and I don't want you just uh\nYou know jump bobbing yeah absolutely why why why is it worth saving who can articulate this why is it worth saving how has it changed the world in specifics\nWho can make that case among us who's making that case of their kids at dinner at night in specifics\n\nIs America a good place or a bad place we have to decide because half of the country says it's a great place half of the country says and I don't even know if these numbers are accurate and half I doubt they are have but let's just say half the country says it's a bad place half the country says it's a good place\nWhich are way sincerely which are we we have to choose deli\nBecause it's a binary choice isn't it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have\nTo choose one no no you don't it's not a binary choice the answers were both\nWe're both we've been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hail is paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions\nWhat are we gonna do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them have you heard anyone actually make the case for America and\nNot just in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important\nWhy is the constitution worth fighting for because if we don't know let's just get on with it\nMan let's just move on I I'm I\nWe cannot sit here and argue about our greatest issues of our time we don't have our basic living rooms I Want to make sure I have this right our our\nBasic essential values in line like climate change\n\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each other and how do we treat the earth okay that's a value\nThat's on climate change\nClimate change comes off of that value in principle\n\nClimate change is okay is there a problem is there a problem well I'm Sorry but the science is not settled\n\nThe climate is constantly changing it always has it's why we we had the ice age ... where were the SUVs for the ice age\nIt always changes now can we do things that can affect the climate I don't know some people say we can some people say we can't\nThe evidence is spotty at best and you can't trust the evidence that is there because we have too much evidence of collusion in ... in the scientific field\nYou give me clean cut studies okay\n\nBut that's not even what we're arguing about were arguing about what to do about it see they keep making a about you know whether it's happening or not I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt I'm willing to say okay it's happening All right it's happening what do you want to do about it\n\nWell the solutions are insane the solutions don't work now that is a political discussion that is a political discussion you\nKnow where our values come in on that particular discussion when someone says the sciences settled is shut up that's a violation of our values\nWhen people sit down at the table and say look I care about the environment I really do I disagree with the science and here the people on my side that are showing you that this is co workers in this this collusion\nThat yours yours system that you're you're you're you're you're touting is nothing more than a political system\nIt doesn't work\n\nThat's a political discussion those are the things we should have what brings us together at the end or the values\nWe both care about the earth who doesn't care about the earth sincerely who doesn't care about the earth\nAnd I'm tired of being lectured by people who will go and protest and leave us see of garbage behind them for others to keep and clean up\nI'm sick of it don't tell me you care about the environment and then after a protest everything is not about later\nYou either care about it or you don't words don't mean anything anymore only\nActions do don't tell me what you believe show me what you believe\nGland that [noise]\nBad country or a good country that's that's the question we have to ask though [noise]\nIt is the western way of life we're saving is it good is it nothing but a bunch of ... gender males white males white Europeans that of oppressed people\nIs that is that all is that all it is\nCan I ask you do when do you think World War two officially started when did it really start start so not our involvement\nIn yeah not our involvement a God I mean the date I'm

much to talk about um we've got to talk about Twitter and what they're doing now 'cause it it brings it brings the point that I was just making\nHome about what our values and what are the problems that we're trying to solve their different\nPeople are now saying that you know the problem is is that Americans don't agree on basic values and principles anymore well I agree with that but nobody is talking about those when's the last time you heard anyone really talking about values or principles in the mainstream media\nTell me last time you heard that talked about on Fox for an CNN or MSNBC tell me\n\nDefending basic principles what are those principles well American principles we used to find self evident that all men are created equal so you want to talk about the ah the the shooting\nIn I'm In er\nPittsburgh great\nThat guy has violated American principles all men are created equal an endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights one of those rights is

don't like what the media is saying but they have a right to say it\nSo do you target them for death not if you want to talk about principles everything\nElse is about politics now we could talk about his mental health and that would be something else that would be a very valid target the topic we gotta talk about mental mental health in America Americans are feeling more and more alone more and more isolated communication is going through the roof\nBut none of those are principles\n\nDo we take care of one another well that's the golden rule isn't it\nThat's the golden rule\nSee we we just assume that and we were awake for a while and I I'm not sure if we are as wake as we think we are now\nWe woke up and we we really um we really learned a I think under Barack Obama but now many of us

thing\nSo I kinda grew up but I Know students to with that a check engine light oh yeah and even before the check engine light a you know we I Would watch the uh the heat and you know break off\nThe

that was first [noise]\nIt's the perfect holiday is underway afternoon I damage or speaking and they made the upper seventies many community a few folks here in Haiti but dry at keeping it feeling pretty comfortable plenty of sunshiny today's for gas get the details on the news this afternoon I mean you just cut her Martin\nWTC KFC\nAnd high hard with yo station now Fox News radio covers the world\nOn news radio that seven points out an eleven o'clock [noise]\n\nYet another suspicious package I'm Dave Anthony Fox News intercepted this morning in Atlanta address the CNN\nForce them to go early to get all the activists out and they can have them go and you know go pass out you know go take down Ted Cruz signs or whatever the heck they're they're they're a volunteers are doing on that particular day but it's very interesting way of looking at this we talk a lot about a district that have changed\nFrom Obama to Trump the people who voted for Obama and then changed to Trump\nAnd there's the other side of that is people who voted for Romney and changed Clinton and there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a let's see if it's Thirteen districts that voted for Mitt Romney and two thousand twelve and then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand six team\nSo two thousand twelve on average ... according to five thirty eight had about an eight point advantage for Romney\nIn two thousand sixteen it was a five point advantage for Democrats\nSo what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling as of right now\nAre we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in those states\nSo if you look at it kind of ... to summarize those kind of lost three points are well well the three point Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six to ... less passionate into two dozen sixteen\nBut a big big move from two thousand twelve got it so they're kind of in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand correcting now they were Twenty one districts that voted for Barack Obama\nAnd then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one or so in two thousand twelve with Rocco bomb on they had about a six point advantage for Democrats for Obama\nOr in two thousand sixteen that's swung from all the way back to seven points Republican for Donald Trump so it's a huge swing there\nIs that you would think of these real swing districts so far polling you're showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half points that's big the big change so and that was that's almost equal to where they were voting roam around ...\nSo if you look at that the people who were voted for a bomb and then switched to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for Brock Obama\nWith Romney or the people who voted for Romney then went to Clinton they're in between those two positions but leaning towards Clinton [noise]\nThat's where these districts show up there is also five states where this is a where this occurred\nFive state of Florida Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin where they voted for bronco Obama than change to Trump\nIn the Obama election that had about five point advantage for Obama and those states in the Trump election there was about a to point advantage for Trump\nRight now those states are showing eight twelve point advantage for Democrats show now that part of that it's it's a little bit different than what you would say in the house where they're broken up into little areas and there's so many candidates and their up all the time\nWe're this is some of these races are just there's popular Democrats already Pennsylvania is a good example of that where they have just a big lead or not because\nDon't think it's necessarily solely because of some switch like soldiers how to tell me about all\nThis means from last week or the Democrats making is is the momentum start just starting to swing back towards the Democrat\nI Would say it doesn't tell you much about the Senate but it's I think it does tell you something about the house which is\nThere was that I Hope that there'll be some movement in the house towards Republicans these numbers are showing that I mean right now it seems like the Democrats will take the house and the Republicans look pretty solid in the Senate right now when will we see any movement at all of due to the shooting in the bombing\nWell the polling wouldn't even start probably if you weren't real polling reaction that at least till today we have three I mean you're probably not till later this week Thursday or friday the early okay I Will look for\nLecture\nOn the Glenn Beck program [noise]\nThis weekend as you know a gunman opened fire at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh he shot and killed eleven people during Sabbath services injured and six others for where police officers\nThe guy was insane hated Donald Trump that doesn't make him a Democrat\nDoesn't mean that he was you know following I dunno Cory Booker whoever it just means this is not political\nAnd should it be I Would keep jumping to politics first I Can't imagine what these families are going through\n\nPennsylvania has taught us before with the Amish how to deal with killers\n\n[noise] if you've been listening to me um for a long time you know what I Believe is coming and have said is coming for a while and I'm always wrong with timing but I don't think there's any\nWay to deny that what I've worn was coming is here now we're seeing the beginnings of it now\n\nAnd it's only going to get worse and it's going to get harder it's going to get harder for you to stand up\nHave they taken gab down yet I think the\n... the service provider for them has taken them down um I don't know if they're back up as not gaps fault gap is that it's like kind of a\nTwitter a competitor I guess I Would say that they found up are becoming a safe haven for anti Semite so I guess I'm ...\nAnd you know I don't want that nobody wants that but we either believe in freedom or we don't and yes I don't I don't like the poison that they put out\n\nBut I also don't like the silencing of voices this America man this is American principles you can't silent voices\n\nSky was deeply disturbed really bad guy\n\nYou know you watch TV and you see the victims the\nFaces curling across the TV screens\n\nAnd you might think that things are getting worse\n\nAnd I guess historically speaking this is the worst anti Semitic shooting we've ever had in the history of our country eleven people\nOn the positive side that's nothing compared to some countries\n\nI saw some reporters say you know the problem is is a this is Donald Trump I Hope you I Hope you're happy that do you have your uh your synagogue\nOr I'm Sorry your ah your embassy in Jerusalem\nReally really that's where you're going really this was caused by moving the embassy to Jerusalem oh my gosh\n[noise] wow\n\nYeah Jews were killed in Israel like terrorists last year a hundred and twenty two hundred and twenty two was that Donald Trump's fall too or is that just the evil juice full how many of France\n\nFrance they're moving out at a record number because they know they've seen this movie before\n\nSo tired of the west to being to blame for everything that there's nobody worse than us I'm so tired I was tired in two thousand eight when the president at the time was saying you know\nWe're not going to allow people to around up Muslims in the middle of night\nWe've never done that we've never done that stop it\nYou know who he is China\nOne million Muslims are now in a concentration camp in China rounded up why because they're Muslim that's it\nWears everybody on that one\nIs that because there is no white man evolved is that what it is where is everybody on that one\nMarriage so bad look at all the hatred in the racism and slavery\nSlavery still going on in Africa slavery is going on in the middle east\nSlavery is happening in China it's happening in Brazil it's happening in in Haiti it's happening in Mexico\nWhere are you on that one\nSo tired of playing this game\nWhen it comes to the Jewish people\n\nI obviously don't speak for everybody but I I Do speak for my audience on this one\nYou're not alone there were millions of Christians\n\nWho love you who respect you who are grateful grateful for the preservation of the Torah\nIn the hands of everyone from the home improvement weekend more for\nThe frozen leads to they can rely on day in and day out you can be

to hear you struggling this morning going maybe I can give you and some of the long time listeners some advice\nOkay I'm not really well [laughter]\nI like I've been a subscriber to this network ... TV we hearing voice when you're struggling a bit more than ... than usual okay [laughter]\nMy my my advice is may get tangible because there's so many of us that tune in every day and and listening to this broadcast but then we don't make a tangible and even you were saying that you haven't been doing it shows you haven't been out of the road for a while I think that's going to be so good for you because you need to connect with the people yes I agree\nMy friend and I generally of I had a a friend of mine that says Vietnam veterans in his seventies and we went all the way that we live in Ashland, Kentucky we got up at two AM stroke six hours to Illinois for it that the Trump rally this weekend on Saturday now\nAnd and then stood for eleven hours straight because we we were told the first two thousand people in line would get into the hangar\nAnd we knew we were going to get that way and and as we got through security I'm looking at George saying oh I Can't wait to sit down and you get to the hangar there were no states so there's a reality of we're going to be standing another six hours on concrete\nSo ... is this president is a lawyer [laughter] I'm Sorry I just play just playing for a second [laughter] go ahead tell us or\nI could say it as much as they want you know what we were standing in line making fun of the Carbondale a solidarity network which was a socialist group\nThat was coming to protest they had to have their eleven AM pancake breakfast before they came to protest and you know we ... we were joking well do you think there were a vegan and gluten free options to go along with that and the right but\nThere were overturned a thousand people there for the rally and less than Seventy five people showed up to protest\nThere was not a piece of heard you say this about your ... function as when you've had the restoring functions\nThere was no garbage we would never know when I was ten thousand people there you know one was complaining I was kind of had to warm up to Trump myself and I was in simulated to go to one of these things because I was afraid if I said one negative thing I was going to be completely shouted down\nNow people were so open about talking and\nYou know someone had to go to the bathroom ... their child stayed with us I mean you're in a group of ten thousand people you trust strangers to watch your child ... well you you run and do an errand a comeback real quick it was it was such a positive environment and you know it's like a president just happened to show up\nAt and I'm so glad he's actually going to be in Huntington on friday which has five miles away from where I live I'm so glad I went to Illinois because\nI remember standing in line and seeing the the headline break about the shooting mhm and wait we also went through the doubt of whether the president was going to show up or not\nAnd this is after we got in the hangar lead Lynn standing there for two hours but we never gave up hope and we were we we all ... we had jokes of you know conservatives the one thing liberals can do better than us is chance we can't can't it's like when you classes or something\nI Know we saw it and I'm really glad we suck [laughter]\nBut you know it's it was such a positive environment and our legs were or just killing us by the time that he got there\nAnd George not drove back that night it was at twenty eight our road trip that we took for the experience\nAnd as exhausted as we were in as much as we were a gang George looks at me and says he's doing one in Missouri later this week as an how far is that well that one that what it was just six hours Missouri was going to be eight but we were going to go and so we found out that this one was going to happen right across the river on friday\nSo fight like it tangible and that's the best I can say is go and meet the other people\nTend to Seventy five\n... ... were very quiet people but when you do cut to this rally and there there was just an energy that was there that you realized we can be\nThere's hope for society yeah granted I got up and went to Walmart the next morning and people are cutting you off to get to the best parking spot you know like well yeah on how\nAlison hang on to the second I Want to get your copy of my book I I signed it I'll send it out to you thank you so much for holding him thanks for I'm I'm sharing that\nIs that that is but maybe if I don't I struggling today\nDo feel like I'm struggling today 'cause I don't feel like I'm struggling to them I'm a little frustrated at ... it'd be nation I Would say yeah to and I will I'm frustrated that we concentrate on all the wrong things and I think that's kind of what you're saying here um let's see these aren't the things we should be concentrating on you know the the the president\nI'm being an anti Semite chief his daughter is Jewish\nOr you know how many Klan members are cool with that I I don't think any relatively few", "year": "2018",
