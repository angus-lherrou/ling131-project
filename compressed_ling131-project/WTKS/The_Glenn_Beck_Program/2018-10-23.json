the officers do\nDo they try to fight them off does the does the criminal justice system sending more troops and tried to fight those people from storming the gates and opening up our prisons well we wouldn't want that to I mean it some people could\nGet hurt what do you what are we talking about\nWell if they're Seventy five hundred people and they want to go into a small town and Rob every single restaurant truck stop bank because there's Seventy five hundred of them and there's not enough police in these small towns where we just going to let them take all of the money\nOr do we say no this is a mob\nThis is a a group of Seventy five hundred people who are stating they are going to break the law\nAnd they've already done it and they're just crossing in an overwhelming we did we would never let anybody do that to any other thing why would we allow them into our country\nWe wouldn't let them into our towns just to\nJust to take over our towns we would we would never allow this to happen can you imagine I mean you seem just the waste and the garbage left behind you know it's amazing they are just crashing everything along the way\nWhat are we just supposed to put up with that too you just come into our town and just ... and then we have to clean up the mess after you\nAnd the question not being asked enough is [noise] why are they are so many young men no no no no no those already for\nYour own or no no no no those are just women young women and children that are ... forced to look\nLike in like ... year old men yes yeah who should be defending their own country yeah who should be making their neighborhoods better who should be fighting for their own country\nHave you noticed how have you noticed how the media is just calling these guys migrants\nYeah and knocked Marxist protestors because that's what this is this is a Marxist protest their their Marxist government which was in bed with the Castros in Cuba and manure oh in Venezuela they were ousted in a coup because they were destroying the country they were ousted\nJust as ... has done in Venezuela correct same thing\nSo they were ousted what happened\nThey get pissed off they start coordinating with the door Owen Castro and the ousted president they have been disrupting their own country now they want\nPublicity they want this to be a world stage and so they started coming up towards America They're not looking for a jobs they're not looking for a better life this started\nAs three thousand people who wanted to make a Marxist point to embarrass their own country because they got rid of a Marxist dictator\nWe're just going to we're fine with that we're just fight with these people coming in really what will they do if they did get jobs and decide to live here what kind of what kind of philosophies are they bringing with them\nAll the media doesn't care about any of that and do the Democrats don't care about any of that of course not hear about because they ... they just want them here as voters\nAlready they're sending out to all these registration forms in Texas the Democrats\nAre in Texas of set out but voter registration forms to illegals all over the state inviting them they've already filled out the the uh citizenship box pushed yet they check the S. and sent this out to non residents all over the uh all over the state\nThere's we had like governor is to increase their power base we have the governor of the state coming on and just a minute we have Greg Abbott coming out in about ten minutes\nOr we're gonna talk a little bit about the uh the massive rally for Ted Cruz and Donald Trump ah yesterday in Houston it was unbelievable and the massive turnout but this is in Harris County which is Houston Dallas County which has Dallas those are blue areas\nAnd it's a massive turnout massive\nTurnout uh if the the red parts of the state don't actually turned out this state could be in big trouble because it is a massive\nTurnout is there any thought or with the caravan of just learning from our friends to the south\nAnd what we do is we just let people come in and we just kinda guide them until they get all the way to Canada and they're walking north would they'd never that necessarily they're stopping here a candidate beautiful this kind of your time of year we didn't kinda it's kind of walk on the side of the streets and just kind of having them\nAnd we would if this was going to Canada\nAnd they were protesting Canada I think that would be a lot of people have said just don't cause any Trump just let him go to Canada I'm sure a lot of people in Mexico are saying that just right just what was not our problem they just want to go to America just not a problem\nWell it is your problem and if ... if Canada would say to us you stop this or we're not going to trade with you we zero eight though like they give us any aid\nZero zero cheese whatever it is we're not giving you any of that\nThe way you in a speech at the ... people came to the confidence in the hours before I shoved against a pad and disabled surveillance cameras staff had been given the day off and at the Kennedy used a buddy double whammy to shove jeeze play at the ...\nThe United nations estimates a caravan of Central Americans walking through Mexico toward the United states has about Seventy two hundred people\nTrying to think calling the caravan and saw that in our country telling a rally in Houston last night\nCaravan you have some very bad\nI Can't and it's believed to be about ... miles away from the southern border in boxes Rachel Sutherland is it Fox News [noise]\nProfessional drivers should be held to a higher standard because what they're doing is inherently dangerous if you've been hurt you deserve a higher caliber of lawyer the does your law from nine one to some ... ... ... ... excellent since Nineteen sixty six capsule Glenn Beck on he was\nWe're thrilled to have a the a great governor from the great state of Texas Governor Greg Abbott on with us now hello governor how are you sir\nReally and I am doing terrific how's it going good\nIt's always good to talk to you I'm ... I I Want to talk to you about a couple of things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive turnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas uh ... what does this or what does this tell you and how's the turnout the rally around the rest of the state\nWell this may be frustrating because the true answer is it's too early to tell right here's what we don't know and and that is is this a front running of what the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote for your listeners what we're sitting with regard to the turnout is a ... records are not just for mid term elections which is what the stairs or but in many of these locations are the first day of voting exceeds\nThe amount of votes that took place in the presidential election on the very first day and so all we know is this and that is a massive\nNumber of people are turning out to vote with another was park but do mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan that's coming up here and we want to make sure we're supposed to be critical to do something to stop it but here's all I can tell your audience and that is\nIf you care about the future of Texas it would be clear about the future of America or you could not\nSit on the sidelines this election here because there are other people out there who are casting those who might be hostile to you and your values your values must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this me to make sure you go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo a governor and a lot of times people have said this is the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I always hated that praise\nBut in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say you know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing a ... a election is it not\nWhile he captured the as soon as very correctly because it used to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats are either ran under no label or they would call themselves a conservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and then they were progressive and now they're openly or lifting themselves as\nSocialist and and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor\nIn Florida a is an out and now he says he is a socialist and end the Bernie Sanders style of socialism if not even further to the left in the same thing is happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas or some people may not be\nCalling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as\nThe open quarter policies that is socialism or with a look at the uh wealth distribution policy that is socialism handle these people don't realize and that is socialism is real out there that we see it in Venezuela where they reported inflation rate and Venezuela is over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nI don't I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue there's ... there's only a few counties that are really a a lynchpin here and ah the you know unbeknownst to most people is Soros has dumped\nMillions of dollars into this state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing in so many of your listeners need to understand this is George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles are two years ago he gave a ... million dollars or directly to candidates\nIn Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that ... has funded these ground games to get out the vote and so he is trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for is like that so uh but let's go back to the first part of your questions and listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really\nBlew cities and blue counties you have a Dallas year after year and you have certain attorney do you have all that and you have to El Paso and so you have these massive regions across the state of Texas that makes it\nSo much harder for people who are conservative people are who are Republican to be able to cobble together the boats that are needed to make sure that we keep Texas the fashion of freedom the patch and the liberty or in the past year the conservatives and also\nHe's

I think you should always host these things you are innocent until proven yet either Simon charges against Cory Booker one person making\nYou know and then there's people making these things about every poll everyone up which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man made an editor ... well we don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations correct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them right um so you know\nThat's the way I think you're supposed to hey let's why innocent until proven guilty it's a thing\nA and I think with not only are Cory Booker but also also Keith Ellison I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism about some of these relationships break up and there's things that and who knows\nThere's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing what were they were talking about with capital and everyone you know half the country believed cabinet should be you know I don't put in prison for what happened so what's interesting here is the Democratic party\nHas completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to keep up with the they don't care about it he thousand can do it every once they've completely ignored these allegations\n... it was fascinating at the people of Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happens latest poll came out he now trails forty three to thirty six he's now down by seven points soda wow this is a powerful Democrat one of the top people from the DNC a very well\nOwn is on TV all the time\nAnd he's she's credible she's a Democrat she doesn't have an axe to grind Jimmy dated him for a very long time there's video there's witnesses there's Dr reports at the time\nUh and she again is a very reluctant witness who doesn't want to hurt to the Democratic party light she'd rather have Allison out another Democrat when she doesn't right if I wanted to win for I mean it's just crazy yeah it's\nAn amazing months about one forty three thirty six is a surprise I mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they felt they had Alison running for that post they thought they had that wrapped up a instead is forty three thirty six so right now do we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go ah there's a if you're looking at\nA right now a forty four seats are that are\nSafe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have to it's forty six excuse me forty effect if you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you can get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races that includes a Tennessee which is\nA bill very close to poll came out yesterday that had the Democrat up by one point though the overall it looks like a Republican is still a head they're a vibrant and then in Texas still leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer but then you get a few of a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got a another six races that are toss ups that's going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can do three of six they're going to be fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they if they can pull off fix them six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things past ah so\nYou know at that level of whether it's ah I mean they could lose it to that could easily still losing impossible\nBut that level of between fifty and fifty six is is kind of what we're talking about now and that you know that is a a big difference uh still could be a major thing especially if you can hold on to the house which looks a little bit better than it did a couple of weeks ago but it's still on the unlikely side\n[noise] election by numbers\nOn the way he was a pro Herbert twenty third that is that going back program\nAll right when I take a break and we'll tell you about our spots and come back and I'm going to tell you about\nI mean there's a real problem and you haven't even yeah\nMany considered it to really know well you know that which is er out but he ... saw Donald Trump you know and which is our\nI'd ... did not know that you haven't been keeping track of all the ... the the which is that are putting X's on Donald Trump and and Ted Cruz and others are and what are they what are the\nTexas board of the ... actually intended to accomplish destroy them to destroy them yeah I have not seen this no oh okay well I've I've kind of brushed off myself I'm In I'm up on it but I kind of brushed it off I'm like I which is\nNo there is something else that we now have from a credible source that I think every American especially women need to be aware of what's coming up in just a second\nYou happen to see\nStories a\nA\nIMF financial warnings and the escalation in the central bank gold buying in Hungary\nIs making the news ...\nHungary has increased its gold reserves by one thousand percent\nIn a due to increasing quote safety concerns this is the first time since Nineteen eighty six that Hungary's central bank is buying gold bullion and it's a lot of it up thirty one point five tons\nOf gold ah they also have repatriated their gold from the bank of England to Budapest central banks in Europe are diversifying are moving in and repatriating to take possession of the gold and their own country\n... maybe talking about that for a while really ... who knows that\nAre hungry in Poland or the most recent central banks to do this but Austria the Netherlands and the Germans were the first to do it uh they had been repatriating their gold from the bank of England and the Federal Reserve in recent months and years\nJust bought it from gold one for that a lot easier right why us for it back when it doesn't really the reason why repatriation of gold is dangerous is because of a word and write this down on no matter who do the very high path occasion thing again are you I'm just saying that brought it up\nWhen you hear it your blood will run cold when you hear people actually talking about\nWell the problem is re high publication that's when you had to the mountains [laughter] that's when you know so that's the only reason why I bring this word up when you read about it in a serious way that they are now starting to discuss ... that's when you run for the hills

... about school shootings when they go on and what exactly is that cause\nUh for them so I mean I I like him is Thirteen the real issue I mean and this goes to a deeper part of this which is\nYou

not\nOn our borders 'cause you know what that is that's the Palestinian people yeah but we don't we don't know I mean I think the point of doing that it's not anger us right so you would think that

of Drudge Report it is for conservative video content\nUm that's out there that's being pushed to the side and and hidden by these that company\nWhat platform you're keeping it all on what do you what do you mean you're going to Google Play I mean you're going going right into the hands of the beast or what are you doing to ensure that they they aren't um screwing with you and gathering information on on everybody else\nWell what we're trying to do is I've heard a lot of people on our side say we need a conservative Facebook or we need a conservative Twitter yeah so what we're trying to do is find a realistic work around to the algorithm problem that's going on with some conservative content so we said\nYou know we can find all these great conservative publishers and say hey here's what we want to do we can all benefit from this by sharing content into one place on the video side everyone can benefit\nUm so yeah we will be at the mercy of Google Play and the apple store but I think this is a sort of the first step to be able to counter\nThat suppression from YouTube and Facebook so who do you have on board so far so we have a conservative review we've talked a bright bar we had a great meeting with Prager you last week they're on board and obviously the blaze I Hope you guys come aboard as well\nAs the first time hearing of it but I Can't imagine we're not\nSo and what we're really doing is you know we're pulling the content from your Facebook page and from your YouTube so\nAh the blaze channel benefits because the view ... to you guys\nAnd the other thing that we wanted to do I'm In this where we're already starting to be introduced to other people so we have these great young conservative filmmakers who put out an amazing video content and no one sees it on YouTube or Facebook and so we said hey will be the platform for that you go out and produce it and then we'll work with our team in our network to make sure that\nUm you know half the country that wants to see this content can actually see your content\nYou think because I've done a lot of thinking on this uh first of all congratulations thanks um\nUh it is um [noise]\nUh this is something that I have wanted to do for about eight years and I think conservatives are just now starting to say hey wait a minute what was that idea about coming together\nUm because they're starting to see the writing on the wall or in many different directions or so congratulations on doing that I fully support anybody who is trying to bring everybody together and protecting voices\nWhat do you say I'm to the objection that I have in my mind when people say we need a conservative Facebook\nNo we don't because that just puts us in another bubble right you know what I mean we need to be able if if it's known as a conservative thing only conservatives are going to go there\nSo how have you wrestled with that in your mind\nSo I think the first kick off for that was the Facebook documentary series that I did with the swamp so we had six members of the house Freedom Caucus and we followed them around the Capitol we talked about the big issues plaguing DC\nWe had a liberal and progressive groups sharing that Facebook series So Tim Canova who ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz this as a Bernie Sanders ACA light\nShared the swamp episodes and said I encourage all of my followers to see this um and we did it in a way where we didn't put you know Republican or conservative next to these guys named it was all about the content\nAnd that's what a lot of these um younger conservative filmmakers are doing their libertarian leaning you know they're conservative leaning it's more about hey let's fix some of the big fundamental issues going on and then we can get into you know some of the more policy debates\nSo I think um that kind of content and then just presenting it in a really sweet mobile application makes it easier for people to interact with the contact\nHave you ah have you seen what's happening in Brazil with a with a young libertarians you know they they are looking at America going you know they can't sell that we can sell the libertarians two ... two older and you know\nAll this freedom and talk that they're doing is not a not appealing to the the youth and they are making huge gains and headway because you know they're twenty somethings that have\nWho are are naturally attracted to freedom and said there's a better way to package this I think that's great and anything you're doing to encourage a you know twenty somethings to do that I think as time they take charge\nYeah I think so I think you know having the big conservative publishers on board um and does banding together you know with this program\nWe're going to find a lot of talented people out there who are you know frustrated who are amazing videographer isn't filmmakers who can go out there and shoot this content um and let them be the bridge to reach the next a conservative or libertarian generation\nSo you're the update dot com or let me let me I'm a switch topics with you because you know you of consulted a with candidates et cetera et cetera\nBut do you think is coming our way to places first blue wave red wave no wave\nYou might as well flip a coin so I live I it's funny I live ah three blocks behind the capital in DC so I Am I describe myself as being a spy behind enemy lines because D.C is Ninety\nFour percent Democrat so you know I talked to a lot of guys both sides of the aisle I'm In DC and you might as well flip a coin I mean there's Freedom Caucus guys who say\nRepublicans hold the house by but it's only by a couple of seats there's more people who have said oh it's you know it's going to be Democrats by a few seats\nI really don't know I I think what they are doing with the election is the media is getting so excited looking at this big national view but when you break down these individual races they are going to be far more competitive than what the media saying\nIt's always about local it as a as the Kavanaugh facing coupled with Cortez coming out and saying you know capitalism is not going to be around forever the Democratic socialist the surrounding people while they're eating and shouting them down\nThey have the ... do you think the Democrats different than the leftist do you think the Democrats are waking up to holy cow who's in our bad\nYeah I was telling somebody earlier this week the orange he just needs to put out a video of all the people clawing at the door of the Supreme Court there is a big divide I think between like the old school you know Democrats all my parents' voted Democrat I can you continue to vote Democrat\nThan what's going on in D.C and people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker I mean these are radical left is when I was filming a with a swamp out in Iowa I was in ... district and these are we went to a machine shop\nAnd these are life long you know Democrats a lot of them switched over to vote for President Trump but I'm Talking to him and they go oh you know I still you know identify as a Democrat voter so I just rattle off a couple of issues and I'm like\nThat I had to break into your man you're you're you're no longer for in this Democratic Party right so yeah it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out two weeks away\nHow do how do you think the president and ah the Republicans should respond to this caravan coming up stop it\nI mean I think the president's made it clear where either a country of laws or not and it it you know the the ruse that they're using that this is\nUh it's amazing how well the left uses terminology to try to convey people to their side\nBecause now they're asylum seekers you know their asylum seekers or their asylum seekers you apply for asylum in the first country that you arrived to which would be Mexico so it's not about that it's about getting to the United states about sending money back to their country uh I don't even\nKnow if it's about that these guys are\nThese guys are Marxist or that are upset at the the the the politicians in Honduras that kicked their Marxist a guy out who had ties to Venezuela and to Castro in Cuba\nThey've been trying to do all kinds of ... in in Honduras\nThere 'cause they're carrying the Honduran flag that these guys are Marxist radicals at least the leadership is\nI I Would have to imagine that if I was in a their situation if I was legitimately or refugee and I got to Mexico and Mexico was willing to hear my case or process me\nI Would wait in line for as long as it took the helm ... you know myself or my family for them to just break down the barricades and and charge the police officers in Mexico and say guys that you can't stop us we're going all the way to the United states and right you know singing Honduras national anthem\nYeah it's not this is about politics and who's funding them yeah it's a great issue but I'm the president should stand strong and stop it if they make it that far [noise]\nAll right the uh the name of the ah athletes launching went this week yeah launching this week you can go to the update dot com or\nGive us an email address and we'll

little bit about the American financing I'm I'm very concerned about some things I'm going to sound insane\nThe shortage of dollars a there is a shortage of dollars coming and I know that sounds crazy because we we been printing all these dollars where are all these dollars\nWell the problem is is the government keep spending more and more dollars and the government is looking for people to buy our treasuries which is a giant loan with US dollars\nAnd so the more we spend the more dollars the government is gobbling up also because all of the banks took out loans in US dollars I'm Sorry not the
