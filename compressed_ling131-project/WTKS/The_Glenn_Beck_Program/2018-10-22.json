that\nAnd Republicans got smoked two thousand ten or you had a sixty six percent Republican a percentage of people who are really interesting the election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked\nUm you said the same thing she thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent or said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out again in this time in favor of the Democrats it started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Senate and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... since ... that has changed Democrats have gone up\nFrom sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance a very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two thousand six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nYou know relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if they were able to sweep all of the races there favored in\n... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point\nSo all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is the idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some places you know when there was a down by five in the polls don't want him winning some of those races\nSo the split it's going to be important here but just that get them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that than losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way they these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still hasn't even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power to have subpoena power going to happen\n... nightmare it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of oh yeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again I just I just wanted to five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all taught supper and some of them looked like they might be leading Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the cabinet thing now I mean I think it's a real\n... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling\nAt the ... they're in an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten where at fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest than partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that type of course a blanket role but it's typical of and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of\nThe earlier elections among independents and that may just be because they're overwhelmed with it and they don't they don't like either side and then they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo yeah but I Wonder\nBecause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls and so I'm Wondering you know where that four percent jump was\nAt a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump\nI'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever being retired life like was that being said uh you know I vote Republican I mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for a Republican\nThe independence and libertarian libertarians I'd do vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line that\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent ...\nYeah I mean I Would think they are disgusted with what's going on right [laughter] if anything or they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting data here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\n... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh oh yeah there's this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about that a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters\nSo ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen it was forty one percent very low\nOur ally perhaps we need them I don't know I don't like to getting into the situations I Wish we weren't there at all but this was a crime and it was despicable disgusting brutal\nI mean unbelievable to people in the west but it happened and I have no doubt that the prince was behind it okay\nThat has no bearing on who she was [noise] we can say that this was a despicable horrible crime done by the Saudis and their horrible people for X Y Z and we can say ... did not deserve to die this way\nNobody deserves to die that that way however he is not the guy that everybody in the press is making him out to be he's not some freedom loving guy he's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood

out show to me\nWhere is that working out where is it protecting human rights\nNo thank you I mean\nIslamic rule just by a nother group of Islam is is what you have in Saudi Arabia\nNo thank you I'm

Ninety seven points evident well ... ...\nTalk a little bit about\nThis back and forth with Saudi Arabia because it is important\nThat we get this right and we don't make this about American politics we should make this about American interests but not American politics right now people are saying I came away Donald Trump or\nYou know what George Bush Bill Clinton the second George Bush all the way back all the way back to FDR we have been in bed with the Saudis\nI don't like this I think we're in bed with really bad people he's\nA rattlesnake a bad pet that was asked me once and I love this is a rattlesnake is it a bad bad\nThe answer is no it's a perfectly fine pet as long as you always remember it as a rattlesnake or a snake and not a little puppy dog\nIt's a rattlesnake ... not a bad bet just don't have it and don't\nTry to a fashion Elise ... around its neck take it for a walk eating gonna do it\nSo how do we handle Saudi Arabia well should be the same way we handle turkey but we're not because we're looking at turkey and Saudi Arabia with American eyes stop it\nThese are both Islamic states now their warring with each other why\nBecause one is Muslim Brotherhood and one is a well hobbyist they don't like each other they want death\nFor everybody in the other state they want the regime of Saudi Arabia [noise] Saudi Arabia stopped [noise] turkey because they're Muslim Brotherhood [laughter] and Saudi Arabia wants turkey stopped\nBecause there will hobbyists\nWe're being put in the middle of a fight between to Islam assist both of them want the caliphate both of them want Islamic rule both of them want to rule ah with jihad and they also want to rule with surreal law\nWe don't we don't want any either of those\nSo now let's put this into perspective Saudi Arabia horrible place horrible horrible horrible horrible place\nThey execute kids\nAs long as you've shown any kind of signs of puberty you're tried as an adult they execute through beheading\n... there was a woman who was raped gang raped by seven men not sure if one of them was Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh yet uh but uh Saudi were woman was gang raped by seven men\nThey each got you know between two and nine years in prison however she she received six months in prison and two hundred lashing ... with a whip\nBecause she was in the car without a without her husband and then she dared to take her story to the media is the kind of people that we are dealing\nWith the crown prince\nYou and I are not going to like this guy\nYou didn't say oh look at what he's still he's he's making it easier for women to drive without their husband yeah okay yeah\nSure sure sure he's still a hobbyist\n\nLet's look at what both sides in this country have done\nWe're currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia we are involved in their war in Yemen did you even know that\nPresident Trump announced a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia last year it was President Obama that vetoed a bill that allowed families\nNine eleven victims to sue the Saudi Government\nSo both sides everybody is in protecting these guys\nWhen the crown prince came here to America he met with Donald Trump\nOh my gosh but he also met with Oprah Winfrey bill and Hillary Clinton Chuck Schumer Dwayne the rock Johnson for some unknown reason Brock Obama John Kerry ... rice George W. Bush Henry Kissinger Michael Bloomberg Thomas Friedman from the New York times\nNow that's different remember then Islam\nAnd his ... believes you have to use sharia law that's the constant wow it sounds like the ... the Muslim Brotherhood that's our constitution that is our law sugary a law\nSo\nLet's just begin to tell each other the truth and here's the truth turkey is not a friend of ours turkey is in with the Muslim Brotherhood\nTurkey would like to have a caliphate run by them Saudi Arabia not good people Saudi Arabia huge exporter of ... and has done it here in the United states has spent money building mosques that are very dangerous here in the United states it's true\nThey kill him could be probably seems like it\nI don't trust the Muslim Brotherhood and turkey but I also don't trust those guys one of them killed him\nProbably Saudi Arabia did he deserve it no does he deserved to be called a freedom fighter\n[noise] only by either really an educated progressives\nOr just liars ...\nLots of this half hour is simply say simply safe\nHome security system for your home home security system uh\nYou know for your business as well uh we have simply safe here at the studios and uh it protects the the George Washington compass and the\nAnd the ruby slippers somebody came in and said ruby slippers there's seven ruby slippers or that were made actually the\nThe um [noise] a Smithsonian has the worst pair that really beat up and really pretty nasty the best Paris probably owned by\nA an individual I think loans them to the Walt Disney studios but ours are protected by simply safe simply say protecting more than two million Americans you want to do it for rare artifacts well okay it's it's I use it for the family because my family are much more precious than any kind of artifact\nSet up your system within minutes and own it\nThey are really really the best at what they do and uh they're really affordable\nSimply say back dot com go there now check out how much money you're going to save how easy it is and no contracts it simply safe back dot com ... take control of your family security was simply safe back dot com [noise]\nThese news radio and I didn't have any point in heaven and weld ... am your KFI [noise]\nNow that I sleep cool and comfortable every night on Casper I pick it over any mattress I've ever had it's a high quality mattress at an affordable price and its ships free in a small box so you can try it for a hundred nights risk free you don't love it they're going to come and pick it up and refunding everything so put Casper to the test in your own home for a hundred nights go to Casper\nDot com and use the ... back you're going to say fifty bucks stores the purchase of your select mattresses Casper dot com promote go back that's Casper dot com promote go back terms and conditions do apply\nAccording to the department of energy the most expensive utility for most Americans is their electricity bill adding to your financial misery this allergy season has them one of the wars in years so now is the perfect time to order a new set of HPV backed filters from filter by dot com with over six hundred scientists to choose from including custom often\nYou'll find the perfect it ships free within twenty\nFour hours with filtered by dot com they're made in America that still to be ... dot com\nA news radio Nettie seven point seven to twelve Ninety W T.

W ... dot com\nLocal weather ... Thursday Afternoon I temperatures in the seventies for most communities you will notice more cloud cover partly to mostly cloudy the sprinkles maybe an isolated shower and the first of all our forecast you can get the hour by hour details on the news this afternoon I Need you just cut her Martin WTC chaos\nTo um as far right as they come on the right versus left continuum but it's very important to remember that the purpose of politics is to maintain a framework for order liberty so that you can go live in communities of love where you're actually raising your kids and build limit\nOur mouse trap or ... or where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are they're anti constitution\nSo you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about\nPolitics but at\nWhat point do you see good people\nSay enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYet but then to what end what what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did or to Nancy Pelosi in California than hundred centigrade aware does did to Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao in Kentucky exactly latter day because there is no second or third\nJust moved from there that doesn't just end up and violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do\nBut screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off the table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually\nHave persuasion as any goal the the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch headstrong pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta and taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... of phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing\nThat I'm In I'm In the middle of a little downtown sort of ... restored downtown and Omaha right now\nAnd ah there's no end to fire here and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media college in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties sixty eight percent of Americans in a given week\nWe're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that men are basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week\nIt was an important content but it was shared content ... there was an American way when you fall with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two\nThey're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public\nAnd so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignore them [noise]\nSo what is our\nOur we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our even our own them\nSo yes ... or ... soon them out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment\nFreedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest all of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe a ... day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God\nWith eternal souls and with dignity that way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people\nAre not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest and statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers\nDo you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if\nThose four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to\nBelieve that we can be ruthless we can be place

me wrong are the people in the left or exactly who these people are of course there are but that's often the leadership I'm Talking to an average everyday person who votes they just know\nWhat's happening now isn't working that's why people listen to me when I should talk I talk about ways of making people better I I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life\nLiberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about this I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness sorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there are there many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal\nHang of it before it surely some stuff started with me I should go into education\nAbsolutely I'm the one talking about getting rid of all of a centralized testing prior to high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because ... testing is it unfair way of bringing teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding the funding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons is family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests or the feel stupid and to be some come successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined way you should go well you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do because that means you were in school prior to Nineteen eighty and it was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really wasn't a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about the really do anything ... somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read write\nSurvive in the world without and at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked at the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nAnd they give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some localized central and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready to analyze testing you will lose about ... we will do is in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion so losing four billion not in the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here when we lose at four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strikes which means administrators\nGo away and then it shows while riding granted measures were checking boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive\nWhy regulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one say nice things because I crossed the entire state might say that's easy to counties across all if you\nOnly get the full sharply by the way\nFor you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminishing makes over a hundred and fifty among you dump a couple of minutes raiders you hide my teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done\nWhy in the world we have K. through twelve many K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids\nIs Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed ... that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirty eighth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWas terrible and I got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we say and wonder why hasn't the work ethic we've never had a job\nIt is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who were telling me literally Larry I Will hire anybody what the work ethic\nAnd one uh ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is for people to show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey gotta has a plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk in front and the computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen let's not make some decisions if I think called you right for me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid\nWho you know loves Dr tease him I talked to ...\nI'm a doctor who then we go back to the games are not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different story down okay yes\nSo um so that kid was really smart that could take the SAT right away and goes off and get to the great why should they be bored in school and they should be one school\nNext you don't want any of those things now where he's going to be a trade school\nChoice could become a plumber carp and do whatever you want to be about mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately\nThe average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I let my ... year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough in New York City doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that go get a job why not go learn ... work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people in my generation I just don't have to go work learn what it means to have a boss\nLearn what it means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five\nLearn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nA lot of these sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth right I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here you're sixteen you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use it good luck\nHere's what I'm his wife ... going to happen a bunch of cool prep schools will pop up\nA bunch of great trade schools will pop up guess how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars ain't going to say well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most guaranteed government money yet they do so they will actually give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere's the best part when these schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year these last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each twelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders is more than four billion dollars\nWe saved all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while they are murders at it at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids ... ethnic or the unhappy kids now thinking about this a lemon twelfth grade you're in eleventh twelfth grader you're in a class with everyone who wants to be there\nTo build their kid isn't there to build a kid in something else the kids a bully because he doesn't want to be there that's why he's a bully but not he go someplace else\nYour teacher lemons fourth grade discipline problems almost go away why all the kids want to be there they've taught was killing our children isn't guns was going to have children is lack of community lack of purpose and loneliness\nThat killing our kids put them in these worlds all that goes away I Can't go shoot my fellow friend the teachers have me you know build a rocket with my class I Can't go she ... the farm and he's been a fix a tractor I've got things to do I've I've purpose I meaning I don't do things like that anymore\nWe're living in a world of massive change yes massive change and when's the last time you heard any politician sound or anything like this\nRunning for governor of New York his name is Larry ... want to find out more go to Larry ... is a A R T E Larry shark dot com back in just a second\nMe tell you about life logging\nFor more than three years a software vulnerability in\nThe Google Plus social media network unwittingly gave third party

access this is going to be a common problem\nFor the future there is no such thing as privacy and it's just getting worse and worse and worse my I was on the way home yesterday my wife looked at her phone she's been hacked by the Russians [laughter] yeah\nSo I'm nine points above victory assuming I get a hundred percent\nThere is the hard part right the math equation can I get to a hundred percent\nAnd sadly that's not my message I've got that down it's the media can I get my name out to enough people to where I cross over that barrier which gets to be over the therapist I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win yes what I hear ya yeah it's really is as well get get remember at as third party in general the system is act against you\nAnd some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality could do this\nBecause every day I'm up against failure but the marine corps taught me take the hill the captain shot\nTake the hill the machine guns broken take the hill radios don't work take the hell are stopped giving excuses take fail I get it and that's what I Do I take the hill as a matter I get I literally deal with failure every day this woman every day and when I say that that's not an exaggeration\nThat's every single day as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS and they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even do thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot\nWCBS they got him ... his name he decided no lottery shop dozens of beyond their he's decided that the establishment is all that matters this is what I'm up against it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that uh you think should be heard than you should probably ah maybe tweet storm\nWhat's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think the ... so this is a radio debate yes well there's going to televise also now okay we both televised on radio ... okay\nSo yeah again and they're just deciding no we don't want them they'll me wrong there are three other people should be made should also be the Green Party and also the damn party they should all be there but this is the norm and we put up against this weapon against is constantly and here's the the worst part with all of this we're still growing\nAnd they're still going down that's that's the sad part they don't they don't\nThey don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate how's he doing Larry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you

uh is making waves in New York and he's a voice that you should hear because his his policies are different than the Republican and the Democrat and I believe they're very very workable in a in an era when we are changing everything when technology has changed everything\nWhy we're still looking at a system or you know that feels like the old Soviet size styles centralized system is beyond\nMe but I'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um you are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing\nWith the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo is pushing them around quite a bit especially when it comes to the second amendment\nA and trying to deep platform ah people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for a governor to impede business\nPeriod no ... no ... if I don't like an industry or I don't like something I never said if I Want to have freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief I should be the marketer and chief not not his majesty emperor who decides\nThese people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's always\nNot only doing that he's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around his edicts right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants to insurance force firearm now we can't get it\nThere's no way that the individual and there are at least four million I'm gun owners in New York state if not more\nHow do they mean insurance now when when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore\nFor for any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yeah and that's the unethical part that's the issue\nRight and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by default matter what you do that's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight\nAnd we wonder why we're having a gun if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe act compliant\nSay fact was passed and twenty Thirteen and if a fact said that certain aspects of a firearm make it\nLegal or illegal ... literally what he decided I think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before completely totally above board you are now a violent felon it was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nNot joking district story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes all the top scores that have been revamped of all because of that in other words but it now if you're retired cop once you retire well now you're a felon again vision of them are not good cop this and this is where we are in New York state this is horribly\nBad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy ... constantly who project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a businessman\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired mhm that's what he's done we've lost over ... million since he's just hadn't thrown\nOver a million ... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million look they're voting with their feet when it's yes it's so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they have pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent in New York state they being spent in Florida we're ... we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions though sure pensions are ...
