doing there and I'm doing well how are you\nGood I'm I'm a I'm I'm really fascinated by how we make the turns in our society for the future and a ownership is a big part of this because in the future I don't know how many people leaving on cars I mean it's just it's just all changing\nBut do we really own things when we buy them online\nSo I think there's a real concern here that consumers go into transactions when they're buying things and digital goods are especially digital books movies music they go into the transactions assuming they work the same way they do in the in the world of tangible goods\nWhere if you buy a book you can give it away to a friend you can lend it to someone you can leave it in your will or in the future and you know a lot of your book collection or to or your loved ones\nAnd the rules that control these digital transactions when you buy something on your Kindle or my shows are very different from the rules that we expect in the physical world\nAnd consumers don't really understand that distinction and I think that causes a real disconnect between what we all expect to happen and what happens in fact so to give you a quick example I'm just [noise] um\nA couple of weeks ago I'm a consumer uh a customer of the apple eyes gyms a movie store found that three movies purchase had that we had been deleted from his account there were no longer accessible and I think that shocked a lot of people\nUm those of us have been following these issues closely for years\nWould remember ten years ago when Amazon remotely deleted\nBooks off of people's candles yams including a ironically George Orwell Nineteen eighty four [laughter] so these these issues have been happening for a long\nTime but I think people are are are now starting to have a sit up and take notice\nOkay so I I remember it gives us that it's easier for me to read everything on Kendall um but I and I have a a large collection uh in my library of of of hardcover books\nUh and I read so much I read it all on tinder all but I have recently really been concerned not just because I don't actually own it and I can't have it in my library and I can't pass it on but also because he watch things like that happening in China\nIf you're ... if you're in China in the first they wouldn't sell the book but if they did sell the book\nThe government can just deem that that book is you don't need to burn books you could just overnight just take all of that\nEvery copy of that book out of circulation if it's only digital that's really disturbing to me\nI think it's a real concern um it's a concern I'm from the perspective of censorship and you've just described it it's also real concern\nOr from the perspective of preservation and sort of archiving our cultural history if these books are ... are are stored on these centralized servers\nAnd only the hands of you know the the the two or three companies um\nThat dominate these markets then there's a real risk that um we are going to be able to ensure a cab to widespread distribution of copies that will allow us to uh to to to archive and preserves [noise] um do these works\nIn an errand it with the movie it wasn't because they founded objectionable or anything else is because that particular provider they lost the rights to that movie right and so they they had to pull it from people's libraries because their rights that expired\nSo there are number of ways that this can happen this most recent example I don't know the facts are totally clear on exactly what went on so one way this can happen is that as you described\nUm the deal between the digital retailer apple or Amazon and the copyright holder expires may no longer have the rights to sell that product\nIt can also happen when a record label or a movie studio decides that they want to put out the new updated re mastered the director's cut edition of the movie and when they do that they pulled the old version\nTo hell home I Do [noise] um\nOh my gosh so they almost force you to I mean because they they've always done this where you know it's the masterpiece collection and it's you know additional footage and and the you know fully restored but you still had the old copy now that's right you can't ... I mean even for I mean think of this even just for comparison\nYou can't if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed in our war huh well I Want to see what it was like\nWhen they were originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that what'd you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and the and the problem is most recent case in part was that the consumer did will have a local copy stored on their computer or their device\nUm and and this is this a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you can do the locally when these services are often trying to\nEncourage consumers to rely on their own on the on the company's own sort of cloud storage solution and sometimes I'm with the Apple TV for example\nAt the Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of the movie you have to access it through their ... servers\nExactly I'm\nSorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship as\nIf I downloaded of something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\nOr so is it allows you to store those files locally on your own device but cars that Kendall is tethered through software right where connections to Amazon\nAmazon has the ability as as they showed ten years ago to block it would move those files strong\nMuslim Hubble can you talk about or go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years do chew and a very different way I I'm sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way David forced everybody to have it exactly [laughter] it's\nBizarre you write about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce there is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making for my tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\nYou it's a it's sort of an open ended thing where they are constantly knowing what you do with that product and you have that ongoing relationship where they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk about a little bit about the change their cars that either but that's a real change I don't think people would consider an air and before you answer that we're going to take a quick break and then we'll come back\nGet you to answer that

mean\nThere if there ever is a time of of catastrophic change there's going to be a time when we're all going to have to kind of work together and figure things out or because the things aren't going to work the same with with dollars\nMay I suggest that the world always returns to gold um and for a barter a they have the maple flex going which is is this bar of of a silver that it's about the size of a credit card that you can carry it around\nIt has a maximum flexibility you just break off pieces and are you going to have you know one tenth one quarter of an ounce of silver\nBut they also

occur and the way that\nCommercial transactions are structured rules were going to start to see people become more and more customs to paying for temporary access to resources rather than\nOwning them and in some ways I think that makes some degree of sense there are some people for whom owning a car is it necessary they'd rather be able to take a left or use some sort of car share application and I think that makes a lot of sense\nWhat I'm worried about is the long term a set of implications for a shift away from ownership and towards temporary access a shift away from independent control\nOf resources to one where we have to rely on permission or or or the sort of good will\nOf the companies that control access so ...\nMaybe many I give you an example and see if I'm On the right track I buy a car and I love this car and I want to keep it and it's a classic car but\nI don't own the software that runs the car and if any time the software company says no I'm not going to and we're not

the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he is the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line and that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that Eric Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gave it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and Eric Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and I think it's his background as an engineer or ... uh and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film is saying is that Google or hasn't takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company and making money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it and Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premise of this film that\nIt's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlands are using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the cabinet case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a ... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen that\nRight yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country\nDoing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and at this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody is monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun yes it's a verb I dunno Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always change the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes that's a real problem\nYou're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabin on me and I don't know exactly what because it's occurring right real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was\nIt was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about a ... a about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of us the press\nCertain stories um this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the the point that we try to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the point is it's out in the open you have combat and by the way the fake news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add that the Russians ran of\nJesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you to vote a different way that wasn't that that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias you know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why will you not I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back do you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent\nYes and it's not very good\nAt it not\nThe name of the documentary is the creepy line at the ... dot com Peters whites there is a with it and we have a lot to discuss because of the platform Ming\nA and kind of a role
