I'm Sorry does the gutters\nI add add a run down to the ground for me I Know I have to put a four inch\nPipe in the ground and I can run around the addition over to the existing a shoe store underground but my question is is how do you do I need to go uh when I dig around the side of the house to put that pipe in the ground\nOr you want to get you know probably where you're at you only have to go below the ... probably Eighteen to twenty inches [noise]\nYeah it will be up against the foundational so\nI'd say kind of twenty inches and you want to have slowed to make sure that water doesn't stand in that pipe right so you want to hear them so\nYup yup Yup I I I saw you to stop it it made me feel is\nNo shortage us answer I think I might be able to do this but uh yeah that's a great help that's what I called for the ... I think um [noise] was it certainly important I Want to go down far enough so I'm up in the streets weapon yup\nYup and and again with that slope you're not going to have a problem if you're twenty inches deep\nGet a good gravel base on there and uh and you're good to go [noise]\nVery good thank you much for the call appreciate it All right um well let me tell you about a [noise]\nWhat's going to go on in the next hour I think you'll find it interesting we're going to have our friends in from ... pumps and we're going to talk about uh what kind of backup pumps you want on your home\nYou want to water for you wanted to battery operated [noise] so that's going to be what we're going to chat about and I know there's always some controversy about that but I like the battery 'cause it's not like the water because of the will get a straight from our friends from lower that's all up next [noise]\nAt the bottom of the next hour I should say we continue your on hopes it will be two questions answered you're at home with your [noise]\nYour home is just a click away that Gary Knell of an online dot com he's at home when Gary element\nNinety seven forty seven to twelve ... KFI [noise]\n\n\nWhen you enter sales you know it's the real deal and it came up here we can do it why all year already my hero in financing I can count on this election\nIndustrial designers lining their entire everything on sale three eight million dollars\nOn the holidays including diamonds misleading November there anymore and I need my normal of I kind of credit [noise] that is a Fox\nAnd I wonder should I put fern stripped to have an air barrier behind it or shy applied directly to the wall\nI Would prefer you just to put I Would prefer you just to put insulation that would be open cell when\nYou're below grade and let's work on controlling the humidity level but let's create a buffer um for the temperature differential yeah that was my so kind of what I'm saying we're yeah if you you got a can of Pepsi on a hot day we're going to put a hug beyond that\nOkay right but if you if you start getting a little too creative and we we did for years we used to um\nI remember building basements and we would put insulation with the paper face on there and wrap it in plastic\nAnd what would happen is the insulation it'd be wet because the water vapor becoming through the walls and that's where a lot of the water vapor come through the concrete walls right and it was hit that water vapor or that vapor barrier ... there would be nowhere for to go so the condensation would be created behind a wall and then we had all kinds of problems\nYou know that's why that fern script could leave an air space ... it would ...\nWould but you could still have enough where maybe that air can get in there and still creek condensation because it wouldn't be Snuggie against that wall [laughter] yeah I thought of that too\nYeah so you know I mean if it were me what I Would do is I Would see where my humidity is I Would really work hard on controlling that my guess is that you middle fire probably isn't too isn't big enough\nYou're still running a really high humidity counting there are some phone panels that are open cellphone panels or get some really construction and he's in a blue those things right on the wall and put a hugging on those walls or work on controlling my humidity level in the basement\nOkay I can see that there you go thank you very much All right take care of my alright twelve minutes after the top that they are taking your calls regarding little home improvement and Greg welcome\nGarry Yes sir I just want to give me a little plug here forever or are they came out to my uh my out there this week and we stole the multi step system okay and they did I just want to get they get I did a bang up job and get it done in five days\nWow it's nice not worrying in it and it's a lifetime warning thoroughly well Greg you bring up a good point we're talking to people from all over the country and they they may not have an ever drying their\nBut what Greg said is a mouthful and that is a multi step system\nMany times Greg we get calls on this show and they want to know if they should address the outside the should dress inside she address some Walsh addressed the floor yeah and they're really the only way you're actually ever going to totally eliminate the problem is address it all\nThose outside and then\nAnd then that's why they can offer a lifetime warranty and there's many companies you know in other parts of the country that kind of go by that same philosophy hits a project you do not want to piecemeal\nYeah well you don't want them to come back and read it have to redo your any water problems that come back\nRight and if you just do one part of the quite honestly the other parts could get worse he I always say to people okay if you do that where the water go where's the problem going to be in the ... so we stopped at here and it's like putting your finger on a dyke\nThat's right [laughter] this charge out from your from your point yeah you're courting grain\nSure sure well I'm Glad you had a great experience Greg thank you very much for the call appreciate Gary thanks very All right take care of\nExcellent then that that is a ... you know it's nice that he called um but it's also nice to be able to point out the fact of why it works because they know many people\nYou know this sufferer you have a leaky basement and that's a challenge but you know it starts outside or you know you got a check to make sure leaves rally gunner you gotta check make sure the greetings right you gotta\nMake sure that the down spouse or taken all that water away kind of work on all of those things I get that those things you can control but if you worked on all that\nAnd you still have that problem you you got a problem and it's just not that crack in the wall you can patch it\nBut then there's the ... where is that pressure so anyway that's nice Greg thank you much a day walk him\nHey I heard the lady call in about the uh the fracturing block windows\nLittle tiny chips ... glass popping\nThe I've seen that before All right and I know what it is and and in that case to the uh the crowd was look fine except for one small hairline crack\nAt the bottom okay All right so what's happening I'm at least in the case that I saw on those may be true that person's house um\nIf we're here in Ohio or Kentucky Andy I got the soil they he's All right all summer summer\nJust ... creating stress\nRight so if there's any if there's any have especially if that say a effects that window is\nClose to ground level or even if it's not even if it's a walkout face for example if there's if there's any step fracturing in a box on Asian or only vertical fracturing in a port foundation near that when\nThere's gotta be rotational stress on the glass right and we'll start shifting from the outside that you'll start seeing ships in the middle especially if the silicone or it he said that they use to join the blocks together\nThese weren't around well as crowded so is ... ... ... even between a block yeah that's what she said\nOkay so in that case you have no flexibility what's a walk so you can see that as fractures right coming to the Ames\nBecause all that stress is getting Charles sorts through their right and you'll see pops coming out of the mental because ah when you when you crack the edge you're also creating a sub surface fracture in the surface of the center of the glass\nOkay you know it'll eventually fall out\nYou know you're you're right on target David in fact one of the things that kept and I said I I personally have never had that experience I said called glass block them need they probably have and that experience and um that\nSolution okay it is that it was just to fall for you you don't ... crowd each block um the the\nThe more flexible ... when it was actually have a silicone\nIt's almost like a car but surely nothing to she says that run also function as a call between the blocks from today so it has a little bit of gift to take the rotation and and not crack okay break or allow ships to form on the inside when\nBefore you start seeing on the outside and the other part of it is on that one of those install\nAs a single piece wants to spend silicon start as a single piece\nSugar to start and then sell the opening a with with an expandable so uh what like\nA great stuff ... not enough but not the triple expanding right right although I Wonder right ...\nYeah so ... got a solid so and then you do want that crowd so you're trimmed back ... work actually I'm back on it boom to them and maybe three quarters finished up and then\nWe're out on both sides mhm so then you've got your ground and man that you do have a ground he then that growth will fracture\n[noise] okay okay and so and he won't blow out the window", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck
