critics have said attract what's called birth tourism Fox's John decker lab at the White House\nWhile carrying another country's flag\nWhat what what do you call that [noise]\nYou know the reason why you have to stop this if it's coming\nReason why you have to stop it is because if you do\nStop this one there will be an invasion because America can control our own borders nearly eight thousand\nTroops to match up four thousand strong caravan fourteen thousand if the second caravan linked up with the first swelling their numbers to seven thousand\nSo any media magician trying to spin what this caravan really is and I honestly don't know how you can describe a potential force of seven thousand\nPeople all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no but what does America say\nIt is classic mail is ... military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country that has not happened before but I said I Want to be fair here unexpected in a regular tactics call for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing\nThat men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\nI don't know what you can expect what should you do\nNothing nothing\nIf you had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house and they said we're going to go into your house whether you like it or not\nAnd we've got\nTwo thousand people here and you're not going to be able to stop us because what's in your house we want we're just going to live there now if you had a group of people that were marching\nSaying that coming to your house\nWould you want the police to do nothing\nWhat'd you think that would you be happy if the police all of a sudden just said you know what they're not common for you know here they are they're on

policy with a chart a little bit because we have had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of toss up category yep I'm pulling spend close and now we start to try and move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away\nOr so here's what we have right now are down to only three tossup races or we have moved uh Missouri\nAnd Indiana er into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident us Indiana the polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican that the lives there was a Ted Cruz's still lean Republican state\nAh and ah ah Mississippi and North Dakota there's going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican senators have there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure still and we couldn't really move them\nOr Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls for murder in a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points place falling is a lot closer are really a toss up race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the tops of category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we've moved to Florida to a lean democratic\nState uh again this is a tough race cars you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen\n... movement towards about put towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one is a lean Democrat state um we moved from Minnesota as well from safe Democrat to leaning Democrat appalling there [noise] you know\nI still think that's going to the Democrats but at the polling is closer then I think most people expect there's two races in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we've moved to lean Democrat as well or with a tossup races for most of the time it looks like tester has not enough of a lead there to consider this one to be\nLeaning Democrat at this point ah and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin and leaning Democrat as well so if if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three\nForty five for Democrats so I mean it's pretty it's\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate\nThat is a lot of started to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida was discouraging I think for Republicans the past few days Montana's not turning around\nYou know we've seen no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia as well which was a big hope for a pick up again this was a state that voted for Trump by thirty points and Joe mansion I think he you know\nI think he's solidified his seat there with his pro Kevin Olival yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and hide camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's\nThat the majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slight leaders were moving these days I Would normally keep those in the ... category but for a week away we gotta pick at some point\nAnd we also are or were in the election right now I mean people are voting all across the country right now uh it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break and come back and give us some of those results on the house\nTerms it lectured by numbers [noise]\nOn the Glenn Beck program\nOr want to tell you about our response to this half hour it's filtered by a filter by is a great service really truly a great service I\nI'm going to be honest with you I have I've I'm\nI'm uh fifty three fifty four year old ban love of beat\nNever gone and bought a filter to change the filter it no matter I've owned house after has never changed it you've never changed it in your life never I just did I just did\nSo because the filter by your soldier by is just a way to it's a way to like skip the responsibilities of being a man yeah they'll just do they just send it to you so you don't have to remember ... and I know with you you just had your wife do it\nThe issue a overall however uh there's a\nThe momentum the is not in favor of of Republicans right now particularly in the house and you're seeing more movement or it's dangerous to the Democratic side right now but I mean they know who knows I mean this doesn't mean that that's the way it's going to turn out\nUm it's just it's not you'd hoped to be having a nice run right now where you're going to the image like for example the lead up to the presidential election was a positive run\nFor Trump in Denver and Republicans remember they you know among before but I'm an eight or nine points they close that gap all the way\nAlmost with polls are so it was not a the momentum clearly showed it was behind a Trump leading up to that election and obviously he won here it's a little bit it's not I wouldn't say it's dramatically to the left but it does seem to be leaning that would get\nOut and vote knew not to sit this election out get out and vote

automatic\nCitizenship for babies born in the United states telling the show X Yost on HBO\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nThere'd be legal challenges to that babies born here have been granted citizenship under the fourteenth amendment to the constitution it no a fight a Supreme Court decision the children of slaves could not be citizens the president on Twitter has been endorsing a bunch of Republican congressional candidate he's got a pack campaign schedule leading up to the elections a week from

seven point seven to twelve ... am Devon you see chaos [laughter] [noise]\nThe Glenn Beck ...\nWelcome to the program Mr path grey who ah precedes this program on the blaze radio and television network a and also has his a podcast that you can listen to and download\nAt your leisure ... welcome to the program Patt big news of the day to you is\nI Would say the possibility of the president issuing an executive order ending birthright citizenship\n... problem well problem\nIt's an executive order I agree with though [laughter]\nSo you're all day with it yeah whatever [laughter] it was not the justification yeah it is the justification I think what would happen is it would be challenged and then it would go to the Supreme Court which finally\nOkay force of the Supreme Court to rule on that the fourteenth amendment is not about is not about illegals coming you're dropping babies and having them be citizens out what it's about no\nThis was clearly again I said yesterday\nEverything after the tenth amendment basically is a ...\nIt's just to reiterate or did you not get this yes blacks we mean black people to\nPay your debt right on the thirteenth amendment fourteenth amendment is oh Gees okay and they get I'll stop it yeah here the ... the ... literally Democrats knock it off mhm yes their children are citizens to yeah that's what this was right this is not about coming over here and\nHaving a baby and then you know as sneaking in cross that having a baby and then being able to bring all your family here\nLudicrous somewhat that was ... and so it's been an interpreter now all this time right but you can't you can't you do it with an executive no but\nIf he's doing it with an executive order so it's challenged and it goes right directly the Supreme Court on kind of okay with it yeah\nAnd that's I think that's what would happen yeah um because they will challenge it\nThey will challenge it and I want I I ... I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just\nBecause I constitutionally I think no the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually means\nIt seems to be a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included\nAnd it will be internally there is yeah I think that would be interesting to see like how that shakes out because you know one of the things we've praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts\nSo he needs to the judges he's put in would now rule on this and with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or not if it's gonna be fascinating that it does happen imagine Chuck Schumer and ah and Nancy Pelosi riding up\nThat brief as a friend of the court just come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh\nWe we really believe that is that guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think oh really\nI mean you can usually come with a Pittsburgh shooter and it'd be like say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you\nKnow there's got to be a part of it that just goes oh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership tried to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play we play just a couple of things [noise] listen listen to this this how far they have gone so far they've got here's here's Joe Scarborough and what he had to say listen to this\nMake up um [noise]\nPeople get to make a decision is is the America they want to live in because right now the only constitutional check against this sort of important to have your guy really a guy who was sending a message by time and time again tweeting about face forward talking about his bad hair day there\nThat was done intentionally [noise] to send a message\nTo white nationalist says about me that much but I'm I'm going to launch a baseball game I'm going to tweet about baseball World Series\nI'm just not that I'm I'm not going to let it occupy my day\nThis is how twisted have become you know so twisted they well and that's from a ... a hard core conservative yeah showed her daughter oh nobody's more conservative than Joe no you know not\nBe very happy to be a wonderful Christmas present but really what I don't think so yeah I I'm a skeptic on that I Will tell you we have to get him back on the phone 'cause I just talked to him recently and I said okay ... come on man really rental like yeah he's like okay maybe the timing maybe it's not Christmas but I'm telling you\nAnd he laid out all the reasons why it's about to take off yeah\nIsn't it yeah right yeah not again it's just a matter of timing I'm All right so here's what I Want you to do I want you to take the smart crypto course because I think everybody should have at least a hundred dollars in in crypto currency it's just this game changing stuff\nAnd between a bitcoin crypto currency and block chain\nThat is the future and you need to understand it take this Glenn Beck exclusive course right now smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or call eight seven seven ... back eight seven seven ...\nSmart crypto course dot com [noise]\nAnd when you see chaos always on the news radio savannah dot com [noise]\nIf you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness it's possible you could add a trio ... one of the leading causes extra mind out before to to do\nWith cardio among the FDA cleared personal EKG device but just Ninety nine dollars to order bits and Amazon dot com and type ... that the Amazon dot com\nType cardio ... cardio mobile fits\nIn your pocket and you can take it EKG anytime anywhere right when you\nFeel exempt cardio mobile delivers a medical grade Katie right to your smartphone and just thirty seconds you'll know if your heart rate them as normal for if a trio fair relation is detecting water cardio mobile today for Ninety nine dollars visit Amazon dot com and typing cardio ...\nTake unlimited ... morning noon or night you can always know how your heart is doing\nCardio mobile put peace of mind in your pocket for only ...

[noise]\nSome kids born in America shouldn't be Americans I'm Dave Anthony Fox News that's what President Trump believes considering an executive order to undo the policy any baby born here whether the mothers in the country legally or not is a U.S citizen he tells actually goes on HBO\nLooking at looking at the look at the cover of what was it the Newsweek Magazine said we're all socialist now and as soon as we said\nWe're going for socialism or they immediately said were racist now when you point out uh George Soros this week the media is trying to say anybody who disagrees with George Soros is an anti Semite\nThat's kind of the same thing that you found in Hollywood with your case is about\nI did I did and they basically taken the position that anybody that is a Republican or conservative is racist is anti Semite is is a homo phobic and it's just their their way of kind of of the ring us I mean I\nAnd uh American of Mexican descent and so\nAt my wife is Mexican she's a first generation or you know a ... a Mexican American ... it's ... they use this identity politics to other us and then they completely ostracized and it just isn't that hack mode\nAnd it's something that it it it goes into understanding why Hollywood is so ubiquitous Lee Webb waning and you know you see why all these stories that come out of Hollywood that\nAre so one sided that only tell one side of the story so you know that is when I saw this I said you know what we need to start telling our side of the story and we need to use storytelling\nAs a as a way to do that so that's what I ... it was it was astonishing\nKind of moment to\nCall out a man that is getting in bed with other people's kids and to actually have the entire community turn on is purely because we were conservatives it was an astonishing moment to go through\nWhat is it that they what is it that they have about conservatives more than pedophilia\n[noise] you know it I think it is a fear Hollywood is such a small community and it's run by so few people\nAnd it was just such a fear for losing work and one way and it and on top of that it's like the games of Thrones where\nThey're it it's very competitive to ah to to get that work so the first the first way to take somebody out is the state of the conservative\nUm and then anybody that anybody that is even near that person that gets us think of them on conservative that they're conservative\nThey run from that person so there's a lot of it is the loudest voices basically first kind of ... you out like the invasion of the body Snatchers that this guy is a conservative and then you have the the second tier which are just people that are fearful for their\nFor getting work and those people run as well so it's just kind of this kind of\nA very unhealthy community that gets set up and then you know and then you start to see what happens to the Hollywood box office they start to you know slowly over the last Fifteen Years start to decline because they aren't making a content for the other half of the country\nSo um you know and I think that conservatives have really locked in on this and said you know what a ... of this we're not taking his anymore you see the rating start to go down but now it's our time now there's this new frontier for conservatives\nWhere we need to start creating content for ourselves and we need to start entertaining ourselves because they're never going to do\nAnd that's what we're trying to do with red told America that's on the heart radio a pod cast or cheating on her radio [noise] excuse me I heart radio ac\nWe're talking to a Patrick grilled cheese and um let me ask you\nThe Patrick I'm\nI have this theory about what happened with Megan Kelly that the that the business people looked at Megan Kelly and thought while she's a great gift she's she's very credible she's great an interview you know we have our own\nKind of sixty minutes [noise] kind of person I'm very very smart yadda yadda yadda they hire and that's when the social justice warriors all around them\nRemind her remind them she's a conservative she was or at least she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um and no you can't play nice and you have to destroy her\nAnd so they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized that the social justice warriors were against it\nThey did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune\nAnd set out to destroy do you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do think that\nOr a ... going after the network for their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and then in the entire me too movement had a big part of that that a lot of people aren't touching on um it it basically she was you know print brave in doing that um I think you know from a career wise it might have been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet here's a woman in the me too moment exposing the corporation for covering and they don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become just a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not um being used in the way that it was a God given birth to\nA man and I think that that is is one of the main reasons why and it didn't help that she was a conservative and it was easy to get rid of it because of that\nUm so yeah I think that's what happened in the egg and\nPatrick ... we're we're talking to the host of red pills America you can hear it on the uh I hurt radio out really good story teller I Know you're going to be taking on a few issues that I Want to go through\nA a couple of them um first of all the\nThe caravan that is that is coming up uh there's today they're they're the media and clothing ... Smith are saying there's nothing to worry about this isn't an invasion what what are your thoughts on the care of him\n[noise] you know I think that is something that [noise] for whatever reason the last ten years the left is completely changed their tune on um in regards to our borders are open borders I I I feel like it is\nA we actually do an episode of that is coming up that looks at this kind of story of you know is there actually jobs Americans won't do and we follow a to construction workers\nThat um I I don't want to give the you know the end away but they've completely this prove that ah that that argument and I think at the end of the day there is a lot of people that in America that we've forgotten about\nThat have lost their jobs to to a much cheaper labor that comes across the border and I think that we're seeing this here I think that this the care of and it is not for political refugee status these people are looking for its economic and it's going to hurt\nThe the
