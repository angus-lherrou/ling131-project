identified as attending University of Washington student denied having sexually assaulted his accuser quote I was investigated by my school's office and found that there was insufficient evidence of what she was accusing me up\nNow why would why would that matter\nWe have to believe the witness yes\nI mean they did an investigation and they couldn't find enough evidence but is that really what we care about what about the poor accuser\nHe said uh the allegation stems from a night which he and his accuser both were pretty drunk\nAfter which he performed a ... on her and uh then attempted to initiate a intercourse ... we seem pretty comfortable with the various Cairo him his accuser said no at which point he backed off\nThis girl gave the investigator all at my school literally everything

just after eleven Saturday Night the other two around five AM Sunday all of them under investigation if you have any information\nThey're biased detectors or have always working uh you know even even when they listen to their their favorite commentator they're still kind of you know it's you see the human hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans are kind of already an adult when\nPeople are you yeah of course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine\nThey turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause I think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm and I can trust a subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust sweats higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product in search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and\nAnd what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it and that we've now done with for national elections involving you know a more than ten thousand people\nA I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes with no one having this latest idea that they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track\nYou know that is scary\nIt is you you um you leave this out in the in the um creepy line I'm about\nHow Google has really stripped itself a bowl ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and\nWithout an agenda [noise] um and then\nAh ... how they have ... you know the ... when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national study in the last almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias so you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you\nUh we did have a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there in two thousand fourteen\nNinety nine point five percent of people in the study or could see no bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism uh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs\nAre in their voting preferences so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability to shift people's thinking and behavior\nWorldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and and it was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs\nOr around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing\nAnd without leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results that's not like a news story than just stays there for people to look at it generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know Wilson and Bernays or in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that this is the this is the system that they would have\nDreamt of for propaganda [laughter] [noise]\nAnd this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article\nA calls or can ways big tech can shift millions of votes in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA\nThat's just one of ten ways ah that I've identified over the years and that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment ah that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh and they they they are I mean some of these effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd then I read years and there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\n[noise] well into thousands sixteen early two thousand sixteen or working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people are seeing while they were using a the Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system as it was a first ever\nCreated and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton who am I favored by the way as you mention\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results\nNow and that's that's pretty blase that's pretty extreme wow or sees leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google a you know they're they're\nThey tell us

with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually\nAble to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point\nUh you know ... we well I Wish we could

day\nA some manipulations that big tech companies are perpetrating on them and that's happening now so that that's already going full steam or it's just getting worse every day\nSo I I just I I Want to reset that you did a study during the last presidential election\nYou are a Hillary Clinton supporter but you're a truth teller and you were doing a a a a study on Google Search results and found that they were\nTrying to manipulate it in favor of Hillary Clinton now you say that's the only one way we then have the surge suggestion effect now target messaging affect\nWhat is the targeting certain parts of the\nShura targeted messaging T. M. E. we call that is a is there are all things that we study and that where you were you know were quantifying and you know very precisely a targeted messing affect\nA is really scary ah this this means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to but if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November\nTwo thousand sixteen is is that morning mark sucker bird\nHad chosen to just you know hit the anarchy and send out go out and vote reminders\nUh mainly just supporters of Hillary Clinton\nOr exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that wasn't even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others\nBut if it went justice supporters of Hillary Clinton that would have given her that day an additional\nFour hundred and fifty thousand votes now gosh I I don't I I don't think he did that because you know he was very overconfident a you know as as we're Democrats or I'm not a Democrat I'm not\nI'm I'm a ... a moderate in and independent but at the point is everyone thought Hillary was going to win so\nI'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is we know from Facebook's own published data that that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifts boats and think about it no one knows if if something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day or they were targeted messages going out to some people but not others and of course isn't that what targeted advertising\nIs all about but you see targeted advertising though is competitive but I'm Talking about what happens if the platform itself does something that's not competitive it's completely invisible and it's not competitive so\nI mean this is so dangerous um and it is I mean it's everything that aside by you know a writer has invasion forever\nUh and I mean can can\nEspecially when we get two artificial intelligence couldn't a system like Google be used to identify unstable individuals and wind them up\n[noise] [noise] Oh yes they can they in fact they know who's an unstable they know who's undecided they know who is Republican and who is gay and you name it they know far more about it\nI mean ...

I Can't really any programs\nHave feelings too [noise] after that last hour really really really well really good [noise]\nYou know this is something that I've been talking about for years I mean since since we you know we're working together just the two of us in the nineties and I said some day it's going to be that you won't believe your eyes because they'll be able to create a video of anybody doing anything and you won't be able to believe your eyes\nWhile we're there I've been talking about the coming of AI why did last hour why did that affect you so much\nUm couple of things uh one I think like we all there's a lot of people who claim that that these big tech companies and stuff have biases and I think that there's some evidence that they do\nUm you know but I think a lot of people are motivated by politics when they making lanes like that and we've seen a lot of I think that's true and a lot of cases um you know the fact that Hillary Clinton supporter would do a test of the two thousand sixteen election and find\nThe results that shocking is really a major thing this this is you know he went through an actual process here this is not just some guy it's not just some blogger who thinks they've known in all this is like a\nLot is is a leader in in in psychology yeah it's I mean he was the head of Psychology Today these are the head of a couple of ah research centers it's Harvard I mean this guy is the real\nDeal with some real credibility ... somethings that hard on the left part of it because he comes out it kind of from the moderate to as he describes the Hillary as voter right right\nUm but beyond that uh I seems incredibly helpless\nTo me to stop it I mean just you know because we talk about this all the time how do we move how do we how do we convince people how do we persuade people to look at the world and ex slightly different way or at least challenge their beliefs you know someone who might be a long term you know left wing voter why wouldn't they consider a conservative approach right\nAh and we talked about that stuff all the time\nBut I Know that I can easily supporter you know a candidate that I like right like I can vote my principles easily 'cause I just do it right it's but it's harder to make other people change with the Google thing I don't know even how in my life I Would be able to on my wind myself from Google but I honestly have no idea how I Would do that\nAnd I'm and I'm not even use an Android app me so if you're in an Android which is the largest operating as you know a platform used shocked by how clear he was on that no yeah it was like you're nuts if you're using any of those\nYeah he's like do not use any go Google device yeah not use them I mean he's like it is a what did he say a surveillance apparatus only\n... yeah it's like a designed to just watch you all the time I mean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know in one of the reasons they do is it's the best what\nRight like this is a problem because the the part of the reason why it's the best one is because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right\nUm you know or the search engine obviously we all know Google is is the best one chrome is the best browser it is a bit better\nAnd the other ones I've ever used as it's been a you know I'm ... I mean you know it's you get into deep stuff and you but I don't even know how just why myself from the basics there how it would even do it not to mention the stuff that you know what you talked about with um certain browsers a use other ah you know at all apple products right use Google\nFor a ... search and it's a you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah we talked about in a lot of every time we talk about this someone will will say hey what about duct duct go duck duck goes a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principles\nUm and when it comes to the sort of stuff but I was like you know maybe I should start using and I went to duck to go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser crap what the hell is going to make the difference if I'm searching for all this stuff in duct duct go on grown\nSo now I've got ... I gotta switch emails I gotta switch phones I got us would browsers I like my whole life has turned upside down and I can't I Can't come up with enough personal\nCost to what Google is doing right now to justify a life altering move like that what did he say three\nHundred million word yet documentary ... is like a ... of of data on you\nAnd that ... million pages and pages of data\nAnd again like but I I don't know what is the personal cost to me in that data well there's\nSeveral things there are some things you could turn into I think there are several things that could turn into that are really negative for society he talked about how you could take a fifty fifty proposition\nAnd just by Google suggesting one way or the other can move people to Ninety ten Ninety percent goes away the Google wants them to go\nBack then fits incredible it's a great argument to have real principals right make sure you actually know what you're a ... or what your feelings are on an issue before you are you are influenced like this because we can see how voters do that\nBut I mean the other part of that too is you go to a place with no cookies and no none of these things tracking you will they don't know your preferences and they don't know the things that you like and there are negatives to that it is a real struggle I don't even know how it would do it if I Want it to the problem is not today this is not today it's just technology\nIs now starting to a compound upon itself exponential growth\nIn ways that we will not be able to understand I mean as the book I write about this in addicted outrage and you know use it you said when you read the\nUh chapters on a technology I remember you came in and ... okay well that's a little bleak oh yeah but I mean they fail in their right right it's it's\nIt I mean if you just heard that from a guy who's been studying Google for ten years and he's a he's a Clinton supporter or is he saying anything less than I Am saying\nNo I mean I think if anything it backs that up yeah and that that's what's terrifying because we can all look at the potential future of some sort of series of events that could go negatively and you know you've talked about that you've talked we've discussed openly sometimes you think as a catastrophe pissed right like you think of the worst case scenarios\nBut these are measured results these aren't worst case scenarios the fact that the top ten Google risk a road search results are returning things favorable to Hillary Clinton\nIs not some wild crazy theory it's something that's already happened in his over where are they now what are they doing with this now and imagine if they get over moreover we talk about you know Trump pushes a lot of buttons of people you saw how they acted with Kavanaugh\nRight you saw how the left really AK ... acted crazily towards the Supreme Court justice when they feel so justified\nIn the way they act they get crazier and crazier and crazier and that this stuff escalates they're gonna feel justified to take more overt action and got only knows where that ends up I I I I I mean it could go in really bad directions [laughter] this is um uh\nWe we are entering a ten year period now where our lives\nYou really will not recognize your country the world or our lives by twenty thirty you just will not\nIf you when you see the rage on the faces of the leaders of of the left and the Democrats and they're saying we have to get more radical remember you're already talking about a group of people that believe the ends justify the means\nYou're already talking about a group of people and let's make sure we're not like this a group of people that believe they are right to the point that the others have to just be either re educated\nOr eliminated let me ask the Democrats ... you'll have\nFifty percent of the country that just does not honestly seen the world the way you see it\nWe are just as set against what you believe is right if you believe that socialism is the answer capitalism should be shut down and freedom of speech needs to be curtailed\nI Am against that\nOne hundred percent and I will not comply\nSo what are you going to do with me are you going to silence me at what point do you feel that you have to kill me\nNow more bang on news radio Ninety seven points to have a duty K.
