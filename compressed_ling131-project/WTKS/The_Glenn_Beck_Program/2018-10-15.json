listening to me now you're already going to vote in the next few weeks during the midterms but this is a big one the other thing you can do is stay informed and this hour\nI Want to remind you that you're not alone\n... when you look at my ... were lessening the Glenn Beck program ... when you\nStart writing an essay last night um [noise] had posted up an slaves Facebook but I I I I I I Want to spend some time going over it with you [noise]\nYou know the saying may you live in interesting times they always say oh that's a Chinese curse that it's really not no it's not\nMay you live in interesting times is not a Chinese in fact the first place that we can really find that being said is in the Yorkshire Post that's in England in Nineteen thirty six\nA guy stood up in parliament his name was a sir Austin Chamberlain and he was um uh he was a meeting with union is and uh he spoke of the grave injury to collective security by Germany's violation of of the treaties so he said\nLook not so long ago\nI spent ... years of service in China and there there was this old Chinese fellow who told me of a curse may you live in interesting times and there is no doubt that this curses followed upon\nUs so it's not a Chinese it's this this guy is the only one is the only place we can really find this but I've always liked that because I don't think it's a curse it's a it's a\nIt's just a saying and you decide if it's a blessing or a curse I personally think it's a blessing\nMy dad taught me what I was really young that no matter what happens to you there is no bad\nNow he taught me this when I was really young but it took it took me hitting rock bottom alcoholism divorce everything else my life completely falling apart before I really learned that it took a dark chapter in my life that they taught me there is nothing that life can hand you that is in itself bad\nIt just depends on what you do with it\n\nIs this going to change you in destructive ways is it going to make you angry\nAre you going to be filled with bitterness and despair are you going to be looking for vengeance blame\nOr ...\nOh whatever calamity has come your way to strengthen you through enlightenment through correction new understandings humility up to you\nSo living in interesting times I think that's a blessing\nAnd we're going to learn this one way or another we can either learn this the easy way like with my dad telling me or we all learned the hard way like I actually had to take hit the end and learn through just total collapse\nBut one way or another humility will

any of us are really looking forward at least a large section isn't looking for it we are indeed living in interesting times\n\nBut he is ... is our crisis is our problem of them problem because that's what the world is trying to sell us I personally think it's an ... problem\nAll of us\nBoth sides all of us and maybe we don't see it because we're so busy staging and filtering and enhancing the colors on our Facebook or Instagram pictures that we can really no longer recognize what what is true even about our own lives\nBecause everything that we print in post most of it is ally one way or another subtle or bold its ally\nAnd why is that\nBecause we've been marketed to ever since we were born all of us if you were born after Nineteen fifty you are marketed to your whole

politician or party a B or C opinions now our products as well that you must embrace and where somebody else's not yours\n\nAnd now we're in the final stages where we ourselves are products companies

somebody else will and marketers are trying to fill that in for you you buy this product and you can say I am cool where I Am in style I Am rich I Am smart you by Democrat\nAnd you can say I am compassionate\nYou by the Democratic label I Am smarter than others I Am science minded than it does it even matter if you really are doesn't matter if you've ever given a dime or given any time to

didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned it was really fun fun right hum\nHe misses don't exist but they called all of our problems anyway right [laughter] the amount of that um but yeah so we learned our\nLesson we we took the criticism we got from that to heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work\nCriticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge\nLike a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a a financial racket going on there it's the ... big problem and I hope people continue to address it\nA secondly we decided that that um we would use the highest\nRanks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happened so far if we had gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise] that would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and they did that we were wrong\nBut it does not what happened um and uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest 'cause I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's on the recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and since he's been a recording us I mean clearly what ever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of thing\nTo look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out in the public eye took maybe that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Allen did most of the same as you talk to hell in the other day yeah ah so this was an an immense amount of work required learning these fields very quickly writing\nAcademic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work it was an insane amount of work and these are all fields\nWe have no expertise and no one has a little bit of background in some of this but this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing author only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research side of their career is to get papers published in well established journals are for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper in and I pay ... is a\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight looking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for tenure there's a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned the ones we wrote spend Fifteen some disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been cut short\nSo there's you know you I Know who you at twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and\nThen this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven Thirteen would have gotten in in the end are we not gotten cold\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so uh as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and\nCredible where they got a little gold star for [noise] alright are sponsored this half hour is zipper critter zipper critter is just as\nGreat company of ah of dreamers indoors you know when they first started\nThey were ah this company that uh you would send in you know what you were looking for you would you would write your job and then they would go around and they would posted on all the job sites well since that time they have now become the leading job site\nOr and so they they they have just as pool that you lived there poll polling from that is remarkable they also put it on all of the other job sites are but super critter has gone a step further they have just a floor full of um of I'm\nA software I'm a experts and and scientists that are working on algorithms and looking to be able to narrow everything down to the point to where now you as an employer will get a qualified candidate usually within an hour of

there's a barista in Seattle and I've got my Starbucks here in Dallas and it's not helping me\nSo it's somebody who is right for the job and they even highlight the best applicants it zip

to want it or not because how could\nWe know that as being ... and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little video we've put out to announce the project they're really concerned\nWith the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals 'em\nAnd going out and so what what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... ... what I mean you got me man [laughter] I thought it was done in the privacy of a of a veterinary office [laughter] okay\nUm let's see you did fat body building which quickly is wide\nBut but the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which fat is displayed politically so that fat as just considered another to issue a that equal with muscle\nAnd to say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people pat phobic as they call it\n... and that was accepted\nYeah that was accepted that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um especially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity or who wrote that who we claimed wrote that paper he actually has a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind to this guy being the author of this paper for fat body building was just kind of hilarious\nBecause that's another thing to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking would it would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean there's kind of a it is a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the to the weeds here but honestly scholarship should stand or fall on its merit not on who did it and so\nA lot of people are are making that point and we deliberately chosen names that would be hard to find in a Google Search in a district which was very common names on purpose I actually used a\nA a I roll dice to pick up for off of a list\nOf most common names for certain years and the way that

are of record that were were being written a for for a feminist studies and queer studies and were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique to but\nI'm not really critiqued in a way that most people would I'm just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we are going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive stack\nJames tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal was inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just say this is this an act says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so loaded argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to\nListen and learn throughout the semester which means faced\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to the way in a very privileged classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes and they said watch it with compassion\nThat re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed\nAnd there's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and leftist fit in that without being contracted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's\nThe worst part is is it's only a small step from what I already exist in a great deal of the a feminist Senate race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because he didn't he wasn't bad enough\nOr at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly papers they claimed for example that we grew on too many concepts and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nAnd so on but um does the idea that that giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\n\nWhat if this were published anywhere real if this were published what what would that\nMean to the university system would would what does that mean\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm there will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at the University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year so this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting\nIn classrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working and social justice\nSize field\nCourses I guess as the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to using the classroom and this was being submitted to\nHad to be one of those things that you entered into and hope that you were wrong and when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later going\nGood God this is bad am I right\nThat is exactly right so especially the ... paper I think the one that got accepted\nUm the idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine off of course do I mean as you are one to one thing uh\nBut the ... the the politics of grievance through I really am glad I get to talk to you about that I can because all it takes the grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic left as we were trying to demonstrate we called the stuffed grievance studies we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided\nA politically right now I was really happy to talk to you because I mean I don't want to get in touch with you but you're real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this whole May of ... about\nHow things were going for you under Obama's time and I thought that was huge and I was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge he's looking for reconciliation it's on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know or people on the left were left liberals I'm not ashamed to say that I Know you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right that's great I'm we're on the left me to take responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that\nYou know or left wing people who want the left to come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people\nIn general I get a lot of sense that people send me emails about this now all the time especially\nUm we're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to production politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media is here as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't\nReally remember you know you are an American I'm an American your person I'm a person\nWe have ... most of the things that we think\nIncome and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society and a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working out the details and I really hope that you know that our projects kind of reaches reaches that point does that make sense\nIt totally does I I Am I hate to say this to I'm Out of time could I invite you to come down and uh and do a pod cast with me you know when you spend an hour and a half uninterrupted a and just\nStart where we've just left off no I Love that it would be great great James thank\nYou so much a

this is very important to get to the bottom of is\nIn that area towards Democrats\nSo what it looks like right now and again these things can change with large developments obviously we know something like a ... were to break out these will change completely uh you know individual scandals can change these things as well but the Republicans look like as of this moment there in really good shape to control the Senate\nAnd a really bad shape to continue their control of the house\n\nAnd I mean\nI mean look at the X. dream policies that the left is looking to push in\nThrough the Democratic party\nSingle payer I'm Sorry a single payer health care free health care free college\nI'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for an even bigger a infrastructure package than what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero\nHe was the only one who publicly supported now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten or ... democratic candidates which by the way it will not be enough to ... to cover the field there's gonna be a lot more than I think uh but I mean everybody with the exception\nOf Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and it does endorse Medicare for all\nAll the big names are for it already there but many of them are co sponsors of the bill uh it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are\n... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible yeah we were scare mongers and racist for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stories will go through this tomorrow but I just\nWant to throw these that ship 'em Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college\n... no that is a fundamental um a a a a fundamental aspect of what brought the states together in the first place\nThe state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything well then ... what do we have\nIt can't be that way so we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter it will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat's pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected\nRight I'm only have to do is just just appeal to the big cities\nAnd by the way this this uh this is an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college and I know Trump supports that for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind\nBut uh there is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe this is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by cities\nMean that you know it'd be which it may not want that like as a Republican I certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\nRight or is it is should run themselves in the cities can run whatever they want and the rural or your skin do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has\nTo do and how to live they don't understand it taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them that also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous\nRight and it's ... the house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the it out right\nAnd you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could er race the mistake of the\nUh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate they way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things can be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed\nQuickly then the next ... the first check on the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much slower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for wrecked trying I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was Senator Barack Obama was center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they would be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power\nOf their state then it goes to the president and the president\nIs only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas like no that's the ... this is the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing\nThe Supreme Court and this story the constitution of the United states has failed\nOr you just arguing for king right with these the several stories in a row the mic give you the argument for it came\nRight I mean okay really they've failed or have we not been using them properly you know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and split lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed [laughter]\nOr no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for\nAnd I would also argue the failure park right you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane\nAbsolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland or Portland but I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry so you know the ... last week\nThe Portland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nFusing ...\nCan anybody just get up and start directing traffic in Portland and they just can I just go on the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City if you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared [noise]\nI mean especially if it was a union job would be you'd be in the bottom of the river [laughter] what what\nWhat laws do you even have in Portland now you can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's driving and he's like no I'm not gonna you're young women they break his window and chased him down\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the word gosh I don't know if you saw the mob in Portland this weekend but they had a a\nA law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff\nStarted beating kicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and the mayor ... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I I don't\nI mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any\nWorse he's trying to make it sound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right they they act and they're just thugs they don't act and their do nothing's\nIn Ninety seven points to have a double duty chaos\nFox News I'm Chris posture President Trump says he's spoken to the king of Saudi Arabia this morning about the disappearance of
