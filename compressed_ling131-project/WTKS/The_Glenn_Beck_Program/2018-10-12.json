the news that no one in the news is reporting on this but let me bring everybody up to speed if you haven't been following this guy\nIn a nutshell he worked for the Washington Post he's a revered revered reporter which makes me ... suspicious immediately but he's a revered ... a a reporter Washington Post he is the Saudi citizen\nHe was over in Turkey he's going to get married and so he's like I Need my divorce papers from the embassy and so he goes over to the Saudi embassy he tells his fiance weight in the car I'll be right back she waits right in front of the embassy\nHours and hours and hours going by she's calling his phone no answer on his phone he's not coming out\nShe calls the embassy and they say oh no he left he just he came here and we gave him the papers and he went and she's like I've been sitting outside but I'm not sure if he went out bill did he go out the front door yes so fill in the other guy\nMock moods says yes he went out the front door well CCTV cameras show that he didn't ever leave the Saudi embassy at least by the front door\nSo the next thing we find out this was yesterday as the Saudis are the Saudi prince\nLands of gulfstream his Gulf Stream it at the airport there I'm In turkey about an hour or so after the guy goes into the into the embassy\nThese guys get off the plane with what appeared to be a lot of empty suitcases they pile up in the back of the vans they're driving to the embassy they decide for some reason or another they need more empty suitcases\nThey buy some more empty suitcases they also stop just a real quick you know I don't know maybe the chef needed at the embassy but they needed a bones saw\nBy your bones saw Oh thank you so much now we can have soup and uh so they get the bones saw God only knows what they do in the embassy but they're seeing leaving about an hour later with really heavy suitcases they throw them into the back of\nThe van they throw them on the jet and the jet takes off meantime United States says we do have a we do have a an encrypted a messages showing that the Saudi prince was trying to\nIn ... tried to trap and get him into the embassy or get him back to Saudi Arabia a and today and I don't know if I Believe this because it's turkey but turkey says that they have either given to the United states or shown the United states\nThis video and audio they say they have surveillance in the embassy of him being questioned\nAnd then tortured and then murdered we don't know if that is true but that's the latest today\nSo ... we're going to find out who this guy is and was possibly ah when we come back because this is the part of this story no one surely\nCNN and Christiana autumn poor would want you to have this information will give that to your next [noise]\nLet me tell you

loved the crown prince they got along and and he said a lot of great things about the crown prince now he disagrees with some of the crown princes policies\nAnd that's where they've ... wants to take the Saudi out of Saudi Arabia basically that the best way to put it for this guy but he's a he's not a good guy he\nWants to political Islam he wants political Islam to invade countries all over the world and take it over and he was living here for quite a while before he went to work at Washington Post yeah no no issues there whatsoever\nI'm I'm On the other hand you have this one guy that's not that great of a guy even on the other hand you have a Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince who ever want to send this is this great reformer he he he's a great guy is a great leader is going to modernize Saudi Arabia women can drive now all these social is all these tackling he they dug\nPlain and simple he is eight Doug they go after he's doing this to tons and tons of people thousands of people in his own country people just disappear they go to jail for the rest of the life he is a thug and the only reason he's tackling social issues is because they have a lot of young people in Saudi Arabia\nAnd social unrest of the doubt that hit the streets have you want to see the place where the next uh Arab Spring might happen Saudi Arabia they the demographics point to it I Would not be surprised\nRattle so how do you keep Saudi Arabia under control do without a thug you can't I mean it's like Russia really either bright groups like other countries like that you really can't here's a disturbing part\n... most likely most likely this guy was killed by Saudi Arabia yeah um it just it just feels like a man and maybe all of a sudden he pops up and I'm like\nNo I was a chick fillet and nobody in the news media wants to look at chick fillet so I was invisible for a while\nMaybe doubtful here's the problem we are ... we are pushing through a major arms deal with Saudi Arabia we should not be doing that now we should not be doing that that should be canceled today I can tell you however what is being what is happening is\nYou know the United states was supporting the Muslim Brotherhood now we have some people who know exactly what's going on in that part of the world and there are probably being talked to by Saudi Arabia go and look look guys guys\nYeah I Know you don't like what we're doing here but ah it's the Muslim Brotherhood and its a caliphate you what you want the whole region to be in the Muslim Brotherhood caliphate\nHave at it yeah and that's the decision our president is is having to make it's why we should stay out of other people's businesses amen stay out of their business chemical production yeah\nSo I think that Saudi Arabia will eventually own up to this because I think the evidence will come after them I think they'll they'll blame a very familiar a photo and they'll say it's the deep state the beach they did this no shelter

lady has ah\nIt's played grace and a great composure a and I don't care how you feel about the president I think enough is enough with Melania Trump\nYeah I mean I don't see her I'm\nIn a position where she's being vilified on a daily basis by the press they sniper at her for a long time I'm very charming woman a very intelligent um love shoulder and\nUm I think she's done a very good job as first lady and there's really no reason to disparage malaria Trump\nYou know ... my breaking point was last week when she was over in Egypt and she was over in Africa yeah and the the photos coming back of her\nWere beautiful I mean it was a Ralph Lauren photo spread and all the press could do was if they published any of those photos or they just tore her down for colonialism and all this crap\nErroneous I Know uh and then here she is where the hang on the most beautiful woman in the oval office with the with the greatest style since Jackie oh they love Camelot and her style she was on the cover of every fashion magazine\nBut no fashion magazine we'll put millennia Trump\nOn you know of course she couldn't go out\nTo their cocktail parties and all that it it it there you do your commentary on the political correctness the eight percent but back in ... you left out some really big things could never have happened without the ... in support of the media\nYes I like the media hinted at eight percent directors\nHey let me just tell you a quick story okay All right so this week I've been doing a lot of a promotion for killing the ss which came out on Tuesday and in that promotion I'm basically saying that we in America are seeing a rise of hate an evil\nAnd I tie it in a number of ways one of the ways that I tied it in was that George Soros at his crew have bought up about twenty packs political action committees\nAnd they sent they send them out on missions and one of those missions was Senator Flake in the elevator with the CNN camera right behind a woman's screaming at him\nBecause she was a victim of something\nAnd he was an idiot for not the siding with her who's the woman the woman is an activist and the Soros pack making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year All right so I tell that story which is a tire early accurate a hundred percent correct and media matters within a half an hour says that I compared the woman to the third Reich\nOkay\nNow that's what's going on here that that's what's in play so the eight percent progressive zealots fanatics couldn't never\nHaving pose any thing on this country without the media taking up their cause and actually doing the dirty work\nI put the media in that eight percent it's the it is the reason why it has swept the country it is you're right because of the media but they are part of that eight percent\nLook what happened and Kanye West my favorite guy of all time [laughter]\nOkay yeah so Kanye West who I I I didn't really made um I was in an elevator with him at Madison Square garden went around me I'd short pants on I mean it was brooding\nRight okay so he goes on Saturday Night live which has staked out territory to destroy Donald Trump because it's good for Saturday Night lives ratings that's why they do it\nAll right so ... goes gets invited to go anywhere is to make America great again hat and and no one likes him and he ... he he's he's brooding again 'cause he's being bullied by Saturday Night live OK fought\n'em then because of that Trump invites them to the oval office work ... walks in with the hat and and uh does ... the president or whatever they

U. T. H. and she had a German Shepherd dog as most of the ... did and she terrorized women I participated in heinous crimes against it\nBefore the war she was a seamstress and went to work and came home and

doing a\nTwo hours of for us every day tell if anybody if they don't know who you are explain who you are [noise]\nI I think you know we have a slightly different way of doing things uh than what you were probably typically here in conservative talk radio a wine is we're mindful of the things we're actually trying to conserve is kind of nowadays conservative means I'm not a communist\n[laughter] are you just moving in with pat when you say the second best why here's we did have had it he's number one and in space by our space butter space by your number\nTo help move in that I understand why this is why he is a genius [laughter] do you\nKnow I we actually talking about the things we're trying to conserve the values and virtues that made America exceptional and where they came from in the first place it we we like to start arguments even more than we like to win them\nBecause we think that one of the big problems in our country you know there's this idea that we're really divided in were arguing all the time 'cause we're not argument at all\nWhat we're doing is we're grabbing Seventeen burner accounts on social media calling each other anonymous names\nAre returning to the uh uh the ... factory of of the the smell that we prefer of our own tribe and uh and didn't never retreat from our own native sweat lodge convinced for right about absolutely everything over lobbing verbal bombs at our neighbor over there and we never talk to and we're calling that an argument okay\nI I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out\nAh you know I kind of I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend ... and I'm perfectly fine having a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them myself I had a doctor or a decade or so in Studio this weekend or this last week\nUm we had Dave Ruben who else a stew here recently Michael reckon walled that Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter and we don't agree on everything mhm but\nI'm looking for the people who you can't have a conversation with somebody\nWho is who's goal it is to say\nRights apply to certain people right and not\nTo others is there isn't there a there is a line\nOf who you can have a Congress there is\nAnd you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentleman we need to understand that distinction between an opponent and enemy\nAnd a liberal and a leftist an opponent is someone who disagrees with you maybe even Vietnam and will do whatever they can within the boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas in the arena of ideas in enemy is somebody who wants to end you\nAn enemy of somebody has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with you literally game with you or an office building with you uh and then you look at what's the difference between a liberal and a leftist ... you know a liberal is somebody that wants the government to permit you to do things God says are immoral and dumb\nThis is somebody that wants to government to compel you to do those things\nAnd if you will not do those things that God says or immoral and dumb than us Erick Erickson likes to say you will be made to care the full course of power of government will be brought down upon me ah because you it it's you know resistance as few tile and you're watching this existential transition happening\nThe left in our culture and we're we're we're there aren't really too many liberals anymore and the reason why you're struggling to find people to have these conversations with in the media arena where we work is\nThere's not too many of them left I think there are the outside outside of\nThe Haiti arena I agree that there are you know I see\nPeople people think that I Want to have conversations with you know I Want to your you're going to bring in so and so and they're going to have a conversation with them you can't talk to them no Nancy Pelosi\nI Can't talk ... she has no interest in she has the auto industry wants to end you want to share a country where the best it's\nThe best thing is is that you could possibly say the most charitable thing on both sides is they just want to win ... so they'll do anything to win and some of them will go so far as when they leave the room go that guy's got to be stopped um and that's dangerous but that's not who I'm Talking about\nNot talk about my mom a lot because she had me at Fifteen share pregnant with me at fourteen she found out she was pregnant with me Christmas break Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd wrote the way it happens a month later and she decides not to have an abortion\nAnd so my mom and I literally grew up together and you know I become this Alex ... cheating wannabe kid of the eighties and she's your typical single mom government should do for people what they can't do for themselves you know and and and it has a different view of politics than me and for many years we couldn't talk about politics and\nSo as I started growing more and conservative media we disagreed with and bring it up when we got together as a family has it gotten away of everything a funny things happened the last few years they'll guys she's bringing it up now to me\nThat she semi retired now because of medical disability and so she watched a lot of what's on your screens I don't watch any cable news at all or England or I Can't I Can't and ... do you watch a never\nEnding up when I'm On the air that yeah yeah ... India and unless it's ... hang on just a second I Want the audience to know that's unheard of in our business that you could not have done this job great without watching cable news you know three years ago right and\nI mean I keep up on clips that go violence ... long form it's just toxic ingestion and the vast yeah my mom watches a lot more of this she actually likes your show quite a bit both actually\nAnd he's a brilliant woman but one of the things she came to me one day before the twenty twelve election and she brought it up she started bringing politics up to me um you know unprovoked and she said you know I was so happy when Brock Obama\nOne in a way that we had shattered the racial ceiling and out of the blue she said to me she goes I I Wonder sometimes when I watch the things he says and he does that he's actually a communist [laughter] let me away wow okay yeah um and I watched the way you know my mom is one of those people that is fine Weiss Obamacare\nThinks that Medicare for all his okay we need to be a ... like health care for ... she's not find with if you don't change your religion for the government we shut you down and put you in jail and she's not fine if we we get five hundred million dollars a year your money to Planned Parenthood so he's not find with ...\nSo I've I've recently come to this feeling that we have caused problems of communication\nBecause we have seen Obamacare and we know what the we know those who designed it we know they want single payer health care okay we know that they are socialist that are ... drawing this up\nBut the people who like your mom and the regular people on the on the liberal side on the Democratic side\nThey're not for communism they're not for the end of capitalism they just believe in more welfare they just believe in a bigger hand to help and so when we say this is socialism they hear that as you're a communist and they're like we're not communists right and so we have\nWe have put a giant blanket over the entire voting public of Democrats\nAnd made them feel like we're calling them communists they don't feel like they're communist and they're not communist but it is provide that cover has provided cover if you will for the actual Marxist communists that are that are trying to say and capitalism\n... when you look at you know for the last twenty five years I've been involved in full time a political advocacy either as a host or an activist or I worked on numerous campaigns are run the gamut I've done everything in our movement other than run for office basically myself\nAnd I'm ... when you look at the for the last for all the course of our careers that GOP consultancy industry has has designed a strategy to chase a voter that does not exist and this is filtered down and do the talking points we in conservative media get from these people\nAnd that is that the average GOP consultant believes America wants on wants limited government like the Koch brothers and Saddam and Gomorrah at the same time\nIt's actually totally in reverse the majority of ... and you know it's fascinating is Putin a huge study on this\nBreaking it down into twenty sixteen electorate at the bit libertarian the myth of the libertarian voter man how they define them that that voter largely does not exist as a unicorn okay the reality is and I've seen this on every GOP campaign for every candidate from state house to president I've ever worked on\nThe amount of pushback we get on our social beliefs compared to your the party of big business who wants to leave me off and doesn't care about me guy just tend to one at minimum it's not even close and the reality is most voters are in favor of bigger government\nWith better moral values and this is the secret sauce that Trump tapped into in the last election the irony is that the ultimate heat nist\nAbsolutely embraces all of these cultural flashpoints he didn't say he didn't give you the token I'm pro life he stood up in front of a hundred million people at the presidential debate and said I'm going to appoint justices that will overturn roe [laughter] okay\nAgain now more bad news radio Ninety seven point seven to twelve Ninety double duty chaos [noise]\nWelcome to the program so glad that your hair returning with us Steve days pat gray a stew steeper gear or executive\nProducer and of course my charming self um we're talking about uh the Democrats in what they have done this week just with Hillary Clinton coming out and saying you can't have a civil conversation with these people\nI don't know who these people are that these people used to be a sign of racism uh but you can't talk about these people are and then Eric Holder in the week that we have a video of somebody actually kicking a protester ... um we have ever called her saying a kick them when they're down\nIs this the is this the or is this the\nBeginning of the end for the Democrats or is this the end of the beginning\nOf time um I I Hope it's the beginning of the end\nBecause um I I think most Americans with the ... with the any sensibility left in them\nOr are being turned off by the Democrats right now I I think they've you know we talked about this many times I think maybe now they have overplay their hand we thought maybe that would have happened a year or two or three or four a goal but um I think after the Kavanaugh hearings and all that's going on now with the stability thing\nThat they're completely uh uh issuing I think\nI think people have had enough of them\nSo is it important for us to change a say I think people have had enough of the Democrats because of that blanket people who vote Democrat think wait I'm a Democrat or is it better to say I think people have enough of this leftist no movement\nI I think it's the latter mhm and I think that um you're you're watching I Know it's a popular term in another context these days but you're watching a transition happen\nAnd you know we kind of pretended as if on the rights that just surrendering I'm America's youth ministry known as our education system to cultural Marxist for forty years um wasn't going to have any repercussions whatsoever\nAnd now you're watching the first fruits of that harvest are coming home to roost at the moment\nI and we are we're we're not even I don't even think we're polarized anymore I think we're Balkan iced they get the reference I'm making here so okay\nLet's let's pick it up there how do we um how do we come come back and ah how do we start reaching out to the people who actually do have much more in common with us because they do believe in the bill of rights even though the people in Washington may not back in ...\nHe's news radio Ninety seven points and an end well

points\nYou ask\n[noise] so we talked about this a little bit on the news and why it matters last night uh and I and I asked the group\nIt\nWas a turning point for the Democratic party the leadership\nI think it was there was a spiritual turning point and it was when they denied God three times in their platform I mean I just I find it incredible that they actually did it three times I mean it's just so biblical mhm\nAnd you are you are seeing\nA in you're seeing the things that I talked about in my in my novel the eye of ...\nPeople don't know that they are repeating rituals they don't know what's really going on but there we are repeating Old Testament stuff from the Democrats really are\nProgressive as him and I think this is why the churches on the defensive collectively in the culture it's because\nIt is it it's looked at the clown show that we often see on right wing cable news of\nGuys who pretend to be ministers but really they're just ministers of the church or wherever the GOP guy that gives them\nOn the table at the moment is or the Democrat or the Democrat on the other side you're right but I mean in terms of people have a discerning spirituality which would tend to lean more conservative ... and so there's a lot of a discerning people in our poll pits that\nHad decided they don't want to be the next Ralph Reed clown show on cable news basically and so they're just going to vacate the public sphere altogether which is kind of a false choice really yeah\nBut and it's because they don't understand that progressive isn't isn't a political ideology it's a religion\nIt is it's the it's the and I say this on our show all the time Glenn it's the it's the area is Marcy on ... you know great heritage throughout the course of the history of the church that's what this is of this era it has its own Herman nuke\nIt has its own creation myth dosing Darwinism it has its own in ... where the state essentially replaces the church and government is the becomes God like chest hurts and said when the government removed the God the government will become the God and that's what you're dealing with here the same reaction you're getting from a leftist when you trigger them on their on their state isn't\nIt the same reaction that you would get with your beliefs if you walk down the walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan a quote unquote moderate Arab nation\nWalk down the streets of Amman, Jordan where they're queen is a Seventy five on a scale of one to ten and a king seems to be a modern her mind in his right walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan said this guy say I'm Christians and Muslims worship the same God makes year wearing ... and find out first that they have a Second Amendment in ... in Amman, Jordan because your life will be in danger\nAnd that's what you're witnessing here this is religious fervor you're you're attacking their idol this is not mere political disagreement this isn't even just fundamental existential philosophical disagreement vicious religious fervor you're dealing with the loose it sanity that coach predicts\nI just want to say the first part of that ah the dissertation I only understood about ten percent\n[laughter] pet them short were they so they\nTranslate that into human language\nUh I I I think we see that with global warming\nWith a with their reaction to abortion within this Robie weighed thing that means absolutely everything they worship at the altar of these things it it really is a religious fervor\nYou know that you see with them and and this is kind of the the point of the ... ... ... is\nThis is pale as his\nYeah they if they don't necessarily know they don't know but that doesn't change the fact that what they're doing it was the worship of the environment and the sacrifice of your children he wanted your children to be sacrificed on an idle\nYou would have permit skew as sex at a celebration of bail you could do anything in the woods and the girls in the groves and then when you got pregnant he would call you back and they would slaughter the newborn baby right I I mean it is exactly the worship of bail\nThere's nothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period who himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows this history very well when he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in a New Testament world and Romans one\nVoice when he when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff that would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around I I think we do bad stuff\nBecause we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of been forces itself and so you're dealing with people that what's the wind in the in the New Testament there when you exchange the
