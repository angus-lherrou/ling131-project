I mean we're unlike any other nation on earth when it comes to guns in our history take me through like a either Sam colder or buffalo bill who am I ...\n... ... probably the most amazing Americans

WMGK ...\nI Would love to talk to you and maybe we'll do this or on Thursday um anybody who has read the book and wants to ah talk about it I Would love to talk to you about it and hear your thoughts where I might have missed it where what you may not understood\nUm you know what what do you think is crazy or what is good if you've read the book addicted outrage can we put this on a Thursday I'd like to hear from you Thursday on radio and we'll take calls on Thursday ... a ... just about the book\nKnow given people enough time to actually read it yeah which is nice yeah I think he wanted to do this like the day after ... did not everybody reads that fast so [laughter] so it's been out for weeks\nNow and if you've read it or let's talk about it on because there's all there's a ton a ton in there\nI I think it explained so much about what we're seeing with a capital case right now I think it's\nI think it's absolutely in line with ... well it's amazing because I think a lot of people if you're trying to look at it and you're in you're just playing teams a lot of people would just be like the Democrats are the worst and they're insane but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats\nAnd they sound completely insane about this capital thing yeah completely off the rocker these are people that I Know people who I'm friendly with\nAnd the extent that they'll go to here to try to take all male crime ... in in the last twenty five years and apply it to this one guy where there's no evidence that he committed any sort of crime\nAnd that sort of jump is not it's not just hey they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade\nThere is a different part of this it's about throwing the entire um the entire effort of logic off base it's based in post modernism huh it's explained in the book and you'll see the times I look at it so I'm like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things\nAny fence and there's easy political explanations for all that but it's not real the real basis of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean and it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book\nBecause I think it is the perfect example\nMaybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories in the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah you can find it in the book addicted to outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way\nA and the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels uh and the the upper echelons of politics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe\nWhat they're saying they're doing it because they have a goal in their goal is to disrupt the hierarchy in the patriarchy\nAnd to collapse the system that we have\nYeah and if you've ever had someone who has an addiction problem in your life ... or ... you see them acting a radically and there's some reason and you don't understand that why would they do this they blew their job why they do this they blew their marriage all those things why would the left act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just how how and why this is going on but how to push back against that and how to defeat it\nYeah it is not a a it's not a book about surrender it is a book about stand and fight just fight the right way\nJust know who your enemy is the tactics that they're using and fight the right way it's called addicted outrage we'll talk about it on Thursday with you so if you're reading it tried to finish it by a by Thursday if you haven't started yet please do 'em and uh and then join us on a joined us on Thursday\n[noise] okay [noise] um we've we've

which again\nI'm so we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concern oh yeah we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know she gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist\nOh thank you stop at yard important it's so important is very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold a role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr or or or um uh\nAttorney general general attorney general would ready to go one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's cause for certain candidates or who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused or by a woman\nIn ... he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this ... there's a separation between the cabinet case in the aisles the case of the cabinet case happens or thirty six years ago by the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but it's the one difference ...\nA professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nYeah she's a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort between Oregon Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that really got both of those so there are a little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay actually does what did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course\nWell yeah well in their words case they both have a notes from there do they do around those cases are the the Ford case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which he referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now and never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries ah um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might know it's a slight distinction between those two things one\nHas notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll usually meeting me\nYeah and so she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos of the incident and has photos of bruising on her the other one of course does not um being forced she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with the of course\nI'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties\nNone of them can remember it happening then people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she had named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nOr the dolphins a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax I'm\nWriting um the pictures and are those are things that\nShe showed two co workers in real time\nReal time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that Ford told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like having a I've said the name Kavanaugh even at\nThat time yeah but ... and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape well\nThere was a videotape now we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the\nWith the veil and ... and we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact I don't know\nHundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we I mean like we have them out more we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alice in
