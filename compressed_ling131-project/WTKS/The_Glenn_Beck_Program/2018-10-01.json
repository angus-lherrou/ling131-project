I got something last night have you seen the copy by the way hello soup have you seen the a copy of um of a\nRachel ... yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser ah Christine afford\nShe was the she was a woman that ah was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend\nShe well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years experience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by Brock Obama's head of homeland security as the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year let me say that again\nThe woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was per rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nSo she's not a democratic hack and also\nNot a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true\nShe goes in her expertise is on old crimes to be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win\nAll right before I continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this\nWe're not going to see any uh CNN sock it to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats left wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating to you\nI Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that Dr\nFord identified other witnesses to the event\nAnd those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them she then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court\nNot for prosecution but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and quote\nIt's pretty significant do you think and again like she's being portrayed as this Republican hack to go after this uh this poor woman because she was a girl you mean ... yeah Brock Obama's ah the homeland security prosecutor addicts crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility in with a left\nYes so she's saying that it's it's it won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee this explains in my opinion why it was leaked in the final hour\nBecause every one who saw this knew exactly what it was\nNow she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute it may look like she's credible ah but based on what she said not how she looked\nYou are looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this is this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session lists the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in her late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six\nBut then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein is office the date of attacked change to the early eighties\nNow you might say what difference does it make well if you say you're in your late teens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen\nYou're in high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political\nMid eighties late teens\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years it gets better this is the again I'm quoting\nI'm quoting the um the report it gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers\nShe was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged tack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens\nIf you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out\nThe early Nineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was falls\nAnd it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post Ford narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks\nFor what was supposedly one of the most traumatic unimportant Nick ... events of her life\nMy favorite part of the deal is the fact that it's going to turn a this hemisphere back into a manufacturing powerhouse we're going to be able to reclaim our

you avoid activities that sort of ... joins down just a simple ringing out of a lost cause it puts a lot of pressure on your joints in your hands your fingers and you notice something painful when you

guy sounds like he was a complete\nTorque when he was the ... when he was in high school\nThis is somebody who kept ... you can see on his talent or he literally has no someone whose parents would ground him\nI mean this guy was a complete door in high school and he's like the kind of guy who if he comes home with your daughter or your sister you'd say she really did well first off this was great I'm really happy so the thought that this guy was running a gang rape cartel\nIn the suburbs of Maryland is just asinine on his face but you're saying is that we have entered I think that we abandon a traditional forms of religion and now we're in the church of the social justice right where we just believe things based on a matter of faith based on historical\nRiders of injustices and notions\nAnd that's what's happening here late that they want to believe that this guy did all these horrible things or because you know women have had it rough for many years and there there there has been a lot of sexism and there it's still exists therefore he's guilty right it's a it's very similar to the rationale we saw in the OJ Simpson trial but almost in reverse\nThis is like reliving the O. J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he was guilty because the LAPD is allegedly races\nRight so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago that the that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black man for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life\nAnd they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believed he was a was innocent\nMore than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community they all know that he killed the un Nicole\nAnd they all know it so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and it let me tell you I think a\nDoctor's poured who testified she's a serious person she as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt or testimony ah I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws or just a it's\nA series of inconsistencies that would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right so the fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications\nAnd political communication so I understand how talking points are circulated\nAnd how people get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized to support look the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucify someone with zero evidence\nAnd then what they're doing now is that you're moving the goalposts right I I saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about ah well you know he must have drank when he was in\nIn college or whatever who cares\nIt's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like waiting at him hey Lawrence those goalpost seem kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo Shankar what we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat or who are has not lost his footing ah with with reason [noise] um so the address people\nAddress people who are let's say a twenty something female that says you know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes and there's also a a a chance that he was db Cooper ready to be ... you have to go by the evidence and the case you have to evaluate a cases based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular situation\nOther people that are just as qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he is he's a centrally being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system shorter murder\nSo the question now is the economist is right and there is no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion in fact all of the evidence that has been presented is exculpatory right the the guys calendar clear is that right\nIt's testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also clear as him so you you have to\nCast that aside and then if you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely find that's the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic where we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nThe way there's is in court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but ... you're you're you you were asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made with zero Robert of evidence zero independent\nEvidence to back us up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nHer testimony she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline when this happened to four times so I think people need to cast this aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nHe is going to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is\nIt guilty by association ride mark judge\nI I'd never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of the country has never met met right so we're just going off of your city right now\nAnd based on his own memoirs of somebody who was a very quotable person who had a serious drinking issues it's not bred cabin where we are not nominating mark judge of the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with his judicial philosophy that's fine\nBut well we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family that's like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud right we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations\nJust because we disagree with them politically or ideologically at the state and that's what they do in in in ... public spending third world countries that's not what we are in the United states of America\nJohn Carlos ... a Democrat when when we come back I I I Want to ask you if you don't mind holding on for a second general do you have to I'm I actually have to run the meeting well okay All right let's run to the ... we'll talk some other time but thank you so much [noise]\nI really want to I really want to hear from people\nWho are in the can respond to what I'm hearing\nFrom the Democrats now which is um um we just have to stop all of these people the people all the people on the all the people on the right you know we need to break up their dinners you know as I said earlier one one prominent Democrat said\nWe should um ... what stops us from disturbing people where they sleep\nDemocrats are concerned that given the limited time that the FBI has to work with or the week is it agents won't be able to complete the kind of comprehensive background investigation that Democrats would like to see now the FBI

hello Larry how are you\nAt Glenn how you doing good morning the morning or so I wanted to talk to you I'm really from the beginning if you have time to tell me the story of your life because you were you've had kind of a rough childhood\nYour your dad was black your well your mom was white and they weren't married he was in the sixties\nThat's not a popular thing moms moms family she was afraid wouldn't accept you is that how it started that's true okay tell me the story from there\nSure um I was born in Manhattan I'm as you as you said by racial parents and my my biological mom didn't take the family would accept me so she put me up for adoption\nSo uh my bicycle father was not in my life\nSo I don't know um what he was thinking but that he wasn't in my life so I was very lucky and I was adopted by a biracial couple um my mother was ah my mom who was my mother um was German\nAnd met my father who was black and the army in Germany they brought me to the south Bronx and that's where I was raised by Yankee Stadium\nAnd you might know in the seventies and sixties when I was raised this was not the best neighborhood um so that's where I was raised a my father was a corrections officer at Rikers um the jail here in New York City and my mother was a waitress and then worked in a bank\nShe then I left and we all we live together we we rate got enough money so we actually are packed up it was at the Long Island when I was around eleven years old my father finally made enough money at my mother we worked hard to get that we got out of the the bad neighborhood and got to Long Island and when my ... my father died he died of cancer and when he passed away it was very hard for my mom\nBecause how old were you\nI was a twelve going so when my father died um my mother's family was in Europe and that basically abandoned her for leaving and my father's family I'm a band that has also\nSo we were basically now\nI'm at that point I was very hard for myself and my mom of course as you could assume so by the time I was Seventeen I was ready to get out of here and I decided to get out and I thought you know what I'm gonna go off I'm going to join the army that's what I saw it on the go join the army like my father would be like my dad and go join the army\nSo I go off to the recruiting station ... in this case they're all for recruiters in the same building and I go

you're from queens how do you know you know what's right for upstate\nI don't that's the point and guess what you don't know what's right for me in Queens either were even\nHow let you be you you let me be me and we can all be free to gather\nOne tons of bad work it has words\nThat's our original idea we just haven't done it in a long time so so Larry tell me your day one you're governor of New York what do you do\nThere are several things I have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so the vote because a five way race in New York state and we are plurality state not a majority of ... we don't require fifty one percent there's often go\nWhoever has the most that's how New York state works so I can actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing\nI'm going to happen ... percent ... percent of the vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be forward to going this is the most important single\nElection in the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more boring as a whole but as one single election if I come in first it changes the entire nation overnight it does not just the Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is this the ... yeah this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was get ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nAbsolutely it is that important even coming in second\nWould shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it would make better Democrats embed Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our protection the Democrat\nThey don't have to worry about small business they don't have to about smaller government they will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant is just I'll protect you from the evil left\nAnd all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties that's supposed to be but they don't\nSupposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right but when there's a third party that will libertarians can point the finger and say Democrats what happened what happened to civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government now they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\nThere will be a massive\nA massive culture shock within within the uh the state and within the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back\nI don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire for years as my assumption and I'm fine with that\nBut I have to focus on several things one a complete re board of education\nTo a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay for things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and Washington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government's\nNext that the credit culture of transparency is a problem with local governments now is they're enforcing the kings will\nSo they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied and I don't want the state government to be I'm the king and I and force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nSounds like you've read the constitution or what is that I don't know I\nKnow I Know it's I'm not sure where he's an old the theology to document\nTheir ego yes anyway I think we throw it away awhile ago but yes that's my point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families met her individual businesses but individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs growth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value\nTo each community we don't do that well in New York state it all we have things called regional economic economic development ah corporations which Albany which is the capital and decides where the money is spent\nAnd opened his eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county\nHow buttons that the county's can start to budget to zero so they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas volunteerism how about the concept\nGive you to an interesting concepts one instead of me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation and through lowering spending\nHere's one idea that does both of those we have a bridge is right now in New York state\nAnd one of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial bridge named after our well family that's embarrassing how 'bout instead that Britain's named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights for the bridge we retain the asset I got in a business guy like giving my ass at up\nI'm going to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime straight contractual that's all these companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year a marketing they dropped twenty million dollars on a stadium name that she was in the weekends\nI got a bridge you can name and that bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times on every single day during rush hour and a sixteen person ... uh sixteen million person metro area\nAnd a hundred thousand of cars pass at every single day you will easily dropped the main dolls and that if not more\nOn that taxes hang on just like a Texas New York's popular says Texas you should listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\n\nAbsolutely but he is part now we have them do maintenance again\nWe own it so we still we still inspect it so damages though our responsibility their job is just to repair it right\nThey begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lower spending not just that contracts don't come through Albany less corruption someone else's spending and spending it so guess what lassie fix bridges bridges right now in New York state collapse we don't have enough money these guys do what you have\nSafe or bridges less money and guess what we can start with holes in New York and New York city some bridges costs Fifteen dollars you know I don't know if you're a truck driver I don't think a truck driver you pay by the axle you're dropping Seventy five two hundred bucks to cross the bridge\nLess money less corruption safer better service boom we raised billions of dollars this is just one idea and there are many of them no one else talks about them this is what we have to work on a New York state\nWe can do that so where you are you ... it's amazing to me how we are running\nHeadlong just willing to give up everything that we have already ... the freedoms that we have and embrace democratic socialism yes\nBut we won't embrace this very American idea how do you\nHow do you get the common sense Democrat and Republican who has been raised in New York so their mentality is me this one cell in Texas how do you get them in New York to see guys this this that\nIt's already seller before the Republicans and they all kept given up I mean they don't show up\nOr the Democrats I think
