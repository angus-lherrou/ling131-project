News radio covers the world\nOn news radio seven point seven\nPackages number eight and nine nine Dave Anthony Fox News found this morning police in Delaware just intercepted one mailed the former vice president Biden looking very similar to all the other ones aren't the Democrats another turned up at five AM in New York City\nIt was addressed to Robert De Niro it was found in the mail room of try Becca film production vice security personnel they noticed that this package looked exactly like the one that has been on TV the same characteristics that heavy manila envelope I'm the block lettering v the postage stamp on Fox's\nAnd you took the time to print a medium that has the ISIS flag and underneath it\nIt's a quote from Larry the cable guy that says get\nHer done except none of your bombs get it done none\nThey've had zero chance of making it through security screening and Wylie coyote I think must have known that at some point the coyotes got\nTo go this dam road runner keeps going getting away maybe it's me\nDo you think Hillary Clinton actually personally checks her mailbox every time you know to see of or Amazon Prime order came in and do you think George Soros does every person that has been sent one of these package has mail screening these devices were not designed\nTo kill but to be detected caught and seen Wylie coyote wanted a media circus and boy did he get one\nNow I Am not going to speculate whether Wiley really is from the right or from the left\nI don't know there's a lot of not jobs out that are looking to change narratives before the midterms no one knows yet this could be a kid that just thought this would\nBe funny again there's no chance these bombs would go off so maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who's so screwed up he just doesn't even know what he's doing\nThere's also the possibility someone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other\nThis however is not stopping the left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste by noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's a wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about his rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\nYou know what this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a left wing guy or just a crazy person they will never report that\nCould I ask when the president has actually called for violence now you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\nCalling the media fake news\nIs not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence encouraging your electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business and Maxine Waters\nIsn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility or Clinton I mean I could go on but we all know the laughs narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms\nIs\nIs over or that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue many of our friends and the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked that this kind of attack occurred\nOne person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first of all that would force one to deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back\nSo deep in your memory bank you might need a hypnotists or therapists to bring this memory back at it so long ago\nOh wait a minute no it was just a couple of weeks ago the rice and letters just sent to the White House James Mattis FBI Director Christopher Wray CIA director Gina Haspel air force secretary Heather Wilson chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson did you just happened\nTo him forget all about all of those or should I take you back to the baseball diamond which was way but I mean how old were you in twenty Seventeen\nHe barely remember was I walking at the time I don't even know\nAnd as far as the identity of Wylie coyote for those of you in the mainstream media it's really best not to speculate\nIf you don't know you should say you don't know here's who I think this is\nI don't know there's no evidence on any saying everything is speculation\nAnd if I Would say Ari ... versus a left wing person trying to ramp everybody up\nWhat would that do that would choose the people listening\nAnd they'd say oh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters\nAnd blaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\n\nYou know [noise] if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts\nYou do something like that and something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\n\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny cold credibility\nBut you'd have to be you'd have to be interested in having some credibility to be able to gain it\nWell for\nThe second day in a row Jason ... who is with us that it he is I'm\nA former [noise] I'm\nA former military intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I eat\nThese Jason how ridiculous is this bomb the most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever seen it sort of when I when we first looked at I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder\nAnd um I I was looking at it and I was like\nNo not really I mean it's a plot you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the shrapnel is what's dangerous and a pipe bomb the explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need you [laughter]\n[laughter] right um but there's another ingredient that they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it\nUm that they said they did detect some of that in there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again the everything's spec is it is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing\nA lower or\nSomebody who didn't know what they're doing but they didn't want it to work\nIt had no I mean if you're looking at this thing there is a you know and I've also spent some time in some insecurity all the people that they sent these are these packages to\nThey have screening services whether it's the secret service private security or like places like CNN on media companies have the same thing you you ... you would think that this person would no well I was no chance just gets to the coverage I heard yesterday was this was a sign of how advanced and serious the situation but there was a ...\nYou can't say often to point to our right at that time on timing to you could've\nBlown up the post in it so that there was a photo timer it when it was just probably a digital counter that was doing nothing but that was was kind of funny is the wires were going into that with the way of doing\nRush is next it knew now more back on news radio twelve Ninety and Ninety seven points to have a double duty chaos [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nFox News I'm Chris posture the FBI in Delaware\nIs investigating a suspicious package that the former

yesterday\nAnd this was addressed to Robert De Niro who we know is a free one critic of President Trump and if there is one common thread through all of that it is that the packages that we're saying yesterday were sent to people who have drawn his eye or at one point or another Fox\nFive New York's Robert Moses their President Trump on Twitter says a very big part of the anger we see today in our

they go off like let's say you open an envelope mhm you would pull a string in that era in that area which would make the bomb go off [noise] I'm I'm trying to figure out welcome to the program pat gray from pat gray unleashed\nUm I'm trying to figure out pat what was the timer timing to\nEither this is the worst bomber of all time in human history or there's something else going on here because you why would you put a a sticker on a bomb\nI I ... I guess I've seen pictures of people in the military for example who are about to fire a missile and they put like Osama bin Laden name on it or something like I guess in theoretically possible but if you know of bombs going to explode why would you put a sticker of a right wing me mom and sugar ...\nAnd less and less again potentially a you thought maybe they wouldn't blow up and that people would see the right wing meat\nYeah right like it's almost as if they put on the outside of the envelope open with care this is an explosive so that they wouldn't explode it's not one of the nine has gone off\nBy all put they also put glass in instead of ball bearings or anything metal you walk metal as your as your shrapnel you you you wouldn't put glass in the bomb would just\nDisintegrate the glass even more ... you you don't want it in PVC pipe you wanted in a metal pipe because of the shrapnel\nThis is just it's there's just too many things wrong with this and again it might just be somebody who was sick and demented ... and ... that was the end the stupid or it might be some kid that thought this would be funny it might be some\nYou know mentally deficient\nA right winger that did it it also may be somebody who was on the left is like oh I Know how to change the narrative could be that two of\nQuaint don't know I mean you have to have some level of skepticism of the south\nOf the of the obvious narrative here right or which is some right wing or did this I think the first thing that makes you leap to that is it's not the haven't exploded\nRight so if you are trying to harm someone usually you'd be able to do it okay the same thing applies I Believe two white powder arriving to the president whenever I hear that whenever right wing ... figures are hit with a bunch of white powder in the mail my first thought is\nWell okay obviously you'd think it's someone who is opposed to them but would take a ... minute here and considered that someone is trying to make the president or some other right wing figure look like they're under attack especially when it turns out not to be right then and just white powder\nWide someone do that well of course there should be skepticism we've had these these things have happened a hundred times unbelievable I mean it's so much just to listen to this I suppose he thinks the communist didn't set fire to the rice dog as well [laughter] I mean\nOf course take a moment to consider and and there's no reason to come to a conclusion because we have no idea at this point but you\nSee these statements that have come out from CNN\nAnd ... you know people just outwardly blaming\nThe rights and Donald Trump for this\nLook I don't we first of all you can't blame Donald Trump for the ... unless you think he actually was responsible does anyone think that he actually sent the bombs and brought them to George Soros is how well no but I think of our income Ida [laughter] unless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions we know that\nBut beyond that if you're gonna ... you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's an obvious incentive to make America ill that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs to go off\nIt's certainly possible but they are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault you do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some skeptical eye\nNot until now not into relief factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for people struggling with ordinary pain quite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains due to\nAging exercise and everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking it was nice long walks or playing golf or tennis\nYou can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor maybe all you need to lower or even eliminate these pain whole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something you need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick start\nNow only Nineteen Ninety five go on to order more [noise]\nLet's see if we can get you out of paying to go to relieve factor\nDot com\nCapsule or we have back rush Hannity and now mark Libyan weeknight ... news radio Ninety seven point seven and twelve Ninety W ...

are really finding a a quick way\nOr they seem to be to me that maybe she has a target on her for some of those are things that she said\nWhich is kinda fascinating because that'd be the I mean as we know that they're going to do you tell us talk to us constantly about the inequality between the sexes and and and how how those conservatives are really about Roy Moore oh he's a he's a bad guy\nA but we're going to find that when it comes to people like Matt Lauer and Brokaw and how many more at NBC it's been one of the biggest and not to mention ignoring the Harvey Weinstein thing for how long remembered they employed Ronan Farrow when he was writing the story and they gave it to the New Yorker\nI I you know all of that goes on and making Kelly happens to be one of the biggest critics of what happened and NBC and yet you know she has one comment that people don't like and she's gone that's fascinating\nNBC News uh chairman Andy lack released a statement following her

poked my eye out\nAnd she moved on\nThat to Americans are yes bad things happen we move on that yes people say things that I don't like we move on and yes things have changed\nWe're evolving we're learning\nNew things some things are outdated some things that are good or just being tossed out the window and somebody should say wait a minute let's not throw that away\nMegan Kelly ought to know that blackface is awful yes it's no longer acceptable but you know what\nIf it's a costume that his purpose flea ridden a ridiculing race as black face has done historically yes it's not kosher nor should it be\nBut notice what is happening here with Kelly ... is being fired not because she wore black face but because of words and I the ah question\nNot even she was advocating she was questioning why why is this wrong\nIf I'm not ridiculing people why is this wrong with that person light Diana Ross wanted to be like Diana Ross in a costume why is this wrong\nI think that deserves an answer\nInstead what we got was an apology I Am so sorry I shouldn't have oh please don't be me please don't beat me master please don't be mean [laughter] I don't want to know are whipping please don't beat me are you kidding me\nHow are we supposed to learn if we don't have civil conversations and yes once in a while we ask a question that's politically incorrect\n\nThe criteria in America right now has narrowed so far\nThat it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river if she floats we know she's a bigoted racist if she doesn't well we will will know that will know that she was innocent\nAnd this is so

the two packages that were addressed a former vice president Joe Biden have been intercepted that was originally thought to be just one one of those was found at a male facility in New castle Delaware the other in Wilmington in addition another one was found this morning at the Tribeca Film production office in lower Manhattan address to actor Robert De Niro\nAt the time but it's it's not really funny enough to be a standup comedian as we as a side has basically stand up comedy show or Michael Moore and tropical ad which cannot twenty sixteen right during the weeks before the election he's hoping to sway the election to Hillary\nWhen you when you say it when you say like we saw um I don't think you're yet you should be careful with the use of the week 'cause I don't think I don't think I could find two people maybe you and I don't know who else in his audience might have a seat that act\nYeah I think that dressed like a million bucks I mean his all his most slapped in the past few years and that's the kind of worse and worse sick oh did okay but\nTwelve years ago is really about a health insurance and what she claimed as a Cuban healthcare system was better than us and this was a it is sort of insane rats and no longer that rare you can find them everywhere and basically I I think they use audience that used to go to movies I never\nColumbine get a lot of young people in their twenties are really excited about that movie a forgotten about it maybe they moved on to cheer and chemical and compare a Daily Show and all these other alternative forms of comedy and\nUh you know Michael Moore as it is you're not really funny enough to be a comic\nAnd as a okay so it was just so you are you saying that it's just that he's not funny or that a is there anything can be said\nFor uh the fact that ah this this kind of stuff uh\nYou know you can get the actual people you get the people in office now saying these crazy things so he's not he's not the rebel anymore\nIt's this is not you know he was revolutionary and we're a rebels you know alliance and we all got to you know we're all in it together will now you've got Nancy Pelosi saying all the same stuff that he was saying\nRight there's no scarcity value to what he does anymore everyone's doing it uh there's a kind of pathetic moment at the end of star nine eleven nine\nWhere he does is Hitler montage and trying to say Trump is like Hitler as like interest into playing the speech the Trump inhaler and that's what everyone's been saying Trump is like Hitler on the left for about three years is like is the last one to this Trump is that what party it's so boring it's been done to death\nThat is amazing observation of just where the culture has gone because we have at that point it was a big deal when someone came out and essentially advocated for socialism in America\nI mean even when we talked about with Bernie Sanders and twenty Thirteen coming out with Medicare for all he got no co sponsors on that bill and twenty Thirteen now every major democratic candidate is pitching for that policy and they're not just talking about social you know there's a there's a problem in America where\nWe look at Canada and say that to socialize nation does not that's a capitalist nation that has socialized medicine and has other thing all sorts of welfare state yeah I had you know as welfare state that's not a socialist nation and they're now on the left\nPointing that out that we're calling for an end of capitalism I mean we've gone we've gone further than just saying yeah were you know where socialist like Canadians no no they're now saying no we want an\nEnd to capitalism and they're still getting elected to\nRead like a Mars mission and the leader of the parade for a while but now he's kind of\n... in ... it's ... it's kind of gotten ahead of the closest movie um capitalism a love story with uh the communist uh at them that you see the Soviet Nashville handsome and and I that kind of thing is is not that special anymore as the whole Democratic Party has gone so far left\nSo what does that say to you does that say as I say we're\nIn a lot more trouble than people might think\nWhat does it say to you that this isn't shocking at all\nI think the Democratic party is not doing themselves any favor by by moving way to the left about Obama at the time\nWas seems like Gehring Lee far west but that's that's about as far west as they really should Barrett to go they really should stay out of all this transgender stuff they should really stay out of this open borders stuff they should stay away from a abolish ice they should stay away from the Medicare for all of all the stuff that they're doing is not helping them at the polls\nAnd as a Republican Party as a result is is in its strongest position since the Nineteen twenties\nWhich is astounding which is astounding for the opposition that it is had 'em and the the the flaws or that it is that is well it's it's amazing that it is this strong\nA and it's only because I think of the Democrats moving so far left agree ... thank you so much Kyle Smith a critic at large for National Review\nSo [noise]\nI'm listening to President Trump got another one of these [noise]\nAh you know rallies and he's talking\nAnd I'm\n... and and I'm I'm hearing the reporter this morning talk about it and how out of touch he is and I thought to myself you know\nOne of us is deeply deeply mistaken because he was saying you know this is this is this election is about Kavanaugh this election is about the caravan this election is about um ah shutting people up\nThis election is about tax cuts and I thought yeah that's that's really what this is about that is what this is about\nAnd they of course are saying you know those are just dog whistles set for if if you think that the caravan is not something you should worry about\nWhat's wrong with you if you're not worried about the economy and the effects of the budget and tax cuts um what's wrong with you you just don't see it\nOr are you is your philosophy\nSill upside down from traditional American or economics in philosophies that we are now on the other side of the fence promote move from one another and I\nI think when it comes to the politicians that's what it is they are on the other side of the fence and they just don't think this way

if anything this is a humanitarian crisis because these people are being used they're being used by political operatives in Honduras Mike Lee a senator who was always standing guard by our constitution welcome to the program sir how are you\nDoing great thank you very much good\nSo you um [noise] uh you wrote to me last night and I'm not smart enough to understand it or you said there is a there is a procedure that you're pushing for 'em to hold these countries responsible and get them involved in stopping it can you explain\nWhat happened was that the Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley and I sent a letter to they had took a department of homeland security and the department of state chasing a workout ... with Mexico\nA whereby a Mexico would require people to enter Mexico let's say from Honduras or from El Salvador or from\nAny of these other countries in Central America where a lot of these people were coming from with the intent of claiming asylum that they would have to claim asylum in Mexico rather than in the United states\nWould be similar to an agreement that we already have in place with Canada and a rule imposed by the EU refugees are arriving in Eu countries from Syria in other words when people were fleeing\nA a a country that dangerous to them that is particularly hostile towards them for some particular racial so that they have an asylum claim\nThey ought to apply for asylum and the first\nCountry they reach that could be potentially save your that should be Mexico isn't that\nNormally what happens I mean I thought that when you wanted asylum\nI thought I personally I think the United states government should be running ads do not come to America with your family because you will be turned away if you were in danger come to the closest to us embassy\nAnd apply for asylum I I mean why are we die thought that was what we always do\nYeah it should be more like that and that's not really how it works and that ... ... in order to these people end up applying for asylum with Mexico\nWe're going for the long bomb ill Mary pass and tried to make it all the way the United states but this jury is itself dangerous journeys itself\nI'm right with opportunities for people to be exploited a ... it's an exceptionally dangerous journey for many people especially for children and for young women many of whom are sexually assaulted during the ... and a lot of people claiming asylum\nTurn out not to be able to make the case that they're even eligible for asylum but once\nThey're in the United states it makes it much more difficult to get them back and we think that the\nAsylum application that they're coming by land from Mexico ought to be made to Mexico as they enter Mexico\nI talked to a great guy but the other day and he said that he thought Mexico was working on something with the UN to put some sort of a camp there in Mexico for these refugees have you heard anything about that\nI have not but I\nDon't think that sounds like a a great idea I think that could become a a lot of potential magnet I agree for bringing people here\nUm if the idea is to facilitate that journey specifically the journey from somewhere else in Central America to the United states that could become more of a problem\nAgain you you you nailed it quite a few minutes ago and saying that the humanitarian crisis that we have to be focusing on here really is a crisis with the refugees themselves having to make this long dangerous journey and then knowing that when they get\nHere the odds are pretty high that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event and it just creates a whole lot of headaches for them in the process\nSo Mike I gotta I got an um an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and then a born and raised native ah in Honduras\nSaid have been following the news or on the caravan here locally uh been also a fan of your show watch your show and I have to
