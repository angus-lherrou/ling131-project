and\nLarger reach of people so that uh we all learned or from each other that's one of the great things are doing this show I I Walk with every week and what the ... too so\nUh let people know how they can become part of our a little group of weekend warrior so is it a bill welcome\nUh yeah 'cause I I have\nUm a stretch crack developed in a basement wall a cement block law and um it's bulged out a little bit not act and big and then not falling down or anything and I've had some contractors and to look at it and I'm getting some different\nTypes of advice one wants to put five spring loaded I beams against the wall\nAnd the inside this to push it back but no excavation or clean out\nThere are some dampness on the bottom blocks along the basement floor the bottom blocks have dampness on them ... and a\nOne wants to just push against the wall but not do anything about they drain outside or you know not excavate or may not that drains neither one wants to bust out the cement floor inside and put a inside draining a ... ... and the other one's two\nOther ones said the right way to fix this problem problem came from the outside you fix on the outside and they said excavate\nThat wall clean out jet claim they um drains that'll take care of the damage is at the bottom and then a a resale the wall back so it with gravel and then if you have to put a beam inside to\n... to straighten out the wall which is pretty slight so there I Am with different advice well yeah well it's a\nHard hard to answer but I'm going to give you an overall first of all when you keep saying clean out the drains is their pipes around that foundation drain pipes around that foundation that are crushed are clogged or what's going on what do they keep dark\nI mean at the foundation and the law and I'm a widow no we won't know till we dig it up okay but\nWell here you know wall says eggs in Ben's unless there's a reason and that reason is always water\nOkay that's your number one enemy so water is an issue water is an issue on the outside and water is an issue underneath that floor I think what you're getting is you're getting partial answers but if you're really looking\nAt a complete fix I Would say you got to do almost all the above I'm the first thing you want to do is we don't know if those pipes are crushed we don't know if they're ... we don't know if they're plugged but we know the first two blocks or with so what we do know is the water table was higher than the floor\nAnd now that may be during big monsoon rains but we know that that water table rises up saturate says blocks incomes in the way you correct that is you cut the floor you put in drainage pipes you catch the water as it comes up you rather to uh some bump\nYou pump it away from the house you've solved the problem that's\nHow you solve the problem that's one of the problems\nNow if you don't solve that problem really the best way to explain the bills if that water keeps going up and down and up and down I'm Talking about the water table up and down and up and down those foot or start settling in that wall begins to bow\nAnd I think that's what's happened so the first thing I Do is you know cut\nThe floor put in the underground pipes run to some well in a mood the waterway that's part of the six that's not the whole fix because the outside there needs to be some excavation being done\nYou need to run some pipes around that you need to catch the water does phone from the sky and neither ... around that foundation and you need to move that water away from the house\nSo then you're correcting the water around the foundation you correct in the water underneath the foundation you were then controlling all the water around that foundation\nThen you can address the wall now there's\nMultiple ways we can stabilize that wall um I don't know about this spring beams but there's beams any type of support to stabilize the wall is going to need to be done there is also one company that actually uses carbon fibre doesn't pull the wall back\nBut this carbon fibers applied over to the block which then stabilizes that wall\nStrengthens that wall and we've also eliminated the source that is making that wall bowl so you say it's a slight bow all we want to do is we'll make sure it doesn't do any more and we've done that by correcting the water problem\nAnd we've corrected that by putting a carbon fibre over the block which to stabilize the wall we import back but we stabilized\nNow they ah we never get water innovation and we just get dampness on the box you know there's no water coming in yet\nOnly right and I think that they knew the answer yet\nBut they uh uh you don't think just jetting out those excavating and getting out those are outside drains has gone oh\nIs that the problem you told me you weren't even sure there was drains under there\nYeah there are because they have some pipes that run up um vertically okay all around the corners of the house they ran these uh plastic pipes okay well I'll tell you why wouldn't they found them falling gravel so they felt those pipes full of gravel\nOkay and what was the purpose of that\nI have no idea okay that's how it was also\nI just told you how to you know completely waterproof and stabilize the wall yes there are side things you can do I just can't promise that's gonna work\nYou know I always talk about killer jeeze and the killer genes or this is what causes waters show up for I just what causes water above it sounds simple but it's what causes it it's groundwater grading and gutters\nCutters get clogged water spills on foundation down about putting water right on the foundation that can cause it\nBad grading other words the ... slopes towards the house instead of away from the house that can cause it's groundwater that's ... around the foundation that can cause you correct all those you make correct the problem\nYeah we have good grading ... everyone that's come here says oh you got good draining away from the house you know\nHow to answer this way bill not to confuse you further I kind of show you the whole system\nThat eliminates the problem that if the company does that they're going to do a lifetime warranty on it it's going to be more expensive than the others but you're done can you do the jetting out sure you can\nWill solve the problem it might it might\nBe filing long term if I were to do one first to see what the result how it would you do the inside cut with a ... for the outside excavation with clean out first\n[noise] if I if you can tell me where the water's coming either coming up through the floor whether it's coming through the war I can answer that\nI got ya see one kind of going falling back that whole thing that's why it's a system to let's say they're coming from the floor down yesterday right that's exactly right\nThat's exactly right and if it's coming from up above that gets in your whole type thing and the grading thing that I was talking about the down spouse [noise]\nAlright got a break we'll continue your at home with Gary sell them in\nYour home is Jessica clicking away and Gary Knell of an online dot com
