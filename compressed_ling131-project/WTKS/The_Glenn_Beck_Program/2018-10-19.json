Democrat letter saw before the midterm\nBoss I was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right out in that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what sign for you to walk to the United states and I want you to walk in that group of people and here's a guy in paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group with you and you get you across the border is that what you're doing or you just\nYou're in trusting your children to\nWho knows what ... where's the personal responsibility of the parents here yeah I mean there's got to be some\nThere is and I think their case would be or at least the case the left would make on their behalf would be a these things are so\nBad so bad in Honduras Guatemala I mean they can get a lot worse she can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so many things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's pretty much the opposite like a lot\nOf the same thing we talked about this yesterday I you know letting my kid walk who's seven ... the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI've told the story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block in there there's a giant pond there in a green area is a common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said hey dad I'm just I'm going to walk down to the pond like alone [laughter]\nWithout you\nWhat\nDo you stop and think about how you know pretty protective ... yeah exactly I I don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey why don't you walk to Honduras\nWith a group of people that I don't know [laughter] good luck outlook there are\nSituations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there are certain level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people in these situations are like this or is there probably are some\nBut it it's just ... you try to at the same thing with the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of ... everyone is a four year old who came across the border right in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old that this is a different it's a different story\nUh and you just wonder first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about a hardening the borders\nThis is an easy way to get people together to do that mhm when people hear a story like that it it does not soften their hearts that makes people say ... ... ... you know because the word invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from people who oppose it uh you know in a hawkish manner ... right\nAnd you know like four thousand people are kind of qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion\nRight it feels like waiting does there just top like they're they're taught the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right let the overriding the security\nThere and you're you're coming in or do the right way or the overriding security\nAnd you see that Mexico does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location\nSo they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course they're just keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this and yet or the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a\nFairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful a war on carrying were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy of\nCourse if somebody sneaks in from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they go and work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with them back then\nThey ... they send back to them they then back to them if they do it without permissions they sent back them ... ... but we can't uh were expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to U.S Mexico has a pretty stiff immigration law they've got to streamline law that ensures\nForeign visitors and immigrants are in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves\nEconomically they're not destined to be burdens on society they are of economic and social benefit to society\nWeight you're you expect your immigrants to contribute their own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation or they make sure that they don't have\nAny sort of a criminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants protests have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they are demanding rights or that they think they have coming to them in Mexico you can't even\nGo can't interfere in their in internal politics plus\nIf they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics may deport you know I mean that's a [noise]\nA blatantly racist right I mean like that is not yes there's not an argument there\nWe would never know I Can't do that you can't do that and know should you you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans in this present we want to make sure we're still Seventy or eighty percent yeah I mean I think I Would you I wouldn't I Can't I Can't think of one Trump supporter\nWho would ... support a policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages\nOf white people versus other races you what you want to people who are productive who are here because they want to be here and be part of the society or going to add something to our community instead of taking things from it\nI mean right now that is what you want the hypocrisy is mind by that really is incredible lying to buy it really is it ... ... security for me but not for me and that is not a a that is not a ... that's incredible I mean that's an incredible [laughter] it is a line\nThere that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and ... and it's politically wanting to look at the bottom line is we ... we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten it up that is a completely let the larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to a mid term election there is no like this is a complete gift\nTo the Republicans to people who care about the border yeah people who have any uh did Donald Trump and the people he's supporting the gift\nIt is and and he's telling Republicans that yeah saying hey use their use it in the ... election campaign start talking about immigration 'cause I haven't heard\nAny of them doing that are any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe some warm someone somewhere is but it doesn't seem to be a general theme for the party I did hear cut all talking about it in the debate\nAnd I I don't think I don't know you mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security I mean there's a really close race in Arizona a race or where a mix Sally has a I think a great chance of winning\nOr people to get because her opponent there is like if you took a Michael Moore and put him in his brain into a female body of a congresswoman you would have all of these\nTapes that they've been finding about her where she saying you know she's fasching Arizona oh yeah it's the lap of democracy she's saying people are crazy in Arizona she's talking about how I mean she's on nine eleven truther shows I mean she is\nAs it's incredible but they decided to run her and just and thought that this stuff would not come out\nAnd and ... you know you're talking about a one of the first female pilots are in history and the air the air force incredibly accomplished yeah have a great chance of winning ... in a tough environment or in Arizona adding on this situation where\nAre you know he makes gives a coat pink worker a coat of paint staffer is running for Senate in Arizona\nAnd it was a huge mistake I think for\nHer to be they're not going to really with code picker night ... um that socializing her views I don't know exactly she ... she's been with a lot of these uh left wing extreme groups or some maize any early to thousands to the point where again like she like co hosted a show\nWith someone who was the nine eleven truther wow for a while\nThat's like crazy bonkers over the line right and and the fact that you have a really solid candidate there in Arizona as the border state it's a big deal their taxes is another on the cruise cruise has got to leave there but I mean he's always been talking about border security but I get a look at the other side of that yet with Beto\n... doesn't want no all he doesn't I I don't know that even once a border frankly now it just doesn't seem like it and he's made a big deal out of it some of those ads are like let's protect the dreamers\nLet's let's protect the dreamers and you know what that means it means it means amnesty for everybody it doesn't stop with the dreamers and ... I think everybody who has watched this battle for the last Fifteen or Twenty years knows it doesn't stop the dreamers there they're going to they want amnesty for all illegals here\nCampaign you have been attacked for being what Don junior has called an Irish guy pretending to be Hispanic\nSo what does the Hispanic community mean to you in what relationships do you have with that community\nSo to verify the question about my name was born Robert Francis O'Rourke son a pat Francis or work was the son of John Francis or some other Senate Ulysses Francis work who will go as UFO\nUm for for his life and\nAnd from day one in El Paso and and you know this and ... if you were born Robert or Albert for Gilbert ... your folks your friends your community calls you bet though that's that's my nickname that are gone a bar for my entire life a horn and raised in fourth generation in El Paso\nI'm In a community that has more than ... percent Mexican American\nUh first of all I was you know I'm not Hispanic I had no one calls me or any name other than do\nAt this point which isn't even named either or you can criticize me the same way you can talk about better because that's actually not my name my name's to deep uh in Phoenix book about I'm called Stu thanks a lot for to Glenn Beck for that one but I what I Would say there is first of all it's just an inefficient process I I don't mean to criticize the culture\nOf a of the Hispanic people but if you have ... if if if it's true what ... saying which is anyone who's named any foreign names are all\nCalled that's how is that true everyone who know every one is called Albert is called every what everybody born\nIn El Paso that of Irish American\nDescent that same Albert author Robert framing it as a whole lot better than no no no you can go and fight an actual Robert in\nEl Paso do any exist maybe somebody in El Paso if you're in El Paso or anywhere around there and your name is Robert I'd love to know if you exist because what we were just told is as everyone knows if you're happy to grow up and go and your name is Robert bill Ted\nStanley Orlando or Reginald you're you're referred to as best hope I I Can't be true\nMilitary in ... and I don't think it is I\nI don't think it's not a common nickname in some communities it probably is but it wasn't his ...\nIs it not cultural appropriation did he not appropriate Hispanic culture is that not a problem\nIf that is a thing this is an example of it yes\nNow I'm not going to sit here and tell you what the thing I think it's a ridiculous thing but I'm sure bet I would\nTell us it's a thing yes yes he would [noise]\nAll right and in the meantime we'd love to hear from Roberts in El Paso or near Allentown ... dean El Paso argue Beto Glenn\nLike back get more on Sunday from ten to one on news radio twelve Ninety and Ninety seven point seven double duty chaos\nFox News I'm Krista ...

E. T. oh this is not like that might be his nickname and it might be that it's okay to call him bad health but it does it not he's not doing it\nBecause that the uh the case he's doing it because he's trying to fool a bunch of people especially back you know when he was trying to get to this level at this point\nI don't know I think everybody knows but it helped him climb to this level\nAnd it's it's the name that appears on the ballot too which is interesting very strange very strange ... a lot of times if it's a nickname\nThey'll put like Robert Francis and then in parentheses [noise] Beto O'Rourke so you can identify him from you know his campaign Sarah stuff was that kind of makes sense although I I don't even love that all that in my only Beto O'Rourke on the ballot so that I mean the guy has gone to great lengths\nNot to use Robert Francis not to be identified as Irish American now if you press them on it he's obviously going to admit I'm Irish American it I mean I'm from a long line of Irish Americans right but that's not what you get from him when you just watch his uh\nHis campaign ads or you see I'm In a debate he doesn't know he doesn't identify like that at all he's trying to be a Kennedy right he\nLike he wants to be a Kennedy and a plot you know a appeal to the Hispanic community and it's like you're you're not be F.

K. was he's been gone for a long time [laughter] we all know that you're not the F.\nK. and just stop trying to BP if you're not that he's working on it though it's dry and these these dry and I mean better ... better Fitzgerald Kennedy was an incredible\nPerson we'll [laughter]\nAnd it was a tragedy and yeah I mean it really was an amazing a\nTurn of events there and it's good to see it's good to see a that this has gone on I I just I don't\nI don't see how people don't see through this you know I and I think maybe on the left they don't want to because they think he has a chance\nYou know every few years the the the left gets the terrible teeth or they get to get close in for in a few polls I mean Wendy Murphy's kind of changed Texas who's the mayor refused and that was going to change Texas\nA oh a were you were to use them and when you're down there yeah yeah sort of a moderate leaning a Democrat he was also going to change\nTexas every time they were on somebody there's somebody who's going to just change it and it's going to it no longer we're gonna have to deal with these darn Republicans down their return the state blue we've won forever and by the way that part of it is true\nIf they ... they turn this basically that's what we do yeah that's true they will run they will run the country for a very long time if they're capable of doing that just from an electoral vote

it's going to Jack in Pennsylvania a Jack you're on the Glenn Beck program Hi\nHey pat and Steve Love you guys [laughter] I I think you're missing a very important point and that is that over ... identifies as Hispanic or there for ... you must be belief\nWow there's a great point here is again we're learning today yeah I forgot that was the standard how insensitive of us mhm\nHow hateful and dumber and ugly that is that we haven't spoken about how he does identify yeah and it must\nBe as Hispanic jak bags and it's interesting with that sort of talk it's like you know the the Elizabeth Warren is of essentially identifying as Native American without real evidence that she is she's getting beat up I mean this has been one of the biggest political disasters of all time\nHer coming out and trying to say that she actually is Hispanic Native American short approved it by going back try to ... generation trying to prove it one one thousand twenty four yeah that's what made the left hates it through like this is this playing into the worst of our\nUh beliefs about blood being the determining factor in these things and they they hate their\nThey have destroyed or over the she handled it terribly I mean it's almost like one of those things I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out and doing this is this amazing ah but\nThe identifying thing there's two parts of that like I said as they say that you know the libertarian side of me right like I don't care what people say they are right like it makes no difference to me she says she's Native American or not I don't care\nBut beyond that there is an actual truth\nYou know if it does all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean King wants to come out and say he's black when they're not black ... does that matter to me I don't care what they're doing there I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason but that doesn't mean it affects me in any way\nHowever we have to be able to stand up for the truth the truth is that Sean King is white but the truth is that Rachel does all is white and the truth is Beto O'Rourke as white as white\nAnd you know I that's okay [noise] you know people are supposed to be able to be you know we're not supposed to care so much about these identifying factors but we're in a world in which the left only embrace his identity politics the thick world we need to cure it\nRush is next it knew now more back on news radio twelve Ninety and Ninety seven points to have
