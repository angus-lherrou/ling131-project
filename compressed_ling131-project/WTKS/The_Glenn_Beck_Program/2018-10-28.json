I have a radio I just don't when they often have a cat [laughter]\n\nWhat am I going to be much more money to get the call or two three four twenty twenty [noise] it's been called the policeman best friend [noise] and Jean hardly is with us from Chatham architects team [noise]\nTalking about the the the wonderful job and everything that they do and gene you would think as successful as you guys have been at the community role that you play and you have people from all over the country of not the world calling and said how do you do this or ... we want to set up a similar agency I don't know why there are more similar agencies as successful as you've been\nYeah um you know ... again ... seeing these just\nI'm a phenomenal organization you know it it it's something that that that's really one of the kind you know my mom was trying to see more and more agencies like you said call us tried to model\nAfter after us because how successful we'd been and it's and it's it's fun to make up but you know again I I Would be remiss if I didn't say to a lot of seeing the success comes from\nThe Chatham county a border commissioners because you know ... Chatham county again who completely and totally fun see anti ... and you know without their support in and and their supply and see anti it wouldn't be possible to begin with so\nYou know a lot of this because of um the county manager the chairman of the board of the commissioners and\nYou're absolutely right we have a lot of people calling us throughout the state as well as other states who have who can come to visit us sometimes they have tours of the anti to get a real true understanding of ... because you know that they want to see us and and we also had federal agencies come and meet with us oh cool and just commend us\nHow well our organization operates I'm In an asteroid or has said please towns before that he he believes that the antique and rival any other state or federal agency in terms of investigations like that's the truth and and I stand behind that ... percent as well\nYou know right now we're having problems with the funding crunch diapers here in ... in in in Savannah John and county\n... kind of give people a little plug forces through you know how important to the crime suffers really using the ... we need to keep this thing going\nWell sure I mean you said earlier you know cross suffers for a law forcing us almost like a best friend you know I I can tell you from my\nUh almost Seventeen years a law enforcement here that you know I I've seen hundreds in essence we're Comstock verse has just been a phenomenal an aide in law enforcement and perhaps one of the most unique physicians I have currently is that I'm\nNot only in my position with counter counties team but also on the board of assess or fourth ... suffers\nAnd you know one thing that I think a lot of people still kind of have a hard time believing is is it truly anonymous you know they have a way of finding that the person's callers name out et cetera and and that's just not the case because when when you call them ... you know one they don't even allow you to give me your name simply generated a number that sure Dennis ... all you have\nAnd I've seen it time after time again when the complaints come in on the law enforcement standpoint you know it comes to crime suffer complaint has by no means any type of identify mark home there it doesn't even have the the the number associated with it and it says\nIt's basically a collar state it whatever it is their information they're given\nAnd then\nWhen that case comes to a closure and we've made an arrest of whatever we don't do the case we simply send our findings ... to ... offers wishing is generated into a into a a paint all that goes before the board of says look this to lead to this ... you know this is what they said it was going on in this little resulted in person and the\nAnd then the board makes the termination of what the cash reward amount will be\nBut at no point it is the identity of the caller ever known because again it's never known at all throughout the entire process and so I really want to community to understand that and\nYou know ... has been he used to not only for the drug aspect or you know I can remember one case where where we had a a we're working already on a fairly large case but what we were not ...\nOr that point was identifying one of the main stash houses for this organization and threw it Crump suffer too\nIt made us are looking at us one house ultimately\nWas identified as the stash house for this large organization we're looking into and sometime thereafter we did a search warrant and other health had multiple kilos of cocaine firearms et cetera\nAnd so you know would that help get identify simply from the caller calling in you know we have other cases um for example the Wesley Franklin case was a big case where yeah Crump suffers was huge and solving that and\nYou know so so we've seen cases time and time again where where so many people have\nHad the courage really to me that anonymous phone call in and they're they're a little bit of information was huge and break in these cases that were on the court cases or whatever\nBut yeah I think you ought to explain the gym or good we we've tried to explain it on several occasions to the police may have this this puzzle there's that one piece missing you may think it's a significant other than the average person basically you know I I Know somebody but you know it was just the the color of the car was yellow or something let's all go he said that's the piece of information you need to close the whole\nThing yeah you know ... really hit the nail on the head there um you know seeing the opposite where it's very closely with the biggest homicide units around in time and time again you know we've been part of ... where we've we work collectively but we're still miss not one piece of the puzzle\nAnd you know something as simple as the car was yellow or what have you like you said and and that was the one piece that was caught on to cross suffers I really ... the case one open um\nOr even another case we had recently working with a homicide case where they had a pretty good understanding\nWho the person was good really prove it in the tip came into crime suffers gave a little bit more information that kind of led the ... kind of make a little ... slight right turn a little bit in doing so good the ex sure\nI'm evidence they needed to to bring charges force for murder I guess this particular person\nBut they very likely will not have ever had that without the tip from ... and so\nI think the biggest thing is you know you always see the police safe you see something say something writing and a lot of times people say men will what I saw here which is which is so so minor they don't probably care about that as a note or whatever but the reality is you know that that that thing that you think so minor could be the one thing\nYou had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the ... and ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible\nSince cabin on that has changed Democrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance\nOf very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight would be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two thousand six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nFor relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races their favorite and\nUh and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point\nSo all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is the idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where there was a down by five in the polls they'll want him winning some of those races\nSo this is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that have been losing ten seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are going to wind up getting split and then of course still has may even they're not going to able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power to have subpoena power are going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from\nUm you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation of\nYeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance of this up two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh facing\nNow I mean I think it's a real a real it's going to come to the independent power the independence feeling\nAt the ... they're in an interesting group because they are not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten were fifty percent now independence are almost always going to be lower\nAnd high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that type of course a blanket robots typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with him and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo yeah but I Wonder\n'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls and so I'm Wondering you know would that four percent jump\nWas it a ... percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone in\nPain right and there's a lot of independents that I get I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever have the right ... was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians say do vote for Democrats like yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that that is growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming\nA more rigid in and more of this one\nCould come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\nMhm yeah I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if if anything they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting this data here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\nWhat which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who said that was coming uh\nYeah this this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot of them a lot about the uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... come Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten it was like forty eight percent two dozen fourteen it was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two thousand eighty two Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one\nThis year so this is a whatever the reason while they were going on is higher than two thousand six for Latino voters wow a and again that was a wave election for Democrats\nIt's I mean the only thing I can think of is\nThe Guatemalan refugees what else has happened I mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh\nUnaccompanied minors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages you know I was in July or August ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls were afford at some after okay um all the October ones obviously after ... men include the migrants a caravan situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only places low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters each into thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine for going into doesn't say\nThat if you do it because our whole lives now this is going to be interesting it is like it's like\nYou know back in the nineties the opening of Star Wars yeah this is now what people care about and they care about it in almost a cultural entertainment sort of way be which is I think fascinating\nNot necessarily healthy [noise] that's good that people care about these things but you know I I don't think that people a lot of people don't seem to care about them about the issues as much as they do about just the passionate disagreement with whoever they're on Facebook where\nHave you noticed anybody who says anything other than a ... oh the great one could shockey oh ...\nWith the exception of a I hear his name forty seven different ways in that sentence now I have not hurting [laughter]\nSo it's it's amazing to me how if you speak out you're a conspiracy theorist\nNow hold on just a second sense when his reporting about fact since winning is quoting him hey conspiracy\nAnd make it seems like the accusation is if you're trying to say that he's ever done anything that's questionable in his life you're making excuses for his murder which of course it's not\nThat it's not no no it's different that's different that's that's the people who are tweeting and saying uh oh so you deserve today no no no no this is a horrible crime committed by a horrible state who is not our ally\nPerhaps we need them I don't know I don't like getting into the situations I Wish we weren't\nThere at all but this was a crime and it was despicable disgusting brutal I mean unbelievable to people in the west\nBut it happened and I have no doubt that the prince was behind it okay\nThat has no bearing on who he was\nWe can say that this was a despicable horrible crime done by the Saudis and their horrible people for X Y Z and we can say ... did not deserve to die this way\nNobody deserves to die that that way however she's not the guy that everybody in the press is making him out to be he's not some freedom loving guy\nHe's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nIs the Muslim Brotherhood that he was pushing for was an Islamic state he wants an Islamic state in his own writings in the Washington Post\nSays yeah we have to have a an Islamic assist rule\nIf you dismiss as Islam assist rule under surreal law then you'll never have peace in the middle east well wait a minute I'm not against Islam I Am against Islamic rule sharia law tell me where it's working out show to me\nWhere is that working out where is it protecting human rights no thank you I mean Islamic rule just by a nother group of Islam is is what you have in Saudi Arabia no thank you\nI'm going to give some of the facts of of this guy and it's not a conspiracy there was a conspiracy to commit murder to hide it and we have found that\nNow America needs some adults in the room to say okay that's a separate issue\nBut let's not paint\n... into some freedom loving friends because\nHe's news radio Ninety seven point seven

more intense place where it's crowding out more and more of the things that actually give people's lives meaning unhappiness it's I think it's very important\nTo um as far right as they come on the right versus left continuum\nBut it's very important to remember that the purpose of politics is to maintain a framework for order liberty so that you can go live in communities of love where you're actually raising your kids and building a better\nMouse trap rap or where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics is in the end\nSo I completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left they are\nYou know they're they are anti capitalist they are they're anti constitution so you know you used on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics but at what point do you see good people say\nEnough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end ... what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did or to Nancy Pelosi in California how are you know where does did to Mitch

them about politics or you could still talk about things that\nWe had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now and they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two there are still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world\nIs so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media\nAs if the people like anti ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignoring them [noise]\nSo what is our our we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nSo yes ... a a blurb assuming I'm Out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest\nAll of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is\nWe believe a ... day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and with dignity that's way\nBigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness and ruthlessness almost\nAll of the happiness literature if you will out there is confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation the nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest and statistically the number one driver of happiness\nIs do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if\nThose four things are true or even if three of the four true\nYou're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships\nAnd the undermining of vocation or long work um ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community and I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I Want to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will\nFacebook and what you write about what's deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this\nAh and you're looking over the horizon and we want to talk about that we are talking to Ben Sasse his new

media right now it's going to be\nA potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them a why we hate each other is an awareness that there's

listen to me when I should talk I talk about ways of making people better I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life liberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about this I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness\nSorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there there are many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal hang of it before it short subtract started with me I should go with ... absolutely I'm the one talking about getting rid of all centralized testing prior to high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because they're testing is it unfair way of bringing teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools\nAnd it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation\nTo include children one of those reasons as family court how broken that is another reason is there pressure to take tests and feel stupid and to be some come successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy satellites testing is very good when you're in high school and joined way you should go or you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why it's to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do know that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and it was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about the really do anything mhm somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read write survive in the world\nWithout at at a department education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked\nAt the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse and they give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better finished\n[laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some localized central I'm the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready to testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion so losing four billion not into the world however we could still fix that here's the issue here\nWhen we lose at four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows were riding granted measures were checking boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRegulations rules checking boxes I'm the only ones saying these things because I crossed the entire state might say that sixty two counties across all ... to\n... the full sharply by the way\nFor you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average ministry makes over a hundred and fifty ... you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done why in the world we have K. through twelve neat K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed ... that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirty eighth grade they removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWest terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and when you say I Wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally not people who would tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAt one or aren't you know told me he said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is for people show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system that I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course\nAt sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey get a hospital plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind the desk and ... and the computer all day ... that a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixteen let's not make some decisions\nIf I think cause you write to me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go to years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator is life is good I don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid\nWho you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who then we got it off [laughter] so sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nStory now he'll get yeah [laughter] so um so that kid who's really smart that could take the SAT run away and goes off and get to a degree why should they be bored in school and they should make one school\nNext you don't want any of those things now where he's going to a two year trade school\nGo to trace to become a plumber carpenter whatever you want to be about mechanic H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I let my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old\nMy problem is they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough and you're doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that could get a job why not go learner work work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people imagine if they do go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually means seven forty five\nLearn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nAllow it sounds great how do you pay for New York state

very workable in a in an era when we are changing everything when technology has changed everything\nWhy we're still looking at a system uh you know that feels like the old Soviet size styles centralized system is beyond me but\nI'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um you are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo is pushing them around quite a bit\nEspecially when it comes to the second amendment\nA and trying to de platform ah people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for governor to impede business\nPeriod no ifs ands or buts\nIf I don't like in the industry or like something I never said if I Want to have freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief I should be the marketer and chief not not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's always\nNot only doing that he's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around as eating right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just once insurance forest firearm\nNow we can't get it there's no way that the individual and there are at least four million I'm gun owners in New York state if not more widely and insurance now when when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore\nFor for any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yes and that's the unethical part that's the issue\nRight and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just say if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by the fault no matter what you do that's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight\nAnd we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe acts compliant say fact was passed in twenty Thirteen and the fact said that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal ... literally what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before a complete legally totally above board you are now a violent felon\nIt was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to not joking is true story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes oh the cops words that ... revamp all because of that\nIn other words but it now if you're a tire
