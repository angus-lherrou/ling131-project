Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court justice ...\nAre just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when there was no ... and no evidence\nYeah and you know wow first of all I think once we get past this election\nThat Brett Kavanaugh stuff is going to die down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time you see ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't hear ... occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story\nYou know they they still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest price Kavanaugh\nBut I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations it was always about the the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court can they thought they had a chance of winning the Senate and could block the block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court\nWould that was one hundred percent of it for every ... every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and certainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was definitely part of her calculus there [noise] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story we\nDon't know um but the other people and Cory Booker do not care won't for one second about what happened to this one not it's not even for a second no the only cared about what happened to him so you could call themselves Spartacus a and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty candidate\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all\nUm and and it's and and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and\nAnd again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but if you're judging by the standards that they're putting up it's totally different\n... let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating after I think of how\nRecent this Brett Kavanaugh saying was an ... story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find that Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people are they were there none of those people say that they remember this this incident\nUh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she went back what an avid mountain of it it happened right none of it right [noise] um and we were basically the insinuation from the media was\nIf let's say one of the witnesses she named instead came out and\nYeah I remember that party I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know very distant and I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on for something like that just one person\nSaying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident which just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party occurred yeah none of the incident happened just that the party\nOccurred listen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of late talking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this in Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he's she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to go down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth in Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was saying like perjury charges or something against or\nFive people said ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred wow so not while for one person who was at the hotel or at the party in the cabinet case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after it occurred\nUh a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick with a bloody lip and torn panty hose in their shared hotel room Broderick explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband then her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days of the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape and that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe Camelot and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked for rape is like a by the way I'm going to renovate the prison over there are so work\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended\nNewspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred there was a prison outside the hotel window\nWow that is a thousand times the amount of even alleged evidence that occurred with ah with Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh and yet that was ignored for ... and ... until the very second the Clinton\nBecame useless to the Democrats and now yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment it only happens now after\nThey never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever get to them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump and that's why they have no more used for them but I mean Bill Clinton\nGoes on and still makes a big level speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there it's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so bizarre\nAnd the fact that they that the media actually thinks we should take their current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when you report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system with\nActual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened I mean that is what that the system we have it's the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we are now supposed to go through these kinds of records and an even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it\nIs now or standard that didn't sanity it's insanity\nAnd yet you have Hillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there is substantial evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's trying to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated a reception of Michael\n... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy the I guess they are so pissed off about that\nAnd they don't want him running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are they are very much trying to destroy him at this point but what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then Michael up and out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad that even Trevor Noah who's the ... I mean I I thought John Stewart was on funny this guy is on funny too about the one million to power but I'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other night I took on Hillary Clinton and you know to his credit\nActually said some some accurate things are about her and and whether or not she's the best person to be speaking out on sexual allegations here's what he said\nWar criminals on earth it's about Nazi evil and those who enabled the book will stun you as Nazi hunters risk their lives to track down in mass killers like Adolf Eichmann\nWere protected by ruthless forces there is a reason why the killing books are sold more than twelve million copies so I Hope you check out killing the ss it's well worth your time yeah\nKennedy and now mark Libyan we can't see\nRadio Ninety seven seven and twelfth night WMGK asked some Anna combat\nWith guns do for Glenn today and tomorrow it's going to south in Pennsylvania hates that you're on the Glenn Beck program\nHey guys how you doing good uh I'm laughing when you were talking about kind of the the her reading the stories and how we kind of make fun of the reaction mhm well believe it or not that kind of stuck really impact you I'm ah\nI'm forty two today's my birthday and birthday and Oh thank you and I laugh because when I was driving an episode of the ... and ... it it's French socialists cartoon and I'll never forget it because the opposite of what the village\nAnd ... declared himself like pain of the ... and the other marked rebelled and there was a war among the smart because\nNo one should dictate that singular message when I was a kid stuck with me\nMy whole life and I know when I became a libertarian it's why I went to law school and I I I argued the way I did it why when I teach um your wife\nThe classes I it is a singular message of no and it's like hey\nThat is middle man ever be a cake and and you learn from ... and I learned from that\nI Will never forget is that why isn't it amazing that the\nKnow what you can always on the news radio savannah dot com\nFox News I'm Krista ...

for the New York times today and it is they do this little podcast in the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage ever ever\nUm well he did things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah and that and they said yes at odd part of this saga with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec that much if any allegations of him doing something\nThat against the the motives will write like he would ask they say yes\nOr or um there was one case where um he\nAgain like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure ing himself while on the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics power dynamic absolutely yeah power makes you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian\nHe's in ... he wields incredible power right in this country now incredibly lucky to have her fired at any job in the nation at any job you're a sarcasm is just reality\nIn the situation that they're going to go back to what they were saying they're saying they ... some of them\nPeople were other comedians and one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there is something invited her back to his trailer to do its thing in front of her which apparently was\nWas this was his shtick mhm and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife and a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues and\nThat's the sense of the allegation that he didn't do it in force or to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation ... learn to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously ...\nRight yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I've I've issues I'm Sorry but that is is that sexual assault and the accusation there I Know that was shown which she answered\nA diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so I ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right now and he admitted in such a general way that people kind of a make it easy will he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make the make them right and I think that\nThe one I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing however it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is\nNo and and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other ... other comedians careers is theoretically possible but that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's not evidence\nOf that he did this to anyone so it wouldn't even do it to anyone right I mean you know again he's making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was supposed to scare away from right you're not supposed to just as the other and people will commit crimes in the future\nAnd listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar as famous New York comedy clubs like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedian you never heard of they're probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks into doesn't set or Jerry Seinfeld comes in a while because that are loose hey well I'm In a doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he's bounced around just several clubs around New York since and they let him on stage so the New York times or the exhaustive report about tried to talk to the club owner about why you let him onstage\nThis is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision listen all the people were just upset that\nHe should ever work again the one guy but he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work that he's like never mhm might never say never\nWell can you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence and never work again he says I don't care never this is an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the owner of a place where you would say\nPerfectly to a female customer who was somebody else on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton who was credibly obviously accuse in Juanita brought her I mean I think nobody will expect a warning before he shows up somewhere\nThe harassing young interns at other underlings and he he's back at work\nWe have this weird why I mean Mike Tyson\nIs pretty clear the man was convicted of rape but not not ... time convicted of rape spent time in prison yeah and he's like the darling\nOf the media he comes out of you guys the silly appearances everywhere have a problem going anywhere now doing anything and he I mean and look he served time and he's out right\nUm and so you could make the case as the left has beat forever that people who go in felons should be able to come back and vote you should be we their programs to give felons and convicted felons and murderers jobs\nYet but when someone's accused of something much less than murder they can never work again and not even convicted just accused of his yeah it really doesn't make any sense ... seven twenty seven back is\nThe phone number or it is a pat and sue for Glenn who uh is traverse thing currently uh the Mediterranean Sea\nAnd a canoe or he's always wanted to do it and he finally said you know what this is the week so that he's doing it alone alone which is\nAmazing just amazing I I don't know if there's a Web I heard that there would be some uh there'd be a boat going next to him with a webcam so you could see all the action but uh no I think he attached a webcam to the canoe and and it's just and it's just just him\nCanoeing across the Mediterranean Sea wow it must be a water it must be like to go pro because it would have to be waterproof but yes it's a long it's a long

I certainly know them and they were against Kavanaugh because they believed or you know Dr Ford mhm ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially in everything that they're saying which is\nThey accuse us of believing\nForward\nIn a roundabout sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want him on the Supreme Court right and like no right now is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want him on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... ... you have not provided any evidence to bring as it were that line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her is your prerogative but you don't accuse me of of the ... of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I think I don't think it happened\nYeah I don't either at the White House even I think it happened with somebody else\nMaybe believing that is is this is a I don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't fair but the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens with any big public official\nOr in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades then talks about a party that they couldn't run or where it was and then they tell you what the people who were there and they can't remember the party like\nWhat are we and the person who's making the accusation\nHas an overt uh dislike for the\nParty of the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist is Marcia women's march rallies is is an obvious Democrat like\nYou have to take in that motivation forty years later into account I always started skepticism I had this idea basically I think people almost it's like it's got some bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of saying about it yeah I Know\nI Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you do I leave the survivors no no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor the indicate that this if this has occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the event occurred I Would I ever called the victim I called them survivor but when I when they leave I\nEver survived this assault by this man if they've assault didn't happen they didn't survive it and [laughter] I guess we could all colors they'll survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... a million things are possible what you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make it up\nWhy would she lie about it that's a good question because I Love this one mhm\nPossibly could lose your motivation [laughter]\nWhat did I should like this I don't know what I thought the gal we talk about\nUh yeah I Know we talked about\nThe the women's right to choose it is just ended as if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one I wouldn't defend my children's lives\nAbout as strongly as they they defend their right to kill their children hit is the most important thing in the universe to\nHow many millions of Americans\nThe idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy who you think is going to overturn that right that you think is so vital is insane we've seen foreign crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week and we're five five\nAccusers accused of high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him\nYeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle on receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against the being anti gay this happens all the time you know why\nPeople are are of all many of them are awful their women are awful men are awful they do terrible things\nThat you can explain it happens all the time and the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing a swastika on their door for nothing you know to like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused which they can do we know for a fact the fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them\nWe know the the fourth accuser didn't even bother right any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or when it happened we know that the third accuser went to Michael ... and no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusation we're littered all over the store\nAnd the only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats were the first two\nAnd in the second one is the is that there's a ... their right they went they the person who made the allegation said I I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them All right well I I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate\nThe person and that person said no it didn't happen and she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember to even happen exactly is the fact I'm going to be ... operating evidence on that one either and there was and look the Fort one was only I think taken more seriously than the others because there was it an obvious\nSaying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people there was no evidence proving that had happened here I'm In it of course obviously people a cabin on his uh his or what this is worth saying no um but\nThat one was serious because she wasn't just you know took the step of going in front of the of the hearing and and and doing relatively credible job it recounting what she believed the story was who knows if it was true or if it was completely felt false the idea that you can't pull one person out of the United states\nWho opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation against someone but it's completely false it's just an eight yeah of course you can do it I mean but as we heard with Hillary Clinton\nShe said they were they vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this but they the media access if this is entirely foreign world where someone could lie about politics [laughter]\nDon't of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five cases and probably in all of them\nAnd ... you brought up the high school situation in California where they call it the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accused is one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault\nAnd they they asked the first accuser uh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault\nOr and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk\nI don't like to look at him I just don't like him that's why they accused him they credits didn't like him to really encourage\nOr how about the Ohio University students who are got threatening notes about how they didn't want her in her elegy peachy lifestyle to them to be in the students' Senate anymore at Ohio University\nUh she was a angry and frustrated and disappointed she said I'm a shoe you may find my me revolting unworthy of a threat of my life but in reality it's your beliefs that a repulsive you need to get this through your head you F ing a whole I Am proud to be who I Am and nothing could say or do you ever change that\nBy the way the ... of course admitted to sending the threats to herself ... uh or the woman and why would you do that again why what could her motivation possibly be it's hard to do in this case it's not hard to detect with Brett capital\nOr the woman in Texas who city state trooper sexually assaulted her until of course the camera footage came out and her own attorney had to say we're sorry for bringing this case we didn't know about this at the time or the charges against the for dentist accused in Las Vegas of raping\nA ... a people and that was also found to be completely false\nAnd untrue or ah how about the racist receipt we don't tip of terrorists to an Arab a person at a restaurant um who again later I had to admit that yes he actually wrote the stuff on the receipt\nWow or the former college student who claimed rape and then it had to admit in court that it was completely false on Long Island\nOr a Kansas men who said he put racist graffiti on his own car a or the races note at Saint Olaf college if you remember this one uh that was one where the where they talked about uh once again the\nThis terrible race racial note do everyone apparently is racism is rampant all ... F pure white complacency all over the place where we find out later of course not true we could go on and on and on and on with these stories\nGoing back [noise] super blend on the Glenn Beck for them\nA thank goodness\nPolice in Chicago leapt directly into action when they found a a posting\nOn Snapchat somebody posted on Snapchat\nA photo\nI could barely say if I can barely get the words out of a toy gun oh my God on Snapchat put it right up there he was holding it this kid Eighteen year old Eighteen year old kid holding up a toy gun\nBut fortunately the Chicago police would ride into action and uh found him almost immediately they located him a ... arrested him and uh and\nPut down for um what was the charge that they arrested him genocide a genocide or attempted genocide because he posted\nThe photo of a toy gun and you know with that toy gun who knows how many people I mean he could have put an eye out\nI have a good idea of how many people are zero [laughter]\nProbably yes zero is right it's hardly they actually\nThey actually arrested him for disturbing the peace\nThe photo of of all the air soft it was an air soft gun I'm was disturbing the peace I mean that's amazing isn't it also I mean that cannot hold up I cannot hold up I wouldn't think so but the\nThe community as a plotting no police swift success the swift successive locating arresting him\nIs due to the timely information provided by numerous concern teens and adults as well as the cooperation of the park ridge police department and the cook county sheriff's bleak so is this was a was a a multi\nDepartment good uh operation to get this kid where does this story come around though do we here at the end but by the way they found out it was an air soft gun and now he's now you know this story you know ... cause I mean\nIf let's just say you had a realistic looking air soft gun ... that media lost it a little are you I assume they all have the orange thing on the end yes just bakery no let's just say that fell off or something or even aided black right what'd you say\nHe's walking down the street or he's walking towards the school I can understand someone passing by me like a what the hell is going on and sharing the police yeah and what happens if they show up\nAnd they talk to them they owe generic ... later I think are getting at the orange piece of people are gonna freak out and then you release them right let's say a max the maximum penalty will be will look we're going to take the gun will return it to you later instead\nThey found the ... gun in his truck and arrested him for just surfing the ... did they realize it was an air south yeah they knew it was an air soccer they said it was an air softer\nThey're they're still being congratulated for their swim success [laughter] you know that I don't know\nI don't know what are you going to do with an ... I mean if you shot somebody in the eyes yeah you're supposed to work out those right when you're wearing yeah that would hurt ...\nUh you might put an eye out my mom warns me more than me about that a word that was a kid um but other than that I I don't know what you're going to do with yourself gun\nThat's so dangerous that they had their arrest the kid when they found\nOut it's an air soft gun but he wasn't even walking down the street he posted a photo you didn't on right now buddy\nDidn't didn't say I'm going to use this at school and none of that\nVery bizarre [noise]\nThese news radio Ninety seven points and weld ... am Kevin union chaos um\nHe's ten million blue eyed journalists present murdered the first thing that President has said he wants to hear about from his secretary of state the two men now behind closed doors at the White House filing might come pans return from a trip which included Saudi Arabia and turkey that's where ... was last seen entering the Saudi conflict\nOvernight we still have package investigate because again touching the concept is one of the council general's residence that's been a key palaces that investigation on along and now they do continue to say that again with killed tortured and just men but inside those diplomatic mission\nIs Benjamin how and a woman act of kindness going viral employee any public in Florida getting an unusual request\nI Want to pay for first birthday cake and but I Want to do it anonymously\nTurned out that woman was doing it to honor her stillborn grant can\nMake the sharing the story I have some\nGlenn Beck [noise]\nThat great super deer and joined by\nOther skull and fast so uh but that's where all\nThat I that we don't like that should have ... people who call him do you do severely who you\nAre doing it for the governor to try to remember when that happened in a well a lot behind your back we don't like people to call you okay so to your face is so weak chastise them uh when they do it behind your back and that's a great point which is just before we get into this conversation we should point out the name of the saving of course chewing the fat [laughter]\nRight which is just mean\nThe conversation you know\nI also have the fastest growing five cats in America right now yes that was Jeff ... is early Gabby I'm calling to oh yeah right All right Dr scientific measures on that but I Know are the numbers in really good for the new uh subscribers the jazz or wouldn't go to bill goes real happy about it's fun to Monday through friday during the ...
