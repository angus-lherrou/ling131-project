{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "Jak Owens is one of the season Birmingham he's a thirty year veteran of the FBI now retired and we're talking about some of the great great stories that they had and talking about the the Parkland, Florida situation in the school shootings or jak before we were just before the break we said what would you think about arming teachers I Know in Nineteen Seventy four\nThere was a shooting I think in one of the Israeli and in high school and the school in Israel twenty five teachers and students were killed they started arming their their teachers and also some other volunteers came in from the\nFrom the community that dressed up just like faculty you couldn't tell the difference and the two shootings the school shootings since and the the the perp walk it worked was killed both times so what do you think of arming teachers here\nI I have mixed feelings about it built her I come from a family of teachers cousins my brother my parents were teachers\nAnd I'm familiar with how schools work generally unless you're in administration or perhaps in the gym or or our coach you are with your students\nAnd you're ... you're ... you're going to stay with them during the crisis you may not feel like you want to leave them right to go to the neutralize the shooter so you stay put\nI recommend that that's a good policy and that you stay put and defend them as best you can of course I may say that knowing how bad a shot and my brother is\n[laughter] it's going to take some training bill well yeah now now that up at training has to be really good\nOh I understand it and let me be somebody that you know it may be prior military or even to retired police officer or even the all in tears in the community that we come in and again kind of looked like the faculty but they're not\nI Know they're like air marshals and I I really admire air marshals I talked to them I'm sure lights what what we're asking\nOfficers to do and maybe teachers if we armed and you've got to go against the human tied the pandemonium is a rush toward you\nYou have to Wade through that on the way to the shooter everyone's running away from the shooter and that's where the training and discipline comes up comes in\nTo make that one shot as we've said before on the show and make it kept\nThat is that's the key to stopping ... that's not the key to preventing we can't let these people into our schools to begin with this starts slaughtering shoulder and\nThat I I I see why a solution might include the teachers as a law enforcement officer\nWe as a general rule we fear too many guns at the scene of a shooting ... more guns the worse it is and our perspective\nI give you an example the secret service when they protect our presidents I've been involved in that involved at their discretion right acreage service discretion and they wanted our and well know who's armed yeah around the president in the United states all\nWe see I guess so and that we wear special paying that they ask us to help protect I help protected mix and and the Reagan if they help if they want us to we will help them and we give them intelligence\nBut we we work at their discretion I think if we if we armed teachers we want our police resource officers to be involved with the teachers know who they are where they got to be oh sure\nOh absolutely I Know that a Jack o ones were the thirty year veteran of the FBI now retired jak ... I think the the the question in my mind and and I'm I'm In favor of it except\nMy question is and I've asked this to us in front of friends who are police officers and I have many and I pray for their their safety daily always ask God to us around them with the guardian angels about three layers deep\nBut as I said uh if if you are I'm armed\nYou come into the situation I'm the good guy with the gun but how to you know that in ... and how should I react when the cops do show up and I've got my gun out in my hand and it's easily visible\nThat stuff and bill did you see\nThe aftermath of that shooting we force when asked to treat these kids after everything they've been through you know we have to treat them like criminals\nThey have to come out of the school with their hands up and in Parkland they deposited their backpacks and we know from Parkland do worry\nThat the shooter escaped with students yeah that's the big fear it beginning at Columbine own two today the guy the shooter could be in there\nIt looks like the students mhm this one did you like to eat or old should it I hate to even to say his name I don't want to give him the publicity\nAbsolutely and I don't blame you that the end and that's that's the the real irony of the of the situation I wondered you know many times and I know that Monday morning quarterbacking doesn't help in many cases but you know the Hoover driver\nTaking the kid to school he called Hoover did go to and and I understand that he put the put the gun in a I'm In a metal guitar case or something like that and said he was going to practice with the band and that's the reason he was going to school Fifteen minutes for was out\nYeah and I so I but I still wonder if if there was you know if you know sometimes when you're six cents kicks in she might just want to call nine one one on the way over and and pretend like you're asking your wife about dinner or something and it just you know and I still\nHave that feeling that somebody should've that doesn't I mean there's so many instances where they talk about a totally preventable situation this was it\nI think so but technically this one particularly at all all of the other horrible shootings like the lone wolf in Las Vegas I'm hard to prevent that but you gotta know that's where ears and assets in the community\nKick in but there's there's so many things that can go wrong for example the ... wild disassembled his rifle cared at and what your paper into the school book depository nobody thought anything about it yeah\nAnd here we have a ... driver who may or may not have seen something or should\nI figured out what might be going on people don't want to get involved and they don't do what common sense would tell us to do\nThese mass shootings\nWe we need to all be alert now all of us not just law enforcement chore but the American people our greatest resource in law enforcement the American citizen\nIsn't that the jury was talking with a jak Owens hearing in the minute or so that we have left jak and it's been a pleasure talking with you\nUm do you what is the uh what would you do now ... what do you think the next step ought to be I mean you could cause you hear all the people say oh we ought to ban the guns are we going to ban the A R Fifteen or you have to be should be Twenty one now before you buy a gun\nAs Martin Lawrence or the other night when after the after the shooting in Las Vegas nobody said that you should be fifty four to buy a gun that's all that guy was it was during the shooting [noise]\nI I think raising the minimum age for purchasing a good idea as a person who has um\nLiterally thousands of background investigations in my career according up too high federal officials and judiciary I Believe and backgrounds I Know the bureau does a really good job at a background check we have a lot of information on people if\nA problem bill is how you get a someone with a mental problem into a database this is America you know it's not Russia yeah not prudent and or the Chinese and the north Koreans they can round up people and put them into a database\nAnd the new to you know we don't do that we don't have to cheat to these guys we don't have to choose to win it'd be better than the Russians and the Chinese in the north Korean we don't have to cheat our constitution to make us safe either we can do it\nWe're better than that we can successfully prevent these if we just do smart\nYasser jak has been a real pleasure thank you for your service to our country when so many levels reshaped ... and ... it's been an honor and pleasure if um if you wanted to be were put on the president's panel what would you tell him today\nThe charges are upsetting a and and uh they're obviously they triggered an entire a national conversation about sexual assault and sexual harassment about the unequal way or the women and girls are treated in this country\nAt the same time there is as of now no contemporaneous corroborating evidence for any of the charges as far as we know we haven't seen anybody emerging say yes I remember that and that is an important part of the story as well\nThat is not just an important part of the story that is the story\nThat is the story and I for one I for one we'll not condemn Ford and I will not condemn a Brett Kavanaugh I wasn't there I'm not God there is no evidence they need to vote to confirm\nAnd we need to stop the witch hunts [noise]\nNeither listening to blame that probably am so [noise]\nIn my book addicted outrage um there are lots of examples of\nOf why we should really be talking about something entirely different why we should be talking about how do we make how do we strengthen this and spread this around the world\nRight now are dialogue is America's ducks nothing is good everything is bad and that is absolutely not true\nIn the middle chapter of the the book I I ask this question\nIs this worth saving\nNobody is asking this we're talking about getting rid of capitalism changing our whole system changing everything about it it doesn't work no one is asking the question that must be asked first is this worth saving is America and the west good or bad\nIt can be both because people are both but is it on the on the whole has it helped to more people or hurt more people\nWere not having that conversation we are having it now Arthur Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute he's the guy who grew up in Seattle I grew up in the Seattle area um he remembers the first time he saw poverty and I think\nIt's the first time I really saw poverty as well I think it was it was probably the Michael Jackson a that fund raiser we are the world where we were trying to raise money for Ethiopia and we saw these kids with the bloated stomachs and the flies on their face we had never seen anything like that\nThat was a pivot point for Arthur Brooks in his life Arthur welcome to the program\nHey brother Glenn how are you very good viewing months how're you doing\nI'm I'm I Am great I'm great um I I wanted to get you on because we do not talk about\nWhat capitalism are and what this country has has done what the western way of life has done and we're just allowing it to be thrown out the window and you make compelling case because you didn't commit this with politics in mind\n[noise] no I don't you know and and a lot of the things that we are talking about today I was listening to the last segment of your great show and and you you're talking about this big war this big cultural battle that we're having in those countries or whether it's about the Kavanaugh hearings are about\nThe Trump Administration or about capitalism in general these are really kind of proxy cultural battles that we're having in in our country today it's a culture of outrage you've talked about this a lot\nUm you've done humans work on this important topic and it's important for all of us to remember we are so unbelievably blessed in this country we live in a peaceful society I mean you're going to have ... if you dare you know if you if you can stomach it\nAnd listen to people saying the most violent ghastly things to each other but but let's remember there's going to be known knock on the night it was going to be no jak booted thug nobody's going to take you off to prison God Bless this country and we have to stop taking for granted the fact that we live in a democratic peaceful society\nAnd we have to stop trashing each other all the time and having the dome proxy wars that's completely unproductive\nSo ... right now I you know the big ideas are being trashed the ideas of\nFreedom of speech or because you know you have to have a safety the safety space all of these all this nonsense yeah but also capitalism itself when you saw the pictures back in the eighties of those starving Ethiopian\nIt bothered you and you actually that that set your feet on the course of trying to find out what happened to them right\nIt did I mean the fact that I'm a political conservatives today has everything to do with the fact that I share the objectives are most of my [noise]\nMy my left wing friends and family that I care about poverty in ... and I started to look for the way that you can wipe out poverty everybody listening towards clan believe [laughter]\nAnd and that their their obligation infect their privilege to lift up their brothers and sisters at the margins of American society and and and society around the world what really matters is what works what system works while you sleep I became a proponent of American free enterprise system\nAs a gift to the world because I wanted to do more to help my brothers and sisters and I found that there was one system of pulled people up by the billions all around the world these are big issues that we need to be talking about it in America today and how we can do this better\nAnd you give me some of the stats Arthur I Know you I don't know if you have them off the top of your head\nToe absolute so from Nineteen Seventy until today you know when when you when I were\nReally little kid um that was when the world sort of open up and people started to see what was going on so it's really in the seventies when people saw that Ethiopian famine I went to India for the first time when I was Nineteen years old in Nineteen eighty three of starving children it was ghastly\nFrom Nineteen Seventy until two eighty percent of the world poverty has been eradicated starvation level of poverty has been eradicate no Seventy percent of Americans actually think that poverty is getting worse and the reason is because it's never\nLike front page in the New York times or any of the newspaper millions saved from poverty I mean that's not a new story you only see the things that are going wrong but the truth is it to build\nAnd of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of starvation or poverty Glenn since you and our kids and there was one thing that did that and that was democratic capitalism and that is America's export to the world\nThere I don't think you would disagree with me or through um that we are not using the first task of wealth of nations moral sentiments we are we we have we think that capitalism is just going to be good no matter\nYou know who's wielding it and and it's just going to produce wonderful things no it\nAs Adam Smith lines out it it can produce really bad things as well capitalism depends on the people who are willing ... are wielding it but also uh depends on on what our goals are yeah slow and it's got up to now would you agree with that\nYeah that's it well it's kind of the problem is is not capitalism a lot of all we see today wired deals cronyism all the special stuff that's going on with powerful people in Washington D. C. and in every state capitals around the country\nThat's actually not competition that's trying to shut competition down on behalf of powerful people so she'll competition is good competition politics and economics and then the competition of ideas fact is that\nYou know the ... the Glenn Beck show is part of the competition of ideas and a frame democratic nation is very are important\nAnybody wants to shut down competition on behalf of powerful people is not a competitor doesn't believe in capitalism doesn't believe in democracy and doesn't believe in the free exchange of ideas\nTo compete means to do it better than the other guy fairly peacefully and respectfully and to win over an audience and that that's really what we ought to be doing and that's what we're moving away from\nOkay so Arthur I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back with a question that I cannot find a satisfactory answer on I Am a big believer in capitalism\nHowever there is throughout history some people like Vanderbilt et cetera et cetera or they get so much money they have so much power that they are controlling things and it just seems to spiral out of control when you have\nWe have to democratize opportunity of the problem is not that we've got very rich people the problem is people have a hard time rising and we have to be putting our resources and our energy in our law in our initiative toward\nPeople that are at the bottom non so they can all get to the top but so that they can get to the middle the essence of the American experience the ... the moral basis of the American experience is that the the you know three generations ago the Brooks is in the backs\nWere who were just like stretching out\nPotatoes some place they're they're nothing more than ambitious\nRiffraff who came to this country and wanted to get to the middle and support themselves and their families and we have to be warriors for system that make sure that people can go from the bottom to the middle [noise]\nYou know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're gonna find that there's a system of preferences for legacies you know if you went to university is four or five times more likely that your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying you got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience so so that's actually what we need to be thinking about don't worry about Google\nWere a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery at the bottom of our society can't rise today that's that's really an American thing\nAnd why can't they rise\nThat can't rise because we have a discriminatory system unequal education were poor kids are locked into public education systems are parents who don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people that if they don't go to college there somehow losers we don't have a vocational in technical education systems which are the ultimate education reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country and most importantly glad we don't culturally value\nThe skills that come from actually not going to college where people actually homework skills where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did The Apprentice system go away [noise]\nBut went away for a bunch of different reasons but part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America where white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades\nAnd and you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are way through the baby out with the bathwater white kids black kids every kind of kids should have the opportunity to succeed through hard work and skills and political initiative without going to college\nAmazing or there but it's it's that early I think of apprenticeships that I think you know you're going back to\nCharles Dickens times since we've seen is amazing that those that really disappeared in the sixties and seventies back with more Arthur Brooks and is America worth saving that Mm\nKnow

Dallas\nCowboy stadium yeah I think so and so the last bond comedy tour was two thousand nine or\nTwo thousand and it was a bit it's been nominees and so I bet it was common sense yeah yeah it's been a long time so they joined us there's lots of fun joined us grab your tickets Glenn Beck dot com slash to her okay back with a Arthur C Brooks he's the president of the American Enterprise Institute\nArthur though the ... who is we're talking about is this system even worth saving yesterday in politics it was a nightmare and people are just turned off by it and I think they just don't want anything to do with it\nUm on both sides of the aisle I think anybody who is is a rational human being is like this is this is not good none of this is good\nUm however ... we're not having any one stand up for the bill of rights the constitution that's why politics has gone awry 'cause we've deep ... you know unpaid from that\nCapitalism is it's got a horrible name you now have fifty percent of young voters saying you know socialism is great I Want what they have over in Sweden but that's not what they have in Sweden isn't\nNo it isn't and and by the way there are some people standing up for the ... the constitution guys like Glenn Beck and when you got a major megaphone and you're standing up for what's right and true in good\nThe big problem as there are too many people in media and politics and entertainment in our polls campuses on the right and the left\nFrom orchard dining out on the fact that we have a culture of contempt in this country contempt for each other\nI mean Glen you and I we both have everybody listening to us we love people who disagree with us politically that's fine that's a good thing I mean we all should have friends and and people that we love we just have to agree with them we should disagree strongly but we don't have to hate it when there are people that are making money and getting famous and getting powerful\nBy trying to get us to hate each other even more we should be talking about these good things that you talk about the things that really bring us together and then try to disagree in a way that the competition can actually convince other people persuade other people of our ideas but\nThat's the big problem right now too many people are getting too rich\nBy by getting us to hate our neighbors and that's not right\nSo Arthur let's have let's have the conversation I'm I'm somebody in college and I say capitalism is evil and you know there's nothing wrong with socialism socialism is graded works in the Netherlands\nI Know so I hear I hear it all the time we saw him on college campuses all the time they're waiting not to take that on is by trying to create a liberal tears that's the wrong way\nTo do is to attack somebody who's motive and to say that their belief system is stupid\nThat will you can never ever ever insult somebody into agreement and by the way it's an immoral thing to do because these are your brothers and sisters as well the key thing to start off with an any argument is to acknowledge the objective the moral objection to the people is to is to give voice to the fact that\nYou you want these social systems 'cause you want something more poor poor people have more equality where people have more opportunity right and get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it\nAnd then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship ... lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history it's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody's ever thought of in the history of humanity and say [noise]\nAnd now the problem is not that this is an equal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments because most I think even most conservatives um fold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden can you describe what that is\nYeah so I just do this movie the pursuit that that that you mentioned in the last segment of coming out in the spring and part of it is actually filmed in Denmark in Denmark has considered to be the happiest country in the world it's a it's a social democracy it has the

good\nBecause I Can't think of any other president in my lifetime since Ronald Reagan that would have stood for this and would have stood against it you\nKnow I Know I the heat surprises me a on a pretty regular basis and I guess I should be used to it by now but um you know that's why that's why people voted for him yeah for for this very reason he's willing to ... he's willing to stand and make this fight because he believes in it\nAnd it's ... it's just nothing I really didn't think he had it in ... yeah you know we've talked about it before\nYou've got to admit when you're wrong and here's another case of me being wrong and I I Will tell you I think this guy is such a solid citizen at least from what I Know that I don't think he would ever do this but boy oh boy Democrats\nI

universities\nIn the\n... ...\nIt's really hard really very very hard [noise] who [noise]\nWho remain [noise]\nReasonable [noise] when the world is unreasonable [noise]\nBut we must\nNo one will listen to any message if we are just hurling insults\nIf we are fighting fire with fire it will change no one's mind if you don't believe me\nHow many minds did we change\nDid we changed the course\nOf two thousand ten and I I Want you to know I don't think that um we did the fight as much as the press tried to convince everyone we were these evil monsters saying X Y and Z and demanding violence\nSo I understand that\nBut because of that which we don't necessarily have this time\nThe media has changed it's not as important social media is much more important than the regular media\nAll right\nSo what's the best way to get people to come on our side it's never to point the finger at them it's it's never to call them names and I know this from experience\nYou know this because I'm going to be honest with you I did that to you because I was so convinced I was right\nThat I did that you are you instead I didn't listen to you I just thought you were crazy these are the your your flushing down this and that and blah blah blah and you're wrong no no\n\nYou saw things a different way and as I have said on many occasions on this program since the election\nI was wrong on multiple occasions but what amazes me is when I say those things the number of people who just want to rub my face in it\nTo me is I'm a ... if Kavanaugh loses the vote\nThe only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the vote which could be really bad because it will be the Republicans that do it\nUm however Donald Trump comes out and while she says yeah that's over here's the guy he ups the ante and you get a guy that all conservatives are rabbit about\nGuy somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a skill Leah\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of\nPeople's favorites I mean they're okay with him but no I always willing to die in a sword for memory might remember Kavanaugh was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them he item leader I personally think the best course of action\nIs to nominate let's say let's say flake and Collins come out and go you know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great\nDonald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next a nominee and you know what he's already been vetted for the FBI and every senator knows them\nSo we're going to be calling for a vote next week easy easy you know that that's the thing to do because then you have them battling just on abortion right there at the time and place they'd have about everybody correct and that's not\nGoing to hurt conservatives getting to the polls if if you put\nA staunch conservative somebody who says yeah I think abortion is wrong and if it comes before me I'll look at the case of course but I think it's wrong I think it's murder\nAnd that and world versus Wade was a terrible decision you\nThen have\nRepublicans running to the polls and you'll also have Democrats but I think that's your best case scenario gets Laker Collins\nFlake on coming\n[noise] mercury\nThese news radio Ninety seven point seven and twelve Ninety am W.

check on Kevin ... which again I'm\nSo we have that going for us uh and\nThey were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned Oh yes we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist\nOh thank you that's up in the area important it's so important very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold the role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr or or or um uh\nAttorney general general attorney general and ready to go one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's just a certain candidate who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nOr by a woman or he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this mhm there's a separation between the cabinet case in the house in case\nOf the cabinet case happens ah thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's the one difference ... a professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nYes she did a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort between ... and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that really got both of those so the little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay and so does\nWhat did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course well yeah well in their words case\nThey both have a notes from there do they do around those cases at the ... the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which she referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story\nThat she's telling now or never named Kavanaugh the notes from uh the uh Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries huh um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction between those two things\nOne has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll using meeting\nMe yeah and so she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident and has photos of bruising ... on her the other one of course does not um being for chip and have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with though of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening the people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them said I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way a key those in a girlfriend has also\nA named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax um writings um pictures\nAnd those are things that she showed two co workers in real time in\nReal time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like having a ... the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime but but but lives in I mean you I mean you don't have videotape well there was a videotape\nNow we haven't seen it yet though ha ha now there is allegedly videotape that exist some uh uh one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the Kavanaugh thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with the veil and\nRight and we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact I don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we I mean like we have him out more I was like we have a preponderance of

he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks and he tells the\nTruth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line and that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is and it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that erupts Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gay but it was an interview in fact where he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go\nAnd then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to implant things in our brain and here's Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe ... he's a ... I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yes I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and uh and I think it's his background as an engineer or ... or and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film was saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there more than just a company to make money or they have a certain the east coast a certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did in which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about paying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlands are using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the cabinet case and how for instance you know there's there's um\nA ... there is this overwhelming uh\nUnderstanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seeing that\nRight yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past or in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... Stein or have science a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country\nDoing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and he ... you don't know that it's going on nobody is monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they're getting is representative of some objective standard\n... is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun verb auto Google it yes well I mean Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yeah sacks real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly well because it's occurring in real time but\nThe bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about ...\nAbout these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of us suppress certain stories\nUm this is a thing in Google does it end and here's the the the point that we tried to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put up my fake news story the pointed it out in the open you have combat and by the way the news doesn't really convince anybody\nYou know that's that's not right that's eight speech we'll get to that when we come back [noise]\nYou know when you can always on the news radio savannah dot com Mm\n[noise]\nLocal weather summit for the Senate and found this afternoon with the chance of showers and

accountability Institute producer of a new documentary that his out you find it at the creepy\nLine dot com um the creepy line and it comes from a a quote from\nThe guy who's running the Google that you know we were not going to implant things into your head but we're going to come right up to that creepy line that's terrifying beer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I wanted I Want to talk to you about the platform me\nI Am currently saying to anyone who has a conservative voice let's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business or any but we have to have a protected platform\nBecause I Believe these companies\nAre are going to the platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing going here yeah and I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back in first to consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine\nGoogle actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning they blacklisted the entire Internet that shows you the the scope and the size that Google has wait a minute how it's it's a ... they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW\nYes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous\nAnd a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using it Google products somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but is your company ... you know it may be John Smith at acme incorporated dot com but his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product\nBecause if it is golf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use Google we we we highlight in the film for example\nRobert up sign this caller who's been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um Iran or did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this was back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they could shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech on gender or race or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being they have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves\nThey view themselves as a company with a mission so\nHere's what people say when when you know what I use ... well you know Google is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually you are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however\nThey are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a I research so\nGoogle isn't free right for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of it look\nLike there's that this is just at the beginning let me tell ya boogie story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of Beijing how many people it used to look it up for me well you're still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy ... pick somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide okay [laughter]\nThey had a picture of the guy and the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city":
