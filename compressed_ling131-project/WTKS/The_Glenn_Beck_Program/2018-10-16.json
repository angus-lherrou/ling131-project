[noise]\nGoing back program and\nWe need to have a power about Elizabeth Warren to now ... we need to make that a oatmeal soup that she made in ... found don't know I think we should try that I Hope that somebody smoking peace pipe on this whole thing because\nThis is this is just outrageous don't you think yeah she released this big uh basically I Would say presidential audition video yesterday and show everyone that she was for Native American yeah super duper NATO really was a she's Cherokee she's Cherokee and Delaware\nYes ah which is a is something that does not\nYou can demean backed up by the facts now they first came out and said well the DNA test shows her to be one thirty second uh Cherokee\nAnd then they revise that you won ... ... the media revise they can they actually looked at the report and says one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve and ... then they realized hoops you do see we made a a math there this is a serious correction they didn't go to see in the corruption but they pay they should have a cause that always makes everything better sure but it was between one\nUh one sixty fourth in one one thousand twenty fourth I Believe it was yeah one one thousand twenty fourth now that of course in and of itself so he kept the human body up to what one thousand twenty four pieces that one of them one of those pieces\nWould have a little bit of Cherokee now theoretically right I could at least give her a\nTechnical defense of her bull crap over the past fifty years right where she's lying and saying she's a you know she's a Native American and she's uh getting benefits for this and she's getting her stupid super recipes in Palau chat which is the goal of almost everybody\nIn America how how some wild child and they want to talk about appropriating a culture powwow chow that's what I'm going all ... I'm going all full I\nI've just I'm going to I just but let's all complain about the names of out ball teams but what's ... I don't want to hear how wild out already or\nFrom here on out our\nOur audiences called our tribe and we mean it in the Native Americans sense it's a tribe to trial it does\nThe I mean there are studies that show that the average ... percent of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing\nIn her study average person the average person because he I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it up to ...\nThey just didn't show any DNA from an actual Native American yet what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not participating in DNA studies we don't want\nAny DNA studies so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test\nThe DNA against we have to use\nPeople from Peru Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well\nWay and there's the theory is that they those the same people want to migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she is Native American blood and it's not even what they tested\nA and even that it's it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you if you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed and like to point out over the years he would not show the his Canadian blood\nSites like that's not the way this works they oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian DNA does is it shows the lineage of game shows it's it can be interesting in some ways show migration Paterson I Wonder if he would it would have his blood would show that he's\nA thousand times more Hispanic than a\nProminent friends disorder or if it's true it probably would show about a ... so it's\nInteresting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and\nFalling flat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was um it was a her great great great great grandmother\nI think a several generations back and um when she register it was in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white now the theory again as put forth by the the war in a campaign and and and and this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of thing you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right ... and they were able to get away with that there'd be some serious incentives to do that number\nObviously what that is true we don't know that is true with this person right we don't know that it was true with hit her great great great great great great grandmother Titanic secondarily yeah but what have we learned from progressive we've learned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white\nAnd now or denying her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she's not\nThat was what I was we were not allowed to apply to any money we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as\nCherokee so we have to accept that she is so we can't accept look what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous this story is just so rich I don't really care\nI don't care either I don't care that she's lighting and the people you know she's lying or let me just like looking I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face\nMore than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those yet those got them you know we've got to start making\nThem or I Want one more than life itself okay so you know where I'm coming from however\nYou know we all have things I have a story in my family okay of ah one of my great great great grandfather is now my my grandfather actually took a horse of being a full size horse he was a he was kind of a vet\nAnd he told him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else ... and he took him and he punched him in the head and knock the horse out okay so ... my family my on my mother's side they're big people\nUh [laughter] and they may they they had muscles in them that I don't have okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather or was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept\nA jumping over and getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this and he picked it up and threw it over the fence I don't know if that's true I gotta go in and say it's not my family you don't know [laughter] so he could be truly might not be true\nOh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing you oh yeah this\nIs what it was but it was the was it was not true somebody advantages through your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls and I was ... I almost made it into WWE but how many times have you told a story you been on the air for how many years never never I've never you you've you've yeah yeah yeah I get it I again\nIf she is ... trying to play identity politics and if you're going to play identity politics you better be right on these things and that's\nWhy it can give you that I got what it's about is I give you that you're not a huge story I mean ... you know we ... well you know what is a huge part of the story\nIs the Cherokee Nation came out yesterday and said quote\nA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lint lineage such as return ally a to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a da and ... a test to claim any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses wildest honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal air at the edge okay look not a good look\nThey're they're not they're not offering the piece by peer to her or she should probably zip it and it does this\nYou're you've been eaten you've been eaten\nBy the hard left and the Democrats are waking up to it they don't like what's happening on campuses they don't like what's happening in the news they may not like what's happening in the White House either but they're not about shouting their abortion\nKnow when you see chaos always on the news radio ... dot com\nFox News I'm Krista ... the family of a missing journalist is calling for an independent international investigation the Turkish government claims that he was murdered by a Saudi Arabian security team at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nMike Pompeo sign king king Solomon ... to his visit on behalf of President Trump compatriots being dispatched to discuss the disappearance of ... a critic of the Saudi crown prince\nThat's Fox is Simon on their report the Saudi Government they admit that ... was killed accidentally drug companies would have to disclose prices for prescription medicine in TV ads under a new roads being proposed by the federal government health and Human Services secretary out because these are says customers deserve to know if they're being overcharged\nThe drug to understand the industry's trade group is proposing listening prices on Web sites but not in those commercials secretary is our says that's not good enough [noise]\nThis is Fox News [noise]\nNinety am deputy chaos [noise]\n...\nWill Stanford welcome to the program led to hear\nHow are you sir I Glenn how ya doing\nGreat good [noise]\nSo uh we'll for having me oh You're welcome a welcome to the program what's on your mind\n[noise] well um [noise] you know I had written you an email and wanted to say thank you very much for being an inspiration [noise] um and I followed politics since I was eleven years old and I see you as well to the great minds and political commentary today\nAnd um [noise] recently I I saw an interview between you and Dan Shapiro yeah\nUm and he came out and spoke about your past with alcohol and how that you had to enter a and I talk to you and struggling with alcohol myself um any of them being drunk when I watched that video I'm\nYou know I I stopped island you know this this man with all the stress that he goes through\nA he's he's managed to overcome this problem and become a better person and really I've seen a good change in your personality um do you become much more humble and so because of your inspiration I decided to step out and go to AA myself and uh it's been a huge help\nValue when did you go to AA when did you just start\nAbout three weeks ago\nAnd you're still you're still sober Oh absolutely yes or having a great time at that\nReally that wasn't my experience but good for you good for you know [laughter] so ah so ah what was it that was set in that that that turned you\nKnow it was um [noise]\nWe're talking about the ... it was funny you know of course it was it was really impacting ...

because nobody else is am I right is that what what's happening\nYeah well look at those to those two versions or wouldn't have been that different on friday night the the guys who are looking for a fight they got in some extra kicks right and so that's maybe five seconds of violence that wouldn't have happened if they went your way\nThat's five seconds out of three days of terror or antifa was was threatening the venue they were giving death threat to this old lady who answered the phone they're\nOkay hang on hang on we're starting to let's go back to what you were doing what the venue is what I had and you have to hit on the poster because uh [laughter]\nI think the poster is just to be entertaining but go ahead\nWell I Try it again the coach you kill a socialist where the samurai sword in Nineteen sixty and\nIt's a funny troll that a lot of right wing guys do it sort of like the tennis shaping rewrite the helicopter rides for ... and early early satire right right so it it it's that kind of set up I announce it on Tuesdays call myself a toy again like Gabby and I bought a shot myself into his mug shot\nUm second we announced that and and they want to nose to nose with a satire and he goes all the blast they start attacking the venue attacking the old lady there the calls are coming from all over the country by the way it\nSo this was a planned attack that anti for his work I think than seeing the people working hand in hand traditional as well organized and well funded so\nAnd that those attacks continue night before the venue totally trashed windows smashed ridiculous pretentious manifesto nailed to the door that says that we put the Republicans on notice a this is only the beginning we are not civil which by the way the Hillary quote\nA then I get to the venue that night for the next night total in outer chaos you're dismayed signed screaming hurling bottles of urine\nWhich one of them hit my car on the way out a ... organized rallies like there's this guy named Matt sat you'll see if you really get deeper into the foxhole where he is calling it the first thing you know you guys go over there over there I citizen journalists get beat up\nTake his backpack their police to arrest him and\nThen they they arrest the citizen journalists\n... no no I'm Sorry to arrest three of the of the end who mop this guy okay but I had I interviewed him today and he was talking about coordinated attacks seemed very military so this isn't anarchy these anarchist start pulling off\nWell you you know I I don't know I'm sure you are um and to FAA Austin\nIs a ... on their Facebook page has called for a guerrilla style tactics they've they've called for a\nWhat do they call it a black shirt army or something I read a red shirt army I Can't remember 'em but they're calling for people that just want to go out and do what ... normally does but they're also calling now for a an actual standing army\nAnd they were looking for people that know military tactics that could teach people so that's that's happening and of course Facebook doesn't have a problem with with covering that but\n... that must be the Mets had tried the police are looking for that my citizen journalists told me about 'em so yeah that those guys were charged with assault and robbery because they took his backpack so now you know when I by the way peaceful amount of Martin Luther King I must say I saw the same experience\nRight up till now and it's been days and then it's time to leave\nI come out there I've got my plastic sword I make a for a yam a Gucci joke and that's when they heard all the year and that may I jump in the car\nAnd then a group of Proud Boys are are the last wants to go they they leave and the video just came out yesterday on breaking nine one one on Twitter they were attacked by antifa fully clad with\nAll their gear and they throw a bottle at them and a huge fight breaks out and now\nIn your world that fight would have been you know\nHey cops cops or something like that and then I'll come actual it's a little bit longer but again five to ten seconds different so we're splitting hairs here you know the real issue is we're up against\nHomicidal lunatics with no gender ... plan it's not like they know where we're going to get you know our our gas and oil from after the revolution these guys just want to burn America to the ground and the media is on their side\nYou know so it's so frustrating because um we had the same kind of thing happening out in in Portland, Oregon and uh you know Portland has I don't know who this mayor is what I mean\nWhat the hell is he doing where that they're already directing traffic ... the police are standing a block away then they do nothing\n[noise] well my understanding with these super left wing towns like Berkeley in Portland is the mayor allows anti for re chaos and then he can say sorry Trump's supporters are trouble\nI mean look at all the chaos that happens with someone who likes Trump's shows up when when\nRepublicans and conservatives are around so let's just you know if you don't want to antifa around stopping off that's their sort of Monaco and it works\nIt's interesting because because the initial video seemed to indicate that your guys were in the wrong that they had they started this and and they started the violence\nThe second video that was released however shows clearly someone from ... throwing something a at a at a the ... the Proud Boys and and the Mets won the fight breaks out it was not something that you guys at least ... the main one that has been covered it was not something that you guys instigated\nAnd it's strange how quick the media is to run with the evil Nazi narrative which out doing any research whatsoever and isn't it strange to how the media takes five second clip and makes that\nThe total story when we have days and days and days of subterfuge stays in the domestic violence\nIt's almost like I'm at I'm at a point now where I think they don't just like antifa they aren't you so I think a lot of these journalists these little hospital bloggers will go to rallies the masks on I'm convinced\nI Will tell you I I uh I'm having a very hard time defending a the press which I have\nTried to be more moderating or on my on my words with the press but the the deeper we get in to the violence on the streets and the calls for kick 'em when they're down in all of this stuff\nThere is no excuse when when when the when they will not Cole a mob mob an angry mob when everybody knows what that means I I don't know what I I don't know what to say I I mean how\nDo you and I can't go to restaurants Tucker Carlson just today said he can't go to restaurants and they own their own conservative can go to a restaurant today that's a new one and it's because the the media will throw around a white supremacist\nLike it it means absolutely not think oh it's a crime is this is someone who sees white people as above all other races just inherently better and wants all the other races out of America that is that we're markedly\nEsoteric view to have it's it's a crazy if you to have and they just throw it on it and it sticks like glue and it affects our families affects our lives\nAffects our personal lives there's gotta be some culpability there\nOkay so Gavin hold on for a second I Want to I Want to take you over across the breaking and just\nAsk you what it is you believe what is the America that you see and that your fighting for [noise] back with Gavin begin is coming up and just a second let me tell you a little bit about gold lying if you\nThink this stuff is going away quickly it's not a if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress we are in we're in for a real wild ride um they are going to subpoena the tax records\nAnd when they don't get the tax records from the White House the White House will bring it to the Supreme Court and then the\nUh Democrats will say the Supreme Court doesn't have the you know doesn't have a right to do this because of\nOf ah Kavanaugh on and cabinet needs to recuse himself and he's not going to recuse himself then they're going to try to impeach cabin on and they all impeach but Donald Trump I mean it's this what's happening\nThis is what's happening these people are playing for keeps and they are not paying attention to things like oh I don't know the economy is it any really heard you know I see the tweets from Donald Trump all the time I see all the stuff they're saying about Donald Trump has anybody really heard what's going on with the stock market\nDoes anybody really paying attention to what's happening with Saudi Arabia that's a pretty big deal especially when you look at the price of oil a anybody pay attention that nope not in

Ninety nine a civil war um and the liquidation of about thirty thirty thousand Brazilians\nHe is extraordinarily divisive but he is not he's not talking about a smaller government he is talking about a government run by the military or at least the has in the past correct\nAnd he's surrounded by military so a haze closest advisors today are a military base so as a an exception is a follow get just a\nThat is appointed as he's minister of economy this guy is\nA liberal so we have several defenses regarding President Trump as you mentioned he's a he's a liberal and he uh comes as he had strong relationships with financial markets in Brazil so this is the man\nThat he points that out as a base of the trust in his government but uh he said he uh ...\nNot clear how he will manage his own team he has had some trouble controlling or his advisers that have given a interviews or saying things that he had laid it to a unauthorized them so uh it is\nThey had a he will close down and keep a very close government regarding depressed for example he has been using social media as his basic communication tool [noise]\n... this is the kind of ... kind of the same thing that you go job has said\nWhen he was running the first time he said oh no it's not going to be this way I'm not going to do and he immediately came in and he started taking over the media and and uh nationalizing everything is ... is there a ...\n... is that we're we're looking at are we looking at a uh a dictatorship possibility with him that is the military and is it when you say he's liberal is that is that mean a socialist Marxist or what does that mean exactly in Brazil\nWhat we expect here most analysts are don't see any mediate\nA risk to democracy as hey we'll take office and immediately he will shut down Congress that's not what has been a discussion here at this time what is expected that maybe he could uh\nPromote some change in constitution and it is not clear how he would do it he has suggested that he could create a council that would ah create a new constitution for Brazil and that would be set and made it to\nA vote or after eight so and in a console to two people to a electors in general so it he had to to take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will bring it back when he takes office\nBecause the fact is that he's not going to debate he is giving a\nJust a few interviews and usually he controls the process has been speaking mainly through social media so he has no conversation from the press and this ah\nCreates a of an unknown territory we don't know what's coming but\nA analyst most analysts don't expect something so drastic at right at the time\nIncluding because uh in the legislative elections he got a a strong a\nPerformance in eh from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some level of government melody and he will be able to do some of the changes that he intends to but we still don't know exactly what\nWhat do those changes come it can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\nA death wish I had both ... son it ...\nAnd he posted on line a while back a\nPhoto of him I'm next to ban in and said that Bannon as said he would be glad to help in the campaign or something like this at\nThis generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved the end was responsible in a great part of a sudden out of strategy but both of them out of himself\nA case of public afterwards and said it was fake news that has nothing to do with it what do we know for a fact\nIs that Bannon has given some indications that he considers a ... an expression of this right wing movements in bed with the uh in other parts of the world and he includes a Donald Trump in this a movement so he understand that it's\nA it's a clear wave in this\nDirection and both so now that would be an expression of this but we have no a clear indication that he would be involved there's a picture\nOf him close to the presidents get a presidential candidate sun and some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow but we don't know exactly at what point\nAre Clarissa when when is the election finalized when do we know\nAre now at the end of the month a ... on Sunday twenty eighth or will have the final result it's very likely that considering the current\nPolls that bill so not a we'll be elected uh we uh yesterday we had a recent poll that gave both so NATO fifty nine percent of valid votes and ... that is the candidate from the workers' party only forty one\nSo it's a big ... and a ... a poll after poll has indicated that uh his delight to our ferry sure of their votes so we we would have to have a new fact something that would be strong enough to change the scenario button\nAnd it's very likely that hit he wins the election\nClarissa we'll talk to you again after the election and to find out some more we'll be following okay thank you so much ... appreciated okay thank you so much for having me you about\n\nWhat is disturbing about this is his history or he has\nA he has a very very strong history of um of dictatorship a love and passion and ah he is not\nA Donald Trump he's not he has time in the government and he is on record now he says he's changed demand\nA you know but this is the way things happen you don't come in as a dictator you know even Hitler didn't come in as a dictator he came in as a public servant and um and things are bad in Brazil\nThe other thing that has really should pay attention to is Steve Bannon Steve Bannon is flying all over the world and he is a helping cobbled together this a populist movement and\nPopulism is neither good nor bad it's what are the Ames\nAnd uh what are they what ... what's you know what to someone use populism to get through populism is the Patriot act\nMake it so it sounds populist make it so it sounds popular make it so it sounds like something everybody will want that's populism and you can use that for good or evil and I'm In my opinion Bannon is\nOn the dark side of this one and he is definitely someone to keep your eye on and so we're all the candidates that he chooses and chooses to engage with um because I'm In the rest of the world\nThe the believe it or not softness and a tempered Donald Trump doesn't necessarily exist are sponsored this half hour is simply safe\nSimply safe is the way to guard your home to watch over you and your family and it's the craftsmanship\nThe craftsmanship that actually helps um I'm simply safe beat out all of the other competitors and it makes it so worth it when you when you see simply safe\nAnd you see the price of it and then you see the quality of some simply safe and then you see the quality a and the lack of craftsmanship and more importantly how much you've been paying for the other system it'll blow you away\nIt's also a really good for renters or something we don't talk about often but my my sister in law has a new baby another one on the way a and is
