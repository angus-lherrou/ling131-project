{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "Long before I did but my boards are rotting maybe ten at that time I have about fourteen hundred square foot\nDeck and so this has regular pressure treated would correct Yes sir outweighs the lifetime warranty still Kay alright\nHum and they don't give me a really hard time about just require an incredible amount of documentation but what\nI'm calling you about it have you heard a lot of people\nVoicing concern that the ... ... it's the cellulose in the woods teary Rachel it would actually watch not on the surface was from the inside out I mean you could as the board finally kicks in and does as you can put your foot through\nYeah um I just wanted to make sure this is this is not a composite decorating fluidly no it's okay it's what yeah I've had a few calls but I Can't say that I've had a lot of calls I've had more\nAbout the composite than than I have the pressure treated wood but the whole industry as a whole and I'm sure you've realized this and found that South\nAnd you're researching it wasn't just one company as the entire\nIndustry when they went from cc a treated wood to the AC cute too then other formulations\nThere were issues there were issues with the AC whew\nI'm with the um rusting of the\nActual Joyce hangers an actual nails and screws exact and then they went into these other ones and the the the different types I mean everybody's using different formulations and they weren't but but I Can't say that it is a massive problem at least that has touched me\nWell I can see from my standpoint it's actually I Can't call it a massive problem it's just so aggravating because as I replaced boards\nIt's so hard to you know feeling individual board and my deck is probably dying ten twenty percent at a time\nYeah well it's a massive problem if it's happening to you I mean well yeah\nBut I my decision has to be whether I keep fiction replace it needed boards as they go bad or terrible thing up and spend a huge amount of money to put something else though so anyway I just was concerned if you've heard that\nI had a few calls and I have heard of it and when I said massive I mean I'm not getting calls every week about it\nI'm In ... which is out there um\nYeah I get it then I get the whole uh you know do I do I bite the bullet now or do I just keep letting it made me and just do it a little bit of time I totally understand that\nThe other thing I Would I'd like to share with your listeners is is that one of the documentation things on these forge\nIt's not the stamp the stamp on the board that only tells them where the lumber may Russia's right but the sticker on the in the little stapled on usually a plastic sticker\nThey if they're going to put down their boards pull a couple of those off the stick them in an envelope right save them that's the\nThat's the crucial part of proving over here for ... processed\nAnd and ... and how it was a process that exactly what interests us and who saves those labels huh yeah well actually\nI actually was fortunate one feeling up some of my bed boards I found a couple of those into joining early said my big\nAnd I hear ya I don't think I Would have saved them actually ride in you know even to this day Jim I'll just take it a step further because we just try to educate people the best we can um we went through a process just so three or four years ago\nWhere in processing they started this thing called ground contact\nIn non ground contact pressure treated wood and I stated on here numerous times you can have a deck that's twelve feet up in the air and if you got trees around it and wet leaves fall on it it's the same as ground contact\nAnd ... do you how to use the ground contact pressure treated would all the time in my book and now after four years we're starting to see\nSome of the big box stores the lumber yours figured is a long time ago uh but you know it's all about price in the big box stores and they now some of 'em are just carrying just the ground contact thank God because\nShe says makes perfect sense yeah exactly well if I don't know if\nYou want to hear a quick version of this but if any of your folks have been to Stockholm, Sweden uh-huh ... they discovered the ship was the was it was discovered in the ...\nIn Ninety three leading and it was a ship built by the king of ... warship be went down to the architects office after they get laid the cue for this thing and he said wait a minute you've only got one of the ship I Want to go into the architect should know\nYour your majesty we can only do one gun because that's the way the ship design that hey I'm the king I Want to show\nYou know he's the king solely bill ... to ... actually launched the ship ... bands played one over it drifted out into the harbor and a little breeze came up in the ship flipped upside down and went to the bottom\nAnd they discovered it a couple of hundred years later\nThe building museum so that was in a museum in Stockholm harbor was a result of this the sweet gum usually the lumber people their wife are probably the foremost uh in this whole idea would preservation\nMhm and those are the guys they're the best of forty or what happens to cellulose would have made some Kurdish but\nI imagine the discoveries they've made probably which kind of leading the industry that they shouldn't bookkeepers posed to a gym\nOn um how your uh\nTrials and tribulations a proceed thank you much for the call and we will\nWrap up another our men Thomas ... very well something that really last put on your home I'm so envious to this metal roofing well if you're getting ready for a roof and you're going to be in that house for a while I Want you just consider a metal roof\nIt's ah they

with these white bubbles so yesterday um [noise]\nThe gentleman came back and you get the guy leading I Believe\nRight that's being removed it ...\nAnd he reads the ... and it rained within\nHours [laughter] so I think I got a worse problem then I had originally doesn't look bad right now I\nSee the to like a bubble in prefer that I'm an ... you know where they like to break ... looked like they need you know ... and I say these like white bottles from\nK O my question is what do I do now do I start all over again you\nCan ... ... ... ...\nAnd this is only one of several problems that show I don't know whether I should be you know having it down again so so if I should wait the winter and over again and praying yesterday\nWas not going to go way would be my guess\nI'm ... ...\nIs is what will remove that um but now is it's so massive that\nYou couldn't do that\n[noise] well I you know I ... I could do it again you know I could I just didn't know if it was a safe thing to do after it had been sealed twice already and said\nWell ... is kind of cutting through the sealer uh-huh so I don't know where they do in the whole area with design leaner just\nWork out who they spotted you know where that spots were originally with those ...\nAnd then what did they do with the similar\nThey failed everything they everything not just outside ... and then you know within an hour or two it started raining [laughter]\nSo now there are you contacted them at all not yet if it gets yesterday and ah I thought I'd try that you know pick your brain first before I\n... yeah I Do I Know a lot of good\nThings about the um you know the glove Steelers that they use an stamp concrete is it doesn't have to penetrate liked\nThe um the is the I'm\nKind of training I guess ... it's designed to lay on top to create a gloss so it's not like it has to be removed to put another coast sealer on there so you know at first blush my guess is I Do the same process\nDo it again I Would er and they\nGet racy of those areas and instead of the whole thing or\nA year with I mean if you can do that I mean if you can do that that ... can be sprayed on or it can be brushed on so if it's in kind of like what would be the sole mortar joints and that's where the bubbles or maybe you could just\nYou know rubs zoning there and then just come back with a sealer in a paintbrush and just kinda seal that area\nUm that would yeah I mean you're not really affecting the other sealer\nMhm so okay for like a spot traded versus doing\nI Would think so sure I don't see any reason why you need to spray the sealer over everything\nOkay okay um and my second concrete question is I had another major problem in the basement and I had water in the basement that the basement is finished\nBut they're a floor with painted and so now why did that in a week it has a lot of things down and so it's six but\nI ship that you know I'm paying off but now and now we want to repeat that floor but I don't want to show that difference\nI'm part of the floor where that didn't get\nOkay so you got your ... it's going to be on the eve and you're going to be able to see where the different layers of pay for that so there's two option and there there's one option but to ways to accomplish it the option is to remove the existing pain\nAnd there are ways to do that you can either do it mechanically or you can do a chemically\nSo mechanically you can rent a grinder from a tool rental like a buffer with the diamond buffer and it's going to remove the paint\n'em and it's not too hateful I mean they will um so that'd be option one chemically there is\nA ... it it's that as advanced as so much more than it was just ten years ago even\nFive years ago there's a there's a product that they're called blue bear a paint remover I'm In the it it's um non toxic\nMhm so you put a thick layer of it on a you know late afternoon and in the morning you get up and just literally take a scrape room just scrape off the pain\n[noise] okay if they live there um [noise] do I\nBuy it online or you buy it on line ... on line\nSo so it is the website is called\n...
