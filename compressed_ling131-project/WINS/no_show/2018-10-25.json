enforcement that ultimately has proven they will find the perpetrators but so many times it's because\nUh an individual citizens step forward with information that really led to the key breakthrough if you have information share it\nIf you're concerned about uh packages that could arrive at your home or your workplace you see something that worries you reach out to the police get their involvement to address the situation\nPeople can be part of solving this immediate challenge but finally we all can be a part of solving the bigger situation that we're facing as a society as a nation\nOf tone of civility a tone of mutual respect is something we all can create\nWe shouldn't just ask what are the most prominent voices doing we also have to ask question are all of us\nTreating each other with respect treating men and women and law enforcement respect people in the media report the news treating them with respect this is something that we all have to do as a way of addressing a crisis like this and we can and I have great confidence that we will thank\nYou [noise] a commission marathons and Germany [noise] right now the FBI\nJoint terrorism task forces around

investigation we're working quickly to process and analyze relevant information from the suspicious packages recovered over the last few days we will continue to do so for as long as it takes an until there is a resolution\nThis is a nationwide investigation involving multiple jurisdictions coast to coast to give you a sense of scope just here on the New York to ATF agencies ranging from ATF\nThe u._s. postal inspection service the secret service the NYPD the New York state police and dozens of other federal state and local agencies are working shoulder to shoulder\nI Want to thank those partners for their efforts there collaboration and hard work much of their leadership is in the room with us today I also want to personally thank the hundreds of men and women that are up the street working on this together\nThe FBI will continue to focus all of the resources at our disposal to identify and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible for these acts\nThe investigation is still in its early stages I have said this each time that we face similar situations but it bears repeating today it is vitally important that we do not inadvertently disclose information that could adversely impacted our investigation or a future prosecution\nThe public understands the need for this level of operational security and for that reason I Will not be able to answer specific questions on what we know\nWhat I can say is that of various times over the last few days Ken suspicious packages were located at multiple locations in New York Maryland Florida Delaware and Los Angeles\nLaw enforcement responded and each package was collected by experts and examinations are now underway at the FBI lab in Quantico\nAdds to the devices located in New York which contained a powder\nThe initial analysis indicates that the powder in those particular ... did not present a biological threat other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nWe continue to advise the American public to remain vigilant as it does remain possible further packages had men or could be mailed\nThese devices should be considered dangerous report any suspicious package to law enforcement and it is worth repeating do not touch do not move do not handle any specific suspicious or unknown package leave it to the law enforcement professionals\nWe're also asking the public to call us with any information you may have we have set up a hotline nationwide that hotline is one eight hundred call FBI and we also have a link set up where you can provide information via the Internet at tips dot FBI dot Gov\nWe are actively investigating tips you have already provided please continue

call the bomb squad directly you spoke to the bomb squad they advised him to also notified the first precinct\n'em and they went directly to the scene they were met by emergency service um what the
