easy money bit ended eight six six six three nine seven four let's get to it Leslie whose first\nAlison Illinois Illinois is on the line at the question about some gutters what's going on at your money pet\nSo we bought our first home um [noise] and it's in the city so it's very close to the house next to us they're smaller and I'm probably ... feet from my neighbor and the south but it's um they're hoping to finish our basement that we're looking at a lot of that but\nWe also have this enormous puddle that happens every time it rained in between that you have this okay which is nice but anyway so I had all I don't actually know offense stranded okay in Chicago um [noise] but yeah I just wondering what we can do about that it's pretty on the ground is\nSo first of all you mentioned that you're planning to waterproof your basement if you do this right you probably won't have to do any further water preparing you have your basement because when you're basements ... as a result of rainfall\nAnd polls from around the foundation that is the source of the week so we enjoy those makes mostly dry now when you have to those that are close together and there's no place for the water run\nYou need to try to do everything you can kind of manage it now the the rules on these houses both sort of dumped into the space between the two they have gutters that are working ... what kind of water management is there now\nMaybe dumping their a part of fuel or whatever they do they land you know\nYou think they're flushing the bathrooms on your roof through her I don't know what they're doing\nThis in a let me ask you a question for you but there's Groupon did you take the ... Oh yes oh\nGod okay now I'm the old rule did have any speaking or singing problems not really no your whole shady\nUh yeah some shade or in the car\nMore strict on the front of that I just noticed that in front of a little bit late right above the entrance of the door you know but I got like a a body shape a ... type out so\nWanted thinking here is that typically the area where the roof rafter touches the roof sheeting right where the would be squeezing solid contact\nThat's a cooler spot than the areas that are right and left of it so sometimes when we get these stripes on the roof it's a condition is called ... and it's because you get more condensation\nAre in those areas that are cold in the areas that are worn the left and right and then now also on the shady side of the house or wherever you have shade you're also much more likely to pick up a little algae or like in March\nAnd that can also cause standing on the roof\nSo before we jump to conclusions what I Would suggest you do is use to take a very simple approach there's a roof clear out there that's called spray and forget\nIt's available and ready to use bottled you basically just snap a hose and garden hose onto\nAnd then you could spray the roof down and just kind of walk away and see what happens I actually haven't had an extremely dirty shed roof\nThat has so much moss on it and it was crazy 'cause it just hadn't done anything wrong time so so last summer when I was\nPainting the fence new to the repairs outside of decided that we take care of that and I got the springs forget\nAnd put it on once and then I walked away for about a month noticed that almost all it was going to put it on one more time and it's perfectly clean and put it down doesn't happen instantly because basically what it does it stops the gross from forming think of it in a sort of a weed killers the moss\nAnd it brings the roof and then there's a residual and stays on it and kind of protects the long haul so I Would try a product like that very simple fairly inexpensive\nAnd see if that doesn't pay and then if it does then you've got to know what you're dealing with um one natural thing that you can do to ... though that grew up down just to try to get a little more sunlight on that area sometimes I've told folks to ... trees and and that should just enough light on it because sunlight is a natural will decide as well so it makes sense\nBy right I'll give it a shot\nAnd hey if you've got to foreign project in mind we've got a two hundred dollar gift certificate going out to one lucky caller from our friends

floating spiders hangers brown fat or that or the corps\nBattered I've ever seen in boy\nAnd in the brown spiders that are as big as quarters they sound like brown recluse spiders which can bite so those we don't like at all\nI have a law passed by Congress that our ... our ran outside impossible to get rid off\nSo I hate to say this but have you considered hiring a professional and he probably stays saving some money but whenever I hear somebody is buying lots and lots of pesticides spraying it inside the house in spring and outside the house I'm kind of the opinion that by the time you do all that you've expose yourself to so much\nAccess pesticide that you would have been better off just having a pro come in because they can buy stuff that you can't buy plus they're specifically trained on where to put the insecticide how much deployed\nAnd also the insecticides today are very specific and they remove only insects that they're supposed to remove and they don't remove the beneficial insects that you want to leave behind so if you're having that much of an infestation\nI Would stop shopping round pesticide and call a pro and have them treat the house and once you get the populations down toward their manageable kind of more normal than you could try to use some of those other products just on a maintenance bases that makes sense\nShirt and a half years that here's down the question\nOut having the same problem and the mall kids all around the whole entire neighborhood it's made by end going to help stop at\nWell yeah it'll create sort of a barrier around your

apartment\nRental apartments yeah okay so if you get the ... the exterminator out there and they tell you that you've got something like a brown recluse spider there\nAnd you bring that to the attention of the rental agent and I think it gives them plenty of reason to treat the whole apartment complex and not you know look nor them and to the point where people when kids start getting bitten\nOkay ... thanks for your information\nBut this whole time in your house constant battle of wills you know with just a few changes newly homework problems being solved might just be the ones on
