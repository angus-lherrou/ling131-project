[noise]\nMinute ... home advisor now here's Tom Chrysler\nCoast to coast more for the shingle this is the money been home improvement show on top of Chrysler stand today is a very exciting show for us because we're coming to you from Jamestown Rhode Island [noise] this is the site of the latest project\nFor the forty season of this old house and today in the final day of production we're right here and actually in the garage it's a lot nicer than that sounds surrounded by the cameras\nAnd the sauce to bring you the story of a very ... just completed by the spectacular team at this old house now if you're not familiar with this area it's a very unique place with a lot of history Jamestown Rhode Island\nIs a coastal town it's it's just across the Narragansett Bay\nFrom Newport which is home to many many famous mansions\nBut if you didn't happen to be named Vanderbilt or asked her do you may have decided to build a more modest cottage right here in Jamestown and many of these houses do from the late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds one summer visitors built them to enjoy the ocean breeze isn't the Sandy beaches\nBut today many of those dwellings remain on insulated\nAnd since they were originally built just for the summer season there was really no need for insulation back then and that's what brings us to this old house which was rebuilt to increase energy efficiency but keep the old charm\nThat a kick things off and joined by this old house virtually any contractor Richard ... worker Richard thanks so much sir Richard when we say that the goal was to make this home energy efficient we're talking like insanely energy efficient here because the plan was to make this a net zero house so those are not familiar with ... Europe's kind of explain that\nThere's a bunch of components to one is to make it insulated really well to make it incredibly tight and so we did that with our thirty walls in our forty feelings and and we made it tight tight and then on top of it we\nWe did another thing called aero barrier to make sure that we\nWe controlled infiltration unbelievably I'll get back to the minute right so you gotta make the place where the type [noise] then you got to be able to make some electricity so we put\nEighteen solar panels on this greatly designed garage which just just behind the building away so nobody sees it it's perfect dangle [noise] so it becomes this terrific collector for us and so we could make about five kilowatts electricity so we can make electricity were super tight\nWe can make electricity in the last piece to have a really efficient heating and cooling in ventilation system which we we did a and then something I'll tell you that ... in just a second so the combination of those three pieces is that when the sun is out right\nWe make electricity and we spend the meter backwards back to the utility and then when it's not out at night or and cloudy days we use electricity as we need to for heating and cooling and running the building\nEssentially made all the energy that it needed now to do that you need to rely on a lot of systems for one of which was the insulation still talk to me about the insulation that made it possible here\nYou know as you said this was this summer cottage are designed a you know in the Nineteen twenties or so where you had some structural framing members that worldly geared to support you know the roof load itself right a now today's standards where the ...\nEnergy codes we've got to make room for insulation\nOr they might say that these aren't even us\nSo we had to do a combination of insulated from the inside with super high a fish and stuff like\nQuote sell a spray foam right then we also had to insulate on the exterior of the building so we added to the outside just as much as we added to the inside because we didn't have all of a room on the inside right you know they advantage to to adding to the outside is that you create that thermal barrier\nAround the the framing members which are much more conduct of and transfer heat law so\nSo that was a critical part of this project now to the inside the finish I had a chance to walk through the house earlier just amazing carpentry in this job you guys that are really terrific uh works here with all of the detail and the trends in the ceilings and stuff to talk about\nThat well uh I give credit to the architect on power as to who are really just thought about\nEvery space in the house and took advantage of his expertise and the design world and and really created a masterful\nA depiction of of water cottage built in you know cozy atmosphere would be in a you know all we did was follow his lead and not and execute a but I I give credit to him he he took advantage of every single corner in the house\nAll the sounds are those are good partnership and unusual for you to have the architect is the home or here too and his wife has the designer\nYeah well it was it was really a little bit intimidating to start with because um I you know held to a little bit of a higher standard has left us do it it really turned out\nTo be a really mutual relationship you know we collaborated on a lot of things Don wasn't a so you know a meal with already you know right we were able to exchange ideas and um they were right down the road so it eliminated a third party and the middle so it really ... really did work out\nWell but as you say communication really is key now the exterior of this home had a lot of work done in the landscape you hit a landscape architect helping with that but ah you had to organize that part of the construction as well what was the challenge\nWhile the challenge was a it was a a short period of\nTime where we had to make a lot of things happen and we had three different porches which uh you know cascaded down into the hearts tape\nAnd then we had a really extensive landscape plan\nYou know it caught me by a little bit by surprise but when they started bringing the trees and the plants and I was amazed at how many plant things we ended up having and then they the landscape architect Tom Ryan did just a wonderful job that segment in different areas around the yard which are all\nMeaningful and well planned in a you know it it it came together\nWe can't wait to see it rollout chefs wiener the builder

holding proven show coming to you today on location from Jamestown Rhode Island the site of the current project on this the forties season\nOf America's most popular home improvement show this old house and one of the guys who's a part of the fabric of this old house for over twenty five years is general contractor Tommy soda can just keep getting younger don't you tell me a\nWhile almost thirty five years there wow five thirty six years the main yeah man it's amazing I hear and I'm Down in the first few years [laughter] way played hard to get I get well maybe that's it that way will turn it down because I work for my dad we would just do my dad would he didn't want any part of the details anyway but now we're too busy to do a\nTV and stuff so I Want to talk with you first about the fact that a lot of the construction here was pre fabricated and I think when people think prefab a factory built they think well maybe it's not as good as what you can do by hand but that's not really the case here and and it's nice it anyway you were to circle you had two things that you do hear that were just fascinating to me\nThe foundation for her she said oh you can make everything in the house but you can't make the foundation\nNow you know you guys actually got a foundation three hundred miles away\nTrucking wow pre cast foundation insulated it and it has a concrete reinforced steel reinforced studying it insulated so there's no thermal break in that in that position and the studs a pre drills for the electrician to run his wires throat and it's a fast\nEfficient way to put a foundation and\nThat's basically waterproof at the same time\nWhile in the building that we're in right now this is actually the garage that it probably the nicest girl jak you've ever seen right but this was factory billed as well so\nThis is a pre cut building well you put it together everything caught on a on a CNC saw yeah so you know what's going to fit exactly right you know put the puzzle together and you've got a beautiful barn that looks like it was built onsite\nNow the challenge on this property was building into net zero which means that basically has to be so tight so well insulated and uh so perfectly heated um that it it essentially makes all the energy needs to operate that involved a lot of different types of insulation or want to ask you about that because I I think it's unusual to see\nSpray foam used to different types of Springfield open and close close so and then you had sold ...\nIn which are actually I Love that isolation I mean I think of it is it's basically rock writes funding to fight it molten rock radio and and and you it's a great installation if astounded need for insulation and its water resistant well you know if it gets wet it's going to dry out\nNow you guys use a technique called warmer blanket on the exterior walls what does that mean well\nThat's the way you take the insulation the the stone will right now or you can also use rigid phone and you apply it to the exterior surface of the building so you framed the building in this case we had the old building we had to deal with\nThe conventional walls right those were spray foam on the outside of the sheeting you have to put a thermal barrier\nBecause you have to worry about the thermal bridging of the structure when it when it meets that different installations so in other words they could be some transfer of different temperature\nFrom the actual study ... and so you got to worry about condensation forming on the inside of the outside insulation here that make sense does enter the sandwich right so in other words you're putting something like\nA um it's it's ... like a house wrap that you put on before you put your installation on and it's like a range screens you know of any any condensation should occur in between that installation it will run down and not damage the she\nWas actually has to be completely storm only separated\n... ever yeah it's almost like when you're building ...\nBuildings you put separate walls and never touch the same idea here which are thoroughly separating everything's good shape and insulation ... exactly right yeah that's the trick now you also had to install the solar right which is on this building and you also have a beautiful wooded shingle roof here now\nWhich single roof ... is there not done right and I've seen an awful lot and I know you have to rewrite like crazy\nSay Ron fast if they're not you you have to ... you have to think of that ... uh which ... today is not like ... it was say fifty two hundred years ago right the wood that you get from lumber is really farmed\nTreats younger trees because all the big old tight grain trees are gone so now the wood will absorb\nMoisture and so on down the line so what you would do years ago you would have what is called skip sheeting right basically it's like strapping a roof with spacing between it so the air could get underneath the roof shingles and dry I'm from underneath and from the sun up top\nA wood roof is like a wooden boat it has to get saturated with water as well tied to the joint and then it becomes waterproof the shingle itself is actually wet\nAnd if it's laying on ... without any air it it runs from the underside out yeah so you have to put some type of a breather\nUnderneath it and there's all kinds of systems like a C to
