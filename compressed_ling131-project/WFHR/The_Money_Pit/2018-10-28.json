talking about the entire house here or is it just one room bono noticed in our house\nSo in order to really clean out that smell you'd have to pull the carpet you could have a clean but I suspect that

so much for calling us an entity money that's nuts\nI Know I messed up but but\nI'd like to be paid for my mistakes that okay [laughter] ...\nWell not fall it in full swing it might be finding that between all that patio furniture and the lawn mowers an outdoor equipment and anything else you've got for the warm weather season you're running a little tight an outside storage\nShed can be a great solution and also ... project our project but before you began that there are four important things you have to consider that we've got the tips in today's ... project presented by haunted by their dot com\nNo first the average cost to build a shit is a pretty wide range we're talking about between eight hundred and four grand it depends on the troops are choosing whether you're going to build yourself or hire a pro but what do you decide to be a white or not there are several basic questions you need to ask you saw before you start shopping\nYeah first of all do you need a permit I think a lot of people forget and think oh it's my house and I can do whatever I Want and I'm going to do this thing or I'm going to put up a fan\nYou can't always just go and do that you have to check your local building called first to determine if you need a permit to build a shed on your property now you don't want to find out after you finished the project that it's got to come down because it violated some building code or unknown in code\nI mean that's the last thing you want to do is invest a bunch of money and then have to take it all down and then do it again\nNow the other big thing you've got to think about is what size does your shed needs to be and what do you want it to be you know do you need something simple and you know primarily for jets business needs putting things in there and not making a cute or any other functions or do you want something decorative\nThere are so many different styles and size is out there that you really need to evaluate your home and your property and how you're going to use that that you can determine the best style from what your ... going to be\nA part of that is deciding where the should is going to go I mean depending on the size of your property you get a lot of different options for the placement that shit you know folks very commonly might put it close to the house which makes running power and water one's easy or\nSometimes folks will talk it sort of to the side or the back of the property so that it's less obvious but put some thought into that because you're gonna be going back and forth a lot and you don't want to regret that decision\nAnd finally what your budget I mean did you go tight budget you can build a very simple should that gets the job done without a lot of frills\nBut it's got some wiggle room you could think about adding some extra features like integrated shelving inside decorative trim on the outside or you could go all out man cave or she's shed and maybe at electricity heat swimming\nWall to wall stereo I don't know [laughter] you know you can really totally decked out those are fun too but I think it through in mind that budget so it comes out just the way you expect\nNow if you do go pro we recommend getting estimates from at least two or three contractors before you choose the one pro that's going to help you with the project\nAnd that today's pro project

matter the type of job home advisor makes it fast and easy to hire the best local pros\nNow got Tammy in Philadelphia on the line who is looking for a better shot or\nWe happy today I'm Hi I'm calling because I wanted to find out um I had an old Victorian house and I have a three three three\nI have a ... and when it wasn't a shower on a second floor and then I Want to take a shower or in the water up the are going to therapy or the shower go with coke and I've been ... contractors and my plumbers and I'm not getting a consistent answer so I like to remedy that says I'm door remodeling\nOkay so are you opening up walls is part of the remodeling\nYes I Am completely stripped down to the says\nOkay great so first of all the reasons you have reduced\nAre generally because you have old steel pipes that suffer from internal resting and they cause they closed down like a clogged arteries and then you can't push enough water through it and that could be your main water pipe it could be the supply pipes that are inside the house\nOr a combination of them and so since you're taking the walls are part of the general rule of thumb is whenever you expose these old steel pipes you want to replace them with copper pipes um or with tax was different newer type of plumbing pipe\nNow the other thing is you may not have enough water pressure coming in from the street\nOne of the pressure is not that big of a deal because I think the pressure on okay just like basically we have to bear I'm going out and you can only use one at a time by the water completely goes I call it here in the shower somebody on than eager to think\nWell that's because the the pipes may not be supplying the hot water they may not be moving into hot water water heater do you have a twenty gallon minimum size but she'll be okay for for two bathrooms okay and is it an older water heater um\nNo I just for fun or to eater\nWhen you replace it is that changing the plumbing around it this this is going through the steel pipes\nThey changed the hype around the no I don't think\nYou need to talk with your plumbers about what kind of pipes you have whether or not that's concerning the problem and need to know where the water pressure is at the street because if you're not getting enough pressure that could be the whole cause of it\nOkay now I go there and I saw something online called a um a car sure balance now where there were many issue at all\nSo a pressure valve valve is designed to be used primarily in the shower and what it does is it keeps the mix between hot and cold balanced so that you don't get scorching or freezing cold waters when the pressure drops so if somebody wants to say run hot water downstairs and now Robert hot water from the upstairs shower [noise]\nIt would not change the balance of water from the mix of water between hot and cold so the flow would be less you'd have less of a stream but it wouldn't be the the temperature wouldn't change okay right okay no that's not it I don't think that's the cause I mean that would that would certainly be a good thing to have\nSomething you should consider but I don't think that's the reason you're not getting hot water on the second floor I just don't moving enough water up there\nOkay so basically what I Need to do is tell them to check the piping around the water heater again\nA plumber should know this not only to run the water heater basically if you're going to one of those walls what kind of pipes do you have\nAnd are they corroded and should they be replaced to help groups are up to help alleviate this okay I'm In of all else fails you could always had a second water heater upstairs you could even had a checklist water heater which would be a really small unit and it was supply additional water that second for bathroom\nOkay okay okay well I think that kind of remedy the problem\nAll right thanks so much for calling them money pet hey you know fresh clean water delivered every tapping your

you today\nMy toilet is making a whistling sound a it's a high pitched monotone doesn't do it all the time it starts and stops intermittently I've tracked it down to the where the fail for the water comes in the toilet\nThat what's causing that Carl is the film valve and it's not that unusual condition we see that a lot we've heard about it many times\nAnd the reason that happens intermittently is it's somewhat a indicative on the expansion a contraction of those parts and it's going to vary based on the water temperature um but it also was only going to happen when the toilets reselling\nSo what you should do is simply replace the fill it while you're at the flush about because they usually come into set they're not very expensive you can buy bowls for probably Fifteen bucks and if you follow the instructions that come with these it is a do it yourself projects to be able to kind of pretty much rebuild your toilet\nOkay sounds good to know if I might point out something it does it when the water is not running in the house at all times\nAnd here's here's why that's happening okay because you probably have a leaky flush fell but it's one of the reasons I said to replace\nBoth building flush valves because if you have a leaky for stopping at a very slow leak the water out of the bowl the ... valve will respond to that and refill that bowl so you're probably wasting some water because of this condition as well so it's a good thing you founded but again it's an easy inexpensive fix and you can do it yourself\nOkay very good Tom appreciate your welcome good luck with that project thanks so much for calling us at ... money pit\nFall season at the garage sales yard sale and just general clean out before the winter really kicked in and finding Danny except when it comes time to getting rid of the stuff that's left over especially if it's trash that are toxic and what's considered toxic my kind of surprised jail\nYeah paint for example I mean we put it on the walls of our kids' rooms right but most authorities do consider getting rid of pain\nTo be toxic so you can't just put paint to paint strippers car oils and other chemical waste out with your household garbage instead a lot of cities will offer household we drop off sites that are set up especially for what they term toxic waste and that includes paints\nYeah we have I think it's once a month that might be more frequently in the summer but we haven't stopped the program and they pick like a park or in like the parking lot of a huge shopping center like one Saturday a month\nAnd it's called stop throwing out pollutant and you can bring all the different things from like tires and mattresses I mean it's really amazing the things that are considered pollutants you have to be careful when you're throwing out stuff\nThe other thing I think people forget our batteries\nAnd all different kinds of batteries you know a lot of the big box retail stores offer return to sender boxes that are made the typically for recycling batteries especially for things like from phones or anything that's rechargeable and speaking of the retailers out there you know the EPA says that old computers cheating\nAnd any other electronic can be dropped off at many national retailers\nFor safe disposal and some of those are Best Buy and people are just really do your research that little bit before

question how can I help you today\nWe need to replace our rain gutters are shingles on I\nReally feel that old house uh Portland cement shingles and third the people that are the three companies that I've talked to about replacing rain gutters they tell me how simple it is it just lift up the asphalt shingles and put this Japanese than anything that's it and I think\nOkay as far as flexible but I think this is my crack so how do I find someone who knows how about\nPreserving singles and thing up leaving\nWell I think there are weird number of ways to install gutters you can put straps a that go up on to the asphalt shingles but they can they can also be attached directly\nSo what you're going to want to do as a test those gutters directly to the fish up and said of using males you're going to want to use gutter screws there very long lag bolts lightweight pant leg bowls\nUsually have a heck's head on them and the nice thing about these uh these gutter balls so to speak is that once you put them in and they don't pull out sometimes the nails the gutter spikes that they use will pull out\nBut these gutters crews will not pull out so you just need to use a different fasting system and if you have you had physically had somebody at the house to solve this configuration or they just telling you this on the phone\n... we had just moved to the area and I was just going down
