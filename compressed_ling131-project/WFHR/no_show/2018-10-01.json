radio\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWeek for Sunday in the NFL certainly did not disappoint some got that reversed over time you're on NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com we still have\nOne more games ago on Monday Night I'm very curious to\nFind out what your biggest takeaway was\nFrom uh the action that we saw here on Sunday in the NFL because there aren't a lot of things to consider based off the games that we watched you got the Chicago Bears who behind Mitchell Trybulski look like legit contenders this year\nThree in one now on the year ... and no signs of slowing down Trybulski throwing five touchdown passes in the first to have you already know how good their defenses right with ... back\nAnd maybe he was the missing piece or maybe met navy really is the innovative genius that people thought he was when he was in Kansas City and now we've been to Chicago Bears the creativity they that they show on our fence and all of a sudden\nThe bears first place in the NFC North would they three and one record\nWe can look at the gym and they beat the Tampa Bay buccaneers we can say the old dentistry much they are who we thought they were\nThose are the ... bay buccaneers that we thought we were going to see this season yes the fitzpatrick was real for the first two weeks of the season but obviously the luster has worn off then Ryan Fitzpatrick is now playing like why if it's Patrick and he was benched for gene miss Winston\nAnd now who knows who's going to play quarterback the next time the Tampa Bay buccaneers tape if you're probably going to be James Winston right inject a little life into that theme after losing last week and then getting blowed out here on Sunday\nHow about the Atlanta Falcons\nWho ... the falcons come up with any analogy you want about how bad their defenses and accepted maybe that's something that we get up on with at some point throughout the week give me your best analogy\nOf how bad the falcons defense is like they can't stop a nose bleed or ... and things like that you know when you when someone's cold shooting a basketball you\nYou couldn't hit water if you fell out of a boat ha ha ha ha ha or man they ... they couldn't even catch a cold ha ha ha\nTompkins can't stop or knows when they can't stop anybody they can score with Amy ... in the NFL but when you allow over thirty points per game defensively\nYou're not going to find success and every time the falcons score\nAll I Wonder is did they score too fast because sometimes they do\nThey score so many points but there are big play off in a big ... up and that that doesn't exactly dominate the possession\nAnd so when they extend their lead against the Cincinnati Bengals to five because they failed to put the ball in the end zone EPA settle for a field goal there were four minutes left that's an eternity against that falcons defense\nAnd as as I'm watching that game there was no doubt in my mind no doubt in my mind that the the Bengals score\nIt was just a matter of would there be enough time for the falcons to get the ball back that is a perishing fear the Atlanta Falcons\nShe is one in three and all of their losses you look at it and you're like OK blue lead blue lead blue lead can't stop anybody can stop anybody can stop anybody\nThey even had a ... that again that was well in hand against the Panthers and even let cam Newton's correlate touchdown and actually make that a close game of chance Panthers but blowing the lead losing to the saints in overtime last week losing this game\nLosing week one when you had the lead one in three\nThere are a lot of questions with this Atlanta Falcons team and it's not just the injuries 'cause I Know that they have two big injuries on defense\nBut something we've got to change I don't know what\nWhat it's going to be but they cannot keep trying to win games in a shootout fashion it's amazing they become a big pool team all our friends no defense it's like watching big twelve football every time the Atlanta Falcons play\nEight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six two two more takeaways from week for Sunday in the NFL how about the New England patriots\nHad been lost three games that are oh since two thousand and two they were one of my locks of the week by the way we are four and one so far with our six team on Monday Night so hot we crush here on the show\nAnd the only game we lost a was a a Stanford college game we had them plus five and a half they didn't cover recovered the other two college games and to put you in the NFL today\nThe patriots were not going to lose the Miami Dolphins I Know that tannahill has won ten out of his last eleven starts going into today but the dolphins do not winning Fox borough and I was fully confident that Tom Brady and the patriots would come out with a game plan\nThat would be very effective against a dolphin the team that was banged up on their defense of front

Edelman and then Josh Gordon probably at full strength all of a sudden everything seems to be All right with the New England patriots isn't it amazing what one winner will do\nAnd we thought that last week about the Pittsburgh Steelers one way in changes everyone's opinions because it's a reactionary sport right in ... and it's not just football or any sport we react do\nWe know football goes week to week but because of social media and everybody gets their thoughts out there immediately on Twitter or Facebook Instagram whatever\nWe react in the moment I mean how many times do you do you see on

ravens defeating the Steelers Sunday night\nFootball on NBC and well it was twenty six to fourteen but the game could have looked a lot different\nBecause the ravens ... fourteen three about to go up Twenty one three when Alex ... phone calls on the goal line\nPittsburgh than recovers that they wind up tying the game fourteen fourteen going into the house and then it was just a tremendous defensive effort by the ravens who get this has not allowed a second half touched down this entire season\nBaltimore [laughter] very impressive defensively in the second half of football games this season they didn't scored a touchdown but the four field goal is good enough for the win three in one Baltimore now in the season while the Pittsburgh Steelers dropped two one two and one\nEight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six to do in calling from Tulsa your next year on NBC Sports radio without being\nBen how's it going\nMan when he got\nSo uh this may just be coming because I'm a very huge New England fan but I mean ... uh Pittsburgh map and other than I Do think they believe they've got so many weapon that Tony Little brown a cop games conquered not looking too bad honestly uh the authors of climate pretty decent and I but then rockets burger\nLook I mean his passing over the last few games and especially the NIH has looked horrendous then very off are good and I'm starting to think it may be the uh start or maybe a medal at the end of the Iraq was burger here I think he he just looked out of it and I watch them on the sidelines\nAnd like I said it may just be me being a whole New England fan but I really think he's starting to lose it [noise]\nWell I think there might be something to that I'm not completely a hundred percent with you but I I Do think there's something to Ben Roethlisberger and I appreciate the phone call in because I don't we do this whole song and dance now with Ben every year about his desire to play\nIt seems like for the past two off season there's been a question about whether or not Ben Roethlisberger wants to continue playing football more so this off season than last off season but this is now going to hang over him this season and then at the end of this season could this be his last year\nIs it time for them to draft a quarterback which they did and then makes them upset and now he's bothered by it and the whole the whole team now is it has to or has the answer questions about Ben Roethlisberger whatever\nYes he has his moments where he looks like Big Bend these great future hall of famer but then he has his moments where he's off\nAnd tonight there were a couple of throws that he was really off on throws that I thought he should have made where he had guys that had steps on the defenders\nAnd that was the difference between converting a third down which they were horrific getting this game\nOr punting in a way they missed a few minutes more than a few opportunities their defenses bad yeah\nLots of holes defensively the offensive line plays Well James Carter is making it so that you don't miss lay beyond bell but make no mistake about it even\nIf they had way beyond bell of course there'd be a little bit better because she's one of the best players in the NFL and so you get them on the field and all of a sudden things look a lot differently because now you could put bell and comment on the field at the same time and who knows what type of dynamic\nDrop Benz cars how many times do you see the lady on bell line up as a wide receiver right so there's a lot of things that you do off instantly one way beyond bells on the field plus the other team\nHas to gain plan for living on bill so yes he changes a lot of things when he is playing he's not going to play for the Steelers this year she's not going to happen\nThey want to trade him I don't know who's going to offer anything for him because he's just going to be a rental\nThe only way that he's going to play is if it's after week ten cars then who can sign the franchise tender and become a free agent at the end of the year\nI don't think anybody in the stores even want them back at this point and they might have to accept aid package that is less than desirable and it might have to be from a team that it's OK renting him and you know maybe it's the patriots\nRight as Sony Michel as you know doing the filling it nicely but he's still rookie and he's not labeling bell and they're a team that couldn't\nRent a player like that and try to win the super bowl and then not even worry about signing given the off season\nBecause that will be a free agent and will sign a big money deal but I don't think we have you on bell playing in a Pittsburgh Steelers uniform at all this season and I think the players not lock room do it and I think the coaches and the fans have to come to grips with that\nBut I think the fans all start to come to grips with the fact that this is a down here for the Pittsburgh Steelers before the season started I I'm not going to sit here and say oh predicted them to a woman to win one no\nBut before the season started when I did my over on the show and I said go under with the Pittsburgh Steelers my reasoning was delayed beyond bell situation I didn't know James Caan I was going to play so well\nBut my reasoning was Ben Rob the spurs desire combined with Libyan bell combined with a difficult schedule and the fact that Mike Tomlin has very rarely if ever had to deal with adversity\nAnd I'm a challenging him are talking about him as a football coach but ever since he stepped foot in the door of the coaches office in Pittsburgh to be the head football coach he has one\nAnd any off field distraction or any adversity that has come their way\nRushed to the side because they've been winning [noise]\nFor when you're losing [noise]\nThat the real test of care [noise]\nHow old is the gene react\nTo one to one one son\nAnd this

know that it's technically October Monday Night I get it but still it's still weak for the first quarter of the season and then the first quarter of the season the Broncos are like unbeatable\nAt mile high but here's where I really like them\nI think there's value in in them here I don't think they're getting enough respect\nOr they're not playing as good as the Kansas City chiefs are but sooner or later there's going to be a defense it's going to figure out what Patrick homes is doing\nAnd as good as mine homes has been playing he can't keep up this pace for the entire season\nHe just can't he's going to not have a clunker stinking up what is going to regret to the meat and he's going to come back down to earth they can't keep scoring as much as they're scoring somebody's going to stop them and I think the Broncos are in a good spot this is a pride game for Denver\nDenver as a beat in Kansas City in Denver and over two seasons bolt their losses the past two years ... at Denver had been by a few ... and I think this game could come down to a field goal as well [noise]\nBut I Love the idea of a whole bunch of dark patches of such a sucker for all my other drugs I really am\nI think the Broncos come out and play very well here on Monday Night against the Kansas City chiefs I pick them to cover the wind but I Would not be surprised if they won the game out right\nSo I\nIf you're giving me the points that take the points it was at five and a half four and a half now with three and a half so there is a lot of bronco money coming in something to pay attention to four and a half as where I got it\n... and now it's at three and a half maybe it goes down to three by kick off but we know that that is a very good home advantage there at mile high and I want\nTo see other

there uh for Denver and Casey eight five five three three or four NBC eight five five three two three four six to do\nWhat I look at the\nDivision leaders right now in the NFL and I try to think about which ones are going to stay there which ones are going to fall away the first place that I look isn't the\nAFC East where it's obvious that the patriots are still the class of the AFC East even ... even though\nThey don't have the top record right now that belongs to the Miami Dolphins at three in one look at what the patch just into the dolphins and my reacting to one you know the way they bounce back of course I Am\nBut the jets [laughter]\nCome on I'm a ... fan to nothing\nThey don't pose any threat neither do the Buffalo Bills so based off what you saw here patriots still owned the dolphins patriots still own that division so that is one division leader that I don't think we'll stay there\nIn the AFC North ravens are tight with the bangles I picked the ravens to win this division I think they are the best team in his division Cincinnati is often has been they've been electric this season I worry about them defensively\nBut here's who I don't worry about defensively the Baltimore Ravens and they've been ... good offensively as some of the top teams in the league\nThe ravens have scored a hundred and twenty three points this year they've only allowed sixty five they had not\nAllowed a second half touched down this season\nThey have the best excuse me second best point differential\nIn the league best point differential in the AFC I'm\nBig on the ravens this year I really am in the AFC South I don't think the titans getting enough respect\nMike ... has this team playing really good football and their three in one right there with the Jacksonville Jaguars

six students are more takeaways from weak force Sunday in the NFL how about the New England patriots\nHaving lost three games in a row since two thousand and two they were one of my locks of the week by the way we are four and one so far with our six team on Monday Night so hot week for us here on the show and the only game we lost\nA was a a Stanford college game we had them plus five and a half they didn't cover recovered the other two college games and to put you in the NFL today\nThe patriots\nWere not going to lose the Miami Dolphins I Know that tannahill has won ten out of his last eleven starts going into today\nBut the dolphins do not winning Fox borough and I was fully confident that Tom Brady and the patriots would come out with a game plan that would be very effective against a dolphin team that was banged up on their defense of front\nSony Michel ran the ball well\nTom Brady passed it all over the field Josh Gordon had a small impact in his first action for the patriots and now this pet seem to into\nAnd welcoming back Julian Edelman and then Josh Gordon probably at full strength all of a sudden everything seems to be All right with the New England patriots isn't it amazing what one winner will do\nAnd we thought that last week about the Pittsburgh Steelers one way in changes everyone's opinions because it's a reactionary sport right in ... and it's not just football or any sport we react to we know football goes week to week but because\nOf social media and everybody gets their thoughts out there immediately on Twitter or Facebook Instagram whatever\nWe react in the moment I mean how many times do you do you see on social media\nTakes from a game that's that's a blow out in the first half and then the other team comes back and wins and all of a sudden all your opinions and the first that don't even matter anymore and then you get an account like old takes exposed just tweet everything about everybody that said something wrong in the first half\nWe live in a reactionary time right now and so yes\nThe patriots winning on Sunday changes our opinion had day last this game it would've been a completely different story the Steelers last week they get their first when it changes the narrative they lose again here on Sunday night and now we're back to the original concerns\nDon't get mad at that\nBeing the truth you know don't hate the player hate the game this is what it is we react based off what we've seen it's called reasons he buys\n\nThe Steelers I said that they would have problems against the ravens\nBecause the

HBO package and\nYou know we get used to Jim Lampley and company calling these fights so what was the reason for this more competition financial reasons maybe so time rising up and selling them why we're getting away from boxing\nI Believe some of what you say is true Dave certainly other networks and other platforms are the streaming\nSuch as the zone and ESPN getting into the game was a factor but also and I wrote about this a couple of days ago and my obituary HBO I Believe Netflix out a lot to do with this Dave is that in the last couple of years there\nReally started to make boxing less and less of a priority and more things like game of Thrones and this is one of the reasons why bother on top ranked Todd the boss left the network with their fighter they they kept telling me Steve it feels great network but they are not a sports network\nAnd with no war with Netflix and Amazon Prime the needed to compete in that space dramas original shows documentaries\nAnd as other networks and other entities got into the boxing space spending more money [noise] HBO laid back a little bit and I I always thought for the past year year and a half\nThat the or lessening their priorities in terms of having boxing be one of their big tent pole events you can see this coming gave I'd been writing about it for about a year or so I wrote wrote something couple of months ago saying HBO stand for here boxing is obsolete\nTo me this is the loss of a great tradition but remember this Dave boxing was the last live sport that they ever had\nAnd wants the Eighteenth team more here went through with Time Warner Eighteen the I think as a corporate entity decided hey we're not sports\nThere are other people that want to invest in the boxing wipe it against them when we need to figure out how do we create our next game of Thrones because boxing to them it's something they they showed on selected nights\nBut it was not a franchise or a property that they own like game of Thrones Sopranos or the liar so I think that's what really took place of the fact that now with Netflix are producing their own original programming being very successful Dave boxing got displaced\nAnd he talks about Bob Baer leaving wheeling and and throwing you know the the un pursued there with top ranked ... ... what about humans seeking billions of dollars into boxing in trying to monopolize all the miners under his table taken by the Showtime kind of getting away from me it was well they did that her\nWhile I don't think it helped them um but you know once ESPN\nDecided that they were going to really invest in the boxing I think that along with the el him unstable which is now a Showtime and it's all going to be shared with box that those two things are huge 'cause it took away two main content providers at different times\nAnd it also raised the stakes I I remember having\nDinner years ago with the with Jay lark and it was that a Showtime at that point the lake right Jay lock and he says the housing premium cable network I'm not worried about HBO I said really said no I'm read about ESPN because if they ever decided to really invest in the box and make it put us out of business\nI Believe that the final nail in the coffin for HBO Boxing I'm alongside a lot of stuff that you said was ESPN deciding that boxing is no longer just a niche sport\nBecause ESPN as a free to most people that has a much bigger audience than he's been with the premium channels that way\nYeah I I look\nHBO I Believe has about what twenty five to thirty million subscribers and I don't know what the numbers are currently\nESPN's in about Ninety to a hundred million homes and also this day and do some traveling Everytime you go to an airport or a hotel and you stay in a bar you eat at a restaurant and bar and

but I think that's one of the issues is that the I don't look at this ... this this completely disastrous thing for boxing 'cause they\nWent HBO decided to basically be the big network of boxing which

don't think they'd like\nStaying cocky per se but the rams ever really going to stay inside the love that they have for the cardinals out there or even the Bruins to be perfectly honest with your with the NHL or you know maybe because it wasn't an original franchise\nSo I think you know that was the heart stewards right at the beginning but I don't think there's a lot of those type of things like when the browns left Cleveland originally I don't I don't think it was definitely anything like that\nYou know there were plans were sixty thousand steep football stadium right down by the Mississippi River by the arch in St Louis a ... and that's been kind of stumbled now are there still plans to build ... and drawing NFL team to St Louis\nOh actually they they working more towards hoping to get the NBA good um\nI have to you know that's a big basketball is big bear so they've been working more towards that but right now it's kind of dormant on the uh the side of any type of you know major sports franchise is there and that just out of focus on the baseball and hockey\nThe St Louis hawks want an MBA championship what was that Nineteen fifty seven Robert with a great Bob had it all the great tradition in St Louis\nYeah I mean one of the few to set up the Celtics team yeah back in the day\nCan speed with which you know it's very hard to because they ordered all the players are back there so there there's definitely a or some some basketball either St Louis or Kansas City opera predict get a NBA team probably within the next five to ten years\n[noise] what about Seattle\nAnd you know I asked bags the commission that and and he was like you know something\nAh we're not looking to expand\nBut I think if one of the the other teams are one of the maybe the other struggling franchises or wanted to go obviously Seattle I think they just passed a bill for their new a new arena I'd have to look for hockey budget okay and I also just like ... as it can be made into basketball uh so I think I think expanse in\nMay be more likely for a a a place like St Louis or Kansas City where for team was to move\nI think that if they want something ready made and obviously Seattle would be ready made\nAll the owner operator presidents CEO founder a grand pool balls didn't leave anything out of black sports online Robert little ... and he didn't leave any titles out\nBut you know the most handsome man or you know [laughter] and that this is the independent in ... and maybe a bit [laughter]\nWell I think that's true without question I'm speaking of great and handsome and above everybody else did the Alabama Crimson Tide Robert I said yesterday on the air I Know it's an early I Know these are Eighteen Nineteen and twenty year old kids and nothing's guaranteed in life but\nThis has the potential to be not only ... greatest team ever but maybe the greatest team I've ever seen in college football and it's because they've never had a quarterback back to before that they had athletes all over the field\nAdding him as almost unfair to the Alabama football program\nRight I mean I think that's what everybody is saying is that Alabama's have had marginal average quarterbacks you know good game managers\nAre but not the type of guy that you say you know you the fear or would that would put into a a a defensive coordinator I think that they would Alabama's that'll be the same you know every year for as long as you said the coaches I mean are probably going to make the playoffs\nAnd then when they get into the playoffs they probably will run into one scene I'm Becky and you know throw punches with them as we would say a than it is just a matter of what happens I mean in Georgia was right in that ah you know again last year and obviously aquariums in a beat 'em the the year before so it's a different theme obviously they still have hurt\nThough is that like it it's not like a Clinton situation where one guy goes down south of a sudden you out of luck because other got voted or they have a great a backup that does lead national championship a team so that really set up\nA almost every year to being a championship game or at least the playoffs and then you know hopefully you know one of the teams that are in that can make a competitive\nAnd you know the really bad news for the FCC is to attack by all those younger brother is a senior in high school playing in the state of Alabama right now and people are saying you start to do this too and he's already committed to Alabama so good luck over the next two or three years\nThat was that I don't see anything changing a would mix saving in Alabama for very long time I don't know how long they should run it's going to happen I mean I don't think can go on forever uh but right now there there are trained they can't they can't stop\nWhat do you think about this patriot situation Robert I'm you know you know caught her new book comes out and says the to Tom Brady wants to divorced from bill ... second was thinking about retiring in the off season here and obviously\nYou know ... wanted to keep going right below him to the franchise tagging the turn the team over to him maybe next year and either released or trade Tom Brady breathing gets window that he's mad at ...\nAnd then ... Bob Kraft because my grandpa went against his wishes and ... them away so\nCracks in the foundation now Robert are we're nearing the end of the patriots dynasty\nI mean I think it is I mean after I don't care what type of relationship you're in after sixteen Seventeen Eighteen years there's\nThere's gotta be some friction and I always thought that Tom Brady issue was that deal ballots said no matter how great Tom Brady was ever want to give them for granted I always felt like Bella check felt like he can he may Tom Brady and if he ... he had somebody that was decent\nBegin make them into the next or you know ... I don't think that's true but I think braid he feels that way that you know almost like a son wanting you know affirmation from dad and dad just doesn't know how to get it like I said my dad is\nThe other we can solve hunger\nTogether we're Feeding America\nMessage from being America and the uncomfortable\n\nYou were a little kid and you thought about what you want it to be teaching them to topple through things changed as you've got older teaching didn't seem like the best option then you'll be something else what would your twelve year old so\nNow you want to be a doctor you don't think teachers save lives [noise] twenty five at a\nActress playing a different role\nI'm not a scientist or\nOf physics chemistry what do you think teachers teachers today are breaking down the line and innovative ways to instill homeless [noise] taking learning or\nBeyond the four walls of the clock\nTo recognize the great things are happening in your\nParty line to me [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWith\n\nRobert ... enough to hang on with us into another segment what they do work with on NBC Sports radio knock on Robert thanks for hanging in with a\n... you when you talk about the old married couple of you and I knew this about sixteen Seventeen years now there's a feeling\nI moved I'm divorced so we work each other's nerves yeah\nPlus we gotta we gotta marriage where it's like a long distance [laughter] we always see each other every once in a while that that's how you make sure the relationship last\nYou know my father always told me the key to a successful relationship is never seeing each other\nBut absolutely that's why you were just talking to a lot of the couples that have been together for twenty Thirty years they don't sleep in St Louis oh\nThat's right a lot of time apart that's the key Robert ... of the the the boy the end of a narrow forty five years of HBO and boxing in the greater spiders the greatest fights of all time you need them they've been fighting on HBO or HBO pay per view over the years so\nWhat what was what was it our Hayman pulling a lot of fighters away and putting fights on ... TV show time rising up or maybe a disown with ... her with the screaming thing and the competition now why do they get out of boxing\nBut I think I think he can be traced back to when they lost Floyd Mayweather one Floyd Mayweather went to Showtime and law whip Floyd Mayweather like you just alluded to all of the aisle hated fighters or that legitimize a Showtime\nAnd I think you put a big debt and HBO Boxing and they just didn't really show that they really cared about sport in the last couple of years they allowed wants to get a bailout top rank and Bob Arum to go to ESPN and if you lose weight or two of the you know three major uh promotions\nUm you know there's really not much else that they just didn't seem I don't think there's so much as HBO or being forced to get out of Boston\nAs well as more as HBO just didn't want to be a box thing you know any more and it's odd because boxing I think right now Libya to help ease\nUp because of all the the the deals and and and different streaming companies are different networks that are involved so they're getting out at a time where are you know boxing is really crossing over I think more to the mainstream\nWhat do you think about disown ... from ... boxing is starting up to the great English promoter or they're going to put on eighty plus spikes does a year when he got boxing and mixed martial arts and it's nine Ninety nine a month no pay per views no extra money ever and that's what you pay every month did he get eighty plus ... a year um\nYou're and you think the screaming thing or you know is there are enough people who get away from the television sets and ah and use their devices and what's not streaming to make it worthwhile for them\nYeah I think streaming is the future honestly I think you know the traditional cable and satellite like we know it now won't be that way in ten Fifteen Years I think\nUh the way especially young people out a way young people consume their their stuff it's all Netflix it's all Hulu it's all a you know ESPN plot side all WWE Network\nThat's all you know the streaming type of services so I think you see Oscar getting into it a little bit with a with a golden boy and a Facebook Live or you see Showtime putting a lot of their uh their shows on YouTube with a lot of international shows up so I think I think that's the way to go I don't think\nYou know for me personally as as you I Know you know we grew up you know big boxing fan\nYou know watching the fight ... fight party\nA that was our way of of Libya didn't watch any do boxing back in the day but I think for young people they want to be able to you know to pull it up on their phone she to fight it and go do whatever they're going to do water tweeting or on Instagram Snapchat so I think it has a chance but\nIt's all about the fight and fight or do they have everything Joshua will become a guy that you say hey\nI can pay this nine Ninety nine a month because I don't ever want to miss you Joshua ...\nMy daughter's Eighteen just started college and she she never watch the television I don't think she's ever heard of\nIt's all downloading that's the way it is with the kids these days are Robert I'm\nPack yeah may weather man you know Floyd announced it's going to be a rematch hearing them for a man he was all in on this thing\nAbout what a lot of bad feelings member of the fans found a class action lawsuit last night was so mad and many had it and hidden in three\nThis is probably going to be a tough sell so there's rumors now and even white mentioned this this might be a free one network television maybe NBC ABC or Fox and maybe a freak show network TV that would be a great idea\nRight I mean it is what may whether you know it's all about how much what he did he get\nAnd if he can get enough money up front and maybe some on the backing it up through advertising or whatever I can really have it is not what you do now have you're making ... ... ... the connection with the networks they things like that do about them and figure out the way to make himself a lot of money at Florida a lot of money\nOr they could do it that maybe the best route to go I mean I just don't see I'd be curious how many people would pay you know Seventy nine eighty nine dollars the the the fighting\nNot me I won't be I don't I don't know if it would get a million new have reviews about it but if you put on like you said NBC on a Saturday Night after they put it to me who do\nYeah I Would watch that show or that maybe in a way to go\nAll use suits back at NBC listening right now in New York City are you hearing this still this heck yeah man ... let's put it on regular NBC and by the one last question we'll get a couple of seconds left here have you ever met him in a I I I guess I've never seen him I've never met him I guess the exists but he's the real mystery man have you ever met him\nAt ... quick story I had a real bad metal one time\nWhen I met him I was around whether what

them and uh and had enough of a lead to be able to hold on and be able to get that decree it perfectly\nYou know in the final instant the final admitted that Stanford game a little bit over a minute left or I think I'm a candidate Stanford had two time outs left\nWhy don't you just take a couple of these there or force them to use their time out taking yeah and I think the most they would have been twelve seconds left on the clock when you do the math and and if you have Justin maybe dance around a little bit or or run toward the sideline and slide maybe you could have killed the whole thing on for them I throw in and out of bounds\nWhy risk it hand off on the phone call there what did Mario crystal ball or what was the asked why he didn't take an either\nHe I mean I think the ... the question was asked multiple times afterwards and\nYou know again I think in in the heat of the moment and again I'm not\nThat I I don't I'm not speaking any type of quotes that that Mario\n... didn't say in the heat of the moment it looked like you know they maybe hadn't arrived is exactly what the clock was going to be but I think also they were playing to win the game and uh you know and and not trying to take it down to twelve seconds and then take the chance of a fork down block of wood\nIn the Oregon Stanford series\nOver the last twenty or twenty five years day\nThere had been more free T type of games in which Oregon has lost to Stanford in some sort of a fashion that never happened up Seventeen nothing with Bill must graves quarterback and for the ducks in the late night Nineteen eighties early Nineteen nineties up Seventeen up and my six minutes left and get\nBeat Eighteen Seventy [noise] I'm In the year that joy ... takes the Dutch to the fiesta bowl or they'd be\nColorado and argument should have been playing Miami in the championship game they lose the Stanford forty nine forty two elite forty two thirty five and a half to block punch in the fourth quarter to lose by myself\nAnd so when I was all those type of things that take place now Nick Mario as I Would have done is your plan to get her first day and not taken chance of putting ... scamper back on the field with Thirteen or fourteen seconds left regardless of whether they are on the field and again as she gave her Dale it wasn't like he stretched out exposed the ball\nI got caught on a pile of ball go punched out now and the rest is history and so that will always be the big question but in fact I like the way that they were trying to play and get the first down to run the clock out versus putting it back and ... you\nKnow I Wish the ducks are undefeated going into Washington next week but still an absolutely huge game and uh the huskies look really good and and beating BYU yesterday lost their first game a tough one basically a road game plan are burned down there in the country made it pretty good account of themselves losing I think it was Twenty one sixteens already so\nThis is an average I think that we'll find out really how far this morning program has come back here under Mario crystal ball and Justin Herbert plays against a team of the caliber of Washington\nYeah they're going to be by far the best defense that they face all year long and then you know Utah's plant lights out on defense needed Washington state so overall but that just from that standpoint in just from a sound\nTalented a disciplined defense Washington is by far the best defense in the lake and Oregon right now statistically the top story scoring team the top total yards team the top average\nYard for play team in the conference and so you're going to have the top off ants against the effects are here in two weeks since stadium and then of course there there is no love lost between Oregon and Washington and uh I mean I share that it\nHas to do but\nYou know it's been owned here last couple of years I Washington Oregon and one twelve or Thirteen in a row Washington has soundly won the last two games in convincing fashion Seventy Twenty one years ago and Justin Herbert first start\nAn odd stadium and his first started gets Washington and all the huskies took care of him I think Oregon ales like\nThey can compete with Washington and and ... from what I've seen over the last couple of weeks I think they can in particular at home for Washington as his so sound so good and everything they do the task is going to be really tall or to get past washed and right now they're in there to defending chance for a region\nYeah it's still I think that the best team in the late\n... of Notre Dame and getting hammered uh thirty eight Seventeen and that sort of been back to back losses ... with the Sox game last week but I'm not good for Washington because I think they they need in Stamford to win that game maybe to get a national championship consideration after last October and so um that wasn't a good one for the globe yesterday\nNo it wasn't as if you just said it right there as I mean the Stanford obviously yeah you're right that the officers but they got one and I wasn't surprised what's what Notre Dame pitcher and frankly after ... Oregon to put on\nAnd on the stadium and losing the game a in Washington needed Stanford but when and frankly to ... ... and for the ... and so the Stanford in Washington when they got together would be a kind of a championship type of match in show right now the ...\nKind of limited limping along hoping to sneak somebody into the final four and it's going to be\nTough to do uh just because the league continues to take hits or the south division can it continues to beat up on each other and\nAnd and does it look to be the stronger the two divisions and so you know arguably you got the top two possibly the top three teams in the league in the north division\nAnd uh the teams continue to knock each other off and that type of deal it just doesn't bode well but right now I just think Washington is the best team and a leg or they're the ones that can knock off a thank goodness in Oregon\nAnd the ducks have them at home I think that's you know another touchdown and having them an arts stadium that uh\nYou know that that's now get a little bit of rest day and that's really important for this team is to get some body healthy that weren't able to playing that game last night a late night late night game to or are they got a few guys kind of banged up their body and getting everything major installations\nSo called gold she comes to counteract washed it usually takes versus\nHow upset Kelly own for now after all the great years up in Oregon inheriting a mass at UCLA and uh I I'm looking at the schedule you know I don't know if they're going to win the game this year\nBoy does he get easier to do I mean that's\nThe thing about it then you start looking at that and now look at him I look at Scott Frost in Nebraska\nAnd the way that those two guys are struggling and uh you know I mean I knew at both of those schools that was going to be a little bit of the rebuilding process\nUh but at the same time I didn't take Fresno state and Cincinnati what both kickoff UCLA uh in Pasadena this year I thought the UCLA but at least get one of those against that both of them to be able to get off to start and so\nYeah it's been tough on ship an ... old friend of mine outside backers coach don't tell them at all he made a mind here that Oregon but ah\nYou know those those those guys will get it together it's going to take a little bit of time people need to be a little bit they shut down there are good coaches there's no doubt about it and I think once they get their guys are recruited and on that team and coached up in that tape deal UCLA is slowly but surely going to sneak back into things\nUm and by the way what somebody drinking heavily junkie when they when they came up with this back up north and south by our Stanford and count mountain the south and Colorado in Utah ... that doesn't make any sense to five or ... people say that the day but\nIt it's funny I hadn't probably in the collective three or four years prior to your head anybody even question it uh but this year I've heard a lot of people say why would that be the case why not have\nYou know for the Arizona ring up through California being the six South Asian games in Utah and Colorado that is what it is and who ever thought\nA ... before the season you'd be at this point the season and say who do you think the only undefeated team and the Lakers are going to be Colorado you know I don't think anybody would have said that so\nYou know ... they're they're doing a great job there and and doing some tremendous things playing some good football uh but they're going to get tested the meat of their schedule is to come no doubt about\nThat All right good luck to you talking to you as always thanks for coming on okay good architecture mail you anytime he goes to great my dog is like if the Twitter handle and be former star quarterback and Oregon and are doing the radio broadcast the days when the ... the sports radio\nFeels like we're interrupting the conversation\nNBC's radio would come right back [noise] for a\nComplete look at news for the weather and other great information it's a new report was Harlem ... am Thirteen twenty shells usa jar\nIf you suffer from E.

[noise] [noise]\n\n\nDo we think it's worse for this game show [noise]\nTax and the great acts of former NFL wide receiver all American the U.S seen our radio analysts get them to join a segment on TALK from college football in the meantime\nFor a light and him up lots of things going on in the national\nFootball league today including some clock management blunders in the ... you know I I I talk about this all the time when people say well they you know you talk about this clock management stuff and and coaches not being able to manage their time outs or are you going to get off that subject and I said absolutely yes I Will yes\nAs soon as coaches understand and learn how to manage the clock properly and use their time outs properly they're start listening to me and quit blowing games and quit being stupid I I I'm I'm I Would say more than anybody I could quit talking about this\nAnd then I turn on the television on Saturdays and Sundays and I see one fiasco after another and there were four games today we're asked a direct result of poor clock management\nFor use of the time outs and pork gave management the game for a lost\nThese coaches are claimed that they work Eighteen hour days and that they they sleep at the office and they watch film until their eyes bleed and they over prepared with a hundred hour work weeks\nAnd yet on Sundays they have no idea when and what not to use the prime out and what to do in the last couple of minutes of the game\nAfter all that preparation time what you don't NFL coaches now have twenty to some of them have twenty two assistance on staff and besides the actual coaches video filmed coordinators analytics guys and none of them can go to the head coach and teach them how to properly use this time outs and how to manage the clock I could\nHave you got another example today that I've had this offer out here for years for one million dollars per year I Will sit in the broadcast I wasn't in the coaches booth\nOf any NFL team with direct communication with the head coach and my only job is to tell them what and what not to use this time outs and gave management decisions how to manage the clock out a marriage is talking about\nOther than that certainly I'm not qualified to put together a game plan or do any of that there's no stuff but I Am the world's foremost authority o'clock management and I know more than any NFL coats more than any publicist an editorial assistant how to manage the clock and how to how to use their time outs that's my specialty I made a lifelong study of it\nAnd yet they never learned it keeps going up and they keep making mistakes and you don't really frustrating thing too is what I'm watching the game\nAnd these colossal time management clock management situations come up neither announcer ever brings it up nobody brings it up in the studio before or after the show nobody brings it up in the media\nPeople just don't get it\nIt's unbelievable how they couldn't see the obvious like this but again one million dollars\nI'll sit in the booth that I met her ... and I here's my guaranteed here's what you make the million dollars back tenfold I guarantee you an extra three wins per season any NFL team an extra three wins if I'm sitting in the boat and they listen to me\nAnd they called the time out what I tell them to call them and they manage the clock the way I tell them to manage it and they manage the game the way I tell them how to do it they will win an extra three games and an extra three games a year in the NFL you know what that means\nThat the difference in some teams are making and not making the playoffs that's a difference of tens of millions of dollars three extra wins a year I should charge more than a million would I'm going to do for them\nBut let me give us some examples today [noise]\nMet Patricia then I got to get started giving these coaches nicknames or us a moron moron Matt Patricia time's running out against the Dallas Cowboys the uh the the lions have a I Believe it was a twenty four twenty three lead\nDallas throats when deep down the other was about thirty five or forty or gain right there in in the last was about a minute and forty seconds left the ball with Scott\nAnd by the time they spotted the ball and good everybody lined up and everybody runs down the field another Fifteen or twenty seconds said elapsed and then what's the ball was placed in everybody's ready to go then you know the play clock is was thirty five second thirty five forty seconds\nBy the time they snap the ball for the next play forty seconds we're a lesson in ...\nAnd that protects us out there were two time outs with Dallas in field goal rains with his stomach his rear end didn't call a timeout\nAnd I'm yelling at the TV you've got and they only had two left because he's stupidly blew a time out in the third quarter about midway through the quarter third quarter the critical of the time out and I said to myself well that'll cost them of course neither announcer brought it up neither announcer said it was stupid neither announcer several that'll cost them at the end of the game because they don't get it either\nBut I said to myself well that costs and boy did it\nAnd then the cowboys one another three or four plays and now there's\n... there were ... and ... and then finally Patricia cause a couple of time outs on defense but he was one short he sort of called one right after that big play it would have saved him admitted and if he hadn't called one and the third quarter he would have had an extra one and then even after Dallas made the field goal with alliance would have had a minute left\nAnd then you get mad at Stanford back onto the field and certainly him at MIT and he could have driven them down there in the field goal rains and one of the game but instead Dallas ... o'clock all the way down to three seconds ... we'll go on the game and went home\nSo if I'm sitting up in the booth advice and Patricia the lions win that game today because they would have had an extra minute to get the ball back and Stafford you know potentially could have won the game driving down the field kicking a field on again\nUsing your time outs properly creates extra possessions and extra possessions or what what NFL games because most games come down to the last five minutes most things are evenly matched most games are close\nAnd if you're mad at your time to properly and you create an extra possessing or two for yourself and one or two less possessive for the opponent most times you were with the lions could have greater than an extra possess some for themself today by properly using their time outs and save at all three of them for the end of the game which they didn't do\nSo because of a moron map Patricia alliance lose the game now let's go to Matt and Dan quit I guess today will have to call him dummy Dan we're coming up with big names for everybody there

Adams is flying down there are these corners aren't very good and Michael Hi just left the game with a growing injury this is why it happened open we should be calling bombs to divide the Adams twenty times this game\nHe's wide open so why on second down have you got me spread out with a single back and it's a blast in the age gap against you know they're tough defensive line what are we doing this for\nThat's what his frustration is and he's here to take let's go back through the week you know McCarty comes out of the game and he says hey blue collar when and and great job by our defense and\nYou know are often scattered it out in the air and Jones and boy had some big place and time Montgomery had a couple of nights plays time Montgomery was joking in the locker room has finally got the longest to catch in my career forty seven years because they didn't call this one back you've had several called back for a penalty or something along the way\nAnd then he was asked about Aaron Rodgers McCarthy said yeah you know we have waited to see how you get into the flow of the games with this spraying me but yesterday they felt confident enough that he could call a keeper played without waiting to see how Iran was was doing in the game physically\nUm and and he said that the he thought the Thursdays practice and pads was the best practice of the season so far this year\nNow you know let's talk about what happened\nAaron ... two weeks ago remember we had that clip when I said to Rogers you know we know that you know your outstanding and you can just do on a Saturday run through and you watch the film and that you can go out there and still throw more accurate passes and just about it a buddy in the NFL but what about your receivers\nAnd what about your honorable Allison or somebody goes down like Randall Cobb Marquez Valdez gambling has got a runner out man they need every rep they can get with you not to Sean Kaiser 'cause you'd you practice with the Sean Kaiser two three days\nAnd then go out and the game with Aaron Rodgers that just a completely different game for those receivers and what was Roger ... he said well then you just got to be on the same page with me you know you got to me during the week and ask questions and how I see things and how long will play it but but there's nothing like\nActually doing it in practice and have a number twelve there when you run through the game plan to explain what to do so then Rogers\nHe's sick and tired of looking at the dish on Kaiser\nPackers for the last two weeks in practice\nAnd he sees it it's not only affecting the timing of his off and it's affecting the quality of what the defense is going up against you know he he's seen a slower game and and the defense that probably having more advantages and then when I have to end up going against her cousins\nOr Alex Smith their author games because they're not the ... you know they're not practicing during the week again to a real NFL quarterback\nSo Rogers goes out there and Thursdays practice and he says you know it was all grid that I did that but I you know I felt like I needed to do that for my team and he thought that that might get it put a kicking the you know a a pants and the and the Packers defense\nTo get ready for the bills and Josh Ellen running all of the field so I've condensed\nErrands comments last night and I'm telling you he can't believe that\nThey didn't take opportunities of open place once they were up by you know to scores in that game against the bill fears Aaron\nI mean it's like I was feeling tremendously better I just felt like when you're a little ...\nOn up and so I don't think there's a split off and\nMaybe a jolt to the defense a little bit and the ah [noise] as I can take credit for them or their um for ... twenty two and maybe\nThat's what it was it was as bad as we play on our fence with that many yards and longtime\nWith us and so\nI think a lot of people play it really good but there was no slow\nThere was a little bit in the first to\nReceivers that's not a question for me\nYou know I had a couple of nights ... will um you know to tell us a\nCall ... during the games that are the average but um you know around the world and\nJones was good the change of course right now is getting runners slasher\nSlow to sort of on the one of those those those are\nI mean we were championship decent level and I'm\nNon playoff team often so global but\nBy any stretch them as a nation we need\nOur plan makers and are in position to\nGet some more opportunities\nYou know again like today I mean they're not there to cover for anybody [noise] but uh\nThe shit twenty targets that\nAmerican stuff you know and then they dared to play on a few times um [noise]\nSo we got to find

clay and ... back in there and then Perry ended up leaving the Redskins game with a suspected concussion made it through the protocol will still able to be active in yesterday's game but you know we've talked about collar fact role in that you know eat when you talk to me just doesn't sound like an outside linebacker like a guy that's rather that are knocked somebody's\nHead off he talks more like a a ... a center on your basketball team he gets praise for some of the place he makes on special teams but it's not like he was that fast\nAnd even though it was garbage time of the seven sacks they had three of them are from Tyler fact grow and David ... who faces him a lot in practice stood up for ... for fifty one and said you know you guys are too harsh on ...\nI think it's unfair how he's been treated in the media honestly I think he's\nYou know he is a good player and he he does what he does\nI was when he won says about it becomes too ready to work and he's got intangibles about um that can be successful\nAnd I appreciate him just contained shopping wouldn't let the noise no sense to you guys out there and you guys have a job to do as well but you know nothing but happy because I'm actually I'm working every day\nA good player and even better person\nSick enough for one of his guys he eats a bad rap in the media I I think it's only ... the fact that there's ... there's nothing spectacular there's nothing that stands out he gets lost in the wash does any\nI he does um unless and maybe if he just uh you know as a little bit more instinct\nAnd jumps on plays a little bit more because I'm sure he wants to be assignment sure you you take a gamble when you go after the quarterback or you try and hit the running back behind the line of scrimmage and they end up

ma'am thank you\nSo I'm I'm I'm twenty four years old I just graduated a community college about a year ago um and I like to start making a series that polluted out on however I just might have waited waiting I can\nUm I don't know why and considering the amount of money that I make 'em go if you don't\nUm how much we can get that I said I might call her pay our pay check 'em can move out and really\nParents kinda ... like free\n... or ... what do you make\n[noise] um monthly and is that and that's after graduating okay what is your degree in\nCollege but um I actually got a job but he can to help 'em my career\nSo when we're your career kick in\nUm I'm I'm actually quite a few of my education take about a year\nOkay well at eleven hundred a month we're talking about a little over Thirteen thousand dollars a year that you're not going to you're going to make it on that in Raleigh out on your own okay you're not making enough to do that so we've got to get your income up that's why I was asking and so um yeah we need to double your income\nOn pretty quick here as fast as you can and when you can double your income and then I Would go get a you know an inexpensive apartment maybe a roommate or whatever and just get started on your own and the main thing there is make sure you have no bad do you have any debt it all\nAt a higher rate down I asked him about it every day I'm which I'm I kind of who I'm just like ... and more credit\nWhere do you mean they're taking care of that\nThey are fake I pay a whole lot when I look I\nKnow that you know we don't need you to establish any more credit you don't need any bad you you don't make enough money to breathe hardly okay so when you are one hundred percent that free\nAnd then you build an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses are like five thousand dollars a set aside\nFor emergencies then you would start saving towards your home and by then you are also in your first apartment and you just are saving as fast as you can and you won't put down as much as you can possibly put down how old are you you said you're twenty four\nOkay go ahead or you got a good plan so hopefully in the next twelve to Eighteen months you can see that income spike up as you start using your cosmetology degree\nAnd um because you know when you were Thirteen thousand and when you get your twenty six thousand quick as we can this doubling of that's still not a lot of money but that'll at least get you out there and get your moving in and get your career to start to build\nSo hey thanks for the call we appreciate you listening Ian is with us in Prince Edward Hi Ian how are you\n[laughter] Hi there thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nMy wife and I got five boys five kids and we just moved into our dream on three years ago or ten twelve acres the long term could it could turn around but the last few mine for just started your plan where they just have to\nAnd we're just thinking um when we got thirty five thousand undead besides the house and we're just not sure if you want and we need to sell the house has to be that free or which is called through the next ten Fifteen Years and and just make it happen\nTen to Fifteen Years we maintain a house and everything\nYeah like whoa where you know we have twenty eight years left in the mortgage\nMhm so what's your house you can come\nAbout Seventy K take home pay\nTake home pay All right yeah and um then what is your house payment\nIs around twelve hundred a month\nOkay house payments not on the line here that's fine you know but you got a lot of kids you got a lot of kids and you're not used to living on a limited budget and you're going to start that\nFlag you know\nBecause you've got thirty thirty five hours to clean up I mean you really need to clean that up it's probably going to take you year and a half two years but something like that you you no longer than two years you need to have this debt cleaned up right what is the thirty five thousand in debt what kind of debt\nA mouse or the long run the parents and part of it is my credits twenty five on a credit and kind of ground come on from our parents\nOkay she'll just a line of credit what'd you bond with the line of credit\nSo it's just been life has just been there about a piano a few years ago [noise] or just miscellaneous things\nOkay and that's over right yeah not doing that anymore right\nNo no no we were like we're just taking tired we just want to be free yeah we love the place\nI don't really I don't think you need to sell the house houses now killing your twelve hundred bucks out of a fifty eight hundred dollar take home by not out of line\nYou're oh you're okay on her house but you do have to get your written budget get on every dollar you're written budget and get that going as quick as you can ever dollar dot com and I'm starting to you know using the app on your phone\nTo squeeze every dollar so that you clear there's thirty five because if you can clear the thirty five you're going to have pretty good room in this budget even with five kids and you can clear I did just going to take a year and a half two years just a year and a half two years or Seventeen five a year out of Seventy thousand take home that's doable\nYou can do that as a lay down and you can do that a thirty five thousand out of Seventy thousand with five kids that means one year I don't think you're going to do that so somewhere between the one in the two and that's on landing on Eighteen months Richard is with us Richards in Salt Lake City Hi Richard how are you all\nHigh they've got how can I help [noise]\nSo I was wondering about emergency until we have a fully funded with emergency hundred of three to six months [noise] good to have about it can go in there\nI'm at my job for a trip out matchup came a hundred dollars a year great um should should I fully fund the account and should count towards Myrtle Fonda\nHolly funded to get that match that's wonderful and the ... of course can only be used for one kind of an emergency and that's medical bills it will lots of other kinds of emergencies pop up and so um or do you do you do both of you work in this house for as a single income\nIn Oakland okay and what's your household income of around sixty and what are you do er nurse\nYour nurse okay very very stable career meaning that if you were to lose a job you can get another one and twenty minutes nursing\nIs just a fabulous career field so in terms of ah accessibility an ad hours anytime you want to add hours you can get all being changed direction all kinds of stuff you just really and landed in the sweet spot there so very very good on that given that you've got that type of a career that's not\nSo specialized that it might take you six months to find a job if you lost it or something to do six minutes um then given that that's the situation I Would back and do you fully fund you're at a bond that I just say\nBetween the three to six months of expenses range I Would back down to about three months okay and so that's kind of like partially leaning on the edge as say\nAs part of your emergency fund but it's certainly not we're not really counting it because I mean you can have lots of emergencies that have nothing to do with medical on your life\nWhen you can get you know again you could lose a job you could um have the death of a relative and you had to pay for the funeral or wanted to pay for the funeral you can have all kinds of\nDifferent things happen transmission blow out of the car and all kinds of things that can happen that aren't medical and you can't use the ages I Dream of medical [noise]\nSo I don't generally counted in the emergency fund but I'm looking at your career stability and the fact you got a big fat I just said with a big fat match on it which is just wonderful both of them then that makes me very comfortable being almost three months side of the three to six months range for your emergency [noise]\nOne question I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen to the whole point of life insurance is to replace your income for someone who counts on your show if you have a spouse or you have kids yes you need term life insurance is the only way to protect them until you're out of debt and to build up your ...\nYour only digging a deeper hole if you waste money on cash value plans says it robs you have the ability to make real progress and that's why I send you to the sand or insurance and I have for Twenty years that's where I get all my insurance and they

so the the talent and not all the way that he got up to prove but just to have that passes for the game is something that I Hope I can translate on the field and then translate to my teammates\nSo

niners play this week also from that old Seattle a team that was so successful said why not just put\nFlags as in flag football on the quarterback so it keeps going on these roughing to pass or calls does he have a point everybody else is getting wrapped up in the quarterbacks now it it's almost beyond a hands off\nWell I mean you definitely have a major change in a in the hits on the quarterbacks knows his such that weren't severe in the past seemed like they are you know agree just now which is the what's interesting to watch but that's the way their officiating it down the other players are

looking forward to it at night and see them play against the Denver Broncos get a chance to really watch them do what he's done throughout the first three\nCame to the season is simply amazing um his composure his arm strength ability to keep the pressure and be like stay in place has been fantastic um though he is\nYou know step curry is ... you know creating some of those those amazing place I
