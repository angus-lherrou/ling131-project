CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me just kinda clarify this for you there is no positive effect to your marriage when you lie to your spouse\n[laughter]\nWas that helpful you don't already know that the ... [laughter]\nYeah well I'm trying to avoid it by ear you're all you're doing the cooking it up it's going to be a bigger fight once it cooks up [laughter] you might as well have a smaller by quickly [laughter] so here's the thing if you're afraid\nTo discuss with your spouse a purchase\nOr a financial issues that you want to discuss that is not a financial problem that's a relationship problem\n\nNow I got to tell you there's times I I mean I I have a ton of money I'm a multi millionaires times though I think I Want to buy something and I'm going to sit down and talk show and hey I Want to buy this toy I Want to buy another gun she's like you don't need another gun you have too many guns already people already would think you were crazy if they know what I mean and you and I collect guns by the way so\nYeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're gonna find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so you know you don't need another car you don't need another ... you don't need another enter to report behind the bar actually collect those I've got too much too many like toys right [noise] uh for the grandkids and for the kids to play on\nAnd so you know I I get ready to buy toys ... and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our\nBut I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked about this she gets ready to buy purses too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys this too expensive\nBut like she says one of those purses is equal to\nOne of those guns [laughter] ah well maybe maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know and it's funny how as adults that have the money even\nWhere there is not a stress on the finances have it a little bit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your life not theirs and one of the seven habits just talk about money even when it's hard and it's almost always hard\nTo talk about it\nKeep it clean and\nIf your spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas one is you've got a broken relationship and they are intimidated by you\nTo the spouse is an arrogant\nRebellious immature prints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with their lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child and the grown up body and goes and buys whatever they want to buy but know that it's wrong so they hide it from you know\nMost often we find hidden that though is the what the guy was on the last call\nOne of the spouses has been given all of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling well ends up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and now the shame is multiplied and its shame based hiding its guilty\nCondemnation base hiding so they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job of handling the money\nIn which case if that's your spouse you are partially responsible just like that guy said\nHe was he on that because he should have been more involved you shouldn't have dumped this on his wife and you shouldn't dumping all on your husband\n\nYou shouldn't dump it all on either one of the both of you should be involved now whenever you again can carry that ministry of weight once all the decisions are made but everybody ought to know where every dollar is going\nPretty simple stuff\nYou probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who would almost been on Oprah more than anybody\nOprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we could get on I've been on every other show back in the day you know I've been on a sixty minutes I had been on Larry King remember Larry King was on the air on Sallie Jessie Raphael you remember her with a red glasses you know all that I've been on all these different shows\nYou know everything out there ... except I couldn't get on Oprah and they would call and teach us so finally they call and we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah and the very first family\nOf course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah\nWhy would I Do that because Oprah was wrong [laughter] is what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea\nAnd uh I had told the producers I said was partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not love and his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars if unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy hadn't got he he doesn't know what's going on under his own route these freaking clueless and his relationship\nAnd so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and Dave\nIt's partially spoiled and he owes earn apology I don't think I agree with that and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology because he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand over the debt and he didn't even know what the flips going on under his own roof\nAnd she's like well he delegated it to her I said Oprah this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you're delegated in in business you would always inspect what you expect you would never just walk away and hope it happened you wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that this was a marriage is not a joint venture God did not say and now you are a joint venture\nHe said now you are one and these two are not one they're not on the same page and so\nYou know the poor lady sitting there crying 'cause she's so ashamed and overwhelmed and the guys angry 'cause he's find out how they got a grand in debt that he didn't know he hadn't oh man it looked like a Jerry sport Springer episode or something and um you know and I'm a I'm ... I'm making him apologized to her for not being a good husband\nBecause of your wife can run up your husband can run up a hundred thousand dollars in debt and you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life or their psychopathic liar\nOne of the two but most of the time it's you just did you just dump it on them and then and then you cry because they didn't do it right after you dumped it on them\nAnd walked away enclosed your eyes\nAnd what we'll do the ... well you know you thought but you didn't even care enough to get involved in what was going on and so Oprah's all upset with Dave goes Oprah was wrong [laughter]\nDidn't work out while the rest of the show what we got through it [laughter] so here's the rule of thumb then\nWe see couples who have a good marriage have been married ten years or Fifteen Years or Twenty years\nSit down and start doing a basic budget together we're every dollar has an assignment every dollar has a mission every dollar as a name before the month begins on paper on purpose every month before the month begins a unique budget it takes about ten minutes\nOnce you've been doing it a while but it takes about three months of doing it to get really on the same page and get a rhythm going\nWhere you see couples that agree on their spending before the month begins on paper on purpose increase their level of communication\nIncrease their level of cooperation\nIncrease their empathy for each other for the stress the other ones have been carrying that they didn't even realize\nThey begin to agree on their goals and their productivity what their money goes through the roof\nYou feel like you've got to raise when you learn to do this together on paper on permission before the ... begins give every dollar a name that's why we named the world's best budgeting software\nEvery dollar mess out for your phone every dollar movie of every dollar\nThat you know there are more than two million real estate agents in this country two million\nWhen all you want to do is buy or sell a house you don't have time to sift through ads on line or email twenty different people to find a few agents you want to interview our real estate email peas have years of experience and are the top agents and their markets in fact\nWe recommend less than one percent of the agents in the country that's why many of our listeners have success\nWith an E L pay Richard in Mississippi did and this is what he had to say there are so many ... just a day that it is refreshing to find someone like your E. L. P. bail he's experienced trustworthy and knowledgeable bill contacted me within a few hours of requesting information and was so professional in his presentation and approach\nIt was a no brainer do select him over any other agent\nYou know how how do you explain to other people because I Know I Know what the answer is but how do you explain to other people the level of intensity\nThat is required because you guys I mean it was not panic but you were focused to the point that you've sacrificed so deeply that normal people looking at you all have to thank you lost your minds I mean you guys were on you were game on\nYeah I don't know where do you get that fire from was it desperation\n[laughter] yeah I think it was mostly that living with a stand in line was unacceptable for us than and we just have made the decision and our heart that um we weren't going to do that and so\nI had and we had just individuals that kind of have their perspective that I'm living with us getting on ways and you know and it was normal you know it was just a mediocrity and like that was just a part of life\nSallie Mae is going to be a room mate for life\nSo people you know are some responses that we got where like you know you don't need to do that or you know that you can listen to your life that we had just made a decision like you know art student loan like just so astronomical that we couldn't live with it\nAnd so and we weren't really we weren't ready and willing to do and tell them to do that is the ... budget you know there's Iraq and\nIn fact it everything out of every dollar hadn't assignment and every extra dollar went to a student loans that we weren't making painting like and the land of making payments to having a month\nRight we have to have a big shovel and so we put everything we had towards the end we had like zero last for like just everyday living like eating out\nGoing shopping and socializing entertainment like that did not meet our budget line item and not for our budget and so and you know the sacrifice was overwhelming and they can and the like it was really a marathon to the degree that it was extremely painful to\nLive two ... two years bike and that lifestyle you know but and I would have to say like during those times like\nPrayer with everything like I really had to really have to pray through and just the frustration of that type of lifestyle\nAnd really be lifted in spirit um pet really be focusing can maintain that lifestyle and kind of he had countless hours adding more countless hours like twelve fourteen sixteen hour days or weeks and months at a time um but he was just very focused they just they prepared\nThan in prayer time really a kind of meet the marathon that we were I'm experiencing\nAnd pains of it was it worth it [noise] really yeah I don't know you're completely free [laughter] yeah good\nYeah I Know what else should get out of this is like when you climb a wall that that tall you kind of come away going\nWe can free can do anything going through crushers strengthens me but I mean we can do anything\nThat was in the first twenty four months of your marriage of your married life you know you didn't sit on the on the couch and watch Oprah reruns of wine is your thumb you went out killed at drug it home and paid off four hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars in debt your so impressive\n[laughter] sounded pretty cool we got a copy of Chris ... book for your returns bard we want that to be the next chapter in your story and it definitely will be outrageously generous\nAnd

getting quite the education and the national football league\nSome of the things people were concerned about\nWith regard to um his early for the NFL primarily as accuracy\nOr have come to fruition the ball was all over the place last week he doesn't have quite a good roster rounded especially off and simply\nTitans right now have knocked off the defending Super Bowl champion equals they went down to Jacksonville beach Jacksonville want to nine six ballgame ties are playing really good so I'm going to take Tennessee in this one as did Alex Hardy Brett how about you how does the bill Dietz biking hiking I don't know\nOne month I was tempted to Bill Bill here but where are you really went on I I'm not a big believer in the titans and that's what they did last week you know let's just sleeping on the titans alright\nSo there yeah but all three of us will take the tides meanwhile has this game here should be titled who needs to win most we've got the falcons in one and three and a Heinz Field to pick on the one two and one Pittsburgh Steelers who by the weight loss to haul\nAnd their last game division rival the Baltimore Ravens all these defenses either by design lack of talent or injury have been horrible so far I Would be over in this one without any doubt I bet you they scored more than\nSixteen points in this game combined uh you know how I how difficult it is for me to pick against the Steelers they are at home I think they get it fixed to a certain extent and outlast the falcons I've got Pittsburgh our party is going to take Pittsburgh and bread at it you will pick\nI Can't see the Steelers ones seen one like how can the top and the one who I Know that team's dealing with so many injuries and don't take the home team some of the sellers\nAll right so all three of us will take Pittsburgh and that one let's move on now the Broncos at five hundred to and to\nHave to give it up a ten point lead in the fourth quarter Kansas City last week are in New York to take on the one and three jets of course the jets looked really good at the opener against the Detroit Lions\nEverybody thought that this team was off and running and it's been three straight losses this Broncos team is up and down a bit I think the jets play better at home\nNow Alex Hardy as picking the Broncos in this one with a whole team situation and Sam journal I think having a speed under a little bit I expected better defensive a performance by the ... I'm going to take the jets and this one how about you Brett\nMark up I'm I'm with you I like [noise]\nI like to just at home the shortly solely on the Broncos on a short week in a tough loss and flying across country so I I'm with you I'm going to take suggests I think they when this\nOne All right so there yeah but meanwhile the jaguars at three in one head arrowhead tough place to play to take on the five into cheese on the short we have to the temple and come back against the Broncos\nI think that Patrick ... homes as great as he's been in the afternoon football over yet has someone in their section five of them but listen I'm taking the jaguars the jaguars or a better football team I think are not that he's going to\nGame I think it will be a little more difficult for from home so I'm gonna take Jacksonville on this one um my friend Alex hearty missing Kansas City how 'bout you Brett [noise]\nI like to change I think they are probably the best team top to bottom asked the arrowhead and such a tough place to play then I'm going to go with the chief phenomena say the moms does turn them all\n[noise] All right there you have it so Alex and you take chief I'll take the jak meanwhile the Packers [noise]\nTwo to one and one had to Detroit thick on division rivals the lions who are one and three [noise] um [noise] let's see if there's been some turmoil sometimes that uh you know sparks a fire under somebody's but Aaron Rodgers has been happy with the way things are going on I'm going to take the Packers on the road in Detroit over the liars lions as his Alex already about you a\nI asked the question a couple a couple of games you know how to do with the Viking behind the times\nI was tempted to go lines here but\nVaccines are one of the greatest public health stories of the last century among cleaning\nAnd today the CDC recommends vaccines to help prevent more than Fifteen diseases happy twelve the birthday\nOf the nation is important not only for babies and young children throughout your entire lifetime\nBirthday mom to learn more about vaccines for all day to day life\nTalk to your health care provider for for the lifetime of vaccines dot com public service of healthy women and Merck\n...

it's Baker may feel I Want a guy that played and won and had a lot of games in as accurate he checked all the boxes and for those people who said well he's got some character issues I said that's BS for those people that said all you might be too short I said that's BS he's a football player\nAnd he's a winter well\nLike Cleveland first test against the NFC ah or I should say the uh the AFC [noise] north\nIs well let's let's just face this I mean when when they faced off against the Pittsburgh Steelers to open up to see ah the season ah they ended up in a time you could argue this football team should be on for they lost a close one on the road against the Oakland Raiders\nAnd a lot of it has had to do I think would Baker may feel who is now under center and will be again on Sunday\nWhen they take on the Baltimore Ravens one of the best defenses in the week as a matter of fact now I was an eye braved about Baker may feel\nRaved about it but I have said nothing the likes\nThe ravens defensive coordinator Don wink Martin do quote\nAnd this is Bob ... says I already told the defense this I think Baker Mayfield is this generation spread far or John Elway if you will I'm like wait a minute wait hold on\nWhat we're talking about hall of famers there he goes on to say this guy knows where he wants to go with football and he's very accurate he's got a quick release and he's really playing well the kids confidence\nAnd swag when it comes out of there he thinks he's standing on top of the the mountain he's making plays to show he's standing on top of the mountain and quote I'm thinking okay\nListen we weren't Dale ... the guy that's still carries a lot of respect around this leak is a pretty good defensive coordinator but\nHe's seen some of the things I'm seeing now am I ready to go on and the limb and say that he's this generation spread farmer John Wayne not yet not yet I mean he's he's he's got a few more years under his belt I think before I started to come to some sort of conclusion that he's going to be that good and by the way both those players playing a long time and this lady\nA long time and\nAh you know part of being great being a hall of famer being the generational kinda quarterback means that you're going to have some staying power\nAll right so when you look at the numbers though he made his first started last week so may feel into games or a game and a half I should say his past for nearly five hundred yards two touchdowns two interceptions\nNow he's going to face this Raymond ... which ranks second in the national football league\nIn fact of the loan defensive group in the NFL that rank ... passing and rushing defense and oh by the way that I mentioned the fact that they get back Jimmy Smith who's coming out that for game domestic violence expansion which is going to make life more difficult for may feel I get it\nI I I went out on a limb 'cause we made our week five picks as did bread Abbott and I picked the Cleveland Browns and take on the Baltimore I mean this this game as can be played in Cleveland\nThey went on the road to the black hole with a rookie quarterback making his first starting up forty two and took over time to beat them you could argue they got a job for a couple of times by the officials\nI said this team could easily be four in ... will be easiest way but you know it's not going to be easy\nBut I guarantee you great Williams\nHas not stopped chewing the bug that defense for given up forty two points\nOn the road against the Oakland Raiders and they're going to come out and give Joe Flaco and its football team some bits\nI think so it could be one of the fun games to watch this week in my opinion [noise] and uh another one by Baker\nMayfield and I don't know maybe as another step closer to being this generation's bread far more drawn out where he\nHelp statement by ...\nAll right the patriots up fourteen to free right now about five minutes left in the first apple

run out and traffic and hurt themselves or he had the best intentions for this kid\nI by the way I've been overwhelmed by the response of most people would say this is awful you gotta do something to suspend this guy that can happen in college football um how are they dealing with it they're in College Station\nYou know I think it's a it's a very fascinating um yeah it's a very\nSituation and also I got asked before we get into this you use the word ... because it was the first word in a in this fight song was that as I\nSaid no it wasn't really notice and I went to Arizona State I don't even

that you know it's\nJindal has it and you know he had all the players came out and then they said you know we've got no problem with jumbo you know that we kind of know he coaches this tough and and all of this stuff that you know I think the best way to put it is I think in year one um you know when you're still fresh you know on the scene I think it's something that\nYou know the internal yet I Am and everyone around and if they're not going to really get get too much in an uproar now this has been a situation where she loves a ride in the team for a few years he's lost a few recruits he's been too tough on them and they're starting to wear that might be you know breaking point and things of that nature\nBut you know any of them because they're still on a honeymoon phase I think it was it was okay um you know I think that's how they view it um you know things might change and a few years if if if your nose is still riding the team and they're not really winning or or whatever\nUm you know it and I've seen the arguments on both sides you know and then not I've done you know try to stay impartial and stay out of it\nUm throughout this whole mess you know and I I see where people are going with this I mean on one hand like you said you know it was you know and in interest that kind of help protect player um but at the same time you know you can make the argument that you can't really coach I'm like you did twenty Thirty years ago I'm worried that would have been you know walk in the park I mean today we wrote about you know the\nSimilarities between bear Bryant and jumbo Fisher and you know I'm sure the Barrett way more than ... people by the face mask\nIt was just a completely different time back then and so um you know I think that's it's it's been interesting to see the backlash I didn't know it would be so divisive them I think in those kind of acknowledge that you know\nI'm you know the way he talked about it this week but you know right now all the ... you know we asked all the players and understandably so you know they said it wasn't a big deal but you know they were very adamant that and you know they weren't too concerned with what happened last Saturday\nOr I Want to get to Baylor obviously the entry level way as a as a file notice with them I'm a part of citing lack of institutional control with a\nUm of sexual assault situation and went down there for several years looks like they're going out to the University of going after our browse had given them Ninety Days to respond to this when I hear lack of institutional control the first thing that comes to mind is possible death penalty\nOr how severe could this get for Baylor\nYou know I I think that the death penalty might be a little too steep I mean you know given everything you know what what happened at Penn State you know Penn State and get the death penalty for what happened there um you know I Know that you know a lot of people equate Baylor Penn State in the same boat and rightfully so um you know it's very hard for me to see they are getting the death penalty\nUm at some point down you know I was actually kind of surprised that the NCAA came back at Baylor as hard as they did you figure that the way it had died down um perhaps you know it you know being said was going to do something they would have done it already um in terms of serving that in a way\nI'm so now you know we'll see what happens you know maybe they'll get a a potential boy band and a lot of scholarships I think that's that's definitely something that could be on the table when you're talking about what our lack of institutional control um you know maybe you know definitely show costs for our browse the at the very least keeps them out of the college game\nOr anytime soon or or or show you know provide the penalty if anyone decides they want to hire and which I just don't know the enemy at high school job right now so I don't know if anyone's going to give them a college gig\nUm them so you know it's going to be it's going to be fascinating are a lot of people what had happened in twenty sixteen wondered about the death penalty in the in the a show the precedent that you know that that kind of punishment is something they will never give out\nUm again you know especially after what happened to you know after what happened to that time you and then we'll resolve what happened at Penn State that you know I think that might be off the table but bay or could be you know in line for severe sanctions still\nYeah it'll be interesting to see what happened to Ben we

and they had bill Russell they had Larry Bird they had uh of course\nI'm Bobby or\nAnd they had Ted Williams and what they ended up doing was they decided at that point to put Tom Brady as the fifth member of the Boston a they made it a\nDidn't Mount Rushmore and first of all I'm thinking to myself you can't have a fifth member of a Mount Rushmore there's only fight for face is allowed on Mount Rushmore you can't have that fifth face\nSo like the whole point is you can cheat and say we're going to add a fifth ... face and there'll be Tom Brady\nAnd that's going to be our Mount Rushmore so now we have our selves the patriots Tom Brady there we have ourselves to Celtics Larry Bird and Robert ... and and then of course bill Russell will have or you know Boston Bruins Bobby or we'll have our rent socking Ted Williams\nNo it doesn't work that way\nSo I came down to that says I'm watching this in my body temperature is rising because I'm getting madder and madder because I'm like just as cheating you don't just get the ad Tom Brady and not take somebody off if you're going to ask Tom Brady you got to take somebody off the west right you got to keep it for\nBecause next is going to law had big Papi now live up Mount Rushmore six well once Columbus Clemens gets in the hall of fame and no one gives a hoot about steroids because we put you know big Papi on the mount Rushmore wife seven\nAnd then we'll put Kyrie Irving won his career is over that me and I'm right so why do you draw the line you know what are you on the line if you're going to call your Mount Rushmore of athletes with the city of Boston you gotta stop before because that's how many presidents or Mount Rushmore so this is what I've determines if you're gonna put Tom Brady\nOn the Boston Mount Rushmore by the way\nHe deserved to be there now for how many years right how many years has been were Tom Brady already deserves to be on the mount Rushmore of Boston athletes so I'm going to put Tom Brady there and that makes me have to take somebody out the beauty of Boston is it safe for sports town\nYou have the NFL the NBA major league baseball and the NHL guess what Boston actually cares about all four of those sports\nSo if you're going to do that you have to take a name off and to me it's simple okay Ted Williams obviously belongs on the mount Rushmore of Boston\nNot only see the greatest Red Sox he's probably the greatest hitter in baseball history at least he's in that conversation with Babe Ruth and DiMaggio and Gary and get into you know a bunch of others Ty Cobb wherever you want to throw in that mix Ted Williams is in that conversation\nThen it comes to buy your\nThe greatest Boston Bruins now you've had ray Bork you've got other great Bruins but Bob ... the legend right he's the one that I have no problem keeping him on that list\nBut you can have two Celtics on the list you can have Larry Bird and you cannot bill Russell if you're a free sports town you could of course double up on one of the sports because Mount Rushmore for names but Boston doesn't have the privilege\nOf only having free there the lucky few that have four so you have to put a patriot they're right because you have a deserving patriot that being Tom Brady so then it\nComes down to this what do you think of iconic great Boston Celtics\nIs it bill Russell or is it Larry Bird\nWho exactly belongs on that Mount Rushmore because right there is where one stage one goes and Tom Brady gets on that list it's that simple it's going to be bill Russell or Larry Bird by by from the Boston Mount Rushmore hello Tom Brady\nSo I thought about it and you know I grew up more than the Larry Bird our rights and immediately I'm like wow I Can't really take Larry Bird off list like that I mean\n... the all time greats for Bill Russell was such an absolute star it's unbelievably great out Grady was so British they're showing last a mock yeah\nI looked it up getting the stats\nI don't look at a number of rings because what Bill Russell played in a different era where you kept together great teams and I mean they had like six hall of famers on the team as ridiculous as nonsense plus if you think about this or how many guys in terms of height can really match bill Russell you had wilt Chamberlain yet a just a handful of guys on like today\nLike Larry Bird to me had to create more because I think the league was a bit more difficult when Larry Bird play that one bill Russell played more teams as well let's not forget\nBut bill Russell is a greater Boston Celtic no offense to Larry Bird one of the all time great\nHe is just a product of sheer numbers any doesn't fit because bill Russell was slightly greater than him bird I Am kicking off the mount Rushmore Boston Tom Brady takes the place of Larry Bird am I wrong wrong wrong to say that\nThat might\nI don't think so I don't think I'm wrong to say that I mean it comes down to the fact that he is a great player in the sport of football where he is of course the greatest literally the greatest quarterback in the history the sport\nLarry Bird is not the greatest basketball player ever played\nSome self in that conversation here and there when people talk about top five so I think it's hard to take a bill Russell law for Tom Brady it's easier to take a Larry Bird off for a Tom Brady so I really you know think am I wrong to take bird off for Tom Brady do we keep to NBA guys on there\nI Would kick Bobby are off putting off the ... or more but that's just because that just because because you don't like about hockey no one watches hockey and cares about hobbit not as much as basketball baseball and football it's a distant fourth\nAnd if you're talking about the greatest Boston athletes the mount Rushmore bird has to be on that has to be up there has to be the top for\nWhat you're say it said the here and there are all great players that's the problem is unbelievably a legend these great I get that and he's but loved in in Boston I get that but bird had a more of an impact I think in sports than Bobby or did\nBut it's not about impacting sports it's about impacting Boston because it's the Boston\nMarathon girl had a bigger impact in Boston no doubt you know bill Russell you're right he didn't play against I guess the greatest competition back in the sixties in the NBA right I I definitely think in the eighties accomplish was better than the MBA but bill Russell dominated the greater the best player of that era in wilt Chamberlain\nSo you can't take bill Russell off that off Mount Rushmore and you can't put ...

to me I could just kind\nOf run the brand through right now we will first game do the divisional series Christian yell at each\nThird inning to run home run I mean why not Christian ... has been ridiculous if you're especially the last month and a half of the season he's clearly that actually got to be he finished what one home runs and what RBI short of being a first nationally triple crown since uh Joe met a week in Nineteen thirty seven I Believe he did that with the cardinals\nAnd what's amazing to me is like\nWhy the beginning pitched you right now\nTo for three days to more walk Christian ... is a superstar and Derek Jeter is gonna dump for that deal forget trading John Carlos Danner Marcello sooner trading Christian yell at all uh twenty six years old a five year fifty eight million dollar contract that will be the start of the real downfall for Derek Jeter\nThe return he got back Lewis Princeton and you know minor league guys\nAnd ah I said D. as in some getting Coleman is going to turn out to be one of those good Christian Bale trade although you know\n... always going to have Tommy John these gonna miss next year I mean the guy has a shot to be pretty good as a pitcher the fact is I mean this is my back about where fire to where this might be on the great deals in the last ten years because I don't see any of those brewers guys turning into anything spectacular well Christian yell at you as\nA superstar so today of course yellowish gets the ... going to run home run the third inning\nAnd then it's all brewers pitching right I mean up bullpen and old game was pitch by the bullpen and they got through it they get to the ninth inning and at that point Jeremy Jeffress just blows it right I mean he implodes three hits gives up two runs in that anything is to to go the extra innings\nAdam gonna veto who's been so good for the Colorado Rockies\nHe pitches warning comes in the last one and there's a sequence there and he's you know he's he's\nHe's won a secondary type of guy in terms of the strength of his pitching he didn't want us to be through a show what does he threw Christian yellowish four straight fabulous documents talking very fast patio yup\nBut what is he doing in the Christian religion scoring position who of course gets on base and scores the winning run I mean would you have it would you write the script any other way\nAnd yet when you're breaking balls are better than your fast balls and that's been your vote to pitch Michael stock is can ...\nAnd just thrown for fast balls in that situation the tenth inning\nAdds to me it's strange like you you you have stabbing reports on guys right you know what your strengths are\nLike if you go down and you're going to fail still with your better pitchers not with for fast balls they got burned stock is driving the winning run Miller Park robes and the brewers just like data point games to none in the best of five and you wonder just to get into playing a factor how many ... games in Colorado really player right it's incredible to me\nUnbelievable Sean but what a game was on the I think I did\nThe Rockies almost all one 'cause Milwaukee had like either at home right they have the crowd and on their side dropped to nothing in the ninth and the Rockies came alive and and if the if the Rockies had won that game I think momentum would've I\nWould've favored the Rockies going forward obviously the five game series so yeah that's a big swing but I don't know about you but coming in to the serious I I was favoring the brewers probably Seventy to thirty percent I thought that when the when the series\nYou know what I read something Sean I I think you probably saw this as well but the wildcard team more than fifty percent of the time when the series\nAnd you wonder the lay off of the team that wins the division that has the best record\nIs it worse to have that lay off or keep playing like the wildcard team who wins a thrilling game whoever it is and whatever it is against whomever it is right and then you go in with the momentum in the Rockies as you said almost stole that game in Milwaukee was open it's been so great almost\nBlew that game so you kind of wonder is it better I mean a lot of the Rockies are far from being out of it at this point you know this is crappy team that has shown unbelievable resilience is a team that was able to you know ... you know to to do what they've been able to do to get to this point Shawn they want nine games down the stretch that just a handful to go\nGet a lot of credit I don't think they're out by any stretch imagination no they're not\nBut do you like the five game series would you prefer to see and we go to a seven game series an LDS\nHere's here's the problem\nAs a

detail means we're confident in offering a hundred percent quality guarantee millions of guys have already made the switch to Harry's so thank you if you're one of them\nAnd if you're not we hope you give it to try with this special offer get Harry starters debt with a five blade razor waited handle shaved Joe Sante travel cover all for just three bucks plus free shipping\nYeah yeah I think after we I'm On the second game in Boston when a\nA David drew me in with a a blue into center field I mean now it's three to two and then we have shelling on the mound game six and a you know game seven we had that experience from the year before and uh we weren't going to be denied I mean we we\nCaught fire at the right time and that's a that's the reason why we were able to close it out of the clothes that are convincingly um you know all of a sudden the Yankee it there's just\nA fell silent or I was planning to build it just seemed like\nThey were missing every single pitch you know there was a lot of pressure and at these games\nAre pressure field and uh so it's going to be very interesting come tomorrow night I'm not sure I can stay on the entire time anymore I remember those games get done um after one AM so many times so uh my bad times a lot earlier now [laughter]\nSo it's game seven at Yankee Stadium\nAnd you hit that grand slam in in the second inning and Europe six nothing at that point could you rest a little did we guys like oh my goodness I Can't believe that we're up to six nothing through two innings here after coming back three games momentum squarely on our side at this point\nIt was their moment in that game where it's like we've done it I mean did you have to wait all the way music tend to three final but was there a point there maybe it was eight to one in the fourth you guys are like\nLook what's happening here ... ... that grand slam by Johnny Was such a killer for the Yankees and that was that dagger at that point did you did you know you had it\nNo no I mean when I um rented round the bases I mean there is no small on my face because I remember what happened a year before and you know after the second home run hit the following\nOr two um you know you start feeling a little more confident but\nIt's the Yankees I mean they are a star star studded every single place they they have that winning mentality so um I that was not going to be happy until the final a pitcher's throwing\nYour career you played at seven different locations by Yankees Red Sox have that law they have that aura what's it like to play in a playoff game Yankees Red Sox is it a different field than playing anybody else\nAbsolutely I mean I'll be aligned to you of a [laughter] that's not but um you know there's so much um energy around the ballpark the fans are excited the media's excited I'm the players are I mean this is a\nUh what's your dream about I mean the biggest forever and sports and um it's and it's back after fourteen years it's a it's going to be very exciting and it's it's all new new faces so uh\nUm [noise] I Can't wait to see what happens and you know unfortunately whoever wins this game does not or when's the series does that go to the world series like we had before but uh I'm sure there's going to be a lot of a fire part\n... years ago and fly right you're right but you know it's been fourteen years Johnny since we've had this and that we have not had Yankees Red Sox in the postseason since\n[laughter] no I cannot believe that and you know with two thousand nine when I Wonder what the Yankees I\nUm Boston was a team that I thought we were going to face because they always beat Anaheim I'm In the playoffs and that was the year that Anaheim Scalia I'm finally won so uh um I thought for sure we were going to get them back and\nI'm not sure how how the pressure whether or how I Would have handled that pressure\nOn you know so it's a very exciting but I'm sure I Would have hit a grand looking for the red Sox [laughter] pay back [laughter]\nThe gray Johnny Damon joining us going deep enforcement NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com\nYou know obviously you're a baseball fan Johnny you played this war for a long time but how important is it for baseball and your mind having been a part of the series understanding the the legacy in in the in the rivalry but how important is it for baseball to have this happen right now\nIt's very important I mean as you can see from the first couple of games\nA hundred and sixty third games of the season I mean they were amazing or you know baseball's heading into a no great\nPostseason right now I mean the um all these games have been um incredible um baseball needed this but you know now they could Yankee Red Sox so I uh it's going to be a great again so I just um\nYou know can't wait I Can't wait to watch us as the the best time of year for baseball and uh Derek Jeter always ah when we got to October they would start smelling around and when I was he doing he's like I should I smell the postseason [laughter] you know\nA world championships so that's that's the kind of mentality that are cheated ... what the Yankees so he cannot wait till this time of year\nAs friendly as the guys you are Johnny when you you're wearing a Red Sox uniform playing the Yankees or vice versa and especially in the postseason match up\nHe's genuine hatred amongst the club I mean you hear about DiMaggio when and Ted Williams and that these teams hated each other back in the day all through from Babe Ruth being sold the Yankees\nWhen you play against our friendships put to the side\n[noise] um\nYeah I mean your job is to go out and was so everybody wants to win and I\nHate that expression how um this guy hates losing while I think everyone hates them lose everyone wants to win but there was no hatred on my part I or respect as a way to Yankees play the game\nOr hit a ground ball to the second base but and they're hustling um and so that's the type of ballplayer that I was a I don't think too many people like\nMe or just like the way I play the game as far as I'm like respecting\nThe game and respect when the outcome you know there's no ... there was no uh\nCursing the other team is just about stepping on the field and taking care of business and uh hopefully at the end of the game or at the end of a series your team prevails and you live to fight another series and hope to win another world series so I don't think there's hatred um\nThere's two too much going on that\nYou know that takes up too much time you just want playing the game the right way\nLast question Johnny you go from four years in Boston to actually joining the hated Yankees and then you get you become a Yankee favorite at that point four years in New York\nWhere you would go back to Boston and playing Fenway Park\nWas it good natured ribbing you got from the fans or could you tell they were actually upset that here was one of the quote unquote idiots one of the guys with the best beards on that team one of the reasons why you guys broke the curse of Babe Ruth and now you're wearing Yankee pinch right so you're clean shaven was a good day today could you tell they were really mad [noise]\nUh no they were really mad at you know I get it\nAnd believe me I Want to stay a stay with the red Sox but um I feel like the intention was to try to bring back for one year I'm probably assigned to a lesser contract because ... was going to be ready and so\nAt the end of the day I wanted to uh Saturday nights contract a set the stage for a feature center field there is to make more money and a\nWhat a great place to go into New York and try to who Boston wrong because I mean I was a fan favorites and and that's what got lost at a you know the fans for very\nMisinformed about everything that happened and free agency and you know ... maybe I should have talked up or during pregnancy but that's not the type of player I Am I you know\nIf someone offered me a contract I'm going to take a close look at it um I'm I'm going to be very grateful for whatever happens but I was never going to go out there big for\nA contractor say you need to sign right now I just go to our business and uh\nUm where the chips fall that's what happened so uh um I get it they were upset and I was upset with the red Sox I really wanted to go back there and um have a huge legacy but uh um it takes two to agree and we uh we weren't even close\nAnd guess what you want a World Series you know what the Yankees as well so in the end it all worked out in the fan favorite in New York event favorite in Boston as well a member that incredible old for Red Sox team hitting that massive grand slam any number two game seven to complete the comeback Johnny Damon

ticket holder study in Boston with some news seemingly committing to resigning with the Celtics even though he's a year away from having to make\nThat decision is it financial is this something else also Kevin Iran's whispers as to where the Golden State warriors may end up after he will inevitably opt out of his deal you know year what's the latest Jimmy bought her a lot of talk you get into our body Kurt hew and pro basketball sock and NBC Sports dot com\nJoining us in Kurt let's get to the reality before you get to the\nFun hypothetical and that is of course Jimmy Butler are you on the line said here current that Tom ... set\nThe price so high for Jimmy Butler that it's fairly unreachable for anybody in the NBA because of course he doesn't want to lose a guy but yet you have to at least show Glenn Taylor the owner that he is attempting to trade is a troubled star\nOh I I think we're Taylor's the least of the problems I think it's more to do than Glenn Taylor who is kind of reached upset like let's get this done I don't want this distraction I'm\nWhat I've heard from sources is kind of what you just said which is that the bar keeps moving there's not a lot of traction um they're asking for a lot and that's um you know what they were making some progress with Miami this week at the bar move together and they want something else and\nJust every time that happens and I still there there's a there's a large segment of people who still think to those things that can just get them on a room and play basketball do you know ask about will solve the problems when it's not and they they're they're going to have to take a deal for him at some point but um took too but it was a win now guy coaching\nAnd GM and for his job that team isn't nearly as good I Would make the Josh Richardson deal if I were Miami ... if I were Minnesota I should say like I get Josh Richardson it but he doesn't make you think he's a better fit in some ways but he doesn't give you the pop next season that that that that uh that butler does\nYeah but here's the other problem though and and look every team looks to try to\nYou know get rid of a bad contract when they're trading store around and contract people talk about is Corgi dang and be forty million left on his deal I mean does anybody dumb enough to want to take that deal when they're going to have to pay Jimmy ball or a hundred Ninety million\nAnd that's where the third team has to come in and it's it's it's Phoenix or probably Sacramento but now to make sack look Sacramento take that on forty eight million by the way the ... going price for that is to first round hers and not the junkie first round like Houston has like a good first round or so\nUm that that's the problem you're going to have to come up with an assets to make that you'll worth it in rebuilding team and they haven't come close yet so I don't know that they're going to be able to get that I think it you know if Miami can get Richard send an urban as sort of get Richardson who's a hundred people who don't know and a lot of people don't [noise]\nHe's a quality young three and the guy who was going to be a great kind of glue fit player on a really reasonable contract for a while like you're good at what towns and and like a play some of the defense inconsistency show up with a motor that weakens doesn't but\nYou know what is he better than butler right now no and I still do the deal because I don't think it's going to get any better I don't think they're going to be able to move Jang I don't so I just don't see how they're going to pull any of this off\nAnd first of all ... wide Miami for Jimmy ... why would you want to go to Miami what did you see in Miami in terms of you for being Dwayne wade about forty years old I'm not kidding they don't have a ton of young talent why would Miami below at least they you know when\nI that's a really good question I think that there is I honestly I think there's a cultural fit in that Miami is bigger on conditioning and and getting bodies ready than any hardly any organization and the league or they do rest guys I mean and that's really one of those concerns this underlying ... butler teams getting in on this\nTeams are wary of that next contract with butler because he's got he's got turned thirty before he signs it and he's got pumped into miles on it like there is there's a\nThere's a potential you know blue oh dang type a drop off easiest future during that next contracted it always seems a little bit [noise] um he's you know obviously the top ten player right now um but or top twelve at least living on how you want to rank 'em but\nWhere he is two years from now three years from now is another question that does concern team so it's yeah it is the whole situation is a mess right now I don't even know how to describe it other than that but really if anything's going to happen in the next\nFour or five days at least it's definitely with Miami there there's just no I haven't heard anything about anybody else in any serious way\nChatting with Kurt hew and pro basketball talking NBC Sports dot com here on going deep did worse than NBC Sports radio let's get to the Kyrie Irving situation now of course he wasn't going to sign a long term deal\nThis off season I mean he just waits wander off season it's eighty million dollars more to stay in Boston but he came out today in front of a you know season ticket holders and kind of a queuing day and he pretty much said he's going to stay in Boston that in your mind just appeasing the fans or\nIs it that much better financially print to stay there or does he really just like Boston what are you hearing\nFor herself and his ... find it is financially better for him to stay there they will here's another guy who's a Mac steal his max is fine you know once he becomes a free agent science backup he's about five years one Ninety\nUm even if he leaves it's about four years one thirty nine so that's just it there's a lot of money on the table for him over the course of a contract to stay he'll probably do that um\nI I look things can never say never things can change but everything I've heard from other teams was like even yes the Knicks had interest and there's other teams will like at least make a call but I don't know anybody who seriously thought he was leaving like I don't know teams that really thought you know we got shot at him he's disgruntled um\nOh what's that other ... unless if things went a little weird and that he got recruited by another star but you know Boston's gonna win a light came the day and a lot of games I mean if you're there the favorites to go to the finals\nOut of the east they'd be my predict pick to come out of the east and the finals I don't think he's leaving that you have the money and the chance to be part of that legacy and the fact that he likes the team and the coach I just I don't see him leaving on west of unexpected stuff happens\n'cause he see himself kind of his LeBron and the sense of you know when LeBron was on a team in the ... nice to have been so weak as of late they are kind of the automatic teams go to the finals does he see himself as look Kyrie Irving is a superstar he knows who these young\nAnd as you just know that look I stay in Boston have a nice supporting cast young talent Gordon Hayward openly stays healthy my goodness we can own the eastern conference for five years that looks at it but actually\nI I think that that factors into it I think that you look out there and the eastern who else is there Toronto's interesting this season with co why but however they long term\nIt is a genuine threat but now they've got to find another guy whether that ends up being full and a couple of years if he'll still like Philly what they're going to win a lot of again a very good team but from contending they feel like they're a year of player away I don't know him or maybe they get somebody they've got a lot of money

that's the last place he should go [noise] he's in a case where Kevin Durant fields because he's so sensitive that people are undermining the fact that he's won two rings\nThat he will probably win a third ring\nAnd it feels that for him to prove himself\nOr his manhood or as great as he's got to go to a place like the next take them out of the dumps and be the reason why be that anchor that leads them to the promised land and win the championship could that possibly be why you would consider the next because let's face it\nIn terms of wanting to win and Kevin drains what like thirty twenty nine Thirty years old he's getting up there\nI don't think the next gonna win anything for a couple more years at least I don't know if the next one to go for a thirty thirty one year old Kevin to Iran's as a guy that they're going to kind of put in there to try to lead them to victory maybe means ramp probably as are the three or four good years left at least\nBut I just don't think his legacy it makes sense go join LeBron mean people are ready look at you as a guy that's going to go chase rings with other great players you went with Steph Curry and Golden State just go to the Lakers and try to win with when when one with LeBron James at this point no one's going to hold it against you why one day they already hold it against you is not going to change anything shot\nBut isn't that exactly why he would go to New York Kevin the rent for legacy purposes because he wants to go somewhere\nWhere they have one in a while and where the team is an established and win a championship they'll do wonders for his legacy going to LA joining with Ron that's not going to help anything but here's the problem he's not going to win in New York\nI hate to say it I mean why not James Dolan okay I mean that's fair but the team is isn't bad PR zingers of healthy eating of hell ten Fifteen player yeah but once you show these LPs incapable of state when he reaches towards ACL people come back from that it's not the worst in the world\nGiven how much time did he missed before that it's not like this the guy that was playing eighty two games a year if you look at ... stops for seniors and the number of games that he is actually played in his career\nIts stunningly low concerning the fact that he's always heard I mean look at it his first year it's like Seventy two games but he was also a guy that you know playing less minutes ... sixty six games forty eight games may not play a game this year I mean Chris ... is just like Blake Griffin at this point\nOh no way no he's not in terms of injuries but he missed those games last year because of the ACL the same injury that he's going to miss this season right out of concern that's just one injury what are the injuries yeah well the year before that he missed was the shoulder problems I think it was amazing\nNice to meet ... ... and you kinda wonder it's seven three is that the reason why is an athletic guy and you kind of wonder is a freak way that he toward that ACL those you know bringing on what the ... I think it was\nAnd it just gets to a point where you start to wonder if Chris stop sport seniors can stay healthy you put a next to Kevin do random Kevin Knox is the player that people think he may turn out to be the first round pick out of Kentucky\nThey have something brewing there there's a young talent as well to Marty junior was a very good player you know Frank Neal keynoter still high expectations for him and he's all Twenty years old right now there's expectations but\nIf Kevin trains going there thinking yeah me and for seniors will cross your fingers and uh you know make a prayer because the fact is\nYou're going to need a healthy thing is to win if you're Kevin right because you're still seeing as a team right you're still not better than Boston\nI mean Toronto is going to be different I don't know quite Leonard sticks around in Toronto after this year but I just think that for him the pressures of New Yorker also an issue I don't think he can handle the pressures of New York Kevin ... to me is not mentally built and doesn't have the mentality to survive New York fans and the New York\nPress big problem Sean I agree\nBut I mean why would you leave Golden State I don't see a well we know why for his legacy\nThat just wires right but\nAt this point who cares at this point just adds a legacy when five six rings\nAnd then when the judgment day and people go well Kevin Durant how great was the\nWell guess what Kevin to rent one six rings wherever you have to go follow Steph Curry all the brawn James joins Dwayne wade had their buddy Chris Bosh after joined them as well and even when he went back to Cleveland it's as if LeBron James joined a team of no talent no that Kyrie Irving a superstar and they brought over Kevin Love is still a talented team\nI just wanted yeah of course was talented But Kevin love was diminished on on the\nCash he was a superstar\nBut still I mean let's not a you know cell\nSat the shortest if they didn't have any talent then you know LeBron James by himself wanting what Brian James did in the sense of the games he had his abilities but overall LeBron James frankly did that help in the form of great

the defensive weaknesses of the patriots compared to the defensive strengths of Jacksonville\nEven out see what I'm saying does the differential between Brady and morals make up for the differential between Jacksonville defense and the patriots defense here's the answer no\nI don't think so because you can win Super Bowls the crappy quarterback if you run the football and have a great defense Jacksonville can run the football if for that can stay healthy and teach they all just a pretty good number two and they have great defense\nThe front of that defends the back of that deep as they are

Joe flat goes off to a great START I don't see it happening I I don't I really don't want to Pittsburgh [laughter]\nThey're a mess although they've you know ... back week seven you know what hold off on Pittsburgh until we see leave your belt three weeks back I mean we see levy on balance a week of Latin\nLet's see how that often looks\nRight I mean that to me is the ultimate test so James Connors not levy on bell I think we understand I think we realized that so then it comes down to this lame duck comes back they bury the hatchet it frees up Antonio Brown I guess who's been invisible\nYou know look there's still a dangerous team right offensively they're still dangerous do you believe in Pittsburgh defense though\nThat's that's a big question do you believe in defense you you can't and that's why they're not a complete team\nSo the only team that's really a semblance of the complete team comes down to Jacksonville comes down to the patriots\nMaybe Kansas City I think it is a free team race than the AFC and I just don't trust Sandy Reid and I think when push comes to shove I I don't trust the pages defense that got absolutely gashed last year the super bowl I ... and the eagles right and they got absolutely gosh they got demolished and I don't think you're a better defense now\nSo yeah I mean I think the second best team in the AFC but it's hard to bet against Brady it's hard to bet against ballot jak but I'm going to do it because I just think Jacksonville right now has more of the formula to win the big games down the stretch especially when the weather gets cold I'm going back to the number one in the AFC patriots number\nTwo shots\nI Can't argue with that yeah I think right now\nBut then the question becomes this to either the patriots or Jacksonville are they in the same classes Los Angeles ramps\nThat's the big question and I'll tell you what if charity golf\nIs as legitimate he seemed and there's no reason to believe he's not\nThat I think the rams are the best team in football hands down hands down to the best team in football\nAnd for a quarterback teams like myself for the jets and your team the bills that drafted young quarterbacks high that are gonna absolutely struggled this year\nThe hope is Jared golf did not look like an NFL quarterback those last they gave two years ago right he looked like an absolute blast and everybody thought at that point wow Carson went went after him he's this Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf in reverse\nBut Jared golf last year play better I don't think he was great but played much better this year Jared ... playing great\nAnd you were surprised I was surprised watching Jared golf when he just absolutely doors at Fort touchdown pass I thinking that gave me last play to me it's\nUnbelievable how good Los Angeles is they can run the football girlie they have weapons on all fenced off and get the football to\nThe office of wine is still solid enough the defense is is tremendous although I keep the leaves out what eight weeks\nMarkets Peters is day to day that's the gold standard right now the NFL not the patriots not the Jacksonville Jaguars not the defending champion Philadelphia Eagles the rams right now our number one in anybody's power ranking and that's really the way it should be shown you can't argue with that\nNo but you just said that you think ... going to come down to earth a little bit can't you say the same about Jared golf I mean he's playing above his punching above his way class right now Bush the plane terrific if it's not as if we're not for homes he'd be the envy the through the first four games\nYeah you're right about that but Jared golf has an extra year under his belt the patent homes doesn't\nSo to me I look at the experience factor ... homes have to struggle at some point right it can't be peaches and cream the rest of the way I mean for games and he's putting a fourteen touchdowns not a single intercept which by the way it sounds very Alex Smith asked from last year spit then thrown interception through like the first\nMaybe it's an eighty read thing I don't know ... ... credit I mean he is an offensive ... the reality is at some point I just think that as good as Patrick ... homes and look I'm not denying how good he is I was impressed watching him throw on the run the guys naturally rocket his ability to think\nOn the run in pressure situations throwing that football's his left hand which you really don't want to see but it worked\nThat's something that he had to come up with a split second you light the decision making of Patrick ... homes\nThought he was a gunslinger that's going to try to throw that football through walls of defenders because he knows he's got a cannon that he was going to be Brett Farr and throw a lot of ... I haven't seen it Brett Farr denim yet right that's the thing I haven't seen him make really stupid throws across the field that Brett Farr is notorious for\nSo I don't want to compare minute Brett Farr but he's going to struggle at some point Shawn it's gotta happen needle I think Jared got just as he better supporting cast in terms of the rest of his team that I think it's more sustainable Jared golf than it is with what you're seeing with Patrick my home because you got to the fence and they got all the running in yoga every aspect in there\nYeah I agree I mean definitely has a great greater supporting cast that being checked a jerk golf but I\nDon't I mean there's a lot of weapons around homes don't forget ... cream haunt semi walk into it and you know similar Watkins fits that system right I mean he's not a top ten receiver per se but he fits that system of of doing what they need not stretched a field with Terry kill as well so I I I've been around that moms\nYeah I like the weapons but my goodness how good is brand new cook spent\nMost of the guy that pages like go out and just one year they got a first round pick for a big fan of a brand that cooks yeah but he ... he he'll spread that feel really the federally sent me the wider that's better he can stay healthy and he's willing to take a hit you know and that's the that's a good parents they look at it if you look at the wide receivers\nCooper cups and the guy he just started\nRobert ... [laughter] I thought I'd always known world yeah isn't incredibly\nYou think about that the names were talk me and my ... Cooper cup is there I Would ... I Know he's good as you said his his\nRobert words I mean he's good at Cooper cop is is I mean he's pays like sixteen touchdowns this year Robert was as I I mean he's got there's three wide receivers on that team right now that their own pace from way more than a thousand yards\nI mean one someplace like twelve Ninety Cooper cups on pace for like Thirteen fifty and then you have a brand new cooks a base for Eighteen hundred yards that's including ... Gurley when he brings out the backfield in terms of a passing game\nThat's ridiculous down there and you're right I mean you you look at what ... and you know tightly\nKills on base or ... yards you throwing the fact that he's got one of the best titans and all the football in in in Travis Kelsey\nKareem haunts back to being cream on I mean he got off a slow start last couple of games he's played it about higher level\nThey both have great sets of weapons what's the difference I don't think Kansas city's defense\nIs as good as LA's the facts and that's going to play a big role down the stretch so\nObviously that's got to be a factor but when it comes right down to the NFL it is weak number five\nStart looking at some of the big story lines that are obviously going to play out this weekend now they start to get a bit more because there is a milestone the season a quarter way through we're past that it's coming up ... bc sports radio in the NBC Sports radio mobile app [noise]\nBy the zero just used to be sports radio\nThat go on\nHim while he was\n\nJay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nRight here on your twenty four hour information station am Thirteen twenty W F a jar Wisconsin Rapids\nCBS News update protests at the Capitol today [noise]\n\nThat has senators prepare to weigh in on the nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court with an initial vote set for tomorrow Senate Judiciary chairman Republican Chuck Grassley\nI feel very good about where this nomination is right now it's all come to the Supreme Court hopeful writes an op ed on our rights and the wall Street Journal op ed that he may have been too emotional at times during his hearing last week and says going forward quote\nYou can count on me to be the same kind of judge in person I've been for my entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking and even killed open minded independent\nAnd dedicated to the constitution and public good he\nSaid he will try to be the best husband died in friend that he can be\nThat's correspondent bill rake off after tomorrow's initial dose Republicans are hoping to hold the final confirmation for all senators\nOn Saturday CBS News update on that paper\nHere's your forecast from the weather I weather's enter rain showers likely tonight other light ... guys\nLook it's got about forty one twin mine to ten miles per hour scattered rain showers began tomorrow high temperatures were just you ... seconds tomorrow night scattered thunderstorms likely lowest level up around forty thousand maybe ... don't fit these sites funding\nFrom the weather on gee let our center I meteorologists Jennifer who she ...\nTogether we can turn a stairwell into an e or in a moment snow [noise]\nTogether we can turn a rescue mission for refugees into [noise]\nTogether we can vaccinate seven hundred and ten thousand people every day [noise]\nTogether we are Doctors Without borders Doctors Without borders goes for others don't to provide life saving medical care learn more Doctors Without borders dot org\n[noise]\n\nDamn short going every\nWhich way do we have [noise] any\nThat were three before we get to [noise] what's going on in college basketball is is really interesting aspect of it that we have yet to talk about how [noise]\nCongratulations by the way to a Tom Brady joins the five hundred touchdown pass club with that third\nTouchdown today he is now only eight touchdowns touchdowns shy of Brett Farr for number two thirty nine touchdown shy of Peyton Manning that Drew Brees right behind him he comes in a week five at four hundred and Ninety six\nHow about that Tom Brady five hundred career touchdown passes meanwhile I mean you look at the interceptions Tom Brady shown in his career with the chewy through today's only at a hundred and sixty six interceptions in his career\nFive hundred touchdowns a hundred and sixty six interceptions that's an unbelievable ratio he used to go he is he really is but\nHe's not credible as far as Fox is concerned to put them on the uh Boston Mount Rushmore she's crazy [laughter] stiffed better carve out a new a new area of them said to hire new workers to uh put together a fifth space on their outlet wanna yeah they don't want to offend anybody\nKnow but that's amazing I mean you think about that you know ... Drew Brees is throwing more pigs\nBrett Farr through a ton of picks Peyton Manning did throw a lot of career picks the next guy is you know Aaron Rodgers we talk about his greatness ripe he's thirty four years old Shawn he used to three hundred and twenty maybe he's not a hundred and eighty to to get the five hundred I mean that's another\nSet for what three years right yeah and another six years look back at that ... three years he's had three years or do you think\nAaron Rodgers has a hundred and eighty more touchdown passes and them\nYesterday for stealing thirty five years or in the December British forty doesn't doesn't mean everybody can do it\nEvery day now he's thirty dollars will be thirty seven to look at it right he's falling apart Rob is used as good as any of those guys can do you never was well here's the statistics show I like this so three hundred and twenty ... passing touchdowns ran Rogers right yep Seventy nine interceptions that the\nSuppressive Seventy nicely to hundred and fifty three games he's only throwing Seventy nine intercepts\nIt's incredibly that's average is like a year he has been thrown double digit interceptions since two thousand and ten\nUnbelievably ads consistency when guys like him are Brady throw the football as a fan you don't hold your breath to go on I Hope it lands in the right teams hands right well I remember watching jak games and be a Gino Smith or Mark Sanchez or Ryan Fitzpatrick\nThen right now Sam Donald ... rookie but ... every time they go back and not balls and they aren't going it's fifty fifty that ball may end up in a jets hand or I might end up in the hands of the opponents\nThey're probably the same way right now and he'll get like Josh Allen watching those games\n[laughter] show\nWe already has a long way to go but yeah yeah you're right no it's true\nIt's true it's incredible so congratulations to Tom Brady five hundred touchdown club only the third quarter back in history to do it Drew Brees will join them by an Israeli as this we will we get to six hundred ...\nNo no no\nI think right now so he's forty five [laughter] [noise] I Can't see him playing till he's forty five although people think he will does he get the five hundred and thirty nine and tie Peyton Manning well look he still has what a loving games this year he still has probably\nTwenty five for touchdowns this year right above five twenty five so definitely play next year Tom Brady we'll have\nMore touchdown passes and Peyton Manning was all said and done the question is does Drew Brees last longer than Tom Brady and those Drew Brees takeover that\nFrom Tom Brady and Drew Brees could end up with every single NFL passing record he's got one of the most completion he is who he is he the most yards or if he's not he's with no yes he is now the most passing yards if not he's within one game or so of doing that\nHe's had four hundred and Ninety six touchdowns in he you know he's going to throw a ... you know I mean he'll pass Peyton Manning the questions as he passed Tom Brady that's that's kind of a fun thing if you think about it although breeze and you know present Brady of never being compared to each other right as always manning in and break because they would actually play against each other\nBut in terms of being prolific quarterbacks\nYou know brainy and brief should be kind of a rivalry right now because her neck and neck in so many categories\nRight five or ... or yeah they just they haven't had the tools that manning and free\nThey've never had the tools but people always talk about you know Bryce Harper and Mike Trout they don't have any dogs because they each plane a different league\nFor the fact is you kind of looked the two of them because you know they're both young they're both obviously talented they both want MVPs at a young age\nPresent day and in ... in the record books their neck and neck on everything I mean ... what three thousand yard shy of breeze\nHe's now for touchdowns ahead a breeze that's going to go back and forth as by game by game right we might have a five touchdown game Brady might have a four touchdown game and freeze my throat to bring my throat three it's going to like keep changing throughout the course of the season and really the course of their careers however much longer both guys want to play but here's the difference\nTom Brady says he wants to play the forty five and he might\nDrew Brees place so many games indoors he plays games at home indoors he plays in Atlanta right that's I guess that's retractable roof so James he's going to play an indoor game there he also plays in a warmer environment Tampa Bay he plays in a warmer environment in in Carolina\nMeanwhile Brady has got to play at a you know a buffalo he's got to play now does it play Miami one while you're ...\nYou know what you know what the difference is ready to fight against awful choice\nThat's right and understand why you see a guy that is true and never mind the ... and you know the ... district [laughter] like Caroline defense raise operate in the buffalo trace the [laughter] All right so here's a trade off\nOn this is what you got away do you what's a better advantage playing at least nine games a year in a dome\nOr playing the jets and the bills four times a year [laughter] better and better and stuff we play the jet those words ... a year [laughter] unfortunately the bills and then as I say it's not a jets fan I mean the ownership of the division by\nTom Brady is just it's stunning it is utterly study the ownership of that division they shouldn't even be held the FCC just because the patriots division\nThrough what it should be it's amazing how every team now sets up for life after Brady like the jets bills drafted quarterbacks for two reasons one they need one but two\nYeah it was what eight to one after foreign I don't even want to remember that tend to three it was the final score of that game so Damon ... you'll hear that coming up about Fifteen minutes [noise] All right you know what\nRichard Richard certain brought up something\nAnd this is what he said quote this is what the league wanted they want record passing numbers you've got an average quarterback the average quarterbacks past ratings like Ninety two and they used to be hall of fame numbers and now it's not hall of fame numbers that\nYou can't touch him you can't tackle them you can't hit them high can't hit a blow\nYou can't knock him down to the ground heart all of that you can't hit the receiver to why you can't hit him too low you can't push your barely precedent it's making it really difficult on teams combat it 'cause every role in the book is designed to make sure you don't get them stopped\nHe said quote they're just trying to make it impossible for guys to play defense it's an interesting league we play him\nHere's the thing Richard Sherman is one hundred and ten percent correct he is more than correct the NFL has made it impossible to try to stop the quarterback look at how many quarterbacks right now\nOn pace to challenge Peyton Manning single season passing record either for fifty four hundred and Seventy seven yards of two thousand and Thirteen right now robbers burger GOP cousin's car\nAll right now ahead of the pace\nMet Ryan is literally Thirteen yard shy of the pace Joe flat goes on pace over four thousand yards short Watson's hovering over five thousand five thousand yards all these guys panel homes is well over forty five hundred yards in terms of predictability said with the dog\nAnd I don't have a problem with it to be honest with you on to me\nI like it NFL where there is scoring\nI like the NFL where there is a lot of passing who did enjoy watching the running shoot off that's right who doesn't enjoy watching funding gun football in the college ranks no offense there's nothing more boring than the Tennessee Titans beating the Jacksonville Jaguars two weeks ago nine to six\nTo six give me a break Tate my eye leaves open to watch that nonsense it's like a clockwork orange where they're forcing him to watch all these videos by\nHaving two doctors on each side putting vice dean and his eyes while they haven't taped open a death row\nBorder I played ... planet hall of fame level now three hundred and eighty a yard against the jets last week I don't want to do so he's a hundred percent correct Richard Sherman in saying that you have like go below average quarterbacks now planet hall of fame level I [laughter]\nIt's it's it's a joke it's it's a real joke there there is that does the defense no league anymore it's just too easy to score\nI don't like it has to be some kind of balance to it you know I'm saying I don't want to nine six game but that's to be some some balance here's the thing you\nDon't want to nine and six game and you don't want him out and you have any body yeah but you don't want your quarterback knock you out during the season because at that point you might as well as your season see I'm they can't because\nThey waited so haven't haven't so rely on the quarterback that now if the quarterback does get knocked out no nor such football anymore that's also watch anymore you know the old way to manage it shouldn't be all about one position that's that's what you look\nFor you know what though that one position controls the football more than anybody that one position while it was it that way if they changed the rules and didn't make it so that it it it it it it's um advantageous to pass the ball on twenty\nFour quarterbacks right now have quarterback ratings of Ninety and above its joke Derek car is points three points away from making twenty five okay that's incredible what was wrong with the football that we grow up on tell me\nI never had a problem with it too violent I guess what they're going to say\nToo violent I loved kickoffs\nLoved the great quarterbacks sack I loved that hit on the sideline where you could actually hear it in the stands go ooh All right that's the full we grew up on guys like Lawrence Taylor today would get flagged three times the game\nWell hype this then Dan Parker forget about that ... I get that so I got it right why not just um changed the rule where defensive backs they could touch you put you right away\n... ... what is it ten yards now you have to ... you can't touch receiver for ten years was a tense was it was it step Seventy four five for five or [noise]\nYou could you could make rules to favor the defense you know to balance it out I mean it's it's too far or the other way right now it's too much on the offensive side yeah\nIt really is too much of the office of ... that that the one thing that always bothers me is the fact that every time the ball goes up and there's contact\nNine and a half out of ten times they will call it on the defensive player false sense of players can get away with murder right now when it comes to you know contact with defensive players\nAnd I think what the league has realized is look at it and maybe the popularity and growth of college football kind of helped with is is that people enjoy that people want to see often people want to see end zone celebrations right people want to see the personalities of the personality comes out when when a guy scores the touchdown\nAnd I think the NFL is kind of playing to his audience because they think that's what the audience once they won't hire you\nThey wanted then often they don't want hockey they don't want soccer heck they barely want baseball in the sense of me or you could love one nothing pitching dual between Justin Vernon lander and a ... and ... but I think a lot of people outside of the true fans like your me would hate to see a well nothing baseball game to go it's too boring I'm not watching it\nAnd I began about saying hey we don't want those faiths I think our products as boring\nAs those basketball right they've opened it up a lot more as well off ... I think they also don't want to be afflicted with the same problem\nWhich is fan saying wow it's too slowly boring like hockey and baseball so yes I'll say screw it we're going to the complete opposite direction let's open it up score fifty points a game that's what the audience wants and they're getting it\nRight I I agree but but you can is the rule that we were talking about what a defensive back in touch a wide receiver or tied in with within five yards then after that it's illegal contact right\nHome why don't make a ten years you could there's rules that they could adjust to I guess turn you know balance out the the offices and defense it's just too too far or the other way\nTo the office I don't like it now it is definitely too far the other way it's gotten to the point where it's clear let me Joe I had a great level this year Joe flannel taco\nHe's playing real level right way to get rid of a button and now all of a sudden he's got again by ready for this Shawn joke wackos on pace for five thousand yards past any foreign wasted hours and correct right\nHas it once I had four thousand one format an eight or something yeah he is on pace also you're right it was four thousand four thousand three hundred and Seventeen Yard's not so that's all he's also on pace free completion percentage of sixty four points range what he's done the last three\nHe's on pace for thirty two touchdowns eight intercept\nA guy who was by the way in his career two hundred and eight touchdowns a hundred and thirty two interceptions not even two to one\nYeah it has gotten this far have Richard Sherman I usually don't agree with his mouth he's a hundred percent correct we talked about men are Yankee Red Sox get it going at Fenway Park that later today Johnny Damon play for both the van that great two thousand and four series joins me back then for send me see sports\nRadio cash them morning magazine with Carla he'll be Tuesdays through Fridays at ten AM here on central Wisconsin twenty four hour information station am Thirteen twenty WFL drawn you were NBC Sports radio lifting\nGame on goes to the Dodgers in L.

don't know me it's probably because I'm not famous but I did start screaming company called Harris the idea for Harry's came out of a frustrating experience I had buying razor blades most brands were overpriced over designed and out of touch at Harry's or approaches simple here's our secret\nWe make sharp terrible blades and sell them at honest prices for as low as two dollars each we care about quality so much that we do some crazy things like by world class German blade factory obsessing over every detail means we're confident in offering a hundred percent quality guarantee millions have guys have already made the switch to Harry's so thank you if you're one of them\nAnd if you're not we hope you give us a try with the special offer get Harry starters that with a five blade razor waited handle shaved Joe and the travel cover all for just three bucks plus free shipping\nYeah yeah I think after we I'm On the second game in Boston when a\nA David drove me in with a a blueprint as center field I mean now it's through the two and then we have shelling hundred amounts game six\nAnd a you know game seven we had that experience from the year before and uh we weren't going to be denied I mean we we caught fire at the right time and that's a\nThat's the reason why we were able to close it out of the clothes that are convincingly um you know all of a sudden the Yankee haters just\nFell silent or I was playing set a bill that just seemed like\nThey were missing every single pitch you know there was a lot of pressure and at these games are pressure field and uh\nSo it's going to be very interesting come tomorrow night I'm not sure I can stay up the entire time any more I remember those games [laughter] done um after one AM so many times so uh my bad times a lot earlier now [laughter]\nSo it's game seven at Yankee Stadium\nThat grand slam in in the second inning and Europe six nothing at that point could you rest a little did we guys like oh my goodness I Can't believe that we're up six nothing through two innings here\nComing back three games momentum squarely on our side at this point it was their moment in that game where it's like we've done it I mean did you have to wait all the way music tend to three final but was there a point there maybe it was eight to one in the fourth you guys are like\nLook what's happening you know ... that grand slam by down he was such a killer for the Yankees and that was that dagger at that point did you did you know you had it\nNo no I mean when I um rented around the bases I mean there is no small on my face because I remember what happened a year before and\nYou know after the second home run I hit the following ending or two um you know you start feeling a little more confident but\nIt's the Yankees I mean they are a star star studded every single place they they have that winning mentality so um I I was not going to be happy until the final a pitch was thrown\nYou ... your Korea plated seven different locations but Yankees Red Sox have that law or they have that or ah what's it like to play in a playoff game Yankees Red Sox is it a different field and playing anybody else\nAbsolutely I mean I'll be aligned to you if a\nIf not but um you know there's so much um energy around the ballpark the fans are excited the media's excited I'm the players are I mean this is a uh what's your dream about I mean the biggest bribery and sports and um it's\nAnd it's back after fourteen years it's a it's going to be very exciting and it's it's all new new faces so uh um [noise]\nI Can't wait to see what happens and you know unfortunately whoever wins this game does that or when's the series does that go to the world series like we had before but uh I'm I'm sure there's going to be a lot of a fire part\n... or ... years ago and fly right you're right but you know it's been fourteen years Johnny since we've had this and that we have not had Yankees Red Sox in the postseason since\n[laughter] no I cannot believe that and you know when two thousand nine when I was with the Yankees I\nUm Boston was a team that I thought we were going to face because they always beat Anaheim I'm In the playoffs and that was the year that Anaheim Scalia I'm ... I finally won so uh um I thought for sure we were going to get them back and\nI'm not sure how how the pressure whether or how it would have handled that pressure\nOn you know so it's a very exciting but I'm sure I was hit a grand ... snow [laughter] pay back [laughter]\nThe gray Johnny Damon joining us going deep into words but NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com\nYou know obviously you're a baseball fan Johnny you played this more for a long time but how important is it for baseball and your mind having been a part of the series understanding the the legacy in in the in the rivalry but how important is it for baseball to have this happen right now\nOh it's very important I mean as you can see from the first couple of games to get a hundred and sixty three games of the season I mean they were amazing or you know baseball's heading into a no great\nPostseason right now I mean that um all these games have been um incredible um baseball needed this but you know now they could Yankee Red Sox so I uh it's going to be a great again so I just um\nYou know can't wait I Can't wait to watch this as a the best time of year for baseball and a Derek Jeter always ah when we got your job or they would start smelling around and when I was he doing he was like I ... I smell the postseason [laughter] you know\nA world championships so that's that's the kind of mentality that are ... to ... what the Yankees so he\nCannot wait till this time of year\nAs friendly as the guys you are Johnny when you you're wearing a Red Sox uniform playing the Yankees or vice versa and especially in the postseason match up\nHe's genuine hatred amongst the club I mean you hear about DiMaggio and and Ted Williams and that these teams hated each other back in the day all through from Babe Ruth being sold the Yankees\nWhen you play against him our friendships put to the side\nUm yeah I mean your job is to go out\nAnd was so everybody wants to win and I\nHate that expression how uh this guy hates losing well I think everyone hates them lose everyone wants to win but there was no hatred on my part I always respect as a way to ... play the game\nOr hit a ground ball to the second base but and they're obviously um and so that's the type of ballplayer that I was a I don't think too many people dislike\nMe or just like the way I play the game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to a um Thirteen twenty WIP char Wisconsin Rapids central

local\nPurchased my slices cause yeah that's how I roll I get more than one [noise]\nI open the box to put some\nPrinted she's\nOn my slices\nHistory no Scott he likes his grade and she's [noise]\nTennis I reached down and I started to sprinkle the greatest jeeze over my slices\nI realize I have just grabbed\nSlices doused with garlic I have not been able to get this garlic paste out of my mouth I use the little mouthwash rinse I have not been able to get it out of my mouth for easily in our\nGood thing is no vampires are going to bother me because I didn't bring it over time here on NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio doc I'm Nick that were happening you mess up your condiments\nKnow wherever he's never go to put like ketchup or something and you wind up outsourced by mistake because you know why why I don't use condiment\nNothing catch up ... or ... or nothing to do no salt pepper oregano gone out of that salt and pepper ... that that doesn't count\nWell I tried to put a little greater parmesan instead I got garlic\nThat's gotten a call now you got ...\nAnd what's just use that phrase all over that I forget who are going to talk about it all night right hey Indianapolis Colts you got garlic because you went into Fox burrow on a Thursday night thinking that you had a chance against Tom Brady and the patriots when in reality you got garlic\nNo chance the Colts were going to win this football game first of all Thursday Night Football is incredibly difficult for the road deems codes coming up coming in banged up as well as as it is no tea wide open in this game\nIt's a short week Tom Brady in the patriots are home they have the advantage they play well Fox for oh Tom Brady in history against the Indianapolis Colts is meant to be messed with and he was on a mission to get his five hundred career touchdown pass\nThe ... the odds that Tom Brady was going to throw for three touchdown passes\nE you could've you could've told me any number and I would have just given to you of course he was going to throw three touchdown passes and the game he was on a mission to get number five hundred\nAnd it's exactly what he did\nNumber five hundred for the future hall of famer the third quarter back to reach five hundred career touchdown passes\nPeyton Manning's got the most five thirty nine Brett Farr five oh wait\nDrew Brees he'll get it soon because he's almost at five hundred but when it's all said and done ... he's going to have more than Peyton Manning and I think the breeze not going to retire until he eclipse is that five hundred and thirty nine mark so he's got thirty nine he's got forty more to go\nNot going to get this season but hey I'm I don't know I Can't say that I'm pretty might do it no not going to get this season but he boys none of the year he's easily going to get patriots dominated this one start to finish defense away they shut down the colds and the first half\nLimited Andrew looked absolutely nothing to pick them off and ... it was\nEvery body contributing Sony Michel had a good game just barely barely missed back to back hundred yards name she had ... yards\nHe could have got it by the way and I wonder like I I Would love to find out what was the thinking here\nAnd there was a third downplay late in the fourth quarter\nThe patch had the ball and Michelle was taken out of the game right after he had that run to get them to Ninety eight yards they could have just hitting the ball off to him and let them get a hundred yards but instead they did a past that one incomplete they had the ... with like three minutes left it's very uh\nInteresting little side nugget there but I'm a show like Ninety eight yards and that I'm thirty four yard touchdown James White is becoming ... if not if he wasn't already be most dynamic player on the patriots team\nSeventy seven yards and a touchdown Bronx six Seventy five yards Edelman and his first came back from suspension and its first came back from injury you know the miss time last year seven cats just fifty seven yards and Josh Gordon just to to catch is\nBut the one who was the thirty four yard touchdown for ... five hundred\nCareer touchdown pass just an all around solid performance from the New England patriots who we talked about it after their week for victory over the dolphins are about to get right\nAnd now\nThey face their toughest opponents to date the Kansas City chiefs but that game\nSunday Night Football in Fox borrow\nThe pats basically eleven days to prepare for this Kansas City chiefs team it's a mini by because you're not just playing on one o'clock on Sunday you're playing on Sunday night and the chiefs have a heck of a game this weekend against the Jacksonville Jaguars\nThe chief could very well lose this weekend against the jags and then you have a chief steam coming up against the law and a game that really took a lot out of them because the jags aren't extremely physical team\nAnd now they go into ... and you get a wound to the animal and all in all of a sudden patriots now roll up on the chief's\nBoth teams become foreign too\nAnd now it's not the cheapest to convince the patriots were once again the door wings of the AFC eight five five three two three four and received eight five five three two three four six to do\nAll the patriots still the class of the AFC\nAre you ready for somebody else to take that mantle whether it's the Kansas City chiefs or maybe the chargers maybe the jaguars how about the titans\nCould do Raymond's be that team\nOr when it's all said and done we'd be looking up at the patriots once again or the patriots steel door wings of the a ... eight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six to do\nWe will hear from Tom Brady\nRomney milestone evening we'll hear from Bill Bill a check as well although what's what's the boats are going to those ... Tom Brady during touchdown pass and I was a really good touchdown pass in a way to focus in on the Kansas City chiefs\nThat's pretty much just did it we don't know what I just did the entire thing\nThat's what he's going to type plus we have a special show here\nMember neck yesterday I had and teased out that we could have some surprise guests on the programs and I ... well they are confirmed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chief thing to do nothing in the playoffs a and then another point is we can go into Fox borough because we've done it twice and and beat up on braiding but at least not during the playoffs for regular season we can do it\nUh you know ... it's great plans against Brady and his thinking done it doesn't really work against us because we're better\nBy getting torched than we are you know we're here to defend in the day and conduct but getting torched you know that happens regular uh but on that no man I like listening to you in a really appreciates call\nWent back for the call their jak you know you're right about the chief this year that they could be a different animal because this is a different football team this isn't your typical Andy Reid team that's going to be good to be well prepared but they're going to fizzle out at the end of the year like Andy Reid teams usually do in ... the special quarterback\nAnd you you kind of knew that going into the season\nWhen they got rid of Alex Smith and decided to go with ... homes before you really saw homes as the starting quarterback yeah to think that endearing clearly saw something special and read you know he's like the quarterback wish for this guy has worked with some of the greatest quarterbacks ever play this game\nHe saw something in homes\nThat he was salivating over\nSo they decided to pass the torch on to him and look at what he's done in the early part of the season I think that was such a gutsy performance against the Denver Broncos I thought they were going to lose that game I pick them to lose that game before when we were doing our selections\nAnd I think that that show was old that wind showed a lot about who this Kansas City chiefs team is and this weekend against the Jacksonville Jaguars you will get a no other indication of foods is Kansas City chiefs team is\nAnd this is truly going to be a different era for them a special year for them that when this football game on Sunday\nEight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six due to Alan calling from Honolulu what's going on down\nThey pay a little hot spot you know this is Tom Brady thing you know there's a lot of pros and cons um or that guy and what I admire about ... to ... on on held that drop it\nAnd you know the president has a lot of prayer at play where\nAnd look what he's done\nWell yeah I mean with with the exception of Randy Moss and guess Rob Gronkowski now but\nBefore the Bronx era it was really the couple of years that he had what Randy Moss besides that there wasn't really a more key wide receiver that he played with we're talking about the west walkers tea on branches of the world you know David [noise] these are the guys who he he won with the guys that he turned into elite players\nAnd now it's Julian Edelman and Rob Bryn ... who\nHe is turning into all time greats\nAbsolutely I mean and I admire that from him you know all Americans like underdog and rags to riches story so to speak about what I resent out here they're number one the\nRule number ...\n... ... you know I'm I I'm a fan you know that ... you know I Am not a big raider fan but um you know what I don't but at the bottom is that you know ... golden boy for awhile guy for a walk in the ban then right\nThey never change the rule that very often when he's coming up we'll start got hurt my like when Tom Brady got hurt that very often the than the things that will benefit of low\nYeah I don't think they made the ... yes the Tom Brady rule is because the ... going lowering the quarterback is called the Tom Brady role because they made the role after that happened to break yes you're right Alan exit\nExactly and if I'm not mistaken correct me if I stay off course work they don't want that lobby the NFL a couple of years before the break but for me to handle their own game ball\nThere's I'm not going to get into all deflate gate soggy here out I appreciate the phone call us what you want to start talking about quarterbacks merits or we can compare Brady to to Ben Roethlisberger all we want you know I don't think Brady had any\nA motorcycle accidents or incidents with ladies and restrooms are so uh you know we don't want to start going down a moral\nHigh ground with Tom Brady versus other quarterbacks in the NFL let's just acknowledge the greatness year\nThe guy is one of the best quarterbacks of all time just there was five hundred touchdown pass something only two other players have done before and lead history and\nIt's about to be three countries will do it this season as well and he's thrown a touchdown\nPass through an NFL record Seventy one\nDifferent players\nTo me that's just absolutely\nFor NBC it's eight five five

and it can be the last four\nI'm personally a as I was still a college coach today our tried to hold a really really good freshmen employer\nIf we felt like he would stay four more years\nIf we Richard and I'm I mean looking back we had a number one reprint last year at Florida after the Ninety One season so Danny Werfel and all those guys that we were able to read shared about ten or twelve of 'em they any waffle the highest in the winter and and so forth\nSo we've got four more years out of all those guys\nAnd a tune that as many players as you can have our thanks advantage for a team but are they all want to go pro early now and ah so it's hard to have a whole bunch of peer to your guest bathroom to rule in itself is good and I think a gas leave after four games uh I don't I don't know I think uh\nUh if they're if they really just feel like they're never going to play at that school and then uh you know maybe I understand wanting to have a red shirt here but uh anyway it's a it's a saw and heard Clinton has hurt Clemson and a ... ... their own a skill it's in that situation I think at this time\nTalking to the ball goes to the great barrier joining me has got sunburn on NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com let's talk about the more about the match up here in the swamp but what makes Gainesville such road game for opponents to come in [noise]\n[noise] well certainly a\nA year's I coached here and urban Meyer years the slump was a was a difficult place for an opponent\nCome get when uh the last several years\nI don't think it's been quite a strong I'm In a crowd has not been what they used to be either and they all want to you know they look for all the reasons that it's easy to sit home watching on TV and this that and you know but but they are going to all the other\nBallparks around the south and selling them up so we will have a full house here Saturday and the noise level will be way up there and create that home field advantage that we had back in those days and I think the reason the gators fans have not shown up that much recently is we we just haven't scored a lot of points\nOut we can win some close to the games and stuff like that but those fans want to see some really exciting they want to see a good pass game they want to see the home team score points and\nAnd and things of that nature but again Dan knowing his gas and we're off to a good start had little hiccup against Kentucky but were seen to be trained in the right direction and certainly LSU undefeated so it's a huge gain the SEC game of the week three thirty gang here Saturday\nHopefully the home field advantage will really care\nAbout that last uh Kentucky doesn't look so bad right now the way that they've been playing the season\n[noise] no it doesn't look bad at all when it happened people around here was saying um gosh who we're going to be for Kentucky well wait a minute maybe Kentucky is pretty good which we learn they are they're undefeated and all the way\nA very huge game with that I guess I play Georgia before we do but down the road a everybody's got to worry about this week I think Kentucky goes to Texas A M which would be a difficult game for the wild cats but anyway the gators we just need to worry about it last year or so the answer is being around\nThey come here two years in a row\nAnd I we had that hurricane two years ago and uh the LSU athletic director did more come here during the open day 'cause I played Alabama the next week\nSo I said okay we'll go to your place and then you guys come to our place two years in a row so this is the second era rather coming here are honestly they won the game here and we won the game at Baton Rouge\nSo sometimes at home field advantage maybe it's not all this is an important as we make it out to be but um anyway shouldn't be for game here Saturday\nShould be working bands go for more information about this a wager between you and coach less miles\n[noise] okay that's a dirty a television right\nNow there's a a a a website I don't I don't have it in front of me right\nNow but it's that's a line that says well right\nCurrent seconds yeah those occasion is definitely the

I I to me I I like uh the uh what uh\nSherman what they've land is added to this team but this is this just become a team that can literally by against any\nYou know you talk about how well they are defensively and you mentioned Joe borrow a quarterback I think a big difference would this team has been what ... done at the running back position because I I'm an old school football guy coach you not\nTo set up your entire often and I've been impressed with the way that that was you this season has been able to run to set up that pass\nDon't question and it never miss watching you know if there's nothing he can run into nothing even learned that you can be smashed\nBut if there's a break if there's a cut that the food that's for sure and they push a broom ball into a into a position\nPlan is foot and go back plans foot and go forward plans foot go straight ahead and and that is just what you want he doesn't miss a cook and uh I I agree with you I think there's a I think it was enough talent there that are making lining up and play against anybody [noise]\n...

it maybe this is the week that LSU turns into a pumpkin I I've always said I don't agree with them being ranked as the fifth best team in the country I Know there are good I I Know they have any talent up and down the roster but\nGive me the whole underdog I'm a sucker for home dogs gimme Florida plus the two and a half points if you can buy up to three so you get that field goal protection

become like I said quote unquote the feature back I think the the really interesting one of my favorite Bill Belichick stances of all of his years as a coach in the national football league going all the way back to Cleveland he's never had a back rush for a thousand yards in back to back seasons and so that gives you some idea\nOf how he treats the quarter or I'm Sorry how we treat the running back position but yeah the show was a guy who I think continues to move in the right direction I think that there were some struggle for the first two games are turtles are the first two weeks\nUm he didn't run as well as maybe he probably could have or should have at times against Jacksonville in Detroit but the last two games you really start to come on\nHe's really started to hit that holder things he needs to do a little bit better I'm One of the things that stands out for me is he needs to do a better job of making something out of nothing but what we've seen from him so far\nI can certainly you you certainly get the feeling that that's going to come with time you know you're talking about a guy who still in the first half of his first year in the NFL so I think that kind of thing comes with time we better field vision with more experience in the late but yeah he's all through an awful could start at least over the last two games\nCan you write a better recipe\nFor the patriots or better preparation plans in the patriots\nTo take on the Kansas City chiefs red hot Kansas City chiefs and then having eleven days basically to breast and prepare for them and had the chiefs come often games to two games in a row against the Denver Broncos in the Jacksonville Jaguars this team's going to be so banged up when they come face the bats and Fox wrote I drink it might not be the same team\nYou know it and I'm Glad you bring that up Scott because it's been interesting to see this scheduled tonight to represent at the last game of three games in twelve days for the patriots and when you consider that can then sort of convince schedule\nIt can be awful tough to kinda get up for these games and kind of you know into the bell and now I I Know everyone has to do it and you know but when you consider that you know they have the cheese coming up that I think it's going to be a little bit more of a challenge but yeah I think that when you consider the fact that they had to play the Colts\nOn her shirt week but the gold completed overtime game a week before in the cold tend to come in here so they had an incredibly short we to prepare with a an incredibly lost her and then on the back into that as you mentioned\nThey have the chiefs coming in after ten or eleven days you know lay off it's certainly sets up really well for the Patriot this patriots email after that chief's game they have a really interesting is scheduled they have the bears\nA they have the Packers so they're going to be some challenges they give them tell really into the cheapest is scheduled but yeah in terms of days off and in terms of extra preparation time\nThey're going to need it but it's certainly like I said it it sets up really well for them going into this Kansas City\nYeah I'll tell you what game I'm looking forward to it at the game in Tennessee against Mike ... who we talked about before and the titans ... I think we are all not respecting the titans enough for what they've done so far this season they're only loss was that seven and a half hour game in Miami that got delayed with the lightning and thunder storms\nWill it's going to be New England versus knowing themselves in that when you add up all the different levels\nBecause you know you have the patriots and you have to weigh it their way of doing things Brady and ... and high tower and then you know all over the all all of those often to store all that often to the end defensive stars and then they're going down to face Mike rebel\nAnd Malcolm Butler in Logan Ryan Indiana Louis so all guys who made their bones as members of the New England patriots over the years so yeah it's going to be an awful lot of fun I I'm I'm with you I I really like that and it's a game but like we said before\nThis is the patriots thing the schedule gets a little dicey or it's going to be interesting to see how they respond to see if they have what it takes to be able to take things to another level going forward\nWell let me ask you the question I've been asking the audience here tonight uh or the patch steal the darling of the AFC\nYeah I I think so right now I mean you know they're they're part of a group I Would put Kansas City in their output Jacksonville and they're um you know maybe Baltimore and I think it's ... yeah he is able to kind of right the ship one's living on ballot comes back I think they are part of that conversation as well but you know\nThere aren't that short list I I always say this that you know really the bottom line for this team is every single year they go into it\nAt the very least barrier there a final four team and I think we've talked about this before this is a team that to me you know you can pretty much book um for the conference championship ever even in a down here on many differences\nDo they have enough to be able to get over that doctor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been quite what we're used to but you got a fantastic work ethic\nThank you and I'm impressed by how you carry yourself so

something completely different today but I really have no choice because I saw something that went on a graphic that I saw by the way when it came down to watching this a patriot coal Thursday night game or something that I don't really understand\nThe mount Rushmore of Boston athletes was put on\nThey had bill Russell they had Larry Bird they had of course I'm\nBobby or and they had Ted Williams\nAnd what they ended up doing was they decided at that point to put Tom Brady as the fifth member of the Boston\nOr they may be the fifth member of the Boston Mount Rushmore\nAnd first of all I'm thinking to myself you can't have a fifth member of a Mount Rushmore there's only fight for face is allowed on Mount Rushmore you can't have that fifth face\nSo like the whole point is you can cheat and say we're going to add a fifth ... face and there'll be Tom Brady\nAnd that's going to be our Mount Rushmore so now we have our selves the patriots Tom Brady there we have ourselves to Celtics Larry Bird and Robert ... and and of course bill Russell will have or you know Boston Bruins Bobby or we'll have a Red Sox and Ted Williams\nNo it doesn't work that way\nSo it came down to that says I'm watching this in my body temperature is rising because I'm getting madder and madder because I'm like there's this cheating you don't just get the ad Tom Brady and not take somebody off if you're going to ask Tom Brady you got to take somebody off the list right you got to keep it for\nBecause next it's going to be a big Papi now live up Mount Rushmore six well once clubs you know climate gets in the hall of fame and no one gives a hoot about steroids because we put you know big Papi on the mount Rushmore wife seven\nAnd then we'll put Kyrie Irving what his career is over that would be not quite so why do you draw the line you draw the line if you get a call your Mount Rushmore of athletes with the city of Boston you gotta stop before because that's how many presidents are on Mount Rushmore so this is what I've determines if you're gonna put Tom Brady\nOn the Boston Mount Rushmore by the way\nHe deserved to be there now for how many years right how many years has been were Tom Brady already deserves to be on the mount Rushmore of Boston athletes so I'm going to put Tom Brady there and that makes me have to take somebody out the beauty of Boston is it safe for

Marcello sooner trading Christian yellowish olive twenty six years old a five year fifty eight million dollar contract that will be the start of the real downfall for Derek Jeter\nThe return he got back Lewis brings in and you know minor league guys like yeah I'm a mode oh and\nUh I said D. as in uh some guy named Coleman is going to turn out to be one of those like Christian Bale trade although you know\n... he's going to have Tommy John he's gonna miss next year I mean the guy has a shot to be pretty good as a pitcher the fact is I mean this deals ... where fire where this might be one of the great deals in the last ten years because I don't see any of those ... guys turning into anything spectacular while Christian yell at you as\nA superstar so today of course yeah which gets the off and going to run home run the third inning\nAnd that is all brewers pitching right I mean up bullpen and the whole game was pitch by the bullpen and they got through it they get to the ninth inning and at that point Jeremy Jeffress just blows it right I mean he implodes three hits gives up two runs in that ending it to to go the extra innings\nAdam Vito who's been so good for the Colorado Rockies\nHe pitches warning comes in the next one and there's a sequence there and he's you know he's he's\nHe's won a secondary type of guy in terms of the strength of his pitching yet what is that he threw a shoulder to Christian yellowish four straight fat stocky he's not very fast yup yup\nBut what is he doing if you have Christian yell at you and scoring position who of course gets on base and scores the winning run I mean would you have it would you write the script any other way\nAnd yet when you're breaking balls are better than your fast balls and that's been you go to pitch Michael stock is can hit\nAnd just thrown for fast balls in that situation the tenth inning\nAdds to me it's strange like you you you have stabbing reports on guys right you know what your strengths are like if you go down and you're going to fail fill with your better pitchers not with for fast balls they got burned stock is driving the winning run Miller Parker robs and the ... just like that\nThe five and you wonder just fatigue into playing a factor how many ... games in Colorado really player right incredible to me unbelievable Sean but what a game and it was oh well no I I think I did\nThe Rockies almost don't want this\nMilwaukee had that they're at home right they have the crowd and on their side dropped to nothing in the night\nAnd the Rockies came alive and and if the if the Iraqis had won that game I think momentum would've I would've favored the Rockies going forward obviously the five game series so yeah that's a big swing but I I don't know about you but coming in to the series I was favoring the brewers probably Seventy to thirty percent I thought they would win that when the series\nYou know what I read I don't think so and I I think you probably saw this as well but the wildcard team\nMore than fifty percent of the time when the series\nAnd you wonder the lay off of the team that wins the division it has the best record\nIs it worse to have that lay off or keep playing like the wildcard team who wins a thrilling game whoever it is and whatever it is against whomever it is right and then you go in with the momentum in the Rockies as you said almost stole that game and Milwaukee who's bullpen has been so great almost\nBlew that game so you kinda wonder is it better I mean a lot of Iraqis are far from being out of it at this point you know this is crappy team that has shown unbelievable resilience is the team that was able to you know ... you know to to do what they've been able to do to get to this point Shawn they want nine games down the stretch that just a handful to go\nGet a lot of credit I don't think they are out by any stretch\nOf imagination no they're not but do you like the five game series would you prefer to see him illegal

Kevin to rent the whispers as to where the Golden State warriors may end up after he will inevitably opt out of his deal in a year what's the latest Jimmy bought her a lot of talk to get into our buddy Kurt hew and pro basketball talk and NBC Sports dot com joining us in current let's get to the reality before you get to the\nFun hypothetical and that is of course Jimmy Butler are you of the mindset here Kurt that\nTom sip it set the price so high\nFor Jimmy Butler that it's fairly unreachable for anybody in the NBA because of course he doesn't want to lose a guy but yet he has to at least show Glenn Taylor the owner that he's attempting to trade the disgruntled star\nOh I I think what was the least the problem is that it gets more chipper do than Glenn Taylor who's kind of reached upset like let's get this done I don't want this distraction I'm\nWhat I've heard from sources is kind of what you just said which is that the bar keeps moving there's not a lot of traction um they're asking for a lot and that's um you know what they were making some progress with Miami this week at the bar move together and they want something else and it's just\nEvery time that happens and I still there there's a there's a large segment of people who still think to those things I can just get them all in a room and play basketball do you know\nAsk about will solve the problems with it it's not and they they're they're going to have to take a deal for him at some point but um but it was a win now guy coaching and ... for his job\nThat team isn't nearly as good I Would make the Josh Richardson deal if I were Miami ... if I were Minnesota I should say like I get Josh Richardson it but he doesn't make you\nI think he's a better fit in some ways but he just doesn't give you the pop next season that that that that uh that butler does\nYeah but here's the other problem though and and look every team looks to try to\nYou know get rid of a bad contract when they're trading a story on and contract people talk about is Gordy dang and be forty eight million left on his deal I mean as anybody dumb enough to want to take that deal when they're going to have to pay Jimmy ball or a hundred Ninety million\nAnd that's where the thirteenth has to come in and it's it's it's Phoenix or probably Sacramento but now to make sect\nOn forty eight million by the way the ... going price for that is to first round ears and not the junkie first round like Houston has like take the first round or so um that that's the problem you're going to have to come up with assets to make that you'll see that and rebuild the team and they haven't come close yet so\nI don't know that they're going to be able to get that I think it you know if Miami can get Richardson aunts and I've been sort of get Richardson who say how people who don't know why people don't [noise]\nHe's a quality young three in the guy who was going to be a great kind of glue fit player on a really reasonable contract for a while like he's good at what towns and and like a play some of the defense inconsistency show up with a motor that weakens doesn't but\nYou know what is he better than butler right now no and I still do the deal because that's I don't think it's going to get any better I don't think they're going to move Jang I don't just I just don't see how they're going to pull any of the sauce\nAnd first of all current why why Miami for Jimmy ... why would want to go to Miami what did you see in Miami in terms of you for being Dwayne wade forty years old I'm not kidding they don't have a ton of young talent why would Miami believes that you could go when\nI that's a really good question I think that there is I honestly I think there's a cultural fit in that Miami is bigger on conditioning and and getting bodies ready than any hardly any organization and the league or they do rest guys I mean and that's really one of those concerns that's under wind ... butler teams getting in on this\nTeams are wary of that next contract with butler because he's got he's got to turn thirty before he signs it and he's got him into miles on it like there is there's a\nThere's a potential you know new well dang type a drop off his future during that next contracted it always seems a little bit um he's you know obviously the top ten player right now um but er top twelve at least depending on how you want to rank 'em but\nI where he is two years from now three years from now is another question that does concern team so it's yeah it is the whole situation is a mess right [laughter] I don't even know how to describe it other than that but really if anything's going to happen in the next\nFour or five days at least it's definitely with Miami there there's just no I haven't heard anything about anybody else in any serious way\nChatting with Kurt hew and pro basketball talking NBC Sports dot com here on going deep to enforcement NBC Sports radio let's get to the Kyrie Irving situation now of course he wasn't going to sign a long term deal\nThis off season I mean he just waits wander off season it's eighty million dollars more to stay in Boston but he came out today in front of a you know season ticket holders and kind of a Q A and he pretty much just said he's going to stay in Boston that in your mind just appeasing the fans or\nIs it that much better financially print the state or does he really just like Boston what are you hearing\nFirst off and his ... find it is financially better for him to stay the people he has another guy who's a Mac steal his max is fine you know once he becomes a free agent science backup is about five years one Ninety\nUm even if he leaves it's about four years one thirty nine so that's just as there is a lot of money on the table for him over the course of a contract to stay you'll probably do that [noise] um\nI I look things can never say never things can change but everything I've heard from other teams was like even yes the Knicks had interest and there's other teams are all like at least make a call but I don't know anybody who's seriously thought he was leaving like I don't know teams that really thought you know we got shot at him he's disgruntled\nI'm left with other ... unless if things went a little weird and then he got recruited by another star but you know Boston's gonna win a light came you gain a lot of games I mean there are the favorites to go to the finals out of the east they'd be might predict\nPick to come out of the east and the final I don't think he's leaving that you had the money and the chance to be part of that legacy and the fact that he likes the team and the coach I just I don't see him leaving on west some unexpected stuff happens\nDoes he see himself kind of his little brown and the sense of you know when the problem was on a team in the ... nice to have been so weak as of late\nThey are kind of the automatic teams go to the finals does he see himself as look Kyrie Irving is a superstar he knows who these young and as you just know that look I stay in Boston I have a nice supporting cast young talent Gordon Hayward openly stays healthy my goodness we can own the eastern conference for five years that looks at it but actually\nI I think that that factors into it I think that you look out there and the east and who else is there Toronto it was interesting this season with co why but how are they long term\nIt is a genuine threat but now they've got to find another guy whether that ends up being full and a couple of years if he'll still like Philly was there a lot of again a very good team but from contending they feel like they're a you're a player away I'm In or maybe they get somebody they've got a lot of money next summer two\nMinute

legacy that's the last place he should go [noise]\nHe's in a case where Kevin Durant fields because he's so sensitive that people are undermining the fact that he's won two rings\nThat he will probably win a third ring\nAnd it feels that for him to prove himself or his man\nHooters greatness he's got to go to a place like the next take them out of the dumps and be the reason why be that anchor that leads them to the promised land to win the championship could that possibly be why you would consider the next because let's face it\nIn terms of wanting to win and Kevin Durant is what like thirty twenty nine Thirty years old he's getting up there\nI don't think that that's going to win anything for a couple more years at least I don't know if the next want to go for thirty thirty one year old Kevin Iran's as a guy that they're going to try to put in there to try to lead them to victory maybe me Dram probably as are the three or four good years left at least\nBut I just don't think his legacy it makes sense go really what brought me people are ready look at you as a guy that's going to go chase rings with other great players you went with Steph Curry in Golden State just go to the Lakers and try to win with when when one with LeBron James at this point no one's going to hold it against you why one day they already hold it against you is not going to change anything Sean\n... isn't that exactly why he would go to New York Kevin direct for legacy purposes because he wants to go somewhere\nWhere they haven't won in a while and where the TV as an established and win a championship they'll do wonders for his leg is he going to LA joining with Ron that's not gonna help anything but here's the problem he's not going to want to New York\nI hate to say it I mean why not James Dolan okay I mean that's fair but the team is isn't bad PR zingers of healthy enough hell ten Fifteen player yeah but once you show these ... these incapable stay home and he just tours ACL people come back from that it's not the worst in the world\nGiven how much time to be missed before that it's not like this is the guy that was playing eighty two games a year if you look at ... and the number of games that he is actually played in his career\nIts stunningly low considering the fact that he's always heard I mean look at it his first year it's like Seventy two games but he was also a guy that you know playing less minutes but it's sixty six games forty eight games may not play a game this year we Kristof sports thing is just like Blake Griffin at this\nOh no way no he's not in terms of injuries but he missed those games last year because of the ACL the same injury that you're gonna miss this season\nPrice right out of concern that's just one injury what are the ... yeah well the year before that he must wasn't shoulder problems I think it was I mean you know he's had issues I mean ... ... are you kinda wonder it's seven three is that the reason why isn't that what a guy and\nA freak way that he toward that ACL those you know you're bringing out what the ... I think it was\nAnd it just gets to a point where you start to wonder if Chris stop sport seniors can stay healthy you put it next to Kevin do random Kevin Knox is the player that people think he may turn out to be the first round pick out a Kentucky\nThey have something brewing there there's a young talent as well to Marty junior is a very good player you know Frank Miller Keenan there's still high expectations for me he's all Twenty years old right now there's expectations but\nIf Kevin trains going there thinking yeah me and ... will cross your fingers and uh you know make a prayer because the fact is\nYou're going to need to help the poor thing is to win if you're Kevin right because you're still seen as a team right\nYou're still not better than Boston mean Toronto is going to be different I don't know quite Leonard sticks around in Toronto after this year but I just think that for him the pressures of New Yorker also an issue I don't think he can handle the pressures of New York Kevin ... to me is not mentally built and doesn't have the mentality to survive New York fans and the New York ...\nBig problem Sean\nI agree but I mean why would you leave Golden State I don't see well we know why for like I say\nThat there's wires right but at this point who cares at this point just adds a legacy and went five six rings\nAnd then when it's judgment day and people go well Kevin Durant how great was the\nWell guess what Kevin to rent one six rings but he has to go follow Steph Curry all the brawn James joined Dwayne wade had their buddy Chris Bosh had joined them as well and even when he went back to Cleveland says if LeBron James joined a team of no talent no that Kyrie Irving a superstar and they brought over Kevin Love is still a talented team\nI just you know accounted yeah of course was talented by Kevin Love was diminished\nHe was a superstar\nBut still I mean it's not a you know cells\nThat the shortage if they didn't have any talent and you know Ron James find someone yeah with Rajiv did in the sense of\nThe games he had his ability but overall LeBron James frankly did that help in the form of great players besides says you're not winning and the thing without great players I thinking of rape players Tom Brady doesn't again the patriots shown up showing why this is the best for me the sports radio [noise]\nHey this is Dave Ramsey and

here's what you have to weigh is Tom Brady so far superior to Blake portals the vet the defensive weaknesses or the patriots compared the defensive strengths of Jacksonville\nOut see what I'm saying does the differential between Brady and morals make up for the differential between Jacksonville defense and the patriots defense here's the answer no\nI don't think so because you can win Super Bowls the crappy quarterback if you run the football and you have a great defense Jacksonville can run the football if for that can stay out in the jail is a pretty good number two and they have a great defense\nThe front of the defense the back of that defense their Assad is on the line back in ... amazing as well with Smith and and uh you know the kid from UCLA remember the second round peg was going to be high draft pick\nThe injury concerns he's turned out to be an absolute standard so I mean you know they they they they may have such a dominant defense mileage miles jak right I always\nMiles jak I always lose name back or jackets jak so to me no debate you are the best but you know what I'll take them over the Kansas City chiefs are you located at least for now\nI'll take the pay really Kansas City oh here's why did distressed in Kansas City huh do you believe in Andy Reid when no the going gets tough no but I don't want our homes I Believe about homes\nI Believe the homes are somewhat come back down to earth a bit more when have you read gets conservative with his coaching as he does as a season goes on and the games get more important and then you get to the playoffs and Andy Reid does something stupid o'clock management that's why I don't believe in them I Believe Nobel jak\nAnd and that's really it right those are the three teams in the AFC\nWho else is there brave enough to read one now are there for you since the ... fish but they're they're finished no come on I mean the ravens ... joke goes off to a great START I don't see it happening I I don't I really don't I mean one thing about ... Pittsburgh [laughter]\nThey're a mess although maybe a ... week seven you know what hold off on Pittsburgh until we see leave your belt three weeks back I mean we see lady on bell into week eleven\nLet's see how that often looks\nRight I mean that to me is the ultimate test so James Connors not levy on bell I think we understand that I think we realize that so then it comes down to this levy on bill comes back they bury the hatchet it frees up Antonio Brown I guess who's been invisible\nYou know there's still a dangerous team right offensively there are still dangerous do you believe in Pittsburgh defense though\nThat's that's a big question do you believe the fence you can you can't and that's why they're not a complete team\nSo the only team that's really a semblance of a complete team comes down to Jacksonville comes down to the patriots\nMaybe Kansas City I think it is a three team race than the AFC and I just don't trust Sandy Reid and I think when push comes to shove I I don't trust the patriots defense that got absolutely gash last year the super bowl I ... and the eagles right and\nThey got absolutely gosh they got demolished and I don't think there are better defense now so yeah I mean I think the second best team in the AFC but it's hard to bet against Brady it's hard to bet against ballot jak but I'm going to do it because I just think Jacksonville right now has more of the formula to win the big games down the stretch especially when the weather gets cold\nGoing back to the number one in the AFC patriots number\nTwo shots and I can't argue with that yeah I think right now but then the question becomes this to either the patriots or Jacksonville are they in the same classes Los Angeles ramps\nThat's the big question and I'll tell you what if charity golf is as legitimate he seemed and there's no reason to believe he's not\nThat I think the rams are the best team in football hands down hands down to the best team in football and for quarterback teams like myself for the jets and your team the bills that drafted young quarterbacks high that are gonna absolutely struggle this year the\nHope is Jared golf did not look like an NFL quarterback those last game two years ago right he looked like an absolute blast and everybody thought at that point wow Carson went went after him is this Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf in reverse\nBut Jared golf last year played better I don't think he was great but played much better this year Jared office playing great\nAnd you were surprised I was surprised watching Jared golf\nWhen he just absolutely doors at Fort touchdown pass I thinking that gave me last play\nTo me it's unbelievable how good Los Angeles is they can run the football girlie they have weapons on often Scott and get the football to\nThe office of wine is still solid enough the defense is is tremendous although I keep the leaves out what eight weeks\nMarkets Peters is day to day that's the gold standard right now the NFL not the patriots not the Jacksonville Jaguars not the defending champion Philadelphia Eagles the rams right now our number one in anybody's power ranking and that's really the way it should be shown you can't argue with that\nNo but you just said that you think ... gonna come down to earth a little bit can't you say the same about Jared golf I mean he's playing above his punching above his weight class right now those to I mean he's playing terrific if it's not if not for homes he'd be the envy the through the first four games\nYeah you're right about that but Jared golf has an extra year under his belt the patent homes doesn't\nSo to me I look at the experience factor ... Holmes has to struggle at some point and write it can't be peaches and cream\nThe rest of the way I mean four games in he's putting a fourteen touchdowns not a single intercept which by the way it sounded very Alex Smith asked from last year spit then thrown interception through like the first eight games this season maybe it's an eighty read thing I don't know give free credit I mean he's been all kinds of ... the reality is at some point I\nAs good as Patrick homes is look I'm not denying how good he is I was impressed watching them throwing the run the guys naturally rocket his ability to think on the run in\nPressure situations throwing that football's his left hand which you really don't want to see but it worked\nThat's something that he had to come up with a split second\nYou light the decision making a Patrick Boyle homes I thought he was a gunslinger that's going to try to throw that football through walls of defenders because he knows he's got a cannon that he was going to be Brett Farr and throw a lot of takes I haven't seen it Brett Farr victim yet right that's the thing I haven't seen him make really stupid throws across the field that Brett Farr is notorious for\nSo I don't want to compare minute Brett Farr but he's got to struggle at some point Shawn Scott happening meanwhile I think Jared got just as he better supporting cap in terms of the rest of his team that I think it's more sustainable with Jared golf than it is with what you're seeing with Patrick my home because you got to sort of the fence and they got so they're only getting yoga every aspect in there\nYeah I agree I mean definitely has a great greater supporting cast that being checked a jerk golf but I\nDon't I mean there's a lot of weapons around homes don't forget ... cream haunt semi walk into it and you know similar Watkins fits that system right I mean he's got a top ten receiver per se but he fits that system of of doing what they need and that is stretched a field with Terry kill as well so I I I've been around that moms\nI liked the weapons but my goodness how good is branding cook spent\nMost of the guy the pages like do I just one year they got a first round pick for a big fan of a burden the cooks yeah but he says he he'll spread that feels really they sent me the wider better he could stay healthy and he's willing to take a hit you know I mean you know that's the that's the capacity to look at it if you look at the wide receivers\nCooper cops in the guy who started\nRobert Moses titles don't world yeah\nIsn't incredibly you think about that the the names were talk may or may Cooper cup as I was a cop\nHe's good as you say I Know his his Robert towards I mean he's good\nAt Cooper cop is is I mean these pays like sixteen touchdowns this year robber one does I mean he's got this spring wide receivers on that team right now that their own pace from way more than a thousand yards\nI mean once on pace like twelve Ninety Cooper cups on pace for like Thirteen fifty and then you have you know ... brain and cooks a base for Eighteen hundred yards including Tom Gurley when he brings the backfield in terms of a passing game that's ridiculous down there and you're right I mean\nYou you look at what ... you know tightly kills on pace ridiculously number of yards you throwing the fact that he's got one of the best titans and all the football and Indian Travis Kelsey Karim\n... back to being cream on I mean he got out so slow start last couple of games he's played it about higher level\nThey both have great sets a weapons what's the difference I don't think Kansas City defense is as good as always defects\nAnd that's going to play a big role down the stretch do\nObviously that's got to be a factor but when it comes right down to the NFL it is weak number five\nStart looking at some of the big storylines that are obviously going to play out this weekend now they start to get a bit more because there is a milestone to the season a quarter way through we're past that it's coming up that go towards an NBC Sports radio in the NBC Sports radio mobile app\nFeels like we're interrupting the conversation\nThese these radio would come right back [noise]\nCoverage of high school sports even right here I Am Thirteen twenty to John Wisconsin's twenty four hour news and information station [noise]\nWhat's up every one of the president being white hair to let you know he gets satisfy in history as happened in the October ...

that we have yet to talk about [noise] congratulations by the way to a Tom Brady joined the five hundred touchdown pass club with that\nThird touchdown today he is now only eight touched that touchdown shy of Brett Farr for number two thirty nine touchdown shy of Peyton Manning that Drew Brees right behind him he comes in a week five at four hundred and Ninety six\nHow about that Tom Brady five hundred career touchdown passes meanwhile I mean you look at the interceptions Tom Brady Sean in his career with the chewy through today is only a hundred and sixty six interceptions in his career\nFive hundred touchdowns a hundred and sixty six interceptions that's an unbelievable ratio he used to go he is he really is\nBut he's not credible as far as Fox is concerned to put 'em on the uh Boston Mount Rushmore she's crazy [laughter] stiffed better carve out a new a new area for them to hire new workers to uh put together a fifth face on there now want to yeah they didn't want to offend anybody\nKnow but that's amazing I mean you think about that you know he looked Drew Brees is throwing more picks\nBrett Farr through a ton of picks Peyton Manning did throw a lot of career picks the next guy is you know Aaron Rodgers we talked about his greatness ripe he's thirty four years old Shawn he used to three hundred and twenty Mimi kinda thrown the hundred and eighty to to get the five hundred I mean that's another\nSet for what three years right yeah another six years look back at that that's for three years he's had three years or\nDo you think Aaron Rodgers has a hundred and eighty more touchdown passes and I'm\nThirty four thirty five years or the December British forty doesn't doesn't mean everybody can do it\nEvery morning [laughter] thirty dollars will be thirty seven to look at it right is falling apart robs ... he was not as good as any of those guys you know you never was here's a statistic showing how about this so three hundred and twenty career path passing touchdowns ran Rogers right yep Seventy nine interceptions that the\nSuppressive Seventy nice played a hundred and fifty three games he's only thrown Seventy nine interceptions that's incredibly that's average is like a ... year he has been thrown double digit interceptions since two thousand and ten\nUnbelievably ads consistency when guys like him are Brady throw the football as a fan you don't hold your breath go on I Hope it lands in the right teams hands right I remember watching games and be a Gino Smith or march today and jazz and rhyme fitzpatrick\nIn right now Sam Darnell because he's a rookie but every time they go back and not balls and we're going it's fifty fifty I bought may end up in a jets hand or a might ends up in the hands of the opponents\nThey're probably the same way right now when you get like Josh Allen watching those games\n[laughter] show\nWe already have a long way to go but yeah yeah you're right no true during his\nTrue it's incredible so congratulations to Tom Brady to five hundred touchdown club only the third quarter back in history to do it Drew Brees will join him\nBy Israelis as we will we get to six hundred ...\nNo no no\nThink right now they feel he's forty five [laughter] [noise] I Can't see him playing till he's forty five although people think he will does he get the five hundred and thirty nine anti Peyton Manning well look he still has what a loving games this year he still has probably\nTwenty five more touchdowns this year right above five twenty five so definitely play next year Tom Brady we'll have more touchdown passes and Peyton Manning was all said and done the question is does Drew Brees last longer than ... brain\nBrief takeover that from Tom Brady and Drew Brees could end up with every single NFL passing record he's got the most completion he is probably the most yards or if he's not he's with no yes he is now the most passing yards if not he's within one game are still doing that\nHe's that four hundred and Ninety six touchdowns in ... you know he's going to throw a ... you know I mean he'll pass Peyton Manning the question is does he passed Tom Brady that's that's kind of a fun thing if you think about it although breeze and you know present Brady you've never been compared to each other right as always manning in and break because they would actually play against each other\nBut in terms of being prolific quarterbacks\nYou know breathing in brief should be kind of a rivalry right now because their neck and neck and so many categories\nRight five or ... yeah they just didn't they haven't had the tools that manning and free have\nThey've never had the tools but people always talk about you know Bryce Harper and Mike Trout they don't have any dogs because they each plane a different league\nFor the fact is you kind of looked at the two of them because you know they're both young they're both obviously talented they both want MVPs at a young age\nPraising the Brady and the record books their neck and neck on everything I mean ... what three thousand yard shy of breeze\nHe's now for touchdowns ahead a breeze that's going to go back and forth as by gay by game right breeze might have a five touchdown game Brady might have a four touchdown game freeze my throat to bring my throat three it's going to like keep changing throughout the course of the season and really the course of their careers however much longer both guys want to play but here's the difference\nTom Brady says he wants to play the forty five and he might\nDrew Brees place so many games indoors he plays games at home indoors he plays in Atlanta right that's I guess that's retractable roof so changed he's going to play an indoor game there he also plays in a warmer environment Tampa Bay he plays in a warmer environment in in Carolina\nMeanwhile ... got to play at a you know a buffalo he's got to play now he doesn't play Miami one while you're ...\nYou know what you know the difference is pretty much have to try to do that that's right and I see yeah that's true and never mind the writer and and you know the temperature like our line of defense or is that right now you get the paper tried the [laughter] All right\nSo here's a trade off on this once he got away do you watch the better advantage playing at least nine games a year in a dome [laughter] or playing a jets and the bills for time of year\nVeteran then definitely play the jets those words ... year unfortunately like the bills and then as\nI say I agree it's kind of ... I mean the ownership of the division by Tom Brady is just it's stunning it is utterly study ownership of that division they shouldn't even be hold the FCC just because the patriots division\nThrough what it should be it's amazing how every team now sets up for life after Brady like the jets bills drafted quarterbacks for two reasons one they need one but two\nYeah it was what eight to one after four hundred even want to remember that tend to three I think was the final score of that game so Damon ... you'll hear that coming up about Fifteen minutes [noise] All right you know what Richard Richard Sherman brought up\nSomething and this is what he said quote this is what\nThe league wanted they want record passing numbers you've got an average quarterback the average quarterbacks past ratings like Ninety two and they used to be hall of fame numbers and now it's not hall of fame numbers that the average quarterback you can't touch him you can't tackle them you can't hit them high can't hit a blow\nYou can't knock him down to the ground heart all that you can't hit the receiver to why you can't hit him too low you can't push a bigger barely precedent it's making it really difficult on teams combat it 'cause every role in the book is designed to make sure you don't get them stopped\nHe said quote they're just trying to make it impossible for guys to play defense it's an interesting league\nWe play him here's the thing\nSherman is one hundred and ten percent correct he is more than correct the NFL has made it impossible to try to stop the quarterback look at how many quarterbacks right now\nOn pace to challenge Peyton Manning single season passing record either for fifty four hundred and Seventy seven yards of two thousand and Thirteen right now robbers burger GOP cousin's car\nAll right now ahead of the pace\nMatt Ryan is literally Thirteen York shy of the pace Joe Flaco is on pace over four thousand yards short Watson's hovering over five thousand ... yards all these guys panel homes is well over forty five hundred yards in terms of predictability said with the dorm\nAnd I don't have a problem with it to be honest with you on to me I like it NFL where there is scoring I like it at a fellow where there is a lot of passing\nWho do enjoy watching the running shoot off that's right who doesn't enjoy watching funding gun football in the college ranks no offense\nNine to six Ninety six give me a break Tate my eye leads open to watch the nonsense it's like a clockwork orange where they're forcing him to watch all these videos by having two doctors on each side putting vice dean and his eyes while they haven't taped open a death row\nBorder I Blake ... plant in the hall of fame level now three hundred and eighty yards\nAgainst the jets last week I don't want to get so he's a hundred\nPercent correct Richard Sherman is saying that you have like go below average quarterback now planet hall of fame level I\nIt's it's it's a joke it's it's a real joke do there is that there's no ... no league anymore it's just too easy to score I don't like it has to be some kind of balance to it you know I said I don't want to nine six game but it has\nTo be some some balance here's the thing you don't want to nine and six game and you don't want him out and you have any body yeah but you don't want your quarterback knocked out during the season because at that point you might as well and your season sci fi capitalistic it it's so ...\nSo rely on the quarterback that now if the quarterback does get knocked out no\nNor such football anymore they don't want to watch anymore you know the old way back which it shouldn't be all about one position that's that's what you look\nFor you know what though that one position controls the football more than anybody that one position\nWhile it was bought out a way if they changed the rules and didn't make it so that it it it it it it's um advantageous to pass the ball on twenty\nFour quarterbacks right now have quarterback ratings of Ninety and above its joke Derek car is points three points away from making twenty five okay that's incredible what was wrong with the football that we grow up on tell me\nI never had a problem with it too violent I guess what they're going to say\nTo Ireland I loved kickoffs I loved the great quarterbacks sack I loved that hit on the sideline where you could actually hear it in the stands go ooh All right that's the full we grew up on guys like Lawrence Taylor today would get flagged three times the game\nWhy this then Dan sorry forget about that ... I get that so I got it right why not just um changed the rule where defensive backs the kid touch you put you right away ... ... what is it ten yards now you have to ... you can't touch\nThe receiver for ten years was a tense 'cause that's what it's up Seventy four used to be five for five yeah\nYou can you can make rules to favor the defense you know to balance it out I mean it's it's too far or the other way right now it's too much on the offensive side yeah\nNo it really is too much of the office of ... that that the one thing that always bothers me is the fact that every time the ball goes up and there's contact\nNine and a half out of ten times they will call it on the defensive player all sense of players can get away with murder right now when it comes to you know contact with defensive players\nAnd I think what the league has realized is look at it and maybe the popularity and growth of college football kind of helped with is is that people enjoy that people want to see off and people want to see end zone celebrations right people want to see the personalities of the personality comes out when when a guy scores a touchdown\nAnd I think the NFL is kind of playing to his audience because they think that's what the audience once they want high scoring games they wanted an off and they don't want hockey they don't want soccer heck they barely won baseball in the sense of me or you could love the one nothing pitching duel between Justin Vernon lander and ah\nAnd Chris cell but I think a lot of people outside of the true fans like your me would hate to see a well nothing baseball game they go it's too boring I'm not watching it\nAnd I think the NFL saying hey we don't want those face I think our products as boring\nAs those basketball right they've opened it up a lot more as well off and said well why 'cause I think they also don't want to be afflicted with the same problem\nWhich is fans say wow it's too slow and boring like hockey and baseball so the NFL saying screw it we're going to the complete opposite direction let's open it up score fifty points a game that's what the audience wants and they're very\nRight I I agree but you can is the rule that we were talking about what a defensive back in touch a wide receiver or tied in with within five yards then after that it's illegal contact right\nFrom why don't make a ten years you could there's rules that they could adjust to I guess turn you know balance out the the orphans and defense and it's just too too far on the other way\nTo the office I don't like it now it is definitely too far the other way it's gotten to the point where it's clear let me Joe I had a great level this year show for adults psycho\nHe's claiming level right way to get rid of a button and now all of a sudden these good again I ready for this Shawn joke goes on pace for five thousand yards past any foreign ... correct right\nHas either one side jobs at four thousand one for an eight or something

second game in Boston when a\nA David drove me in with a a blueprint as center field I mean now it's three to two and then we have shelling a hundred miles per game six\nAnd a game seven\nWe had that experience from the year before and uh we weren't going to be denied I mean we we caught fire at the right time and that's a that's the reason why we were able to close it out all the clothes that convincingly um you know all of a sudden the Yankee hitters just\nA fell silent or I was playing set a bill that just seemed like\nThey were missing every single pitch you know there was a lot of pressure and at these games are pressure field and uh\nSo it's going to be very interesting come tomorrow night I'm not sure I can stay up the entire time anymore I remember those games get done um after one AM so many times so uh my bad times a lot earlier now [laughter]\nSo it's game seven at Yankee Stadium\nAnd you hit that grand slam in in the second inning and Europe six nothing at that point could you rest a little did we guys like oh my goodness I Can't believe that we're up six nothing through two innings here after coming back three games momentum squarely on our side at this point\nIt was their moment in that game where it's like we've done it I mean did you have to wait all the way music tend to three final but was there a point there maybe it was eight to one in the fourth you guys are like\nLook what's happening here ... ... that grand slam by the time he was such a killer for the Yankees and that was that dagger at that point did you did you know you had it\nNo no I mean when I um rent around the bases I mean there was no small on my face because I remember what happened\nA year before and\nYou know after the second home run hit the following ending or two um you know you start feeling a little more confident but\nIt's the Yankees I mean they are a star star studded every single place they they have that winning mentality so um I I was not going to be happy until the final\nA pitcher's throwing\nYour career you plated seven different locations ... Yankees Red Sox have that law they have that aura what's it like to play in a playoff game Yankees Red Sox is it a different field and playing anybody else\nAbsolutely I mean I'll be aligned to you if a if not but um you know there is so much um energy around the ballpark the fans are excited the media is excited I'm the players are I mean this is a a what you dream about I mean to\nSports and um it's and it's back after fourteen years that's a that's going to be very exciting and it's a it's a whole new new faces so uh um\nI I Can't wait to see what happens and you know unfortunately whoever wins this game does not or when's the series does that go to the world series looks like we had before but uh I'm I'm sure there's going to be a lot of a fire part\nIn our New Years ago and fly right you're right but you know it's been fourteen years Johnny since we've had this and that we have not had Yankees Red Sox in the postseason since\n[laughter] no I cannot believe that and you know when two thousand nine when I Wonder what the Yankees I um Boston was a team that I thought we were going to face because they always beat Anaheim I'm In the playoffs and that was a year that Anaheim finally uh I'm ...\nI finally won so uh um I thought for sure we were going to get them back and I'm not sure how how the pressure whether or how it would have handled that pressure um [laughter] you know so it's a very exciting but I'm sure I Would have hit a grand slam like a Red Sox\n[laughter] pay back [laughter]\nThe gray Johnny Damon joining us going deep enforcement NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com\nYou know obviously you're a baseball fan Johnny you played this more for a long time but how important is it for baseball and your mind having been a part of the series understanding the the legacy in in the in the rivalry but how important is it for baseball to have this happen right now\nOh it's very important I mean as you can see from the first couple games to get a hundred and sixty third games of the season I mean they were amazing or you know baseball's heading into a no great\nPostseason right now I mean the um all these games have been um incredible um baseball needed this but you know now they get Yankees Red Sox so I um it it's going to be great again so I just um\nYou know can't wait I Can't wait to watch us as a the\nBest time of year for baseball and uh Derek Jeter always ah when we got to October they would start smelling around and when I was\nHe doing he was like I ... I smell the postseason [laughter] I Know a world championship so that's that's the kind of mentality that are ... to ... what the Yankees so he cannot wait till this time of year\nAs friendly as the guys you are Johnny when you you're wearing a Red Sox uniform playing the Yankees or vice versa and especially in the postseason match up\nHe's genuine hatred amongst the club I mean you hear about DiMaggio when and Ted Williams and that these teams hated each other back in the day all through from Babe Ruth being sold the Yankees\nWhen you play against him our friendships put to the side\n[noise] um yeah I mean your job is to go out of the woods\nSo everybody wants to win and I\nHate that expression you know um this guy hates losing well I think everyone hates them lose everyone wants to win but there was no hatred on my part I always respect as a way to Yankees play the game\nA hit a ground ball to the second base but and they're hustling um and so that's the type of ball player that I was a I don't think too many people like\nMe or just like the way I play the game as long as I'm like respecting the game and respect when the outcome you know there's no ... there was no uh\nCursing the other team it's just about stepping on the field and taking care of business and uh\nHopefully at the end of the game or at the end of a series your team prevails and you live to fight another series and hope to win another world series so I don't think there's hatred um\nThere's two too much going on\nThat you know that takes up too much time you just for playing the game the right way\nLast question Johnny you go from four years in Boston to actually joining the hated Yankees and then you get you become a Yankee favorite at that point four years in New York\nWe would go back to Boston and play a Fenway Park\nWas a good natured ribbing you got from the fans or could you tell they were actually upset that here was one of the quote unquote idiots one of the guys with the best beards on that team one of the reasons why you guys broke the curse of Babe Ruth and now you're wearing Yankee pinch ... clean shaven was it good nature could you tell they were really mad [noise]\nUh no they were really mad at you know I\nGet it and believe me I Want to stay a stay with the red Sox but um I feel like the intention was to try to bring back for one year I'm probably assigned to a lesser contract because ... was going to be ready and so\nAt the end of the day I Want it to a sound that nice contract a set the stage for a feature Senate bill there is to make more money and a what a great place to go into New York and try to who Boston wrong because I mean I ...\nAnd and that's what got lost at a you know the fans were very\nMisinformed about everything that happened to free agency and you know maybe I should have talked up or or or create we'll see but that's not the type of player I Am I you know if someone offers me a contract I'm going to take a close look at it\nI'm going to be very grateful for whatever happens but I was never going to go out there big for a contractor say you need to start right now I just go about our business in a\n... or the chips fall that's what happened so uh um I get it it works it and I was upset with the red Sox I really wanted to go back there and um have a huge legacy but um it takes two to agree and we uh we weren't even close\nAnd guess what you what a World Series you know what the Yankees as well so in the end it all worked out came a fan favorite in New York fan favorite in Boston as well a member of

focus this talk radio review\nWith the talkers actually we have to Victoria's\nHere Victoria Cuban and Victoria Jones enrichment fan is long remains or two boys two girls here we go into the next item let's move actually into um I ... the New York times has done a story on Mr Trump and his wealth\nOr whether he has re doesn't where it is and how many people who screwed up along the way when he went bankrupt et cetera\nI don't notice anything new here is anybody\nJust under ... sister coming yeah this this term I think she was\nA for being a judge somewhere I guess her filing says of her tax returns of the family business\nThat's really what kind of started all of this death started on down the road here to answer was lead Victoria whereas I think well in in New York the rumor is that there really isn't anything to it's all been reconciled and there really isn't anything that they are going to go out there so I don't think that there's going to be a whole lot to\nWhat are you hearing in Washington Victoria Jones about this anything\n[noise] well I mean in Washington you know the IRS ah I I don't think you know didn't really do and I think at that time but the the New York ... people that said that they look very closely at this because\nNot only with some don't change things and um and that are\nIn the trumps a wealth quote but it does save lives better some illegal maneuvers may have been done what is the one that the most interesting stories about this in ...\nStory about into Trump's well is that in his wealth in this story the story he has created which is brilliant brilliant is almost entirely amiss\nBut he only go to one million dollar loan what in fact it was like sixty seven million yeah that was nearly all that it was a rape paid but then ... nearly all of it was that a rate paid in fact he was by age three he was any two hundred thousand dollars a year\nOr he was a millionaire by age age I'm ... you know it it's just fascinating also how he tried to get his father to side of the ... changing his will and basically better I think Donald Trump I'm a when his father was in his nineties and ailing setting up a satellite huge\nI'm just very interesting off his father had done nothing except to help him a bailout is say businesses throughout his life it's just it's just absolutely it's fascinating it's a fascinating family story is what it is and I think family story\nHere we go I'm a of the opinion that this sort of thing happens all the time I don't think there's anybody who believes Donald Trump is the world's greatest humanitarian newer great stand up guy and Victor anybody on any side either side of the Iowa who thinks that you are in terms of his uh wealth and\nThe phony baloney stuff that he's created around them so you got to hand it to the guy he's a great PR person for himself\nOr he knows how to sew him so he knows how to tell the story or how much of it is true of much of it is baloney remains to be seen as just one more reason for people either not to like them you know so you look at what he's all about he's\nNot a likeable guy but let me tell you married to him in spite of that why he's popular with his base\nYeah because he doesn't care what you think of him right going out to be all that all of that means he does not care what you think of him here going to do what he thinks is right then whether it's wrong or right he's going to do it and he doesn't care whether people are stopping\nAt the White House gates with flames trying to charge the gates he will do what he wants to do and that's what his base loves is that they think the things that he's doing or the right things to do\nNo matter what the left says or wherever and what has been no matter what the what do they obviously agree because otherwise if if they did\nSo I I\nYeah I think I think he does what he what he thinks is best for him and I think he was I think it's great I think it's great for him and I think she also um has absolutely love the\nUh the arc of um uh the uh the uh of self promotional social media um uh using a ah\nUsing social media that says\n... ways he plays with social media

fourteen Ninety three it's a much lower\nAbout whether or not he should have done it was the question later on what on earth was I thinking and that a couple of laughs came out of that but the fact that he put himself in that position and then the criticism that has come for some of the things that he said that\nYou know one way or another they don't seem to be life shaking a but it's not what you expect from him and so that's a but his whole reputation has been Gerard and that's the point I'm making year by his parents had this political event and whether that\nWas you know ... not a huge deal has been blowing up into a huge deal yeah and now are acting his life and yeah and his personality forever\nYeah but anyway uh that's uh an aside so meanwhile back in the ranch\nOr the other the the the Facebook hacking how many people have worried Victoria cue and you're good at this stuff from Victoria joins I'd like to have you jumping on this as well as Facebook what was it fifty million\nPeople accounts were compromised yet again are and what in the name of God is going on there\nAnd why is it with all of these questions I Know the numbers have gone down on Facebook but they don't seem to be going down appreciably and one wonders why because they seem to be very fine just that they got to shore of themselves what is going on there\nWell as in terms of numbers one of the reasons why Facebook's numbers have\nThey've definitely dropped off but in the older demographic they have not because that for two reasons one older people don't know how to disconnect and delete an account on Facebook and that's actually I'm not making a joke that is a very real thing\nAnd the second thing is for a lot of older people that is still their lifeline of communication with family across the country or around the world and so those numbers of the older generation are always going to be there on Facebook\nBut for a lot of younger people they've just you know pulled the plug\nAnd and you just keep hearing these stories time and time again that they've been hacked and the security isn't good\nAnd you know and again going back to the older\nGeneration using Facebook they're probably still using password one so they're even more vulnerable and they don't even realize that and I go and they don't change their passwords they never change it right you have to change your passwords on a regular basis but you know get get my mom to try to she's not even on Facebook but if she was\nTo get her to change your password you know it's all I've got a sheet we're right on my password around and you know it's just it's never going to happen so unfortunately there are a lot of people who are very very vulnerable to all kinds of malware and that you know all kinds of stuff is just going to do that and\nWe live with forever\nAnd you just said is it's going to be something that we have to learn how to deal with the way you deal with it is you change your password and your right your user name or at least a couple of times a year\nYeah can I can I also said something very creepy about Facebook which is that they lost people to use to expect to identification and I'm\nIn a dragon id number out of your finger some print or something new log in on the computer and then you get attached to your phone yeah and you and then you say yes this is me on your phone and computer says okay you can get it too is that good or bad return it it's good\nWell in theory in theory it's good but what Facebook has done is that uh they have been ousted and court for settling the phone numbers\nTo being used that to facts to\nIdentification in other words to make people feel more secure to advertise it\nAre there are a bunch of the things that really really really they did is to be able to get to get all of them tried out for cash them right\nI I mean I I I'm Still on Facebook because I like to see occasionally will my nephews that do it I don't use Facebook anymore I I Am so\nDon ... but I got done with him when he announced a few years ago oh well you'll stream it no longer going to be a linear oh oh what happened you know\nA ... minute we're going to determine what you'll interested in and I said no you know\nI like the upper right\nOnce you get to name and I tried it oh All right All right I Want for the show and I started getting a bunch of falling all along that line\nIs I Want to see why why not the best thing for all Carol any law\nAgainst what two thousand people at the same couple hundred people are kind of ... who was who like myself who I see their content it's like what happened to the other Eighteen hundred people I'm friends with I don't know how you kill them\nYeah so and that's right who comes up as your friends I Want to know where they get I get that a lot of the people that come up when I look at my Facebook page my personal place because they feel that ever talked to any of them I don't know you know there may be listeners who knows who they are uh is really silly but there's one thing that I Want to mention before we pause\nHere and that has to do with where at Facebook and other social media come into our society come into our lives\nThe story this week of a third grader who brought a loaded handgun\nInto a an elementary school because he wanted to scare the children who are picking on him and where that went in terms of social media the instead of\nCurtailing yet controlling it it goes out for everybody to see and in my mind this gives other people the idea to get a hold of a handgun\nTo do the same thing I think that's what social media does it spreads bad ideas and there's no sifting there's some good ideas and loving things that are there and I promote and I put up on my personal page but there are a lot of the like there\nAt all angry at that age is ... television news ah everything does that spreads ideas\nThat bad fight forty six past the hour I'm going to help you lose some weight now those of you are listening or would like\nTo know what the number one healthiest choices for weight loss I Know many of us have tried all kinds of things some people have had operations some people go on a special diet some people go to a program they go to work out they do all of these things because they really want to lose the weight and then they find themselves after they take the pounds off\nThen they find themselves well okay I don't have the news anymore so they stopped doing what they have been doing and they put the pounds back on again that yoyo up and down very unhealthy very bad for your body and them taking the weight off as important but the way you do it\nIs more important and that's why I underscore Keller trend to be used\nBy those who want to keep the weight off after they take it off\nHits the healthiest choice because of the ingredients\nIn is the best way to lose weight by far it's been around for a Thirty Years' using the body's own college in to lose the weight

have like an airport lounge airport restaurant\nThat the public could use pilots can now but maybe there are certain areas set aside for for them or whatever and then people can come out to the airport right yeah and like you see in some\nFor it so I you know one of those things right now is you you could actually do that I mean that's what the public should know is that with the with the space it out there at the airport right now you're more than welcome I mean I think Jeremy would tell you the same thing that if you wanted to come out for an afternoon and just you know view as things are going on at the airport you can get inside the terminal\nI can handle it and you can have a coke and why you sit there and watch some planes come and go so you can you can do some of that now\nBut they couldn't hand some of those uh amenities out there and I think over time\nThe private sector investment that's coming to the area will make those investments\nI one of the things we steered clear of in state funding was\nA funding those extra amenities because we want the private sector to be a partner as well so we've heard conversations with [noise] you know ho chunk and some of the big farm groups and you know some of the sand valley folks themselves were flying in to be some investors in the private partnerships that we have out there so I think\nYou'll see those amenities grows soon as we get the infrastructure in place and that's probably the next thing on the checklist\nOkay we got our first caller for you representative ... you're on the morning magazine with us representative group\nHello hello [noise]\nKnow over the fence doesn't begin until eleven six and I want to be called a number one today because I've got a few things I got three ... three as I can get three on right without a doubt I'd say three and he got a three hundred bucks [laughter]\nYou got kids and families can get it in the mail there were eight I listen I listen to him I said that that is the whole family and that\nThat brings up a good point actually and one of the things people talk about all the time as you know why do you do a monthly radio show on AM radio you know I get a lot of that feedback from people in Madison or other people who come into the area that here after hearing what I'm doing\nAnd I tell him just because everybody listens to W. F. HR [laughter] I mean it whether it's the morning magazine in the morning show or the afternoon it shows that are on I mean people do listen and one of the things I described to other legislators and lobbyist who come to the area or whatever it may be\nIs that when you're in a rural area and you have one central media outlet [laughter] this is it is when we got right now right right so everybody's on everybody's listening tuned in and when we knock on doors dimensional type ... I heard in the morning magazine with car last week or looking forward to hearing the next week so apparently got a big falling to hear\n[laughter] I Can't I've appreciated I appreciate the listeners now um as you been I'm traveling about the district what are your some of your prior uh priorities we've got what needs to be done to further develop theory or in your in your mind\nYou know I think we've peel back the first layer and we've got people comfortable knowing that central Wisconsin a good place to live work stamp late now we've got to move forward now we've got to make sure that our healthcare investments are coming in which I have no doubt aspires to going to keep growing we just we did the ribbon cutting with them last week on their behavioral health center\nOr I Want to make sure that as virus and even in the southern parts of my district with ... and an Adams County I Want to make sure that health care providers are there that we'd need whether it's straight up health care whether it's mental health care whether it's dental care\nI Want to make sure we're dry and providers into our rural areas to provide and cover that need I think we're on the right path but I think we have a lot more to do especially when it comes to pediatric dentist who take Medicare that doesn't exist right now in central Wisconsin\nSo we've got to figure out a way in the second layer of things that we're dealing with now how do we make situation is better how do we provide better service to our residents in our areas it's it's almost like a business mentality as you want to have good customer service now that you build a good business right right so that's okay I'm trying to do at this point [noise]\nSo it's not just health care at the infrastructure is education I mean those are the things that people talk about on the doors all the time those three things over and over again\nSo we remind them of the things we did and we talk about plants that we have for the future\nSo I think the investment the six hundred and thirty seven million dollar investment as a K. through twelve as time has gone a long way to alleviate people's concerns about this you know stability of our K. through twelve system in our investment in ended our desire for good possible system as possible\nUh there's going to be more investment into it next session and again I have no doubt about that\nBut I also want to make sure that people understand that they have educational choices especially in rural areas again\nSo if you are in a certain school district and you don't happen to like it I Want you to be able to have the choice to have a virtual school choice a you know whatever it is that fits your family's needs I Want to make sure you have the access to it so that's that's what we're working on his good customer service and delivery of services\nYou just brought up something and this is something I've talked about with our during her updates with men stayed technical college I mean\nThere are a model for our technical college has changed because of the majority of their on their students now are people who are working hip and also they need options and instead of being in the classroom maybe a other companies that society work place with a laptop so they can do\nOn line and stuff I mean there is this a lot of this out a box thinking in ... in the ... and that level of education it would appear that that's also going to be required\nOf public education and private education whenever I mean yeah it is a new world I mean I didn't want me to get there and how has technology changing that\nYeah technology is making the world available to your fingertips twenty four seven so the need to be in a certain location to take advantage of it is lessened right threat we have a huge economy based in Wisconsin to work at home individuals people that don't necessarily have to go into the office downtown somewhere anymore that can work from home and get the same thing accomplished\nThat models should spread to education that model should spread to a mental health services like a spiral where there's [noise] tele medicine where you go and you talked to a doctor who was in California of you know on a screen you mean the need to be an actual location has changed so much for every sector of our lives and I think\nThat should expand as much as possible to help people feel that there's a good options for them that they need to travel is less than that people can actually still get the same services and benefits in education no matter where they are what they use that just [noise] it's common sense to take advantage of the opportunities that exist for us we\nNeed to get in on this is talk on an election year I Know if things get stupid on ... avenue silly season is a good way of putting you know because people stopping adults but after the elections or what do we need to get who's ever in office\nGet everybody at the table to talk about this from public schools the private schools to a technical college University in and say okay here's the thing technology is changing everything rapidly\nAre what are we going to do with our educational infrastructure in the state and then we need to\nYeah we do and I think that's something that we've shown over the last four years here in Wisconsin Rapids area that people can finally come out of their silos and work together and mostly it's been an economic development and transportation issues but now I think there's a good opportunity to spread that into the education realm and have those conversations to say OK\nWhat can we do a little bit differently how can we deliver services a little more rapidly who's going to coordinate that how do we make our training for our students a ... to our employers in our workforce area um employers how can you help fund some of the new technologies that you want for your incoming workforce and it's not just at the technical college level\nSometimes when you're training individual for a company you also want to train them to stay in the area you want to train them to love where they are\nThat's why we need to start a lot earlier sixth seventh eighth grade\nIn training people on not only just job skills but also the benefits of being where you are in the social economic impact of what you can do by staying home and raising and living and working in an area and raising your family here I think\nThere's plenty of opportunity for us and the social science area in our in our high schools and junior high is to talk about\nWhat we used to talk about when we were in junior high and high school is the value of your community and no you know who are the people in your neighborhood right right and take it back to that because I Can't tell you how amazed I Am at the at the Wisconsin ... police department and the outreach did they do in their community policing with chief Lovings now\nI mean you see them out there doing fun videos you seem out there playing hoops with kids you I mean all these things that we've always wanted people to know is that the people in your city or your friends or people in your community or people you should interact with and I think that's the one thing we have to fight technology on a state Internet interacted interact with people\nIn a good thing because I was going to get across the street from my house getting mail ... the other day and a rabbit squad ... drove by officers slowed down and said Hi [laughter]\nOkay yeah exactly so back in the eighties seventies eighties and nineties when I was growing up if you're a police car driving past your house in Wisconsin Rapids you're like oh somebody's in trouble right so you get this preconceived notion that oh man it's a bad area or something right up and down the road\nNow like you just said don't drive by and see and wave and have a quick conversation now you know that it's a good thing to see a squad car somewhere and it's just\nAnd he knows I live in a neighborhood that's my house and yeah yeah I was I was a knock on doors the other day and I would county school I pulled up behind me and kind of you know blue siren real quick and it was Scott Drew one of my friends just kinda wanted to give me a hard time and just talk for a little bit you know I mean that's\nWhen is the lesson to be learned from this whole thing\nNegotiate conversation that's the one thing that just has not exist and in this because those signs of turn to each other into these major evil entity is neither one will talk to each other besides it through their lawyers and in the court room\nThat's not how the world works it goes back to the conversation we had about technology and how it changes how we interact with people if there's simply had been some interaction with people six years ago I don't think we'd be talking about this six years from the time they applied for it\nI don't think was that he would have had to spend two or three million dollars in court cost to defend a project of some kind if he had done a simple developers agreement with the town of Saratoga who if they had been willing to do a developer agreement or some kind they could manage what is going to be put into their town instead of somebody telling them what's going to be put into their ...\nOr so the fact is the land was on zone\nIs there is a right to do something out there now it's time to come to the table to figure out what's going to happen besides capable that can't happen right they're not going to let that be a part of the equation so when people ask us on doors all the time\nEspecially in Rome in Saratoga were knocking on doors they're like what about this what about the cows what about the case will\nTell them right now I'm telling them it's Ninety five percent certain you're not going to see a cable unless the town makes the case will get built by being so obstinate right now because\nThat's kind of the towns position is not to negotiate it's to say you get all or you get nothing to ... ... you either have to build all of this where you build none of it\nThe town's going to lose in court at some point and the DNR at some point it's probably going to say well you've gone through all the court cases I guess this is what's going to have to happen\nI don't want that the opposition groups out there don't want that I don't know why we can't sit down and make that happen after the ... are able to make that offer [noise]\nWhy can't we make that happen and have a conversation in a compromise and a final solution to all of this age that's been out\nThere and you just said a word that for a lot of people as a ... and it's a scary word a compromise but that's the nature of all of a negotiated solution\nIt it's it's humanity in every family has compromised cooperation I mean every business has compromise and right you have a have a board were not everybody agrees but you come to a solution you have\nYou have a church board that comes to a group the surgeon you have village boards town board I mean everything that we do in our lives is about conversation and compromise and finding solution\nExcept for some projects like these for some reason and I\nIt it it's hurtful to a lot of people to have to even think about what's going to happen out there\nI think a lot of people live talked to and especially in those communities say you know I Know something's going to happen I just want to know what it is so I can deal with it you know Scott tell me what's going to happen there and I have to tell them for six years I don't know I mean we've brought the ... as far as we can to negotiate on one side\nAnd now it's time just to have a conversation if it's the four of us in a room you know Jim and Louis and Dan and Terry and me as a five us\nLay out the parameters and let me figure out where to go in at least if we get in a room and talk\nMaybe something will happen but I I don't want to take the chance that there is not a conversation happening\nWell hopefully again [laughter] I mean\nThat's the kind of the key pins to making sure that all the work we've done and water quality quantity in that area can be sound into the future you don't want to take a step back after you do all this work and spend all these day dollars to make sure you're cleaning Pete in well arrowhead Camelot\nThey all share it with all these lakes so we've been working on a for the producer led program to the team deals and everything else in between\nI don't take a step back I don't want to add other bodies of water into the work that we're going to have to do later\nSo I think it is reasonable to have this conversation and to have that offer formerly introduced by Jim ... formerly deals put in front of the town of Saratoga by the board\nTo have a discussion so that's that's my main point in this whole water ... that was a whole lot of debate is there's gotta be a discussion at this point 'cause six and a half years is just way too long and absolutely ridiculous to have to keep waiting this long to figure out what's going to happen\nThere was an interesting story and it relates somewhat to an issue you been working on and we've talked about in the past involving food banks and that was the fact that there is a Feeding America is getting an influx of\nFood because of the tariffs yeah yeah and so they are getting a bunch of food and the problem now is getting it out to the people that need it\nWhich I Wish we had a bill that would do that I mean you know what I mean that's those are the things that when you propose them in the legislature you know there's going to be a need\nFor the harvest for hope it would have done exactly that it would have it would have set up central distribution points for Feeding America to have the opportunity to deliver more food into all Seventy two counties of the state of Wisconsin but again it was a turf war by food banks and who's going to deliver the food\nReally if if your main goal is to make sure that I mean even slaps here in ... county flirting idea we you know we may not like everything about it but we loved the idea of being able to distribute more food to people in need because that's our mission and that's our goal\nBut for some of the bigger food banks and southeast Wisconsin in eastern Wisconsin Green Bay in Milwaukee in particular oh no no no no no no the only people that can deliver food to people in need are us\nAnd we ... what are they running a monopoly\nI don't know I mean those are the things that drives me crazy and that's why it takes so much heat from people for trying to seek consensus and find compromise because I just I don't like people who do that you know there's just something that makes sense doesn't it\nSupposed to be about feeding people right it's not the way the world is supposed to work and I'm going to fight like hacked to make sure that people like that don't win so whatever the situation is whether it's a environmental thing or a food thing or you know healthcare thing or whatever it is\nPeople like that can't when that's when we start losing our society and losing the values and morals that we have in central Wisconsin is when people who are loud and complain and hate more than they want to talk and learn and grow\nWhen those type when those situations lead to wins for those folks I don't know where\nWe're going to go well kind of like we we all decided to live in various bubbles yep like silos ... or go do it and we live in the silos and we and we only interact with people that I agree that are so I was the best one ... and\nAnd then during the election years it gets even worse sure Iran impulse I I mean the silos\n... that's a that's the thing I've been talking about forever and economic development here and would counting and that's why I give so much credit to the chamber and encouraging Reggie and all these groups who finally come out of those silos and finally even the even the communities around the the man in the airport together and that actually you know the Rapids in Grand Rapids important their dog and everybody else in Rome\nFinally all having conversations with each other instead of I win you lose to hey let's all win\nAnd we finally have shown that and I'm going to keep using that model forever and ever and ever and ever to say it's realistic it happens these people all like each other\nI mean even when they were in their silos they'll liked each other so what's the difference if we take ourselves out of that silo and put it together and I think\nThe two groups that I give the most credit for that are encourage and Reggie I think those two have really driven everybody out of their silos into working together and being part of each other and courage on the community sign and ready in the business community and now everybody's out there and the best example is that community picnic every year\nFor the business community is out in full force and the community are all there and I think those two coming together have pushed everybody else in the ... out of their silos into thinking about what daylight looks like with everybody working together\nThat's why I'm excited about the Tribune building next session because I think the timing is there I think the community support is there are there are people who would traditionally her on my side of the aisle and in the area when we you know politicking talked with a trivia really naturally hate me for liking that idea\nBut I think it's a good idea I think that's something we can use to grow on and central Wisconsin especially downtown Wisconsin Rapids to draw more interest with the boys and Girls Club in the river front redevelopment\nThose things sometimes you want to you everybody wants to keep their tax dollars right you're right you don't want to send your tax dollars anybody that's everybody's initial thought as it's my money I don't want to I don't want to send it out [noise]\nMy whole point Carl is Ben we're going to pay taxes but just the way it is my job is to make sure it's a small amount as possible and if I Can't get you more back I Want to make sure it's we've coming back to your own community\nAll your tax dollars shouldn't be going to Milwaukee all the time if you're going to be forced to pay taxes and we can't get compromised and cutting some taxes for you that are necessary\nI Want him back here and I want to spend here I don't want to spend to ever else in the state of Wisconsin so that's why we do some of the river from Dallas to the city it's why we do the WTC investments into the Tribune build and that's why we do all those dollars for all those small little projects around whether it's the CPI loans for cold storage and beer and or whatever those dollars are\nThat's why we bring it back here because of their your tax dollars and that's my job is to make sure that they stay here as much as humanly possible\nAnd we're going to take our final break them and be back with a today's edition of the morning magazine\nMost of the high school

you'd\nBuy them on the K would have said execution I'm all for it you know I mean it it it's I I'm kinda just said look I understand he's trying to get technical but it sounded like he was fishing for answers wow you know it'd be more specific\nHe's acting like a guy he's acting like guy in the hot seat some days he is by the way he did a sit down with the Milwaukee Journal sentinel and it's going to be on Sundays papers he back in the day and not so long ago every August or the quarterback\nThe head coach of the Green Bay Packers and this goes back you know twenty thirty forty years they would sit down at the end of training camp and that there'd be these big one on ones you know\nThe three or four TV stations the two or three big radio shows and the end the Sunday Papers right across the state and ... and quickly they seem to be able to push that all off\nNow they make themselves available a lot every day anyway right but everyone wants to just get that you know behind closed doors shut down one on one and ask their you know up close ... like you did with him last spring right so right and so he now he's doing on this this is a weird it's just weird timing\nAfter this little thing with Rogers and the Buffalo Bills game and McCarthy was asked OK so Aaron points out yeah we want twenty two to nothing great job by the defense but there should have been a whole lot more often\nWhoa what what was the worst part about the Packers off ... against the bills last Sunday and I both feel\nWell I mean we're just you know we weren't we weren't as clearly red fail\nIf I'm wrong all regrettable around five thoughtful and to me that that those are two biggest any of the games were for the way we have a football I mean there's probably that's really the\nThe biggest read on my on migrants to live than it is about the football you got to take care of the football and you got to take it away I thought it was\nA much better job although we've got to take away as we were\nWe were and take away physician a lot more of the game of\nPrior to the first three so I mean I don't get a message and the training of that came across but we didn't get that done on often so I'm like a like a state and so that that's really I mean if you want to just play number and somebody just just take the production of the far complacent and photos and\nWhat kind of what what kind of numbers do we have in the past and that's why I Want to go a lot\n[noise] totally hung up on numbers and statistics don't think it's important to look inside of this because there are there's times for you to put up big numbers with no frankly you don't play those oil like fundamentally so follow up thing is that you stay out for the fundamentals and you keep the place though consistent you got a lot of games and and that's where we're after\nIs your mark Murphy watching this stuff up in the office mhm not just saying what's going on here what's going on\nWell he would have to know because they're meeting\nEvery week right and he's probably getting the same answer at the meeting\nYou know it's kinda like talk it out of both sides your mouth\nSo Aaron Rodgers you know calls things out after the game against the bills errands looking better\nHe's a nice feeling better than it was more mobile in their mobile yeah still got the pain but practice yesterday but here's the difference Randall ... out of their skin with a hamstring develop a Adams developed a calf situation on Wednesday he will try and go through tomorrow's run through practice Saturday and they'll determine what his\nYeah it's a different type of preparation you know you have a base level when you\nPlay there is a game before him twice a year I misspoke games last year and then they change the schemes so they're planting differently on defense takes a little more uh more time into it as you look in a different guys and different spots then you're saying you know the injuries that they've had\nA number of guys are coming in and got some new players obviously\nDidn't last year and then it looks a little different on film we played a coach Patricia and in fourteen when is the coordinator\nIn New England so we have a familiarity with ... with that scheme to folks over here for that\nBut uh yeah will be ready to go I'm just took a little extra preparations were\nPlaying a lifeguard is linked together it was a guest on your Monday Night show bill and asked\nHim what do you see it on the on the film with the lines now the map Patricia is in charge in Detroit\nIt this way that for now the different technique\nThat different personnel there there's a lot of turnover there so it's definitely a new approach\nSo different techniques using different\nGuys using her hands differently and reacted differently\nA lesser um I think there are so much worse scheme and their parents right in front and they just want to\nBe disruptive and this one's a just a little different style\nYour teams look into bonds back after Washington\nMike mccarthy said Thursday's practicing pads best for the season so far after the game you're quarterback says we should have done better than just touched on this what's often think coming\nUh twenty two to nothing when it was good when we didn't win by good Mars on but we want to just finished those drive so we we did a good job or maintain draws a lot of first our own got some yard is but we just wherever the cap was arrested on and when we neither were made to be able to score\nAgainst the cowboys map Patricia loves blitz ... we did that in New England as well so that means is going to be a big game you're gonna be looking for lane tailored left guard ... Lee and now Byron Bell picking up these blitz as Byron now's the right guard a Justin ... been dealing with the shoulder injury I don't I think he's\nActually eligible to come back but you know what I'm I you get the feeling that the train has pulled out of the station and Byron Bell is now taking over that right great guard job\nOr how come well let's talk to the fence of coordinator Jo filming on why bell might be the new starting right guard\nBig man I'm it's got a good life so I play the game you know what we think we really like the bottom and\nI'm an area that we need we wanted to emphasize last week I Want to continue to do so as he did a great job getting around the football you know and hustling down the field and help us teammates off the ground and play in the play to the whistle and\nYou know that's something that you know we want to you know we want to get our place speed up a little bit more than than we've had in the past it's not quite where it needs to be and you know\nThey play the game with the Saudis tried to play physical I'm certainly do have some things work on but I thought overall for his first starting again he hasn't had wasn't like a game here and in may ... may or whatever you can or\nAre trying to cap and got a Potter wraps it right guard has you know so I thought as is adjusting to the physician Senate contribution that we got out of Sunday was a really good\nYou know these coaches when they grade you out not only to just talk about did you make the block or not but\nYou know how's your hospital down the field to line up on time did you help your team it get up off the field that you you know where you were part of the huddled it does does the center have command huddle that's another thing that they check off on centers are they getting the team together and ready for the next political sold you know it's everything that they're grading on that\nSo the big question is this\nIs Aaron Rodgers has got to try and be mad Stafford and Marvin Jones and golden ... and those boys and try and put up four or five touchdowns in Detroit and he's got to do it three rookies germane Mart they they're they've had extra practice sessions for this guy to quote learn how to catch the football\nAnd he was the first one you took in academia St brown I think he's a smart kid and talented I don't know if he's\nBeefed up and I I thought they started hiding them a little bit in training camp but then he was then he was an act of\nNow he's been on the act of a it's been up for the active forty six for the last couple of games but only a little bit of special teams yes where you had to had a staff from often so they must feel that he's behind in the office but markets belt is gambling they feel pretty good about you know you know he had a couple of snaps a couple of plays last week\nSo you talked to a gym hustler\nThe pass coordinator he's the assistant to Joe Sylvan about his experience with the ravens and a bunch of other teams when you get like at Torrey Smith guy ends up being really good for a while um what's it like to start off with a rookie receiver against the lines\nAnd I've played with young guys and the ads I played when I started out with the um several times to start the season farm so those those guys have to apply that to learn as they go um\nThe all the volunteer day he wasn't what he is now\nWhen he started falling asleep I don't know any of those\nGuys staff their first year but I can just imagine joy wasn't I'm catching\nNinety balls and and and lighting people off in his first year so everybody has to go through that kind of a process and and to get the world they're going to go\nOn but the the one thing about them is they're they're talented guy [noise] um they're intelligent guys\nThey're very competitive\nUm size strength the they got what you want in a position now just a matter of expand the good and bad of this whole thing\nIs you know he had the voluntary and Randall and gee they might not make the game or you know who knows what's\nGonna happen again that comes out of that as other guys get experience either even if it's just in practice\nFork and were there and being in there all the time\nThat that that experience is rather than roll and that's that's that's what you federal to get out of it in a situation like that\nSo a chance for experience you know game experience on defense bill um they're run game\nUm well first of all the by the way they the the line defenses give up like a hundred and fifty yards plus every game I think so far so that would be something that maybe they'll pursue their and Jones and company but when it gets to be a match Stafford and how they're going to try and defend those guys Marvin Jones is tough man\nI think if Kevin king can is a hundred percent coming back to the screen injury maybe he goes up against them and then you've got ... against golden tape and I didn't go to this look really good the last couple of weeks he's I still think he's on a threat and I'm the same page as Matt Stafford\nThey're running backs liquor blunt I kind of looks like he's\nYou know it's past his time a carry on Johnson is the rookie is the second round her that kid is a impressive they'll use them both as little as a receiver like a James White as a running back he runs really hard to see a Rick he'll get some carry so those are the things we'll be looking for a up on the offensive line\nMike Daniels had these tremendous battles against former Packer TJ laying the last time these two teams ... matter of fact I treated that out\nAnd then TJ reply to that said hey thanks for finally watching us guys down there and the line you know Tina I don't know what a great guy TJ lying is Mike mccarthy actually made it a point to safety dealing is still a tremendous football player\nBut he had this concussion last week in Dallas\nWhere it took them a long time to get up\nAnd then there's even a camera shot him and the tape of the game where he's he's down on all fours on the sidelines and you know your memories had kind of a history of some of these concussions it looked really bad and I'm\nI don't think he's going to play and it's almost one of those things like oh my gosh you know is this the end of the road for him so we'll find out on\nKeep your fingers crossed Mike always good to enjoyed it and ah last night we had a lot of fun and then we'll do it again or coming up year olds\nAnd we and we met some great built Michael show listeners last night to laugh at him from a nominee falls game in a B.

year making one forty and be debt free in two years my answer would be yes\nYes and um that would mean that if you want to keep her car there's nothing out of line with keeping it but just by it off I mean we're not going to keep a bad uh regardless of the ... we're just going to get rid of it but you know so but if you told me you owe thirty thousand dollars on her car I Would sell it in a heartbeat\nOkay because when we were there wouldn't it wouldn't fit neither one of these equations I mean you wouldn't be dead already in two years probably and on top of that\nUh uh of of course you'd have too much tied up in vehicles and so that would change my equation that's how I use it just a decision making paradigm that's all it is critical thinking\nI'm among baby step for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars cash [laughter] um I Know that other than my house\nUm which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I could Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have no equity and\nUm and I had about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um so I'm going to be putting that into it\nAnd I think for him and kind of\nTaking out some stock mutual fund to kinda see where it goes from there okay um so my question is what are kind of my what do I deal with this kind of piled cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep\nMy living expenses for for um you know every any given month is about twenty seven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with their child so I'm pretty much the only income right now [laughter]\nUm so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then I Want to know what to do with the rich should throw it towards my house on a little bit every year or should I\nPut it someplace else we teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first second and so forth\nSo I'm baby steps one is ... dollars you've done that too is dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses um that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so uh twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate\nAs a chance to an emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now or what do you make\n[noise] um so I'm about Seventy eight year\nThere's the household income yeah okay All right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a tension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it I'm Sorry I didn't know how that kind of played and uh the card as well\nI'll tell you that mandatory\nAll right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four O. one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have I just opened up a rock or re ... with a better man watches on a kind of the the high hundreds\nFor me I'm familiar with what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a I'm a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo are coming there they're they're doing pretty good but none of them are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in ... at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time in her life that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would just go to smart pastor Dave Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the ... best in business so I don't care what you do okay I don't think my income at all\nBut people have always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred is eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded ... and I would have those in growth stock mutual funds\nI spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stock mutual funds it's all sort of what I recommend and I put forth in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international\nNow once you're doing that and you know the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it and mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine\nOkay and just watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and so you you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that and that's maybe step three is ... by babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different the ... you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it and what you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent\nAbove that everything I can find in my budget or at any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's maybe step six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's maxed out\nAnd ... invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy or what you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those too rough IRAs and any other money I'll find them I budget I'm going ... keep jumping around that house you're probably going to that house paid off and there were four years that this right\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\n... idea ... how are you guys are better than ... deserve what's up\nAlready so I have ah currently two hundred and twenty three thousand a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty abnormal ... currently with us from the treasury um it as a result of having been additional service academy three years ago\nAnd the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal that I'm obviously much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby stuff I'm a I'm a huge fan ... yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand 'em ... 'cause I Believe it's going to go actually know for ... will eventually end up any collections account\nIf I'm not able ... pay the amount ... fall\nYou know um and what does your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year also\nWhile ... have you guys are on the Internet um side and so what I'm going to just put this tonight for and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can 'cause you got wonderful income you'll be dead for two years\nIt's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start someone twenty thirty thousand bucks for this thing ... ... it's going to go away really really fast you make a lotta money\nYou're not getting a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I have never heard of this I'm curious about the learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they ... charge you for all the tuition\nYes are so little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either ... the surge through and lip service or you're assigned\nThe recruitment and get\n'em and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and they paid ... it goes over to the u._s. treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs and enlisted person if you get ... for a period of time and has forgiven\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news and the ... story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nTo be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dot com slash you have to hire the right person\n... recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new it finds them for you it's powerful matching technology scans thousands of resumes identifies people with the right skills education and experience for your job\nAnd actively invites them to apply\nSo you get qualified candidates fast\nAnd right now ... recruiter for free ... recruiter dot com slash Dave that's ... recruiter dot com slash days the zipper crude or the smartest way to hire\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nWrite I actually last January took myself off you know of of her checking am because\nHardware ... more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\n[noise] he was doing drugs you know and and so he wasn't in his right mind the\nRest my case you know so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to\nParticipate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom did this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent for mom of eventually\nBut if you can get her back I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and that be perpetual but to do that was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to read\nDuring the seat again but you like go to the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was on a healthy\nYeah and I'd like to get her up and running and healthy you know we've got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't she don't hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again broke you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that habit and those that love them but the good news is I have seen a innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nThem now she only they medicated as she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nWell there's you you don't want him just in a in a fall the rest of their life\nIs I mean they had control there she ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen uh as as a semi mentally ill and she is she's not on a couple of different\nWell her ... her only shopping as what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nYeah and it happens to people all the time though what did she say right now when they call you on and so you get nothing she does pick up the phone\nYou know you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you're just you know because they're going to just I don't think\nI should be talking she should\nBe telling them to be either one of the American long conversation it's I got nothing you get nothing because all they're going to badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs go and then we start negotiating in trying to work our way through the debt right\nWell I think this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate and\nI are going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months how they're they're doing art\nPliable today but she's got no money and you're not giving her any no so they get\nNothing they get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof and give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nAnd let's say I mean she'll she'll in little here Thirteen entered their eight hundred their she'd say look it can we work at a deal\nYeah or you know they got Thirteen hundred bucks you haven't seen any money in two years I'm no backup and work and again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take\nThat in the settlement in full will do it and get an in writing and no electronic access to your checking account 'cause whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if they're just moving it's a film industry\nAnd so you got a pretty similar rattlesnakes because they are [noise]\nCovering person here\nWho's going into a rattlesnake being\nTo go war whether emotionally on there\nBut you can you can give her the cheerleading support machine age without giving them money and I think you were to do all of\nThere's good news show she can make it out if she makes good choices\n\nHere's your for gas from the
