four NBC or you can tell you the ads malone's Mike that's A M I see a couple of big things going on in the world of sports about an hour before we went on the air a news came down\nAt the University of Maryland who twenty four hours ago made a decision to reinstate their head football coach DJ jerking\nOr twenty four hours later they decide no\nWe've decided to fire\nNow there's a lot of stuff that has gone on with regard to this\nThere have been several reports out there that I'm One of the decision came down from the board of regents\nDespite the fact that all of a slow the president of\nThe university or had grave reservations about reinstating them or we're hearing now that the board of regents threatened to a fire walls slow\nFrom his position as president if he did not reinstate them why well my guess is Seventy million dollars that was what was owed\nBJ Dirk and they're gonna have to pay that off and then go out and get another guy\nSo many ways they reinstate him everybody I'm including the players on that team or a number of the players on the team were all up in arms and I I completely understand why\n[noise] I mean Jordan McNair a football player that died\nBack in June I Believe it was after suffering heat stroke at the end of may\nUm his parents\nReleased a statement yesterday after we were told he was reinstated saying that felt like a kicking the gotten somebody spit in their face and I couldn't agree more could not agree more with this [noise] uh some of the football players when ... met with a team for the first time out to be reinstated actually got up and walked out their reports of scuffles in fights and today's practice\nNow there was a [noise] on campus administration um you know a\nStudent but it's ration it had been planning to protest a protest or Thursday as well and you got the governor of Maryland Larry Hogan who released a statement you said a share of the concerns of many Maryland there's and believe very strongly more must be done to restore public trust I'm calling on both a university system\nOf Maryland board of regents and the president Wallace low\nTo reconsider their decision at the schedule a public hearing to address these issues in an open and transparent manner that's just part of the governor statement after the firing came today\nLow released a statement and I'll read part of it 'cause I think it's interesting he said uh since returning to campus now apparently he's doing what presidents do which is travel around and try to raise money All right it's not about kids thought about the best interest of the students about raising money that's what presidents are hired to do\nThe big universities anyways Lowe says uh since returning to campus after yesterday's press conference\nI met with the leadership of the student government association speaking on behalf of numerous student organizations the Senate executive committee deems department chairs the campus leadership the overwhelming majority of stakeholders expressed serious concerns about coach DJ darkened returning to the campus\nOf the chair of the board of regents has publicly acknowledged that I he's talking about himself all this law had previously raise serious concerns about coach ... return now this is not at all reflection on my opinion of coached are kind of person\nHowever a departure is in the best interest of the university and this afternoon coach jerking was informed that the university will part ways and quote now there is also a story out there as I said that\nThe board of regents toll president low here's our recommendation don't fire that sounded like and we've got to pay him Seventy million ... million dollars but when everybody\nThe state of Maryland\nAll right uh people in every facet of the university life their throws up their hands not to mention just the public perception of what the hell are you doing in Maryland\nOh finally they fire DJ dark and which by the way I think is probably one of the best things they could have done I I just don't know how it is that if you you expect DJ drinking to for instance um\nSay a look at look at parents in the face and say listen you resent your son to me and I'll take care of all make them a hell of a man and a good football player I'm like you killed the kid or you were responsible I mean I don't want to say you killed him personally but it was his program and he has responsibility for that and\nI think somebody so you know always pointing the finger at somebody else\nThe buck stops there as far as I'm concerned so anyways DJ jerk and has been let go of by the way\nI'm very interesting with regard to what is going on in Cleveland of course our early in the week there was a big news when\nJohn Dorsey and Jimmy has on the owner decided to part ways with the Jackson and taught Haley be off its coordinator there in a Cleveland and a point interim head coach\nA great Williams who by the way spoke earlier today that the media out there and among some of the things he said was not just\nCyclists and I I've had at least eleven opportunities to be a head coach in his league since I last was ahead coach and I've had at least four instances where all I have to sign a piece of paper and I was the guy turned those down and was the right situation like who the hell cares Craig and I love ... I think it'll get after you bought I mean he wants to take the battles with the quarterback\nAnd force him to make mistakes and I like that kind of defense I really do [noise]\nBut I'm like this is not the time do this is not the time to be talking about what it is you may or may not be doing you have an opportunity now and you're charged with um the job of a kind of rally the troops if you will\nSeeing if you can get this thing had it in the right direction and then we're told at the end of of his tenure there or this season I should say\nThat they'll certainly look at him and consider him as a possible head coach candidate I don't see that happen ladies and gentlemen and I like great Williams a lot\nI just don't I mean listen you want a guy right I I Would imagine they think they have their franchise quarterback and Baker may feel so why not hire a guy that you think will develop a franchise quarterback that's not great Williams he's a defensive specialist he didn't know a crap about office really or development of a quarterback and I just don't think\nHis personality his bent\nWill service the Cleveland Browns moving forward now\nAre a lot of other things that are going on\nWith regard to\nWhere they might go we keep hearing the name Lincoln Riley the Oklahoma head coach who did such a great job out there with a with Baker may feel probably by the way spoke the other day and said that\nVolunteer your lunch break at America let's do lunch that or you know\nWe can walk to school at the corner we stopped like kind of yeah forty one thirty one I mean that we took a left holding the\nMusical is coming from the car\nAnd he's a smart she had been so distracted\nAre so many other than\nSuddenly he realized he forgot his homework again I left my homework on the table\nFor schools to ask me how\nSchools today when you can see learning an attention issues from their side\nYou can be on their side that's why there's understood that or a free online resource for the parents and the one in five kids with learning and attention issues get personalized recommendations practical tips daily access to experts in more to go from misunderstanding to understood that Oregon raunchy by understood in the ad council\n\n[noise]\n\nJobs\n[noise]\nAbout getting happy hour away and happy holiday [noise] can't trick or treat I'm doing radio on the young kids get on the other\nAnyway ... thanks for listening um we do this and we moved around a little bit 'cause of the breaking news would be the jerk and earlier today but uh [noise] we're not going to leave it on the show provides I don't know too much entertainment [noise]\nAh it's the best sport sound in the business so what's good to hear it as he said why\nDo you have to vote\nThan they should move sees these what\nSorry for\nThe man who does all the heavy lifting here my producer Alex already ox Omar\nBelow I've heard that you're missing out on some candy so I thought I'd put both un bread added on the spot let's say hypothetically you're treating a what what is your your ... your favorite candy that you'd like to get\nA toss up between a Snickers and a um Reese's peanut butter definitely my top three those two okay you've read\nMinds a hundred thousand dollar bar the hundred thousand dollar bar on a grand yeah do you remember those I remember that but I Can't remember what it was in um it was a new get in the middle yeah obviously ... know chocolate and they're like rush crispy and on the top or rice Chris don't they just called us a hundred hundred grand bargain or a hundred grand yeah\nOkay so in a sense it's kind of like a payday right except for instead of peanuts has got like ... Christmas rotted bingo\nRight cool and in the twenty first century they evolved into the lake fire has five ingredients for the milk got the the new get the rice crispy is the milk chocolate pretzels and peanuts round out your five ingredients but that's just kind of cheating let's just take all the best parts of candy and put it into one bar\nI think the Snickers peanut butter comes through their twists\nAll's yeah yeah so this is something about the combination of chocolate a peanut butter it's pretty hard to to be\nEloquently said which is exactly what I'd like to say a for I'll be completely candidate I just got captured in like leeches speech on Halloween okay I heard it about six minutes of it here is the best sixty\nThere's all kinds of cool skeletons the ironic thing is ...

sheets and everything so I was a grim reaper at a very cool grim reaper mass and just really cool who'd\nBeen even had this thing that looked like it didn't look like a circle but it was a ... open award and probably in\nSecond grade maybe\nReefer and second grade that's off\nThe I just I'm trying to figure out like the process of the gears turning for my college to think back that long\nWith only that but the whole thing about I Can't believe it I didn't know you need to happen costume if you want to put their hanging right there on Iraq\nI'm just glad that leads left it there but that one on the front of a joke you take one step further I don't know if you knew the smartphone there was a championship parade in Boston today\nAnd the breaking news from there David Price weighted to announce to the adoring fans that you don't have loved him all of two weeks I guess after his postseason performance he did he will often see we'll take the red Sox money for the next four years that's big news\nAnd the ... the part where he said what is Alex Cora ... this sounds like a guy who works for the Boston Red Sox right here\nYeah\nEverybody was sixteen stadiums [laughter]\nBetter to enjoy yourself the Boston Red Sox\nFan yeah he's a he's a Boston guy now in and out through and through forever and ever huh\nI Hope you enjoy them in and out while he was in southern Cal Fire way by

you're throwing stuff that players managers come on\nThey just wanted free beer like who they broke the group the trophy they brought a that is true yeah I was an unfortunate shots a good thing that you know the pitchers and the guys at the pinpoint accuracy were on the duck boats and not\nIn the crowd trying to throw I don't know I just I I was looking forward to hearing another during story like the tie in Jordan Bell forgot his Tennessee 'cause he's a rookie it never went to a ... grade before and fans are tracking bottles that had a Seattle\nWell yeah I mean listen you know\nThat there is wasting his first of all I saw something that the Boston spend like six hundred thousand dollars on winter\nYeah three hundred thousand at the celebration Sunday night in LA and three hundred thousand today for the parade\nSo why are these knuckleheads attending the parade throwing crappy ass Bud Light cans of players on a boss when the team is spent three hundred thousand dollars for boosting\nThey've already had like twelve or fourteen\nDon't want to admit that there are any fallen soldier [laughter] after work or just sitting around your job\nOr a grid stuff for the company that

[noise]\nHey I'm Andy if you don't know me it's probably because I'm not famous but I did start screaming company called Harris the idea for Harry's came out of a frustrating experience I had buying razor blades most brand for overpriced over designed and out of touch at Harry's our approach is simple here's our secret\nWe make sharp terrible blades and sell them at honest prices for low two dollars each we care about quality so much that we do some crazy things like by a world class German blade factory obsessing over every detail means we're confident in offering a hundred percent quality guarantee millions of guys have already made the switch to Harry's so thank you if you're one of them\nAnd if you're not we hope you give us a try with the special offer get Harry starters that with a five blade razor waited handle shaved Joe and a travel cover all for just three bucks plus free shipping\nDeliberating for eleven days I'm just kind of underscores what has been known about Maryland for a really long time and that is it's it's been a very dysfunctional\nAthletic department um it's lacks leadership it's lack 'em times morality um and I think uh you know we saw yesterday you know you had a couple of school officials up there\nAnd are really awkward press conference unable to explain why they were making the decision that they were making they\nExplain that these eight or ten and Damon Evans the athletic director who's still employed\nThat they share the blame in a lot of ways for this mess that they created but that now they got a second chance and it just was so striking to hear that they wouldn't get a fair chance\nUm and to hear them say that they wouldn't get a fair chance after a player has died after\nThere's been so much allegation of abuse um it was just unbelievable and and um [noise] you know tonight I think a lot of people feel like there was um a kind of a justice served\nUm in terms of dirt in but there's still a lot of things up in the air a lot of uncertainty\nYeah in fact that we're talking with Rolling Stones wants you to post reporters we've all this ... story he was\nHe was a reinstated yesterday about twenty four hours ago and then today fired up by the the president of the university Wallace low and that was my next question Roman okay so DJ Dirk and\nUh does not live to fight another day at the University of Maryland which I think is they just thing to do and I don't know do DJ jerk and maybe he's learned from that and then we'll go on to become a head coach someplace else and and do a terrific job but you mentioned the athletic director still being in place\nI Would imagine since this has been a PR nightmare\nJust from a recruiting standpoint to try to get kids to come to that college don't you kind of have to clean house with anybody who has any responsibility with regard to the door to their situation\nI mean you would think a but this again that's Maryland and it's proven\nTo be anything is possible here I mean I think last night prove that um but I Will say that I'm for now Damon Evans\nUm who you know who is for a long time you is viewed as an up and coming star in this business when he was at Georgia um [noise] you know he obviously was\nI'm forced to resign there when he got a DUI in two thousand ten um Maryland had given him a second chance um and she doesn't fourteen years out of the business working in the private sector and a lot of people believe in his talent um [noise] but\nAnd I outlined just kind of a a a lot of petty issues a lot of inability to do his job or the last few years to to provide any oversight\nUm and now he\nUm is promoted two weeks after Jordan McNair dies um this summer\nI'm we know that he's he's closely aligned with the president um while this low how we know that while as slow as has gone to bat for him I'm so that alliance we'll see um [noise]\nYou know we'll see what happens with that ah obviously Damon Evans a has a lot of um opposition and and it's hard to imagine that yeah even if he does bring in a\nA a a straight shooter as a coach or a clean staff a staff that does things are right way\nI'm his presence alone could affect the recruiting could affect a lot of things there fundraising so many factors um so\nThat's going to have to be weighed but has them now you know walls love the president has the power to to to move on evidence to move on as employment and we don't get the sense that that's going to happen anytime soon of course that get that that could change and we'll see\nAgain we've got a Roman stumps with his Washington Post reporter so before it gets you out of your backhanded I assume continues to to uh to be the head coach in the interim fashioned moving forward and um my guess is and I think they played Michigan State which is really not have any consequences necessarily given the story but\nAh I guess we'll just continue to to the run the program until the end of the college football season is that right ...\nYeah and you know ah Canada his um [noise] he's won a lot of support is he's five and three or ...\nYou know as far as much as intense and and as long of ours that jerk and forces assistance to tender Canada's kind of a different guy he's laid back um they get in there and they're out of the office by five thirty six everyday that culturally a lot different presidents\n'em and players like em and and um they've\nConsidering what they've gone through the amount of distraction to be five and three\nTo be one went away from below average ability um it's pretty remarkable and I think Canada's it on a great job and um I think you know talking with people inside the program tonight I think there are just relieved that there is some semblance of closure\nObviously we don't know what's going to have on the evidence we don't know what's gonna happen on low but um I think they're in a good situation for the rest of four games rest of the season with Canada and and I think they got you know a sense of closure tonight for sure\nMy right or wrong but I Know it's been busy for you today my friends so we appreciate your jumping on him

head football coach DJ Dirk in to the dismay of many the surprise of countless hours in a reversal of one hundred and eighty degrees has occurred but not\nWay that you would have expected the university system of Maryland border regions is not who has now turned around inspired\nDJ dark in one day after reinstating him instead the president to the school Wallace below who has already announced that he is retiring at the school at the end of the school year in June has unilaterally made the decision\nJay dark and then I applaud Wallace the low end the reports are that there is potentially the opportunity for the border regions to retaliate against low though what are they going to do with the guy is already announced he's retiring at the end of June\nBut for this to even get to the point where the presidents of the university has to pretty much overrule the border regions of the entire university system of the state of Maryland is only asinine\nThe fact is this could have been avoided yesterday if the board of regents had done the right thing which is to themselves fire DJ darken\nInnocent unreal situation that is ongoing that finally we hope has finally reared its last ugly head the fact is for Wallace the low he comes out looking good in this here's the guy that in August came out\nExcept the responsibility to the chagrin of some by the way because by accepting responsibility you know Marilyn pretty much it's going to have a tough time fighting any sort of a civil lawsuit\nBut it's about right and wrong when a Nineteen year old player dies because every single system put in place to try to protect against the player getting heat stroke in the summer\nDid not occur\nEvery single system that was put in place to help Jordan that there\nWas an used something to the extent of twenty nine or thirty minutes after he showed symptoms of heat stroke was he finally being treated for one hour after he officially I guess show those symptoms and ambulances finally called\nEvery single minutes as important as it is to make sure that a student athlete is medically taking care of was wasted upon wasted by trainers are apparently had no idea what they were doing or just thought that Jordan McNair was faking it\nDJ turkey is not directly responsible for the death of Jordan the mayor I just want to throw it out there he was not there but when you are the captain of the Titanic you go down with the ship\nWhen you're tapping Smith and there's death and destruction all around you after you had an iceberg you don't save yourself on a life raft you go down with the ship is exactly what he did\nEver DJ turkey and who should have resigned months ago who should have shown that he understood the severity of the situation who should have shown that him still being Marilyn was poisonous finally he is out\nAnd the part about this that we don't talk about his DJ jerking himself being a coward and allowing it to get to this point we know the border regions it's pathetic well you know every single person that border regions if they're elected she'll be voted out\nIf there's any way to remove him maybe the governor can do so every single one of these people that voted to keep DJ jerking should be removed\nA whole new group of border regions needs to be put in place because this group is an author failure\nIt's that simple and after wall is the low the president to the university\nHad met with numerous Stuart student organizations student government Senate executive committee deems department chairs campus leadership\nCorner reports the overwhelming majority was concerned about jerking coming back to campus he finally took it upon himself to do the right thing and get rid of DJ dark and and the toxic culture that he sadly harbored\nBut I don't want to take the responsibility away from turkey to show this is where we've talked about carefully ever since this all started in August\nThe fact is Derek and it's not responsible in the sense of having been there at the practice forcing Jordan McVeigh or to continue even with the heat stroke but I just felt that at this point of DJ drinking at any sort of common sense\nHe should've resigned between August and now because there was no way that he could do his job correctly from that point forward he couldn't walk into a kids' house and tell the parents that your son's health is my best interest\nHe couldn't walk in and tell us family that I'm going to make sure your son makes it out of there and for years because during the there did not\nThe bottom line is he should have had the sense to have resigned to kind of I guess get past all this embarrassment that has now come out because of the fact that it's gone to this point John I'm not going to absolve him of any responsibility because he could have been that guy to fall in the sword like he should have done months\nAgo so what changed from yesterday at this time till about a few hours ago what changed the outrage on campus the outrage on caster should I should have the president at least and the board of regents we should have known that should have known better\nThat the outrage from the students and from the media would be this this great they should have known better\n[noise] that's for them their tone deaf yeah\nTo make the decision to reinstate teacher dark and after the tone deaf absolutely torn toned up but don't you think DJ Dirk in should've resigned before this got to this\nOh boy ask a question\nNow how can we showed how can you think he could do his job correctly\nFrom that August points to know how can you think that at reinstatement if he was going to get reinstated he could actually do his job how can you believe that he could be an effective head coach in Maryland when it came to recruiting even granting players to run through a wall for him\nHe would bet that people have short term memory when they'll forget\nThat I Love you back on that but a lot of players did support him by the way yeah three players walked out of a meeting but a lot of players a lot even a lot more player state he's going to have his supporters among those players 'cause he recruited a lot of them yeah so I mean from my perspective\nThat he does have support so he could do his job effectively I don't know but he but at least ... you know some players supportive\nIt's incredible well this is the situation you're Dirk in approximately has eight point five million dollars left on his deal\nAnd if Maryland does not fire him for cause university apparently he's not doing that he's sixty five percent of the total so she is on five point five three million dollars half of that amount will be paid out in the first sixty days after his termination that'd be by December thirty first the\nJust over the force or if one wants to\nRun to you what the council and the U.S Forest Service\nThat's well I'm Glad you enjoyed it but I think it's that had back in\nI don't think I'm sure they'd be careful getting as a\nI'm going to return the kayak\n... how about a black T\nTo find that hard to find a neighborhood park or green bean you live in the U.S Forest

on elm street right now [noise] gift them in memory on my feet exactly right yup [noise]\nHow 'bout that dirty habit it is Halloween [noise]\nHope everybody went out the good news for me though I left the candy bowl outside my apartment door and he was rated the clean\nNo extra candy for old Schwartz here all done I took that candy though how do you I don't care who took it as long as I don't have to take it back into the house isn't part of the fun\nSeeing the kids dress up in a costume went out for an hour and twenty minutes went trick or treating around the neighborhood now but I Would and that was about candy outside my apartment not so fond you got to dock on my door and then I'll give you candy\nWhy because I Want to see the kids dress up you will you know I was going to have any kids see the car I wasn't home so then they get no candy\nBetter they get something if they knock and no one's home right\nLike where does the habits I didn't know some some older guy is not taken all the candy around the building some older guy wants to be a jerk and take the candy bowl means that's on him he's got to live with his conscience has to deal with that\nNot only that now [laughter] you want candy I gotta see costume oh my goodness well we had a\nI took a Kate did the hair today did it perfectly it was fantastic oh boy don't use the career I Do\nUse for Bobby pins don't want to hear about a real pro let it go down to a real pro\nYeah it's fantastic I think they will [noise] this radio thing doesn't work out I have a career how about that\nI you know what a shame on or your girlfriend for not doing the hair I agree right no no no it was I had\nTo do it you know I was the one here this morning so I did it and it turned out well she was happy with the hair she looked in the mirror she gave it the old sums up\nAnd uh I was a winner for that so it definitely worked out well I was a champ got a lot of candy trick or treating has a lot of when the weather's great by the way here in New York weather's nice sixty three degrees so kids could wear the costumes didn't afterwards jackets but here's the one thing that bothered me about Halloween and call me like the grumpy old man here\nSean but when I was a kid kids for the most part was like really kind of make their own cost you you know like you would actually work on it and\nYou know it's so easy to go to storm by my costumes you right there was like something different about making the cost you rather just go to a store buying it already made costume right\nWell no I mean as an adult though I'm not making toss do I'm going to go to a store I'm buying it\nFor the kids well I don't have kids\nDo you think it's a it's it's a little different to make it on your own compared to just go to the store buying the already bought one\nYeah saves time [laughter] I don't know I mean how about this and yet you have a car right do you put your brakes when any new break pets do you put them in yourself or do you take it to a mechanic\nUm\nNo I take it if you have to think about it yeah well yeah but you don't want to change the Gulf say if you have a kid I I Can't I don't know how to put it in my mind a because of the time you know you don't want to because you don't want to change breaks but you know what to do hair [laughter]\n[noise]\nThere's a lot easier to do to expire and but then you took the time to learn how to do a your daughter's hair right right either don't have to look up YouTube and put brake pads and easy to do\nIt is really to put our break yes yeah it is the change a tire an oil change yes I can change a tire that I can do okay so then it's just one more step of the very easy you know how to change a windshield wipers to believe\nThat I can do [laughter] yeah [laughter] I mean I live in New Jersey except for one year of my life\n[laughter]\nBut people\nDon't people don't change their their brake pads themselves because the time right so I could see how old are you know adults don't want to create a costume they'd rather go to a store buy ...\nGet that I I understand that and that's why I wanted to Oregon your car right you have a sense of accomplishment of Detroit yeah so anyway I think it's a good analogy\nBut here's the difference like you screw the breaks up on your car and you try to stop and they don't stop [laughter] right like screw the Halloween Costa Rica runs through the door and you can just you know be like oh crap oh I just buy one we screwed up the one we tried the bank you know\nOr I can take it to a mechanic and uh you know you trust that mechanic we car okay\nYes that's why maybe one day like we go in the same guy well what about if you have to try out a new guy it was a point where it went away so I Know you help your brother change breaks and stuff right\n[noise] yeah it takes all day he writes like your whole salaries God or not all we would we change the shocks and the brake pads that sounds terrible well yeah well\nIt's fun I write like

I had a a general idea\nBut I didn't know for sure and uh I saw him today and he he was a pirate [laughter] was it good it was it was okay\nBut I don't I I Would have done it a little better but it wasn't up to me oh my goodness classic absolutely class I wouldn't have done rather than that I Would have had him dressed up like Johnny Depp in pirates of the Caribbean ... this was like I had an hook\nType ... yeah yeah\nNot as good right putting the makeup on his son yeah [laughter] I live there [laughter] [noise]\nSo that would that would that would take you know having to talk to him\n[laughter] that's true hey at least I can say my break\nMy goodness yeah I can you have a useful skill I don't I rarely get more into this DJ jerk and firing Romans jobs covers Maryland for the Washington Post it gives us more details in Mexico and they they are forced an NBC Sports radio and the NBC Sports radio mobile apps\nCash them morning magazine was Tuesday through from eight to ten AM here on central Wisconsin twenty four hours or do you want to\nDo with a drawing for NBC Sports radio what the\nHell they're doing is complete one eighty one day after reinstating head football coach DJ Dirk in they have now decided to fire him this after the university president Wallace low that was student group students government department chairs the campus leadership\nMeanwhile legislators passed away and major league baseball Willie McCovey\nFive hundred and Twenty one home runs the hall of famer dies at the age of eighty claim crush on the Dodgers today was supposed to be the deadline to\nDetermine does he stay in or opt out of his two years sixty five million dollars remaining both sides of green do to extend the deadline to friday for pm eastern time Houston Astros declining brand became Fifteen million dollar option meet all the Yankees\nInstead have declined Britain gardeners twelve and a half million dollar option but they do sign into a new one year deal was seven and a half million dollars thirty seconds remaining the gay Minnesota one twenty five one\nUtah because we'd scoreboard that then be see sports radio DACA\nHey I'm Andy if you don't know me it's probably because I'm not famous but I did start screaming company called Harris the idea for Harry came out of a frustrating experience I had buying razor blades most brands were overpriced over designed and out of touch and Harry's or approaches simple here's our secret\nWe make sharp terrible blades and sell them at honest prices for as low as two dollars each we care about quality so much that we do some crazy things like by world cause German blade factory obsessing over every detail means we're confident in offering a hundred percent quality guarantee millions of guys have already made the switch to Harry's so thank you if you're one of them\nAnd if you're not we hope you give us a try with the special offer get Harry starter said with a five blade razor waited handle shaved Joe and a travel cover all for just three bucks plus free shipping\nUh went in front of them and and um deliberate it with them but at the end of the day was a lot of the president was the only one they could officially act on um you know we have a person closed the situation who told us yesterday that they presented Wallace low\nI'm with an ultimatum that they're from number one priority was to bring back TJ darken and that if he wanted to keep his job that\nHe had to bring back DJ dark and um and that he also had to retire at the end of the year he obviously made that decision to retire um in in collect another year or so of of salary but but\nThe bottom line is is that while slow came back today and made the decision after so many voices came out [noise] um and he made the decision that\nHe wasn't going to take the border reasons threat recommendation and and keep jerk and he was going to act in he obviously did that today by firing dark and himself um so we're gonna see I'm definitely a political power play ah continue to unfold\nI'm sure in the coming days I'm\nAs as low the president and the the board of regents um [noise] maybe all um have to question are there places and all of this\nCat with Roman stubs covers melon for the Washington Post ear ongoing deep to enforcement NBC Sports radio according to the media look you have members that\nWalked out yesterday or the the meeting between Dirk in a ... D and of course the team itself we find that it may have been as little as three players do you have any idea Roman asked to to support\nOr lack of that dark and a half from the team do we know\nWe've you know we've talked with a lot of uh people inside the facility um you know re such uncertainty yesterday there was\nUm a group of players obviously only three walked out but there is a group of players who are really uneasy about him coming back um I think the consensus among\nStaff members was um [noise] that that um they didn't necessarily want him to come back or that at least they didn't respect\nThem coming back I think the bottom line is is that the um process is kind of gotten away from Maryland so much that this team feels like it's been forgotten the kids feel like they've been forgotten\nUm even the McNair family is felt like [noise] um this has become all about DJ darkness become all about the university or has become all about power\nAgendas what have you and I think that team is really rallied around each other to the first eight games this season and I think one dark and came back yesterday and it felt like [noise] in Salt lake those divisions in those fractures [noise]\nAh we're gonna resurfaced so um you know tonight [noise] uh\nI think there was a sense of relief that maybe this team got some closure with with their can finally being fired and they could just get back to some normalcy that began in August [noise]\nHere's something I brought up earlier in the show and I'm only going to act on this roaming to me for it to get to this point where\nThe board of regents first reinstate then you know president low fires twenty four hours later what about the fact that DJ jerking himself\nHad an opportunity from August to now when he was placed on paid administrative leave\nTo do the right thing himself in just resigned I mean here's the guy that frankly probably couldn't keep doing the job right it's hard for him to walk into a recruits house tell the parents your son's health is it my best interest when one of his players died\nSo do you think that DJ jerking himself\nKind of looks like a coward when he could of just kind of kind of avoided this whole thing if he had done the right thing and had just resigned over the last three months\n[noise]\nYou know I you know that's probably not that's definitely not for me to say I'm to judge DJ dark and on that obviously there's five point eight million dollars on the table um he wasn't going to leave that\nUm and I also think there's a sense you know from him and maybe it's arrogance maybe it's ignorance who who ... who knows but I think there was a sense that maybe this wasn't the maybe this was totally out of his control that he um [noise] you know that he stepped into a extremely bureaucratic\nExtremely dysfunctional athletic department when he got here you under arrest\nDysfunctional this back like department as it's notoriously dysfunctional\nUm it has been for years and I think he really underestimated that had been at places like Stanford Michigan and Florida where these powerful athletic departments operate 'em so powerfully and and it seems like they're you know that Maryland I'm just isn't on that level so\nUh but he also was a young coach he did have a lot of oversight it maybe he didn't think he um was at a responsible but I think at the end of the day\nI'm you know he wasn't going to leave a five point eight million on the table and I think he really wanted to fight for his career he wanted to fight\nMaybe for the kids who still believed in him and and um you know I I I don't think him resigning was ever an option so now it's definitely not for me to say what the right move for him what happened but um I certainly think that it rubbed kids the wrong way that\nUm throughout these weeks that this whole fight became more about him and having him and became more about\nMaryland's administration and politics in it became less about the debt Jordan McNair and less about um the kids who were actually on the field so it's a sad deal and um you know I I think it's being felt by a lot of people for sure [laughter] hopefully\nIt it's over in the sense of DJ dark and of course is now officially out as the head coach of the University of Maryland Roman stubs covers melon for the Washington Post Rome and appreciate the inside my friend\nYeah thank you for having me appreciate it\nThere you have it the latest as to what is happening with that situation a DJ dark not a good situation I mean it really is a path to come down to visit and the president to appoint acting unilaterally unilaterally against the\nUh you know the voices in the board of regents who had\nBelieved the best move was to reinstate DJ dark and that obviously happened twenty four hours later with an absolute outcry occurring on campus they have changed that and he is fired and what that means is they are at this point\nUh keeping that Canada as the interim coach and we'll see what that means as you get that interim label taken off who knows at this point what it means and how they move forward with that situation but we have to go get too because we did not

[noise]\n\n\nDamn short\nShorts [noise]\nIt is our number two we know that the Houston Rockets that offer for first round picks deal along with some players for Jimmy Butler the Minnesota to rules apparently would not make that deal as it is not happening to this point for the latest that being run Ford in\nSees a bit of craziness here so the in today's game against youth tall\nJimmy Butler pretty much set himself out of the game now the timber wolves were calling it quote general store in is the host general sort is\nHe's just store all over what is general CERN is not doing this for the knee showing it to the wrist ... hip ... so the neck it's just general sorted out Sean\nWe've been around sports long enough to hear all the different excuses legitimate ones I Would say for a player being out have you ever heard the term general store guess\nI haven't\nNever ever heard the term general store ...\nWell that's exactly what it is now it's been six weeks since Jimmy Butler first asked for a trade and the three teams originally that he had asked for where the clippers the nets or the nix\nThe relationship Carl Anthony towns Andrew Wiggins that's dawn the owner had come out and said that he would bake the trade regards the fact that Tom Sybil didn't want to make the trade and now it comes down to something that I talked about earlier which was and I mean earlier like when we first heard that Jimmy ... wasn't happy what I said was\nWhy doesn't really bother just threatened to sit out\nIf Jimmy Butler threatens to sit out he's not helping Minnesota win games right and while it's an ugly tactic in the end it probably would work and he would most likely\nMost likely\nI Would say he would probably get traded because Minnesota's dot going to keep them on a roster if he's refusing to play other teams look at him and say well yeah that's a crappy move but\nIf we bring him here that proverbial change of scenery he's going to be a happy camper he's going to certainly play this general store and this will obviously passed but as of right now the belief is that he'll take the trip the Golden State which I Believe is we're Minnesota goes next\nPlay there but there is not exactly any sort of a guarantee that that's the situation if you're really this is the smartest thing you can do as much as I hate this tactic as much as I feel that it's wrong considering the Minnesota Tim rules are paying Jimmy Butler handsome ... not as if Jimmy ... is not making any money\nAnd as an employee of the team you probably should go out there and play considering you're getting paid\nIf you want your way in sports today the best way to go about doing so is to cause a stink right and we've had guys over the years in all sports cause a stink\nAnd one of the ones we've you know is the NBA is what it wants the Francis said to the Memphis Grizzlies at that time as the Vancouver Grizzlies don't don't draft me I'm not going to do remember that talk don't draft you're not going to go so that was a big\nThing and in the end I guess Vancouver or what are they I guess they didn't they didn't they traded whatever was you had Kobe Bryant the year he came out of high school the New Jersey nets at the time John Keller parties rookie years ahead coach in the NBA was all set to draft Kobe Brian ninth\nBrian said no don't draft me if you do have to go play in Italy for a year or whatever it is\nAnd it was an orchestrated shouldn't get Kobe Bryant drafted by Charlotte within a pre arranged to deal already in place for then Charlotte where he wasn't going to go any way to ship the rights to Kobe Bryant the Lakers the rest is history and I think it was ... out in ... Campbell where the guys that went back in that deal\nSo we've had this in the past and the NFL Eli Manning right we forget that Eli Manning actually on draft night two thousand and\nFour did hold up a San Diego chargers Jersey as unhappy and reluctant as he looked because he was officially a San Diego charger\nFor a couple hours before that deal was worked out where he is going to the New York giants Philip Rivers was originally a New York giants he goes of course to the uh San Diego chargers in a major swap\nJohn Elway sat at a Europe played minor league baseball so he didn't have to go play for the apples calls before he got his right traded to the Denver Broncos so guys have done this over time we're going back thirty Thirty years here and I'm sure there's other examples that we're missing that may have occurred past Thirty years\nBut if you are Minnesota you want to get something back because\nYou sit Zach levine you sent Laurie marketing Chris stone and a guy named Justin Patton but you did send some young talent to Chicago to secure Jimmy Butler\nAnd now you're on the verge of losing Jimmy Butler not even two years in because he's been there just one year\nYou want to recoup some of what you got I mean Laurie marketing looks to me the real deal ... means a decent player Chris done up and down but still I mean there's talent that was sent back to Chicago\nSo you want to get something back and forth draft picks from Houston may not be the answer because those aren't exactly going to be high picks at least the first two aren't going to be ibex because Houston's really good eater Jimmy ... mix here's this going to be even better regardless of the fact they started off what one in five this year\nBut if you're really popular and you want to get your way up to exactly right sit out don't play\nBy you playing what exactly are you accomplishing\nYou're being a good soldier right we know disgruntled we know you don't want to be there you've made a publicly known so sit down\nAnd apparently that is the strategy that Jimmy Butler may be leaning toward right now as he sat outside with general store and his and on the other hand not sure yet well what happened when it comes to the next match up which will be Golden State bought and Julie Butler's absence can you believe this one Sean Derrick Rose\nWho we all believe is on his last legs and I don't mean that sarcastically I mean he has terrible knees\nHe a parent we may be somewhat young again and may have found the fountain of youth\nDerrick Rose tonight put up fifty points in a one twenty

do some crazy things like fire world cause German blade factory obsessing over every detail means we're confident in offering a hundred percent quality guarantee millions of guys have already made the

sixty one three have sixty five games last year\nYeah they should\nMean unbelievable I I just don't understand how it is that they can be so bad yeah teams get off the slow starts there's no question about it and certainly that could be a case here thought\nMight take a look the pressures on there and Tony as much on that team isn't exactly a team built on youth right\nWhere it's like okay we we have a five year window here of winning I mean that we knew it was going to cause fairly quickly 'cause Chris Paul isn't the youngest guy not they bring a Jimmy Butler changes that equation a bit because Butler's Thirty years old so he's got at least four years but I tell you what\nTeam is continuing to play poor basketball Tony's not on the hot seat now and should not be but they would start heating up wouldn't it\nNo I don't think so you can't drink soda\nIs the salary cap situation that they couldn't science river reason right right\nAnd so uh [noise] yeah they're not as good as they were last year there defense just not as good I don't I don't care of you know bought Carmelo commercials an officer play we know that\nIsn't is expected to a degree I didn't think there would be one of five but they get you know all and ... and James Hard to miss time so [noise]\nBut they missed time goes on but they're playing inferior competitions to see how it will surely good enough true true and they've also I mean at the home field advantage is more prevalent in the NBA really more than possibly any in any other sport right I mean the NFL sure I get it but when you look at the Houston Rockets who right now are\nYou know ... ... they are Houston is only for at home right now that's crazy\nI mean last year the Houston Rockets at home or thirty four and seven\nTheir own for this or you know they're they're born that halfway to the mosque totally had all of last year at home in forty one games\nSort of rockets to you or the most disappointing team bus far for two weeks in the NBA thoughts for in the NBA the most disappointing to show them the wizards\nYes yes\nBecause the wizards to me or a team that\nYou know the wizards or a team that when you really break it down they should have won more games last year they weren't great last year\nYou you knew there are some issues with Bradley bill and John Wall last year you know those those really started to come out\nWhile they are a terrible team at one in six and that is shocking lives lost four games in her own you wonder what's going on in Washington can they blow it all up you know John what makes forty two and a half million dollars a year with the new deal the Houston Rockets clearly have to be the biggest disappointment at one in five now what's the biggest surprise\nI Want to throw that out those little

don't expect Denver to be with the names\nThat have nickel a joke itches a star I mean the guy is unbelievable you know maybe you don't really talk about him you don't hear much about it because the fact he's playing out in Denver but we've got he's an Eighteen intended six guy last year you know we talked triple doubles here's a seven foot or shot last year average six point one assist per game
