I wouldn't be your assistant coach and then you know the baseball ... Madison you know it'd be a baseball coach and the new hockey I mean\nThings have changed quite a bit but that was just sort of the norm so um you know when he first came to Wisconsin obviously has the head hockey coach but he was still a professor he had to teach classes over then as for him so he thought no fire department you know he talked golf class at odds hockey classes and so he was still\nSo the head hockey coach wow so when when you were coaching on the men's side as an assistant but now as the women that coach did you have to ever have to teach classes in the university\nYou know we don't we don't have you know that things have changed by member when he first was able to hire an assistant coach and then uh you know times have changed all of a sudden you know we're able to hire a second assistant coach which you know ... you know from the recruiting standpoint you know\nHelps out a great deal a lot of little things though it's a it's a different environment and coaching and whatnot but to you know back when he was going through it especially in Madison you know that just that was the norm\nSure mark Johnson was the pitcher and a shortstop growing up right\nYep I always tried to work in a curve ball and it's interesting as you watch your bird game last night and listen to all the things that are going on with them it's a game within a game\nAnd it's fascinating because uh you know is it normal I looked at it in the entertainment value you get one picture but then you put yourself in the manager's shoes and how many things that they have to go through and all the analytics now and the numbers and when do I take the picture out when do I put him in you know and\nYou know so last night you know when the Dodgers have second and third and you know they've got the you know the next batter up all he has to do with his ball to the right side of the field and they you know they get a rotten sure\nAnd so as you're coming to that if you're about to here's what I'm thinking and you know they ended up striking out and then they walk them next but to get to the pitcher and they try to get all the inning you get certain opportunities than hockey to score goals\nOne baseball it gets ... opportunities score runs and they gave up a classic example of how you can get a run and\nAll that long yeah but you know the brewers are playing while their pictures are doing a fantastic and so it's fun to watch carefully\nFun to watch much analytics in college hockey\nI don't think so much in college it's really become part of the NHL and you know dealing with the salary cap and dealing with player contracts the it's a big part of it because because they can come up with numbers and if you have a say two or three million dollars left on the cap you can go find a player for that value\nNumbers wise and you know analytical ... your role as the Moneyball thing it's a money ball thing totally so it started written in baseball obviously what the old days but it's the it's gone to\nAll sports now and so I Know NHL teams to hire ... people full time employees to do with those type of things that they need to do with\nTrying to find and put together the best roster they can under the salary cap issues that they have to deal with\nYou know when you're coaching too do you find yourself I mean I'm sure you do you see in Minnesota and they've got a Sarah ... brand serve a man of cats or whomever and you know okay I Want this offensive bear out when they're out on the ice where I Want this foreign line\nDo you find yourself doing an apple is that every single shipped because you like I mean most coaches like to do roller line we saw that with Tony this past weekend against PC you like to get them to roll lions play three phone lines consistently and get him into a group\nAnd a lot of games you love to do that because everybody feels a part of what you're trying to do and uh you know like our gave everybody a chance to play and play in a lot and they left the rank feeling part of a you know victorious game and so\nBut there's some games you know especially with the time I was in the media time also when you're on the road\nYou know ... matchups that you either want to have in your favor or you want to stay away from a that are very good for you so and you know another team has a real powerful line like Minnesota will come and a couple of weeks and they put together the three players and you know that are you don't want the players national type players and they're good Weiner so\nIf we have a chance you're going to have your best defense of groups out there you might put lines out there that can match up strongly with him but more importantly you know you need your defensive players to be out there to hold them down\nYeah badgers play really well this past weekend against Minnesota ... feet the bulldogs forty two and three to one for those that don't know these goals set her is Matty Rooney who backstop the United states women's hockey team to a gold medal in South Korea last year beating Canada in a shootout and\nYou've you've dealt with like Ninety shot and she only gave up what seven goals all weekend but defensively your team played well Christian Campbell was insisted all that much in gold but otherwise you're blocking shots chickenpox didn't really nice job defensively against the\nFBI was the night show on the team uh some footage of a Sunday afternoons game today before practice because we did a lot of good things and you know a bunch of the highlights that show the team was creating the scoring opportunities and you know you don't know if the talks going to go in or not but you know you keep bringing that and you know\nThe odds are eventually you're going to get a couple of course at time but uh she's a she was a great gold tender you know the weekend before uh\nAnd then when they played Minnesota uh you know they get to where she would guess who's gonna win ended up meeting them in a shootout picture she's able to keep the talk of our net but you know it's fun to watch the players always play six games now we've got better over the course of the last three weeks and\nUh I like to have to I like the way we competed all six period this past weekend it was a worthy opponent\nOr you know certainly up to play a couple of games later in the season up there and uh you know with their young players there'll be better so the challenge\nYou know just as if it was a was here so you know as you well know and you're going to go into this weekend you know whether you want to last the previous weekend if you're going to have success as a following game you have to do certain things and you have to play well and\nThat gives you the best chance the you know have a chance to win the game and if you don't anybody can be any different time and you know it's no different you know for instance first games friday night I'm sure they're going to come in or all excited [noise]\nMost of them have been a you know to our arena and so they'll they'll get excited with the fans and the energy and the building and so uh you know we're ... we're going to have to

Peterson and ... right\nAnd if they Robert ... if they've Roberts wants to take those guys and put 'em in off the bench than I'm sure counsel just kind of with Josh hater who by the way has ... I think they said that Iran has pitch back to back games I think six times during the regular season they've never used them three nights in a row\nAnd there was some concern the other night when they

hundred and thirty pounds\nNo maybe yeah maybe and I'm thinking God but he just I mean he's got all this thought out I'm sure he's already thought about every scenario that could possibly happen I mean last night they throw shot seen out there\nWho survived five innings gave up just for hits\nAfter ... allowed diner and runs that his wife started Dodger Stadium\nI don't really pushed all the

that's a three sixty batting average including for doubles and a triple offered to hey by the way I Love the fact the other day 'cause you and I talk about the spread\nOn Christian yell at John was given a switch and decided to bubble and on the third baseline\nI just wanted to stand up and cheer\nI Wish everybody does that he has to shift everybody says this shift the true in a baseball hit at the other way but to get on I mean\nYou think about it and I was ... who I Love by the way is an analyst was talking about that I think the other day goes every time you get a runner on base it's it's the start of a rally just get on base however you can get on base and I love the guy that is likely going to win the BP decided to go ahead and later on down the third baseline that was awesome\nAnyway we were talking about a ritual or I I just stand that popped in my mind and I wanted to do that out there because I scream and some people were going to do let him shift you know it's ruining the game I mean\nHere or there or not that's what the game is supposed to be about anyway we're talking about hills numbers who ... and we've been wrapped up by the top of that the brewers order this year though is that a little bit more success he's got a one fifty Iran to starts against the brewers the season\nSo we'll see that the margin of ... out there today is the little tenuous\nUh the Dodgers will not have the money run do\nAs a part of their batting order again I forgot it hasn't I mean\nCan't can't his way out of a paper bag and he's got the past fall issues so um\nHe has a has been set off the bench and it's gonna be Austin Barnes could that Arizona State is not any better at the point is bad too in five ah but he's apparently a defensive specialist so we'll see what we we go with this thing so it's going to be an interesting match up in a Dodgers kind of fighting for their lives\nThat's a walkie brewers find a way to win this thing tonight

that snapping\nAnd whenever that happened that's going to school and they certainly work out well for Becker Mayfield I also think that that's what you eat a a quarterback with the ... kind of jump started before they're the bears by\nHe's another one that's got a a really good match up this week and his New England patriots who've seen them get up on a path again we know he's going to have to throw in that match up she liked that and they've been able to create the players especially with Taylor Gabriel and the last couple of games so I like him a little bit this week as well\nAll right we're talking with Raymond ... who is our fantasy football expert from NBC Sports and wrote a world through under center I'm more alone [noise]\nUh All right there were some running backs ruled out last week a foreigner delving code Chris Thompson a name a few of those by the way a moody at most confidence and for being ready and and putting up some fantasy point two weeks out of\nWhy I think that those confidence is Chris ... and it seemed like he was he was very close to playing last week they ended up holding him out I mean perhaps because he has a very long injury history back they were just playing it safe but\nI I Would really expect them to be back this week the other two I mean who knows the fact that the Alvin cook was expected to play multiple national reporters came out and said that he was going to play it was going to be honest that count but then he was going to play\nAnd then after ... warm ups he's ruled out that kind of sound like a setback you've already had a few of those in his return so I Am I'm worried about him and I'm going to pick up will tell you the U.S Murray and in any of the leaks that he's still available and then work for that I mean we heard some optimism last week but we also heard some reports that he's going to be out until after the by all the way that we can\nSo there's really no way to know what is going to kind of play it by ear this week to see how the situation shakeout\nRehman a Bill Bill ... killing that are ... will continue to get a larger role in the office in New England so from your perspective and from a fantasy perspective how do you rank compatriots past 'cause we got ... Edelman James why Chris Hogan and Gordon how would you put them in order\nI think Chris Hogan is at the bottom of that list and you know the one kind of solace she took with Chris Hogan was well he snaps here say they're still playing the staff of the ... and disappeared last week is Josh Gordon popped up you know do check cut his role is going to keep growing well get nine targets last week and he played over eighty percent of the saps his role\nIs already there so if you're looking at the past ... even with Iraq and he had\nHe is the answer but I Do think there could be a question moving forward on whether Julian Edelman or Josh Gordon is the is the best patriots wide receiver for fantasy purposes I think that element is going to continue get the targets but\nCertainly he's not as explosive as a player and starts Gordon is you're not going to expect them to make as many long played maybe not even the as the ball in the red zone even though he did catch a touchdown last week\nSo I still have Edelman ahead of Gordon until we really see court kind of\nConsistently get the targets in that often but I think that that is\nAnd as we move over the next up All right let's let's wrap this up with ah some of the critical waiver wire additions that you may be looking for a week so\nI think you know you're talking about running back I thought we were going to talk about that aren't they Freeman that's got to be the top of the list now within heading into reserve surprisingly head and get their reserve you know he was ruled out on Monday for weeks and we thought All right well that it's going to let it go to the by now he got into a reserve you've gone for at least eight weeks\nSituation with Ito Smith their backup running back behind to have a cold and where he has a big opportunity here to the last two games without does on the frame and you don't have ten and Thirteen touches he's played right around forty five percent of the stats and those games and more importantly than that he's been the rent on that he had\nThree touchdowns in the last three games because they consistently up and use again inside the twenty and sided than inside the fight those carry that are the most important for fantasy running back so I think that is the best option out there on the wires do out there in a tunnel leagues if he's out there where you are I'm going to go out and make sure I get\n[noise] All right my friend for less than a best of luck to you and your Houston Astros and hopefully we've got a seven game series with regard to a real fear for the you know

talk about a mishmash of problems that New York giants are at the center of it all\nWhat do you think of that front NFL franchise is over the last fifty sixty years\nFor New York giants drop their white the Pittsburgh Steelers in the conversation I mean the patriots in the robber craft there have been one of the best run organizations for the New York giants have had that civility but my God this has this whole gotten out of hand\nIn a moment I'm going to play a little audio of John Barrow for the New York giants candidly\nTalking to the media seeing more than what you expect the usual owner to say but when you're wondering why you have an aging quarterback that has little left in the gas tank you might be volatile receivers that you're paying Ninety five million bucks to over the next five years\nWe can't control is emotions I think it's fairly obvious why John marrow would decide to be candidly honest when talking to the media\nBut some may get upset with this comment some may say that he's trying to silence players\nBut I think there comes a point when you look at the organization you say to yourself somebody has to take charge here and try to write this ship I mean this is an organization that's floundering the giants the last twenty three games are for Nineteen for Nineteen\nAnd they may have an old world running back for the next ten years but they don't have a quarterback for the next five games\nThat's the problem with the New York giants right now is what is the future I don't have that answer because the New York giants have not prepared for the future\nThe New York giants have been blinded by faith and Eli Manning toward this organization shot itself in the foot by not adequately preparing for life after Eli Manning\nAnd this is where at where one of the owners all get together the meat and the media is there\nJohn ... usually got people don't talk to why because the giants never had problems there stability the cameras they gravitate to Jerry Jones right the cameras gravitate to Mark Davis very rarely do you see America in front of the camera happened to talk about this crappy team take a listen to John Mehra\nTalking candidly about the New York giants their problems and even opening up about his Ninety five million dollar wide receiver\n\nBy will get you that uh will get shut down here in a minute\nBut I'll tell you what it is totally incredible to me that it has come down to the point where the New York giants are staring at another last season enrollees six weeks into it I have the sound I think All right let's let's play John ... earlier today talking to the media\nOr where she says oh why oh why oh\nWow how about that\nA little more playing a little less talking now shall I already right the headlines for the pundits out there should I write the headlines for the soft he's out there how dare you try to silence a player in the day and age of players kneeling how dare you try to silence a player by saying less talking\nHow can you take away the personality of oh del back in junior and tell them to stop talking he has a right to talk he has a right to say what he wants you know what I say shut up and do your job\nThat I think it's a deal Beckham junior hits his fault that statistically not doing great\nThat is yards per catch averages week that he's got a grand total of one receiving touchdown thrown for one we've got one receiving touch down to the first six games a year now it's not on him I don't think it's a case where he's not open\nI think a lot of it has to the fact that the New York giants have an inability to protect their quarterback and ... the inability to escape the pocket\nSo when you have two seconds or even three seconds before your pocket is literally collapsing around you\nYou know manning doesn't have adequate time to allow the outback and junior to do what he does well just get down the field so in essence soda backing juniors become a slot receiver who needs to care about seven or eight yards catch the ball and hope to run with it\nBecause there's not enough time productive junior to get down to feel deep and I'm not even sure you managed to get the football him at this point in his career what I call them yesterday noodle or manic and I'm not talking about pain I'm Talking about why I really did ... years of pay calling a noodle armed here on the show that was like turn\nDo we tell our next time we see I'm Sean do we bring it up dark she goes I remember we had that conversation and ah\nI didn't get to a party because he didn't seem to be in the mood to talk about\nFamilies don't don't bring up [laughter]\n'cause we have such a good relationship with them right now so I I don't want to do [laughter] I urge you realize armed these days\nOkay we'll leave it at that I just find that incredible and if you're John ... I Wonder if you regret not trading O'Dowd Beck and junior last offseason money but if you simply the New York giants should have traded outback and junior they should've\nI'm not denying he's a great talent so I'm not denying hotel Beck and junior talent wise is one of the three best wide receivers in football although you know what I'm starting to think the geometry Hopkins\nMight be in that conversation and maybe oh del drops a little bit I mean they told me around their Julio Joneses there I'm not gonna sit here and tell you a flat out to like him junior better than ... Hopkins I think there's a quite an interesting conversation bringing up both those guys now you can't go wrong with any one of those four guys I just mentioned\nBut the reality is what have the giants won and where you were in years\nBack in junior they've gone to the playoffs exactly ones in these five years and by the way this years already over for the New York giants\nI'll tell you right now and I'll bet you any blast dollar I have\nThat the New York giants are not making the post season this year fairly obvious at one in five and it's not as if they're getting any better they're often and the year where there's more often than any other year in football history there not scoring remotely close to what the league average is I mean there are averaging less than twenty points games only pathetic\nDo you break it down and you look at it\nOut back him junior as great as he is does not help the giants win games a wide receiver does not help a team win games right\nYou need a quarterback to get the ball that wide receiver\nYou needed office of line that gives the quarterback enough time to get that ball that wide receiver you need a running back deck and established a running game to give the quarterback time to get the ball that wide receiver you need a defense to get the take away the stops to hit the ball back to the fence to get the ball than the wide receiver notice a pattern here\nThe last man there that wide receiver bashing the wide receiver position I'm just saying I'm not so sure oh del back in junior is as important for the New York giants is Ninety five million dollars tells us he is\nHow do I know because they don't win with him\nThey don't want without him obviously right no question about it we saw that last year when he was hurt or early in the season to miss a lot of time\nLow KUVO what did he not planned for today\nCan be found anywhere in the dark side to discover\nBeautiful class that come together to read it on forget ... century [noise]\nIs over the force or the fundamentals forced off the road to you at the council and the U.S Forest Service\nWell I'm Glad you enjoyed it but I think it's that had back in time I'm sure they'd be careful getting as a\nI'm going to return the kayak\nIraq how about a factor\nGoing to find a neighborhood or can be a lot of fun to have that\n[noise]\n\nSo afraid of his things will get paid way too much [noise]\nThat we are doing the best worst than NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com oh well maybe I have not shown up as [noise]\nPeople originally thought he would\nNow had claimed he would come back during the Steelers by weekend there on that by week now did not show up on Monday and from the reports out there he does not plan to report this week despite what obviously he had said earlier maybe he shows up October twenty second\nWhen it's the next weekend may start preparing for the brown here's what I don't get\nHe should show up he should've showed up yesterday if he's planning on throwing up next Monday and here's why that's a free eight hundred and thirty two thousand dollars for the week\nLike well I don't get this like nobody's showing up next Monday ... that would just show you know financial responsibility because if you want self preservation the easiest eight hundred and thirty two thousand dollars you could make it the pie week because you're not playing\nSo I'm a little confused about this guy had advocated the whole time if you're going to hold out through the first six or seven weeks you have to hold out for the whole ten weeks before coming back and according to final six weeks or six games towards your free agency years he can turn the counter one year right\nIf it's about self preservation there's no point lay beyond bell walking through the door next Monday and he should wait again three more weeks before doing so\nBut here's the interesting thing about it\nThere's now a belief out there because the story keeps changing by the way I Want to call BS but a lot of these reporters they want to break every story I don't know how how solid gay really be when it comes to this because they're all wrong about this right\nBut everybody seems wrong ... bell situation it's way beyond does what he wanted his age your nose and everybody else to me just seemingly throwing stuff out there against the wall and one guy hopes his stuff sticks batches how I view what we're watching here\nBut what's happened is you know it's amazing to me the fact is that now the report is he may wait until after the trade deadline which is Tuesday October thirtieth to report because what that would do is shut down the chance for the Steelers to trade him\nAnd they care apparently do that until he signs his franchise tender so where are you know bill apparently right now is on tradable\nThere's also other things that have been written about this as to what can be done and one of the things that\nDow could report before we gate there were ... they want to Venus a two week roster exemption on him that would allow him to get some of the money he also can use those two weeks to get himself into shape\nSo I'm a little confused also by way beyond bells actions you and this is what I don't get the Korea told member on ESPN ES said quote I miss football when I Do get back I plan to give it my all I still didn't want to go out there and when the super bowl the Steelers\nThat's fine but that contradicts everything that you're sitting out for right like the whole fact is\nI understand you miss football but your little stamps you're against football is supposedly what's going to get your bigger payday\nNext off season because the more football you miss the less wear and tear on your body the less care even touch is you're going to have it for a drink six or so Kerry last year he already said I'm not going to have over four hundred touches if I don't get a new deal which clearly not going to get over ... you know touches because he's already missed six weeks\nI just think this could be very clean an easy way if you could just say listen I'm coming back to the last six games that's what I'm doing maybe enjoys the speculation maybe kind of like this game\nBut if you are the Pittsburgh Steelers and your players on that team at this point\nDo you care but I mean by that is this you always hear in the NFL people talk about what is that they say we only talk about the people that are here in the locker room right guys get hurt you become a persona non grata barely around the team if you're hurting rehabbing\nWaving a bell is barely remember this team I in fact he actually is not a member of the team because he has even scientists franchise tag\nBut\nHow much better with this team be right now if levy on bell was there and not James Connor\nThen when I ask about that as this James Caan or has played very well this year right I mean James Caan or has played actually really well and he's rush for seven touchdowns in six games he's on base for twelve hundred yards and Nineteen rushing touchdown he's on pace for Seventy catches were seven hundred yards\nIt you know what I'm saying is this Libya bell is\nBetter than James counter let's get that out of the white right or not there yet I I Know that lady on bells better than James Garner back way beyond bell may be the best running back and football and you talk about his dual Fred ability\n\nBut does lead beyond bell make this Pittsburgh Steelers team\nThat as of right now in the standings in that AFC North there are three two in one and they're in third place with way beyond bill they much better with lady on bell or they five in one or they foreign to\nWould they be that much better when you look it don't work that James counters Dunn\nIs a lack of weight off your belt the reason why the Steelers are three two and want you know the answer is no there hasn't been good in fact Ryan shaves deer missing has been a bigger loss of this team the lady on bells absence\nBecause they haven't been adequately able to replace Ryan ... linebacker when I think that's to be honest James Carter has adequately replace lazy on bell\nIn fact even better than adequate in fact right now he probably be a pro ball player if he rushes for twelve hundred yards at seven hundred yards receiving and has doubled is your touchdown he's going to probably will\nTry to tell you right now I don't think they've really mislead belt where if you're a Steeler player you're saying my goodness when the lady on there's there isn't as if they put it in a running\nBack 'cause every two or three or four carry it absolutely stinks garbage\nMen get your story straight to the media and also the lady on bill you want to play or don't you want to like\nGive us a day when you come back he's got to know what his mind when exactly he's coming back and play in the NFL for the Pittsburgh Steelers right the college football stereo so Wharf right now

the late receiver [noise] without next though so who's now down it looks like at Ohio State just chase young\nThey uh they got sophomore cameras a sophomore freshman but he was a five star or yeah yeah 'cause it just killed it um you know Todd ... second in Saks tied for second and tackles for laws\nAnd it's just just wreak havoc on I they haven't lost much when they lost that those because of Jaycee on\nNational comfortable writer for CBS Sports dot com Dennis ... joining us going deep enforcement NBC Sports radio he's it to believe that and they both so would have missed the rest of the season recovering from this court muscle injury or was he expected to come back at some point before a bowl game\nSo I think the thinking was well let's say he does come back what are your accomplishing if you come back for two games\nAnd then play Michigan and you know whatever in the playoffs and and that they can championship game because some point you've got to think about your future earning power I think that that he was thinking about their significant gains for Ohio State\nThink comes back or from Michigan I'm ... and he plays the Big Ten championship game in the playoffs I think he's proven himself you know why put your body on the line and I hate to be so crass\n[laughter] that's what these guys are thinking and I have no problem with him doing what he's doing for Christian DiCaprio Leonard for that skipping a bowl game because they've proved everything they they've had the proven tall and they need to think about their professional future got no problem with that at all\nAnd it's happened to him you know today beyond cloudy you couldn't even talk this temporary would say that he you know his effort is being used these last year wasn't exactly they're member quitting cold balls dropped in the draft because he seemed to kind of dog his last year UNC just kind of looking at the draft is not exactly as if\nThis is you know uncommon maybe it's on comedy because he's actually literally just dropping out of school at this point but as you said Ohio State is\nFairly well uh you know covered in terms of making up and they both ... and that's amazing considering he's a possible first overall pick or even the second overall pay but Dennis you know what you mentioned Alabama but I think the big thing was George's last LSU and how badly they play in two weeks 'cause they have a by coming up this weekend [noise] who's the quarterback of Georgia when they take on Florida\nOh I think that I think it's Jake from um I think all all that is from if you're talking about that all that is is a discussion point\nFrom LSU why didn't just in the fields play more insidious play more and one should be inserted I thought they had sort of them a little bit late but he didn't hardly play at all it was kind of a change up\nSo I I don't think it's come to the point where we're talking about who's going to START I mean maybe they got a package for just some fields but when you're talking about a guy who led\nThe FCC and I'm In accuracy is a freshman or as a pastor then you know I I don't I I think you know I I think Jay from getting the best chance to make its Florida was put it that way [noise]\nSemi the only one out there and you keep some of the big games ride the beat Miami with maybe ... maybe a Georgia and I'm Still like the ones that you're going to drop I don't know maybe it's I I just don't have people I think yeah you're on a day with our halfway through the season right now going\nOn in the show going to drop and I've got three had to um\nFor doing our halfway as his halfway point this week halfway all America to in my coach of the year halfway through the season or is it orange or say what you will about him\nHe's gotten results if a eat them something they haven't had in years that they've got a quarterback is the great no more of his game manager\nBut he's been kind of a raw raw rally you know rally guy at two interceptions get Florida that's OK comes up with some big plays against Georgia and all of a sudden ... people are talking about LSU and Alabama ... third maybe that's for a spot in the playoffs and read that or by that once you before the season so\nNo I I I Believe in them now because of the fence which always travels\nBecause of the office and which is good enough and it's very opportunistic um I think I got a shot I mean if if that game isn't it night November third I'll be very surprised\nCBS game I haven't seen that I Would hope it's at night\nCBS more stock on national college football writer Dennis ... joining us going deep enforcement and NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com Dennis in in your mind did I'm sure you play the hypothetical is 'cause it's like gambling frankly when you think about who's going to end up in the college football final four\nDo you see a scenario in your mind when you get kind of crunch the numbers were both the big twelve ... twelve or shut out\n[laughter] sure I can see that um I think you just look at the top for right now you could see it um you know Notre Dame game gets in that spot they take power five a spot so you know that's one\nI think you could argue that the tax wells might have played itself out the playoff already their best team that I see most talented Washington's lost twice or they're out\nThere that's last chances Oregon you got the ... if you're packed twelve you you've got to hope that Oregon wins out and that they're good enough you know I don't know if the committee now how does that look\nIn comparison to undefeated Notre Dame or taxes that has beat and uh Oklahoma and the top five twice it's well the one I don't know I'm just I'm just asking a rhetorical yeah because I don't think it looks very good\nAh so I don't think their chances are very good right now so yeah the big twelve\nImpact well it doesn't look good right now if you're either one of those conferences you're hoping for another day in Boston for starters [noise]\nDentist last question and you know we talked about earlier Alabama there's a gap in your mind between Alabama Ohio State and everybody else\nWhen you look at this Alabama team in let's face Nick Saban has had some incredible teams in his tenure in Alabama does we just wouldn't rank up there does the addition of two or put it over the top rather significant weaknesses that you see that may be an Achilles' heel later down the road\nA boat a state and all that I wrote last friday that this is mixed savings best team in his head at Alabama or it's one of the best of Alabama history now everybody says well they haven't played in\nThis isn't UCF schedule by the way they play they played a downloadable team they went out and scheduled that game at a neutral field I'm not going to downgrade I'm sure that they beat and everybody else on their schedule gives me\nThey got probably the best set of receivers next havens had ah for running backs we could start for anybody to it's great I think the biggest thing about this pain and people don't see it as Nick Saban has had the vision and I guess\nProgressive necessarily thinking that to make this past first off they're\nJust not on line to stay in the middle and patriots the path to set up the river and that's they're doing I'm not saying that pass a law than they pass on first town and they asked was set up the rug and they they take their shots down field next saved and who who railed against Arpaio for years yeah clearly embraced archaea\nEm to his his benefits and I don't think you know if if we're going to you know the team that's played them the closest is am which came within twenty two points Arkansas or thirty one the most since the championship game when one Clemson beat him\nUm a couple of years ago Twenty one months ago it's the most points against Alabama so that they won by thirty four discord sixty five to maybe be absolutely they can be the second half of teams but I think is we're sitting here now is the best teams ever had in Alabama\nAnd by the way they could have easily could have Seventy five against Arkansas that you might be a federal law you know the foot off the pedal in that fourth quarter Dennis ... make sure the fall Dennis onto an ad Dennis dot CBS and there's a little tidbit then is you're you're a hockey lover and

were\nNever want to get back to the closest situation at Ohio State here [noise] here's the thing though\nThe NFL has this rule where you have to be three years removed from high school before you go to the NFL Draft and it doesn't matter if you do a year preparatory school two years of college checking your play\nYou know I'm sad you know San lot football the way that the ... swan did play minor league football for the car with me on the top ten pick your player back in the day\nDidn't play the college ball like everybody else whatever it takes the post grad year two years of college life at shell did that when the valley forge military academy that went to ... for two years so it's been done\nBut now than it posted literally played two years and free games\nI you know does it start that trend are showing you mentioned Russia and Gary of Michigan oh you know why isn't he do to stay there and he's already been injured too right so like why didn't he just stood out start preparing for the draft\nGuys like him and they both get right to work out together you know you get a boy these top notch NFL tied trainers to work yeah I Would probably be better prepared than the college guys get prepared on campus Sean so why not start that friend\nYeah and we're Sean Gary has more to lose the game at this point right would you agree like I I Know like you're one of his biggest critics you want to see approves the more at the college level because it was the number one overall high school football group so he and his numbers don't really suggest that he's\nA top Fifteen picked but I watch a week in week out at least when he plays he's missed the last two games\nI think he's a legit top Fifteen back I I think he's improved greatly\nFrom his first two years but yes and so maybe you had something to the game maybe a couple of picks you can move up here and there but it's more loose spy plane\nI'll give you a better example that both posted in Gary because boats and Gary ... project ability watch when the national championship this year right\nHere at all over it Houston\nYou're not winning a national championship\nWho cares if you win the conference USAID award who cares at all over the top five pick okay\nWhat's funny is the poster came into this season as a top ten pick Russia and Gary came into this season as a top ten pick it all came into this season as a top by pick probably right\nIt's not as if they needed to play a single down this year to prove anything so reality is are we going to now started hearing and should we started hearing Shaun the whispers of maybe she'll be two years out of college jumped out of high school I tell you why when that rule was made the players coming out of high school physically did not resign\nPlayers like they had that book I Am one of these ... you know recruiting losers right I I'm On the site scout rivals whatever it is I follow all the recruiting\nThe kids coming out of high school today look like NFL players now yeah you have some guys who are tall and like you need to put on twenty pounds\nBut the other guys like Russia and Gary are you know both ... and those guys look like NFL players coming out of high school maybe at the bulk up a little bit right\nIn two years of college they can bulk up at major programs maybe at this point is starting to it's tied to start talking and learn and get from three years out of high school to two years\nBecause reality has done of these guys needed to play this year to prove their NFL value\nAnd you know what the NFL teams would probably say that's great not as much wear and tear on Nick ... Gary at all of her because those guys sat out and they worked with a nutritionist they worked with a trainer to the pros they worked with guys that know exactly how you need to be in terms of your health and you know your quickness and things like that your strength\nThat the NFL looks for\nSuch a waste a junior year for these guys anyway 'cause they were going to leave his top ten picks\nSo it makes you wonder Shawn what how they got backwards outta here except for the fact they have to be three years out of college or high school\n... exactly what was the thing is what shocks me a little bit is even though Nick closest injured and you probably wouldn't have returned until November\n... Ohio State in the running and and there's\nTwo in the national championship and that doesn't appeal to Nick both I understand I I understand why he doesn't want to\nYou know doesn't trust the staff training staff and and all that I as you laid out before I get get all that but we always thought that All right if you you're not in contention like a ... of you wants to go home and lose the second game is there any point in planes kid\nI mean he's got that play baseball next year anyway so what is the point right\nYeah you think the six million bucks already milk when there's anyway right so I mean maybe he's a different example but I yeah I\nDo players that like Michigan which I'm Gary ... Michigan still in it right if it was the second game maybe maybe that's what he says All right enough is enough\nI'm going to focus on getting ready for the NFL Draft but that's what so surprising about Nick ... the Ohio State has a chance to win a national championship and he's not going to come back for two or three games in a big tent championship game and two games possibly in college football playoff that that's still a lot of football that he's missing that's five games potentially\nI hate to say it this way\nBut if I'm Nate boats that I think okay I get myself a little nice\nAnd that does hurt Ohio State I disagree with what Dennis dot dot said that ... has played well\nRight but Nick Boles you can still use the top ten to pick on your defense especially if you're playing the Alabama's other worlds Nichols to you could find him inside on\nYou know passing down or whatever they they could find ways to play ... and the closer together and they have a lot of death on the line as it is Ohio State so I Do think it does hurt our state when they play the Alabama's of the world but anyway I just\nSay oh you're right he doesn't he's one of those dominant passers at all college football for sex and the first three games six tackles were lost in the first three games also is a leading tackle for the buck eyes at that point which is very rare for a guy playing you know a defensive end position I just think here's my problem with this all in calling me selfish\nIf it's up to me and I have an opportunity to win the national championship to get myself a national championship ring\nFor I guarantee my health\nFor a guaranteed cool thirty million bucks for my first NFL contract\nI hate to say it ...\nYou could you know take out an insurance [noise]\nYou've got thirty million dollar contract policy\nOr the both have the money\nWill show he's [laughter] no doubt about it for that and Joe ... dot net is uncle so [laughter] that's right it's just like the man exist Cooper get money from or describes his own little fortunate they didn't make quarterback money than the most adventurous [laughter]\nBut here's the problem though it's a thirty million dollar guaranteed for the first four years\nAnd I mean they both should be an NFL star for twelve years\nThey weren't talking Nick posters earning potential is a hundred plus million dollars right as a dominant past Russian NFL today you're making Fifteen million bucks I mean they both says chances of you know making you know nine figures in his career are really good\nYou are going to play the last five games and\nTake out an insurance policy brown Jr a million bucks it's a lot of money they get right I get it I understand it\nAnd the value of a national championship isn't exactly the value of your NFL career anymore\nThan we've seen guys dropping a draft because of injuries so I don't blame I Know people want to you know I\nLose three in the morning for taking my love [noise]\nVery avid editors do the Celtics radio network in Boston opening the season at home against the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers here let let's back up for a second and understand what this match bit okay it's this simple when you look at eastern conference there's three teams are we looked upon as the favorites right to free dominant teams Boston\nPhilly no argument right those are the three dominant teams right now in the eastern conference and the question is who is really the best\nHow does it end up falling together in terms of the seeding when it's all said and done his boss the number one seed does Philly or Toronto end up being a number to see their fight for that right that's going to be the fun part of the eastern conference is [noise]\nYou know it's like the land is getting ready for water like who is going to end up being the team that goes up against the war he's in the final forget demolished in Boston says the number one Philly in Toronto fighting for number two and number three well Boston at home\nFirst quarter there was a game Twenty one all about halftime Boston at a five point lead in the Boston just dominated the second half Boston roles to a Thirteen points second app advantage they win one oh five daily seven over one of those top three teams the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers\nWhat's interesting is Gordon Hayward comes back makes his fraternity was rusty I mean ten points five rebounds for twelve shooting for Gordon Hayward he wasn't great Kyrie Irving was utterly atrocious twenty nine minutes ... shot to uh fourteen from the field one of eight from three point line Kyrie Irving at seven points\nOut Harvard had nine points\nYet the Boston Celtics dominated the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers thinking about that you get Seventeen kept by points from Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward and you still waiting by Eighteen points\nPay the big game twenty three point nine rebounds\nMoore's off the bench and you know it was mark is more he's one of the Celtics more keep it somewhere else where is the Phoenix or somewhere else or whatever but mark Morris sixteen points in ten rebounds off the bench Boston with a dominant when rose year eleven off the bench\nOver a six or team when there are two best players had nothing in the tank and combine for Seventeen points they got what Seventeen points means Gordon Hayward will end the year averaging more than Seventy points a game Kyrie Irving will end the you're probably averaging eight points more than Seventeen points a game\nFor the season and yet they won by Eighteen now this is why I don't understand I don't think ... brown is a good coach the Sixers that goes I don't think Brett browns could come she got completely out coach last year in the postseason completely out coaches terrible why are they starting more careful\nI mean are they starting more careful sober J. J. reading because they have to justify taking them number one overall\nConsidering Jason Tatum for twenty three and nine and Jason Taylor was the third overall picking the same trap as more careful and in fact the Boston Celtics had that number one pick traded in for Philly Philly had to pick that ended up being Jason Tatum\nPhilly had a chance to tell you the meat or more careful and twenty four minutes to seven from the field five points to assess as a point guard playing half the game he was also a team was mine is sixteen on the court\nJesuit run against sixteen points in thirty minutes I'm just not understanding what prep round is doing doesn't guys start because he earns just start don't you earn a starting job in professional sports\nWhat is mark ... stone at the NBA level except being a top pick to deserve being the starter right now Jay Jay rhetoric is far more accomplished player that mark out faults now read it can come off the bench and be in the north and said I understand that\nBut it makes absolutely no sense if you're going to play been Simmons as a starter also play mark out faults market has been proven he can shoot\nThen Simmons isn't much of a shooter writer named Ben Senate candidate free border to save his life in fact you never even she was three pointers\nSo doesn't that make more sense to have J. J. rhetoric who is more of a bull's eyes from beyond the arc alongside Benjamin starting with mark helpful it's coming off the bench getting is NBA legs owner in before you consider making them a starter\nIt just doesn't make sense Sean I don't understand the philosophy of bright brown to just hand over the starting rains to Mark Kelly falls who clearly is not deserved it in his one plus years now and the NBA\nJay played thirty minutes and he's not going to play much more than that he does so they need to play\nTwenty minutes game and that's kind of what he did doesn't really matter who starts it matters who finishes don't but I think when it comes down to you want to set a temple in the game\nBut there's no way ... he he didn't really play point I mean they listed as a point guard but Simmons was the point guard eight ... but that's the that's the voice and citizens don't work Dan right they don't work together on a on the same ... you know team\nIt has to have the ball in order to be effective and the other is active without double\nOr as effective because they can't shoot\nThe scene for\nThe Internet is looked for a and B I just think Brent brown does know what he's doing\nBecause why should we can sit here and obviously that I suspect this team and understand that both instruments shouldn't be on the court the same time considering they cancel each other out\nSo why exactly would you even think about starting these guys these guys to get your right rhetoric gonna play more minutes insured he's a better place than folks but what's the point of having fooled start the game is Jay Jay right she'll play more minutes anyway\nYou know we were real generous to the east eastern conference by putting three teams in the next to get to the NBA final I think it's just a it's a race for one team at the Celtics that I don't think it does it does seem to keep people in\nThose two for fourteen to go to war for twelve rusty and they still want by double digits\n[laughter] do they shot six of twenty eight combined six of twenty six combined and they won by Eighteen points amazing big Seventeen points nine rebounds and seven to sit\nIn fifty four combined minutes for Hayward unnerving and they won by Eighteen over the top three eastern conference team\nDoesn't make a lot of sense I mean really\nYou're right maybe we are being overly generous and the thought of the Sixers being in the same conversation as Boston I look to be fair I have to see Toronto an action before I annoy them to be so poor compared to Boston I Want to see what ... you know I Want us to acquire Leonard brings the raptors you know I mean\nWhat are you got to see that going to be the Celtics come\nI Want to say before I'm gonna like flap on that one\nI got to say first I mean I don't disagree with you I think in terms of pure talent Boston there's no way deeper team in Toronto and that they're starting by as much more talented Ronald\nBut I just like to see it

is a game because it was a do or die situation\nIf you notice in credit counselor he made this point last night he said he is never putting the guy in a short inning situation earlier ball game in a do or die situation you're not throwing the whole\nThing of the season in one guy's hands you're doing it because they don't have the starting pitching this is why no one thought the brewers would be the cubs and the central this is why no one thought the brewers\nThis is the problem with the brewers that the idea is when we assessed teams you assess the team based on what's their starting pitching how their bullpen look and\nCan they hid and usually can they hit is number three\nBecause that's just the way we've been brought up that's the way I I've covered this game for twenty three years like this is what it is but what current council is saying is if you go on traditional baseball you'd do we don't have the horses that can match\nBut if you let us bring in somebody knew somebody ... somebody that's throwing the ball exceptionally well well ... I mean you're seeing what their their successes\nYou know they are in the ... they are in the driver's seat and they have as good a shot to win game for and if they're up three one the worst case scenario is they come back home and by the way at the beginning of the series I took brewers insects\nThere you go or baseball inside of set the average on his mind my whole thing was\nI thought of you you over used ... game one and it costs them game too and what I mean by that is the third inning for Josh I Know he came out and said that once you get two innings he was going to pitch in game two regardless but honestly I don't buy it in ... if you were going to pitch him in the game to game you know games even let him go another gun go another ending\nSo the thing that got me once you have to agree\nI I disagree that we were talking about the uh game three right where the\nOther one that gave one oh okay no I hate to pitch three\nI thought hater in game three was I got annoyed at the national media I got my first of all the Alex Rodriguez David Ortiz show that is on washable\nAnd views are hideous oh that is their hideous\nIt it's it's brutal ... some of the war stuff I've seen in a long time because here's what was happening yesterday I can I can just use that says yesterday's example\n... they brought charges hater and they had him warming to nothing once you warned him up you have to use it because if not you wasted a game and so they brought him and he was never going to throw more than twelve pitches\nBut because the the Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz had said well how do you not go to him in the ninth inning look at this ... it's going to blow up in space they all said it while they were getting them being the makeup on\nAnd what they're not giving credit and this is the point of why I'm bringing this up\nIs no one seems to recognize that Crick council is pushing all the right buttons right now\nYou know the old expression sometimes it's better to be lucky than good yeah I I'm not saying that it was the the the most efficient use of Josh hater in for nothing came in the eighth inning I understand all that but he also knows he does not win the world series unless he has Jeremy Jeffers pitching well\nHe used that situation and if you look at the box score Jeffries didn't give up around last night\nNo he did not know you're right about that and let's let's let's stay on the state of California and the city of Los Angeles and while the Dodgers are the talk of the city obviously with then being in the NFC yes the angels have opted out of their lease what I mean is this a possibly the start of them trying to relocate\n[noise] it it could be um you know what they're trying to do and it's a similar situation to what's going on in Seattle Seattle's lease was up and instead of signing a twenty five year extension they only send a five year extension remember you and I talked about that when I was in Seattle and\nThe situation with the angels as they have tried to get the\nThe uh city to pay for upgrades for the ballpark and then the city's up on it [laughter] and you know the city just to ... you know public financing for two football stadiums and this is the problem with calling it even though they're in orange county this is what caused the problem with calling it Los Angeles\nThey can't get any Los Angeles politicians to back them\nSo the only thing they could do was threatened and that's what they've done they opted out of their release I don't think they're leaving anytime soon I think they'll sign a similar deal to what the mariners did but it's just all politicking and the interesting part about it is with the angels go south\nWould they go play down south near San Diego I don't think San Diego which lost the football team should get two baseball teams or not I also think you're not leaving that TV market\nTo same reason the Marlins are never leaving Miami\nYou're not leaving these that television it's the same reason the ... are not leaving the bay area\nIt it all the situations are exactly the same it's why the Seattle supersonic leaving for Oklahoma City is considered one of the dumbest sports business decisions ever made because you went from market twelve to market thirty five\nYeah no it doesn't make you don't do the wall around the angels real quick I'm going to be selfish I'm a big show a a tiny fan okay he's going to be they have they have show ... and my trout and they're really they opted out of their release today but here's the thing what are your\nBut then it goes year based on what we saw a little tiny bat playing part time this year what are your expectations for his numbers in terms of being a full time ... playing in a hundred and forty five games next year I don't believe\nIn a hundred and forty five cameras from what I understand his rehab he's going to play and maybe a hundred games next year\nAll ... so he's not going to be there in February well it\nDepends on how his rehab goes but I don't think he's going to be about a hundred percent ready to go um you know if when it when it when if he's going to hit while he's having his arm 'cause he's having the Tommy John surgery so that he can pitch and twenty Nineteen twenty twenty twenty Twenty one right and the idea is if he's going to do that\nUm he has to temporarily a lot of this there is going to be times when he has to go on throwing programs while he's ... so it's going to be a weird thing for him I I Would not say a ha I Would not play fantasy on wait outside in the\nTheater was funny but I wouldn't do it said that he was a fulltime hitters you forty home drunk on your mind\n[noise] a home runs is so cheap these days I I Would say yes\nTo the ballpark\nYeah but the thing about autonomy is I think is a phenomenal talent I just think if he is not right you just wonder what the pain of the rehab friday to affect his swing you know if his mechanics reflect to so many mitigating factors I wouldn't bet on a timely next year\nI real quick set a Miami they think they have a solution to that hideous yeah they got rid of that ad where's the heck they want to call that sculpture how are you going to be able to not move that outside wasn't that big fight last year about it to where like the artist one and he had the right to keep it at ... what changed now\nI Know they they've decided I think they pay them off and you know I think it's ... like the first things Derek Jeter did was he fired the PR guys and the play by play announcer\nAnd Jeff coat on one of the strangest things like worrying about the product and\nWhat are you doing where they made the trail I thought it was the worst thing in\nBaseball the worst thing in baseball today was you took an eighty five year history called the Syracuse Chiefs the AAA affiliate up in Syracuse New York the Mets bought the team and they changed the name to Syracuse Mets\nWatch that's oh it's awful I'm doing it for the article I'm crushing tomorrow on Fort stuck on it is for eighty five years\nEighty five years they were the chief now I'm not saying they had to stay the chief if you want to change you want to call and something else my favorite minor league team is the ranch will cook among the quakes like call them what ever you want don't call them the Mets\nAnd you're insulting and Syracuse as somebody who attended there Syracuse is a Yankee town it's a Yankee and Red Sox town it's not a Mets town\nI Want to leave your fans I hadn't thought he played for the rancho ... among the quakes I Love that joke asked a lot I used to do their play by play when I was like buddy that was an angel this little angels that team I think so I think\nOur baseball instead of several students getting next weekend were by the way we closer to our one hour special\nThe other one hour special will be a lot of fun baseballs in trouble but\nYou know to call a truce on me [laughter] that's right see I thought you'd actually brother you got it\nOr baseball inside of step it always fun talking to who gets a little baseball here the red Sox are they in control how do you handle the crust sell

one eighty shoe career past attacks who's county [noise] I Am\n[laughter] you can't make that up he throws ten interceptions he and his very short NFL career and I just at this point don't understand\nWhy the guy even goes into games right now I'm a little confused as to why Nathan beat him and he's still on this roster\nIt's daunting to me he is awful I hate to say look I don't want to criticize people if they deserve to be criticized and no one deserves to be criticized more when it comes to being an NFL quarterback the nascent Peter and he's not an NFL quarterback that simple shock your bills fan you watch this nonsense you know he's not an NFL quarterback\n[laughter] I Can't I Can't stop [laughter]\nI hate this whole Nathan heritage of I mean [noise]\n\nThink it does it is is that why you guys doing games\nHaven't haven't seen it in offshore McDermott I haven't even seen enough of this guy chemical who makes the decisions that Terry McDermott you cannot Baptist men on your roster get rid of all\nWhat you need to do is this case it's very simple\nYou have to do what happens now in the ... in the movie or you don't like the movie but uh what was it called again a Moneyball okay you know like Moneyball\nButtermilk in Monterey and Brad Pitt I mean really you you go to Brad Pitt is a [laughter] Billy Beane really really be looking to come on [laughter]\nHere's remember what he does win or the late Philip Seymour Hoffman playing a was an art how I think it was yeah\nLike genetically pencils in\nCarlos painting at first base\nSo what does Brad Pitt do he literally just trades Carlos pain you just about our health care pencil minimal wind up anymore\nSo maybe what needs to happen is Kimberley Roula got divorced\nTo just drop Nathan beat 'em and just released and he's not going to be met so that show that German kept playing what's amazing is like apparently this is becoming an issue in the locker room and I'll tell you something I Believe it and here's why our good friends Rodney Harrison comes on the show and sort of off course part of a safety blitz weekends your many of the same affiliates\nHas talked about the fact that players want to win and a player knows which players\nAre most capable of helping team went\nSort the coaches want to be stubborn and continue to put Nathan Peter been out there there's no way the players back then move because they know he's not a good quarterback\nYou cannot keep putting out there or else you lose the team and I'm not sure what the ah the dynamic is behind Sean of Germans motives to continue putting them out there because the guy is done nothing but fail he's not an NFL quarterback I'd rather have\nAnd unprepared Derek ... who's been sitting in his boxer shorts eating bond bond on his couch watching soap operas on daytime TV in semi retirement start next weekend rather than a prepared nascent Peter because they prepare Nathan determined he's a target machine\nThey should I agreed to an end the bills should have had a better choice when Josh Allen went down\nThey signed Derek Anderson way too late they should have thought about a mentor for Josh on once Nathan Peter men had\nTo think or in Baltimore right ... it's inexcusable for dates and Peter Mitt to continue to play football for the Buffalo Bills I'm Sorry he's shown that he's not as you stated earlier\nAn NFL quarterback what more do does anyone have to see in the does organization who makes those decisions of its actual McDermott I don't know\nBut it's incredible it honestly is incredible to me that this guy still has a job ... if you look you you want to win the football games the Buffalo Bills are trying to win football games is ...\nI'm not to try to in football games with Josh Allen his quarterback because he's not an NFL quarterback as we speak right now\nNo one here he will be\nBut [laughter] I mean you you can't tell me that they're trying to win games when when Josh Allen is so limited that they only have him for Eighteen times in a in a football game\nThat's what I don't understand\nHow they actually are in that game but here's the thing of ... like you want you want to give this guy a chance you want this guy to have an opportunity\nTo develop but yet if you're only going to have him throw Eighteen times in a game because you're afraid to let the ball come out of his hand in the past because you just don't know where it's going and chains are may end up in the other teams hands\nIf you're not going to live with the lumps in bruises of as a you know a raw rookie quarterback you might as well and the merit out because you need them to get that experience what kind of experience has been getting when he barely reading defenses when he's barely dropping back to pass\nHere's what makes no sense to me then also\nDid you see the report on Sunday Morning football shows\nAre unlikely to trade ... according to the eagles because McDermott values\nWhich ... is a good football player and they're not going to train them did you see that report I did see that yeah okay\nSo he's not willing to part with which I'm calling because one of the better players and they're trying to win obviously right that's what he's saying we try and went right we don't want to work with a a good football player who could help us with them why they think they're on the roster\nWe see on the roster I I don't understand it how are you trying to win with Nathan Peter even as a backup quarterback\nThey can't help you can only are you seeing I mean I don't I don't it doesn't make any sense\nHere's the thing doesn't this make you question the judgment\nOf brand and being the GM who trades away a gym a carrot and leaves the team with the roar of quarterbacks English drafting Josh Alan and no they don't hire for Josh Allen\nRight no major exactly what it would help I think\nAnd you have Nathan ... through through five picks and a half\nAnd his only action last year as a starter and you're going to the season with those two guys a quarterback you get rid of ... you know Toronto Taylor you get rid of aging McCarron and you go into the season with Alan and

season Celtics and Sixers from Boston warriors and thunder from oracle and\nI always say that the NBA season doesn't really begin until Christmas\nChristmas Day is when you can really start paying attention to the NBA remember when they had the lockout shortened sixty six games season\nThat was perfect the only thing negative about that was it there were some you know back to back the backs or three games in in four nights a teams don't like that I get it but sixty six games more than enough for an MBA she's eighty two is just way too much especially when you consider the NBA is do wars when it comes to ...\nEvery year only five to six teams have a chance to win the NBA championship so we all know the regular season there's a bunch of baloney\nBecause in the postseason in a seven game series in the NBA the better team wins probably eighty five percent of the time I just made that number up but it sounds good\nThink about it in the eastern conference Institute teams you saw here tonight Boston in Philadelphia I don't trust a lot though I don't trust Washington these are the only teams that have a chance to go to the NBA Finals\nIn the west it's your traditional

I mean it's only the diehards that watch hockey\nThe duty average sports fans not tuning into hockey game just doesn't happen twice hockey's the lowest in the ratings\nBut the NBA\nA combination of not as much as the NFL which carries everybody sports fans non sports fans it's just it's everybody loves the NFL\nAnd yes we can talk about gambling fans do all that stuff that comes into play\nBut the NBA has their hard core audience\nTo why when I joke that the being the show about NBA Twitter but they also carry a pop culture audience the NBA players are more mainstream athletes than any other sport\nMany Machado was running the bases\nAnd as a base water running the first you always run to the outside part of the bag\nBecause you want to protect yourself you don't want to step on a guy I think of many Machado rent on the inside part of the dirt and after stepping on the bed with his right foot dragging\nHis left foot to wipe at the leg of have to say that you are\nAnd then walked back at him\nIs so intentional I Would throw at many\nMachado the next time is up at the back but the problem is they tie game and the extra in extra innings\nThat is such a dirty play\nBy many Machado a guy who doesn't even hostile to first base traditionally now he decides to hustle and take out the lego pays used Aguilar\nDo intentional\nI'd like to see somebody told me that that was not intentional\nI'd like to see someone tried to defend that wow\nI'm treated that that was one hundred percent intentional by Machado\nHash tag and they'll see us\nWilliam it was so good at the tweeter\nMachado rag his foot\nAnd purposely kicked\nOne hundred percent intentional\nThat is on believe we'd dirty\nIf he gets thrown it if he gets thrown it\nWhen I have no issue with it\nIssue with it\nEight five five three two three four in BC it's eight by by three two three four six to do and this is the guy who's trying to get a huge contract next season or in this off season\nYet good luck to the gym\nAt science a guide to like an eight to ten year deal\nI Would not give him more than five\nIdeally like to give them three\nWater what a punk move water polo while what a punk move that was my\nPunk move right there I'll say to a space to that as a punk move\nWe were talking college football before many shouted decided to be a punk I'm going to say that all my punk is a fun word\nPunk yeah it's a fun it's a fun word right yeah by the way you know the first baseman he had his foot pretty high up in that backwards kind of unusual\nYeah he still has he still wasn't on like the middle of the bag though their bills high up the you know normally when you're catching that at first base you're up against the bag not yeah you're on the ... your your photos on the side of the back on his way up high on the back ...\nI'd have to go look back at every single play that he's just Aguilar me to see where he traditionally\nHolds his foot on the bag I Know he's not exactly the um swift this guy over there that's a polite way of saying he's fat so I don't know where he traditionally positions his foot to stretch for the ball a but that\nPlay by Machado that is one hundred percent intentional yes absolutely he ran on the left side\nHeels fans when you guys when you're watching baseball there's that white line in the middle of the dirt that signals the foul line that there is the baseline grass on your left grass on your right what line in the middle\nThere's also a little bit of there's a line on the outside 'cause that's like you're running path many Machado ran on the left side of the ...\nThe left side that\nWas intentional you never do that as a base runners why because you want to protect your own feet that's why when you're running a first base for a play at first you run and then you drift over to the right you know you turn to the right because you don't want to turn into the left because you're turning to the left\nThen they can tag you but I mean there has to be intense obviously you can turn on the way he wants to common misconception but you're trained to run to the right and turned to the right\nMany Machado rent on the inside left part of the base won a hundred percent intentional\nThe hundred percent intentional\nGet a tweet coming in at me or don't disagree but how many first baseman do you stay on the bad like that\nThat's the point you're making their exactly is it Aguilar was standing on the back room higher up as NGOs high up yeah but I got I got to go back and watch every play the guy makes at first I don't know\nI don't know how he normally stands on the back maybe that's just what do you normally does and it's very weird and maybe you know maybe that was ... reasoning either because is because he had a because he always does that he always stand like that\nAnd so maybe Machado is uh he's just trying to send a message like hey we're tired of you standing there like that on the bag because we're going to step on you by accident and dangerous way to getting out at first base\nSo I'm going to spike you intentionally or I'm going to kick you intentionally to send the message\nBut\nMan that was a ah that that was no mercy sweeping the leg right they're mature enough yeah yeah\nBecause he was a slow runner and yeah you need to keep us put them back for a long time meeting like don't even touch this bag kind of thing he was may block in the back to a certain degree\nWell then again it's probably not expecting much out of a run because I don't usually dogs that out of the box and doesn't even try to run to first base on a play at first so maybe it wasn't even expecting much out of run\nSomeone's got to put together this I don't know how they do it you know like a a bleach report and all these other like media outlets put together with the videos where they they cut somebody's head on the character\nRight you know what I'm Talking about someone and I'm I'm I'm going to come up with us now so before his Twitter let everybody know that Scott side and burn came up with this idea I Need Dave Roberts as ah the cobra ... leader [laughter] talking to many Machado as Johnny Lawrence to say sweep the leg\nAnd then you know is there a problem Mr Lawrence no sense\nThat's what I Want to\nThat's what I Want to say because Johnny ... that's a tiny David Roberts is John ...\nAnd I need Manny Machado as

the NBA Finals where they had no business and you know it's funny I said last year\nYou know midway through the season or you know post season run that were brawn James would win the NBA title with that capital years team last year it will be the greatest single accomplishment of his career\nIt really work\nHe did everything he could to get them to the finals and they were just way over mashed

tighter first pet\nShooting video\nOn authorized really\nBeing sold Boston Metro Boston metros who first reported the incident that\nAn employee was being removed by security\nAnd it could handle it fine could be a fight on the shows but nothing more and this is something that uh you know could be the Astros maybe stealing signs or this could just\nBe the actress trying to look in on the picture to see if\nThey're using illegal substance\nNow the Indians filed a complaint with major league baseball because they said the Astros trying to film their dogs\nAnd major league baseball's I've been to that\nAstros swept the or\nThere was a report that the eighties in August believed that the Astros were reeling signs during their name\nBut they don't know if that issue ever got looked into\nStealing signs all that stuff you know the guy on second looking in and it's all that's all gamesmanship when you start to utilize technology that's where I get bothered because that's not that's not gamesmanship that's actually cheating\nAnd decision um this is an exclusive to the Houston Astros\nYou know and people want to talk about\nYou know Red Sox fans want to go up against a um\nYou know going up against the Astros have the actual shooting Red Sox have had their own\nWeren't they find for using a apple watches\nTo steal signs\nMajor league baseball last year\nHad to find the the Red Sox for signs dealing member a\nBunch of years ago where the red Sox pictures in their bullpen were actually watching the game on TV\nAnd that led to some change\nLook I'm not trying to point fingers at at one team or another I'm just I'm just trying to say that every team does something\nEveryone's looking for that itch everyone's looking to see what they can pick up on center so much video available these days\nThat it's kind of hard not to\nWhether it's just a pitcher tipping pitches or it's a third base coach relaying science not that we're laying signs have anything to do with any more because obviously the way that analytics and saber metrics have taken over baseball there's no more but I think there's really any stealing there certainly isn't any hit and run\nSo why didn't the steel aside the only thing that you should be looking on for your videos stuff is it the picture of tipping ...\nThat's what you should be focused on\nBecause that's something that could legitimately give you an advantage when you know what pictures coming is at a fast ball was it a break in\nHere was Alex quarter after the game though on the ... allegedly stealing signs remember he was there bench ... he was on their bench last year the bench coach\nOr somebody mentioned to me right now I'm\nNot saying I'm over here you know building with that too but I just heard is that you have any concerns but tons of installing or anything like\nI'm always concerned about the brother of mine\nWe were doing the job training the advantage in the details and now we don't get caught up on the whole thing of the time so now we're trying to slow down and do we feel there's something going on where you would advise\nAnd that's all it is the right way to handle it why do you think a catcher ... goes out and talks to the picture when there's a one on second base\nThey change the signs\nThat's just what happened in baseball\nIntelligent enough to do that then you deserve to get your sons don't start shooting\nEight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six due to\nRed Sox lead to games to one\nAnd that was the ashes even at two games

[noise]\nBetter than the drama in July of last we don't want to talk about a mishmash of problems that New York giants are at the center of it all\nWhat do you think of that front NFL franchise is over the last fifty sixty years\nThe New York giants are out there right the Pittsburgh Steelers in the conversation I mean the patriots and the Robert ... having one of the best run organizations for the New York giants have had that civility but my God this has this fall gotten out of hand\nIn a moment I'm going to play a little audio of John ... of the New York\nGiants candidly talking to the media say more than what you expect useful owner to say but when you're one in five you have an aging quarterback that as little left in the gas tank\nYou have a volatile receivers that you're paying Ninety five million bucks to over the next five years that seemingly can't controls emotions\nI think it's fairly obvious why John marrow would decide to be candidly honest when talking to the media\nBut some may get upset with this comment some may say that he's trying to silence players\nBut I think there comes a point when you look at the organization you say to yourself somebody has to take charge here and try to write this ship I mean this is an organization that's flounder the giants bill last twenty three games are four and Nineteen for Nineteen\nAnd they may have an old world running back for the next ten years but they don't have a quarterback for the next five games\nThat's the problem with the New York giants right now is what is the future I don't have that answer because the New York giants have not prepared for the future\nThe New York giants have been blinded by faith and Eli Manning tore this organization shot itself in the foot by not adequately preparing for life after you lie manning\nAnd this is where Iraq where one of the owners all get together to meet and the media is there\nJohn ... usually got people don't talk to why because the giants never had a problem their stability the cameras they gravitate to Jerry Jones right the cameras gravitate to Mark Davis very rarely do you see a merit in front of a camera habit of talk about is crappy team take a listen to John marrow\nTalking cared about the New York giants their problems and even opening up about he's Ninety five million\nFever\nBy will get you that will get us out here in a minute\nBut I'll tell you what it is totally incredible to me that it has come down to the point where the New York giants are staring at another last season enrollees six weeks into it I have the sound I think All right let's let's play John ... earlier today talking to the media\nWere she we create\nWow how about that\nA little more playing a little less talking now shall I already right the headlines for the pundits out their show I write the headlines for the soft he's out there how dare you try to silence a player in the day and age of players kneeling how dare you try to silence a player by saying less talking\nHow can you take away the personality of oh del back in junior and tell him to stop talking he has a right to talk he has a right to say what he wants you know what I say shut up and do your job\nThat I think it's all built back in junior hits his fault that statistically not doing great\nThat is yards per catch averages week that he's got a grand total of one receiving touchdown thrown from one we've got one receiving touch down to the first six games a year now it's not on him I don't think it's a case where he's not open\nI think a lot of it has to the fact that the New York giants have an inability to protect their quarterback and ... the inability to escape the pocket\nSo when you have two seconds or even three seconds before your pocket his literally collapsing around you\nYou know many doesn't have adequate time to allow old out back um junior to do what he does well we'll just get down the field so that's been sold out back and juniors become a slot receiver who needs to care about seven or eight yards catch the ball and hope to run with it\nBecause there's not enough time productive junior to get down to feel deep and I'm not even sure you managed to get the football him at this point in his career what I call them yesterday noodle or manic but I'm not talking about pain I'm Talking about Iraq already did ... years of pay calling a noodle armed here on the show bouncy like turn\nDo we tell our next time we see them Sean do we bring it up dark she goes I remember we had a conversation and ah I didn't get to march because he didn't seem to be in the mood to talk about\nThat leaves don't don't bring it up [laughter]\n'cause we have such a good relationship with in right now so ah I I don't want to point out [laughter] or do you feel as armed these days\nOkay we'll leave it at that I just find it incredible and if you're John Mehra I Wonder if you regret not trading hotel Beck and junior last offseason money but if you simply the New York giants should is ready to do that by junior they should've\nI'm not denying he's a great talent I'm not denying old job back in junior talent wise is one of the free best wide receivers in football although you know what I'm starting to think ... the Andre Hopkins might be in that conversation maybe it'll gel drops a little bit I mean they told me around their Julio Joneses there I'm\nNot gonna sit here and tell you a flat out older like him juniors better than the ... I think there's a quite an interesting conversation bringing up both those guys that you can't go wrong with any one of those poor guys I just mentioned but the reality is what have the giants won and we're ... we're in year number five votes backed him junior\nThey've gone to the playoffs exactly ones in these five years and by the way this years already over for the New York giants\nI'll tell you right now and I'll bet you any last dollar I have\nThat the New York giants are not making the post season this year fairly obvious at one in five and it's not as if they're getting any better they're often and the year where there's more often than any other year in football history there not scoring remotely close to what the league average it I mean they are averaging less than twenty points games only pathetic\nSo you break it down and you looked at it\nTo back him junior as great as he is does not help the giants win games a wide receiver does not help a team win games right\nYou need a quarterback to get the ball that wide receiver\nYou needed off the line that gives the quarterback enough time to get that ball that wide receiver you need a running back deck an established a run again to give the quarterback time to get the ball that wide receiver you need a defense to get to take away the stops to hit the ball back to the fence to get the ball than the wide receiver notice a pattern here\nThe last man there that wide receiver my bashing the wide receiver position I'm just saying I'm not so sure oh Darryl back and junior is as important for the New York giants is Ninety five million dollars tells us he is\nHow do I know because they don't win with him\nThey don't win without him obviously right no question about it we saw that last year when he was hurt or early in the season and missed a lot of time\nThis message brought you by the American Institute of certified public accountants and the ad council\nPeople are always talking about the stock market always looking to invest in a good opportunity something what the potential to grow the what if you could invest in the future to teachers\nNot the kind of thought would you want to make money\nBut I thought

hour during the day is worse than NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com oh well maybe I'll do not showing up as [noise] people originally thought he was\nValid claim he would come back during the Steeler spy weekend there on that by week now do not show up on Monday and from the reports out there he does not plan to report this week despite what obviously he had said earlier maybe he shows up October twenty second\nWhen it's the next week and they start preparing for the brown here's what I don't\nGet he should show up he should have showed up yesterday\nIf he's planning on showing up next Monday and here's why that's a free eight hundred and thirty two thousand dollars for the week\nLike this like they'll be showing up next Monday of your way beyond doubt that would just show you know financial responsibility because if you want self preservation the easiest eight hundred and thirty two thousand dollars you can make a pie week because you're not playing\nSo I'm a little confused about this I have advocated the whole time if you're going to hold out through the first six or seven weeks you have to hold out for the whole ten weeks before coming back and our crew in the final six weeks or six games towards your free agency years he can turn the counter one year right\nIf it's about self preservation there's no point lay beyond bell walking through the door next Monday and he should wait again three more weeks before doing so\nBut here's the interesting thing about it\nThere's now a belief out there because the story keeps changing by the way I Want to call BS and a lot of these reporters they want to break every story I don't how how solid can really be when it comes to this because they're all wrong about this right\nLike everybody seems wrong on my way beyond bell situation it's way beyond does what he wanted his age your nose and everybody else to me just seemingly throwing stuff out there against the wall and one guy hopes his stuff sticks batches how I view what we're watching here\nBut what's happened is you know it's amazing to me the fact is that now the report is he may wait until after the trade deadline which is Tuesday October thirtieth to report because what that would do is shut down the chance for the Steelers to trade him\nAnd they can't apparently do that until he scientist franchise tender so way down bell apparently right now is on tradable\nThere's also other things that have been written about this as to what can be done at one of the things that people are saying you know could report before we gave the Steelers they want to use a two week roster exemption on him that would allow him to get some of the money he also can use those two weeks to get himself into shape\nSo I'm a little confused also by labor bells actions you and this is what I don't get the Korea told remember on ESPN ES said quote I miss football when I Do get back I plan to give it my all I still didn't want to go out there with a Super Bowl the Steelers\nThat's fine but contradicts everything that you're sitting out for right like the whole fact is\nI understand you miss football but your little stance you're against football is supposedly what's going to get your bigger payday next off season because the the more football you miss\nThe less wear and tear on your body the less care even touch is you're going to have you have four hundred and six or so carries last year he already said I'm not going to have over four hundred touches if I don't get a new deal was clearly not going to get over ... you know touches because he's already miss six weeks\nI just think this could be very clean and easy lazy I could just say listen I'm coming back to the last six games that's what I'm doing many enjoys the speculation maybe kind of like this game\nBut if you are the Pittsburgh Steelers in your players on that team at this point\nDo you care but I mean by that is this you always hear in the NFL people talk about what is that they say we only talked about the people that are here in the locker room right by guys get hurt you become a persona non grata barely around the team if you're hurting rehabbing\nBell is barely a member of his team I in fact he actually is not a member of the team because he has even scientists franchise tack\nBut how much better with this team\nHave you on bell was there and not James Connor\nAnd when I ask about that is that James Caan or has played very well this year right I mean James Caan or has played actually really well and he's rush for seven touchdowns in six games he's on base for twelve hundred yards and Nineteen rushing touchdown he's on pace for Seventy catches for seven hundred yards\nIt you know what I'm saying is this Libya belt is better than James counter let's get that out of the way right or not there yet I Know that lady on bells better than James Garner back way beyond bell maybe the best running and football and you talk about his dual Fred ability\nBut does lead beyond bell make this Pittsburgh Steelers team\nThat as of right now in the standings in that AFC North there are three two in one and they're in third place with way beyond bill they much better with way beyond bill or they five in one or they foreign to\nWould they be that much better when you look at the work that James Connors done\nIs the lack of way to build the reason why the Steelers are three two and want you know the answer is no they're the ones that have been good in fact Ryan shaves deer missing has been a bigger loss of the team the lady on bells absence\nBecause they haven't been adequately able to replace Ryan ... linebacker when I think let's be honest James Caan or has adequately replace lazy on bill\nIn fact even better than adequate in fact right now he probably be a pro ball player it'd be Russia's for twelve hundred yards has seven hundred yards receiving and has doubled is your touchdown he's going to probable\nSo I can tell you right now I don't think they've really mislead your belt where if you're a Steeler player you're saying my goodness when he laid beyond is there isn't as if\nThey put it a running back 'cause every two point three or four Terry and absolutely stinks and start at\nMeant just get your story straight to the media and also the lady on bill you want to play\nDate when you're coming back he's got an old his mind when exactly something back to play in the NFL for the Pittsburgh Steelers right to counsel Mariel so warped right now for victims ... get it done and CBS board dot com dot

boso would've missed the rest of the season recovering from this core muscle injury or was he expected to come back at some point before a ball game\nI think the thinking was well let's say he does come back what are your accomplishing\nBack for two games and then play Michigan and you know whatever in the playoffs and and that they can championship game because some point you've got to think about your future earning power I think that's what he was thinking about their significant gains left for Ohio State I think comes back for for Michigan\nI'm ... and he plays the Big Ten championship

way [noise] semi\nReally want to ask you keep some of the big game tried to Miami and maybe ... maybe a Georgia and I'm Still like a way that you're going to drop I don't know maybe it's I I just don't have the\nWhole I think yeah you're on a day with our halfway through the season right now we're going to when the show's going to drop it I got\nWe had to um for doing our halfway his his halfway point this week halfway all American team my coach of the year halfway through the seasonally that ours or say what you will about him\nHe's gotten results he paid them something they haven't had in years here they've got a quarterback is great no more of a game manager\nBut he's been kind of a raw raw rally you know rally guy at through intersections against Florida that's OK comes up with some big plays against Georgia and all of a sudden plate people are talking about LSU and Alabama and the member third maybe that's for a spot in the playoffs or to read that or by that once you before the season so\nNo I I I Believe in them now because of the fence which always travels\nBecause of the office which is good enough and it's very opportunistic um I think they got a shot I mean if if that game isn't it night November third I'll be very surprised\nOr have you ever want that at night I didn't CBS game I haven't seen that I Would hope it's at night\nCBS more stock on natural college football writer Dennis joining us going deep the enforcement and NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com Dennis in in your mind it I'm sure you play the hypothetical is 'cause it's like gambling frankly when you think about who's going to end up in the college football final four\nDo you see a scenario in your mind when you get kind of crunch the numbers were both the big twelve and the patch twelve or shut out\n[laughter] sure I can see that um I think you just look at the top for right now he could see it I'm going to Notre Dame game gets in a spot they take the power fight a spot so you know that's one\nI think you could argue that the tax wells might have played itself out the play offs already their best team that I see most talented Washington's lost twice or they're out\nThere that's last chances Oregon you got to do if you're packed twelve you've got to hope that Oregon wins out and that they're good enough you know I don't know if the committee now how does that look\nIn comparison to undefeated Notre game or a taxes that has beat and uh Oklahoma and the top five twice it twelve and one I don't know I'm just I'm just fascinated rhetorically yeah 'cause I don't think it looks very good\nAh so I don't think their chances are very good right now so yeah the big twelve\nImpact well it doesn't look good right now if you're either one of those conferences you're hoping for another day in Boston for starters [noise]\nDentist last question in you know we talked about it earlier Alabama there's a gap in your mind between Alabama and dental higher state and everybody else\nThe team in let's face Nick Saban has had some incredible teams in his tenure in Alabama where does this one rank up there does the addition of to uh put it over the top rather significant weaknesses that you see that may be an Achilles' heel later down the road\nA boat a given all that I wrote last friday that this is next savings that team he's had at Alabama or it's one of the best of Alabama history now everybody says well they haven't played in\nThis isn't UCF schedule by the way they play they play to download all team they went out and scheduled that game at a neutral field I'm not going to downgrade I'm sure that they beat and everybody else on their schedule gives me\nThey got probably the best set of receivers next savings had ah for running backs could start for anybody to it's great I think the biggest thing about this pain and people don't see it as Nick Saban has had the vision\nAnd I guess progressive necessarily thinking that to make this came up past first off they're just not on like the vintage change of the middle of the patriots the path to set up through a friend\nThat's they're doing I'm not saying that pass a law passed on first down and they asked to set up the road and they they take their shots down field next saving who railed against our PTOs for years yeah fluently embraced archaea\nI'm In his his benefits\nAnd I don't think you know if if we're going to you know the team that's played them the closest ... which came within twenty two points Arkansas or thirty one the most since the championship game when cleansing the beat of\nUm a couple of years ago Twenty one months ago it's most parts against Alabama\nBut but they won by thirty four discord sixty five committee the absolutely they can levy 'cause they have cut of tape but I think is we're sitting here now is the best he ever had in Alabama\nAnd by the way they could have easily put up Seventy five in Arkansas that might be kind of a federal law you know

back to the Nick votes the situation at Ohio State here [noise] here's the thing though\nThe NFL has this rule where you have to be three years removed from high school before you go to the NFL Draft and it doesn't matter if you do your preparatory school two years of college check your play\nYou know a sad you know San lot football the way that the ... swan didn't let me just play like minor league football for the cardinals fan of top ten pick good player back in the day\nDidn't lay the college ball like everybody else whatever it takes the post grad year two years of college life at shell did that when the valley forge military academy that went to ... for two years so it's been done\nBut now the Nick posters literally play two years and three games I ... you know just to start that trend are showing you mentioned Russia and Gary of Michigan oh you know why does he do the same thing he's already been injured too right so like why didn't he stood out start preparing for the draft\nGuys like him and they both get frankly workout together you know you get a boy these top notch NFL tied trainers to work yeah I Would probably be better prepared than the college guys get prepared on campus Sean so why not start the trend\nYeah and we're Sean Gary has more to lose then to gain at this point right would you agree like I I Know like you're one of his biggest critics you want to see some more at the college level because it was the number one overall high school football group so he and his numbers don't really suggest that he's\nA top Fifteen pick but I watch a week in week out at least when he plays he's missed the last two games I think he's a legit top fifty back I I think he's improved greatly\nFrom his first two years but yes and so maybe he has something to the game maybe a couple of picks you can move up here and there but it's more boos spy plane\nI'll give you a better example that both posted in Gary because boats and Gary project ability watch when the national championship this year right here at all over it Houston\nYou're not winning a national championship\nWho cares if you win the conference usa award who cares at all over the top five pick okay\nWhat's funny is the poster came into this season as a top ten pick Russia and Gary came into this season as a top ten pick it all came into this season as a top by pick probably right\nIt's not as if they needed to play a single down this year to prove anything so reality is are we going to now start\nHearing and should we started hearing Shaun the whispers of maybe she'll be two years out of college jumped out of high school I'll tell you why when that rule was made the players coming out of high school physically did not resemble college football players like\nI Am one of these ... you know recruiting losers right I Am on all the sites scout rivals whatever it is I follow all the recruiting\nThe kids coming out of high school today look like NFL players now yeah you have some guys who are tall and like you need to put on twenty pounds\nBut the other guys are shown Gary are you know both those guys look like NFL players coming out of high school maybe at the bulk up a little bit right\nIn two years of college they can bulk up and major programs maybe at this point it started ... it's time to start talking and learn and get from three years out of high school for two years\nBecause reality is done of these guys needed to play this year to prove their NFL value\nAnd you know an NFL teams would probably say that's great not as much wear and tear on Nick ... Gary at all of her because those guys sat out and they worked with a nutritionist they worked with a trainer to the pros they worked with guys that know exactly how you need to be in terms of your health and you know your quickness and things like your strength\nThat the NFL looks for\nSo it's a waste a junior year for these guys anyway 'cause they were going to leave us top ten picks\nSo it makes you wonder Shawn what how they come back here except for the fact they have to be three years out of college and high school\n... ... well the thing is what shocks me a little bit is even though the closest injured and he probably wouldn't have returned until November\n... higher states in the running and and there's\nTwo in the national championship and that doesn't appeal to Nick post I understand I I understand why he doesn't want to you know doesn't just staff to training staff and and all that I as you laid out before I get get all that\nBut we always thought that All right if you're not in contention like a ... we you know once the local news the second game is there any point in playing this kid I mean he's got that play baseball next year anyway so what is the point right\nYeah you think the six million bucks ready for the Oakland A's anyway\nRight so I mean maybe he's a different example but I yeah I\nDo players that like Michigan respond Garrett Michigan still in it right\nIf it was the second game maybe maybe that's what he says All right enough is enough I'm going to focus on getting ready for the NFL Draft but that's what's so surprising about Nick ... the Ohio State has a chance to win national championship and he's not gonna come back for two or three games and then a big tent championship game and two games possibly\nIn the college football playoff that and that's still a lot of football than it is and that's five games potentially\nI hate to say it this way but if I'm they boast that I think okay I get myself a little\nNice and that does hurt oh I Would say I disagree with what Dennis ... that ... has played all\nRight but Nick Posey could still use the top ten to pick on your defense of a lot especially if you're playing the Alabama's the world's Nick posted you could find him inside on\nYou know passing down or whatever they they could find ways to play ... and Nick closer together and they have a lot of death on the line as it is a lot of states so I Do think it does hurt our state when they play the Alabama's of the world but anyway I just want\nTo say oh you're right he doesn't he's one of those dominant pass or it's just it all college football for sex and the first three games six tacos for lost in the first three games also is a leading tax or for the buckeyes at that point which is very rare for a guy playing you know a defensive end position I just think here's my problem with this all and call me selfish\nIf it's up to me and I have an opportunity to win the national championship and get myself a national championship ring\nFor I guarantee my health\nFor a guaranteed cool thirty million bucks for my first set up a contract I hate\nTo say it I don't want to ring you get you know but that will take out an insurance\nYou say you're thirty million dollar contract policy\nAll the both have the money\nWill show he's [laughter] I Know that does play in the NFL is if the data Joe he was not an editor on call so [laughter] that's right it's just like the man exist Cooper get money from or does his own little fortunate they didn't make quarterback money to end the most adventurous [laughter]\nBut here's the problem though it's a thirty million dollar guaranteed for the first four years and I mean the post there should be an NFL star for twelve years\nThey weren't talking Nick poses earning potential is a hundred plus million dollars right as a dominant pass Russia and the other thought today you're making Fifteen million bucks I mean they both says chances of you know making you know nine figures in his career are really good\nYou got to play the last five games and\nTake out an insurance policy for a hundred million bucks is a lot of money they get it I understand it\nAnd the value of a national championship isn't exactly the value of your NFL career anymore than we've seen guys dropping a draft because of injuries\nThere yet but that is currently the Celtics radio network in Boston opening the season at home against the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers and here let let's back up for a second and understand what this matchup is okay it's this simple\nWhen you look at eastern conference there's three teams that we looked upon as the favorites right the predominant teams Boston Toronto in Philly no argument right\nDominant teams right now in the eastern conference and the question is who is really the best\nHow does it end up falling together in terms of the seating when it's all said and done is Boston number one seed does Philly or Toronto ended up being the number to see their fight for that right that's going to be the fun part of the eastern conference is\nYou know it's like the lambs getting ready for water like who is going to end up being the team that goes up against the war is in the final to get demolished in Boston's a seed number one Philly in Toronto fighting for number two and number three\nWell Boston at home first quarter there was a\nGame Twenty one and all that ... Boston at a five point lead in the Boston just dominated the second half Boston rules to a Thirteen points second half advantage they win one of five to eighty seven over one of those top three teams the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers\nWhat's interesting is Gordon Hayward comes back makes just returned and he was rusty I mean ten points five rebounds for twelve shooting for Gore in ... he wasn't great Kyrie Irving was utterly atrocious twenty nine minutes for ... to a fourteen from the field one of eight from three point line Kyrie Irving at seven points\nOut Harvard had nine points\nYet the Boston Celtics dominated the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers thinking about that you get Seventeen kept by points from Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward and you still waiting by Eighteen points\nPay the big game twenty three point nine rebounds\nMorris off the bench and you know is Marcus Morsi's one of the Celtics mark keep it somewhere else where the Phoenix or somewhere else whatever but markets Morris sixteen points in ten of rebounds off the bench Boston with a dominant when rose year eleven off the bench\nOver a six or team when they are two best players\nHad nothing in the tank and combine for Seventeen points they got what Seventeen points means Gordon Hayward on the year averaging more than Seventy points a game Kyrie Irving will and the you're probably averaging eight points more than Seventeen points a game for the season\nYet they won by Eighteen now this is why I don't understand I don't think ... a good coach the Sixers that goes I don't think represents good coach he got completely out coach last year in the postseason completely out coaches terrible why are they starting mark ... folks\nI mean are they starting more careful over J. J. rhetoric because they have to justify taking them number one overall\nConsidering Jason tantamount for twenty three and nine and Jason ... was the third overall picking the same trap as more careful and in fact the Boston Celtics had that number one pick traded in for Philly Philly had to pick that ended up being Jason Tatum\nPhilly had a chance to tell me what mark how false and twenty four minutes to of seven from the field five points to assess as a point guard playing half the game he was also the worst mind is sixteen on the court\nJesuit run to get sixteen points in thirty minutes I'm just not understanding what prep round is doing doesn't guys start because he earns the start do you are in a starting job in professional sports\nWhat us more careful stone at the NBA level except being a top pick to deserve being the starter right now Jay Jay rhetoric is far more accomplished player the more careful now read it can come off the bench and being an officer and I understand that\nBut it makes absolutely no sense if you're going to play been Simmons is distorted also play more votes market hasn't proven he can shoot\nThen Simmons isn't much of a shooter right I mean Ben soon as the three border to save his life in fact he never even she was three pointers\nSo doesn't that make more sense to have J. J. Reddick who is more of a bull's eye from beyond the arc alongside Benjamin starting with mark how folks coming off the bench getting is NBA legs owner in before you consider making them a starter\nIt just doesn't make sense Sean I don't understand the philosophy of bright brown to just hand over the starting rains to mark ... folks who clearly it's not deserved it in his one plus years now and the NBA\nJay played thirty minute than he's not going to play much more than that hills\nSo they need folks to play\nTwenty minutes game and that's kinda what do you play it doesn't really matter who starts it matters who finishes now but I think when it comes down to you want to set attempt on a game\nBut there's no way ... he he didn't really play point I mean they've us there was a point guard but Simmons was the point guard a data solved the problem but that's the that's why even false and Simmons don't work Dan right they don't work together on a ... you know team\nThey can chew right now I Know exactly what it has to have the ball\nAnd the other is affected without the ball or as effective because they can't shoot\nThe scene bought the is it is well it's for a and B I just think Brent brown doesn't already doing\nBecause why should we can sit here and obviously that I suspect this team and understand the full ... should be on the court the same time considering they cancel each other out\nSo why exactly would you even thinking about starting these guys these guys to get your right reading gonna play more medicine should he's a better player than folks but what's the point of having fooled start the game is Jay Jay rights away more minutes anyway\nYou know we were real generous to the east eastern conference by putting three teams in the next to get to the NBA final I think it's just so it's a race for one team at the Celtics but I don't think there's ... there's going to keep people in\nThose two for fourteen to go to war for twelve Rossi and they still want by double digits\nWhy do they shot six of twenty eight combined six of twenty six combined and they won by Eighteen point\nAmazing big Seventeen points nine rebounds and seven to sit in fifty four combined minutes for Hayward unnerving and they won by eight you know bread top three eastern conference team\nDoesn't make a lot of sense I mean really\nYou're right maybe we are being overly generous and the thought of the Sixers being in the same conversation as Boston I look to be fair I have to see Toronto an action before I annoy them to be so poor compared to Boston I Want to see what ... you know I Want us to acquire Leonard brings the raptors you know I mean\nWhat are you going to see that going to be the Celtics come\nLike I said I Want to before I'm gonna like strap on that one\nI got to see at first I mean I don't disagree with you I think in terms of pure talent walked in a way deeper than Toronto and that they're starting ... much more talented in\nBut I just like the the and I thought things were not impressed alright major league baseball championships series ongoing baseball in the next four men DC for training\nCentral Wisconsin twenty four hour news and information and make sure that all of the Wisconsin badger say Thirteen twenty WFAN char Wisconsin Rapids your NBC Sports radio what the [noise]\nThe Dodgers into one walk off whenever the brewers in the bottom of the thirteenth feeling is that even at the end of the U.S as two games apiece and the Arabs see as the red Sox tickets to games to one lead over the Astros within each victory in Houston jak rather juniors grand slam in the eighth inning blowing the game opening\nThis one's ... NBA season zipped off Tuesday night with the Celtics feeding the Seventy Sixers won all five eighty seven Jason date him at twenty three points and nine rebounds coordinate word score ten points in his first regular season actions since last year's injury\nAnd then I kept a champion warriors received their rings and then went on to beat the other one on one hundred step courage for dirty Jew Kevin ... edits once he's seven broke Casey plane without Russell Westbrook ball George lead the way it was twenty seven points college football news allows thieves Nick boats leaving the school to focus on rehabbing his injury in preparing\nFor the upcoming NFL Draft some Scott ... is NBC Sports radio\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nBy court judge a map of synthetic Motorola are only Eighteen to protect syringes from sludge an extreme temperatures what did you know it also protects our troops you would each purchase a map of both synthetic breaking a portion goes to be interrupted fallen heroes\nQuality parts helping people for no no no\nDon't say President Bill president amount of food will say well sex to recycle proper and say I'm thirty one eighty\nGame on demand with NFL game to\nIn the\nAre [noise]\nI Want to get to a council and I know they're currently playing right now but said assess the way he's going to hurt the ... the show\nWe'll find they can deal with if let's say I thought it was the uh the way he's use the bullpen so far in this just want to get your thoughts you probably throw mine out there\nWell he's doing it out of necessity that that's the difference you know Tampa is doing it because they're trying to design of pitching staff around using openers memory you and I talk to after the Yankee Oakland game in which you know they threw these guys kind of at the walls 'cause they said you know ... you know different picture every inning\nBut you know every one of those guys has to have is a game because it was a do or die situation\nIf you notice in credit counselor he made this point last night he says he is never putting the guy in a short getting situation earlier ball game in a do or die situation you're not throwing the whole\nOf the season in one guy's hands\nYou're doing it because they don't have the starting pitching this is why no one thought the brewers would be the cubs and the central this is why no one thought the brewers would make the playoffs this this\nWhere's the the idea is when we assessed teams you assess the team based on what's their starting pitching how their bullpen look and\nCan they hid and usually can they hit is number three\nBecause that's just the way we've been brought up that's the way I have covered this game for twenty three years like this is what it is but what Craig council is saying is if you go on traditional baseball you do we don't have the horses that can match\nBut if you let us bring in somebody knew somebody ... somebody that's throwing the ball exceptionally well well ... I mean you're seeing what their their successes\nYou know they are in the ... they are in the driver's seat and they have as good a shot to win game for and if there are three one the worst case scenario is they come back home and by the way at the beginning of the series I took brewers insects\nThere you go or baseball inside is that the average ... my whole thing was\nI thought of your ... and it costs to gain too and what I mean by that is the third inning for Josh I Know he came out and said that once you get two innings he was going to pitch in game to guard list but on a cell by it and if you're going to pitch him in the game to a game you know games even let him go another gun going the other end\nSo the thing that got me just had to agree\nI I disagree we were talking about the game three right where do\nNot run again one oh okay no I have three\nI thought hater in game three was I got annoyed at the national media I got I first of all but Alex Rodriguez David Ortiz show that is on washable\nAnd interviews are hideous although they're hideous it it's it's brutal ... some of the worst stuff I've seen in a long time\nBecause here's what was happening yesterday I can I can just use that says yesterday's example\nWe they brought judge hater and they had him warming to nothing once you warned him up you have to use them because if not you wasted a game and so they brought him and he was never going to throw more than twelve pitches\nBut because the the Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz had said well how do you not go to him in the ninth inning look at this ... it's going to blow up in his face they offset it while they were getting their ... being the makeup on\nAnd what they are not given credit and this is the point of why I'm bringing this up is\nNo one seems to recognize that credit council is pushing all the right buttons right now\nYou know the old expression sometimes it's better to be lucky than good yeah I I'm not saying that it was the ... the most efficient use of Josh hater in for nothing game and the thing I understand all that but he also knows he does not win the world series unless he has Jeremy Jeffers pitching well\nHe used that situation and if you look at the box score Jeffries didn't give up a run last night\nNo he did not know you're right about that and let's let's let's stay on the state of California and the city of Los Angeles and while the Dodgers are the talk of the city obviously with them being in the house so yes the angels have opted out of their lease what I mean is this a possibly the start of them trying to relocate\n[noise] it it could be um you know that what they're trying to do and it's a similar situation to what's going on in Seattle Seattle's lease is up and instead of signing a twenty five year extension they only send a five year extension remember you and I talked about that when I was in Seattle and\nThe situation with the angels as they have tried to get the\nThe uh city to pay for upgrades for the ballpark and their citizenship on to the city just to ... you know public financing for two football stadiums and this is the problem with calling it even though they're in orange county this is what caused the problem with calling it Los Angeles\nThey can't get any Los Angeles politicians to back them\nSo the only thing they could do was threatened and that's what they've done they opted out of their release I don't think they are leaving anytime soon I think the sign of similar deal to what the mariners did but it's just all politicking and the interesting part about it is with the angels go south\nWould they go play down south near San Diego\nI don't think San Diego which lost the football team should get two baseball teams or not I also think you're not leaving that TV market to same reason the Marlins are never leaving Miami you're not leaving these that television it's the same reason the ... are not leaving the bay area\nIt it all the situations are exactly the same it's why the Seattle supersonic leaving for Oklahoma City is considered one of the dumbest sports business decisions ever made because you went from market twelve to markets thirty five\nYeah no it doesn't make so you don't do that while around the angels real quick I'm going to be selfish I'm a big show a a tiny fan okay he's going to be obvious they have they have show hey autonomy\nAnd my trout and they're really they opted out of their release today\nBut here's the thing what are your ... you know I like to do that\nSo what we saw a little tiny bat playing part time just your what your expectations for his numbers in terms of being a full time ... playing in a hundred and forty five games next year I don't believe\nIn a hundred and forty five cameras from what I understand his rehab he's going to play and maybe a hundred games next year\nColorado so he's not going to be there in February but it\nDepends on how his rehab goes but I don't think he's going to be a hundred percent ready to go um you know if when when he's going to hit while he's having his arm\n'cause he's having the Tommy John surgery so that he can pitch and twenty Nineteen twenty twenty twenty Twenty one right and the idea is if he's going to do that\nUm he has to temporarily a lot of this there is going to be times when he has to go on throwing programs while he's ... so it's going to be a weird thing for him I I Would not say I would not play fantasy on outside of the\nFear that it was funny but I wouldn't do it said that he was a fulltime hitters you forty home drunk on your mind\n[noise] home runs is so cheap these days I I Would say yes\nThat whole parts of the ballpark\nYeah but the thing about autonomy is I think is a phenomenal talent I just think if he is not right you just wonder what the pain of the rehab be there to affect his swing you know ... if his mechanics reflect to so many mitigating factors I wouldn't bet on a timely next year\nI real quick set the Miami they think they have a solution to that hideous here don't get rid of that or whatever the heck they want to call that sculpture how they're going to be able to move that outside wasn't that big fight last year about it too I like the artist one and he had the right to keep it there ... what changed now\nI Know they they've decided I think they pay them off and and ah you know I think it's ... like the first things Derek Jeter did was he fired the PR guys in the play by play announcer\nAnd Jeff coat on one of the strangest things I worry about the product and what are you doing where they made the trail I thought the worst thing in\nBaseball the worst thing in baseball today was you took an eighty five year history called the Syracuse chief the triple a affiliate up in Syracuse New York the Mets bought the team and they changed the name to Syracuse met\nLots that oh it's awful I'm doing a Fort article I'm crossing that tomorrow on ... ... eighty five years\nEighty five years they were

path to taps\nOr who's county [noise] I Am [laughter]\nYou can't make that up he's thrown ten interceptions he and his very short NFL career and I just at this point don't understand\nWhy the guy even goes into games right now I'm a little confused as to why Nathan Federman is still on this roster it's\nDaunting to me he is awful I hate to say look I don't want to criticize people if they deserve to be criticized and no one deserves to be criticized more when it comes to being an NFL quarterback the Nathan Peter and he's not an NFL quarterback that simple shock your bills fan you watch this nonsense you know he's not an NFL quarterback\n[laughter] I Can't I Can't stop [laughter]\nI hate this whole Nathan heritage me oh\nBuddy least apply I don't think that's the bad white guy stealing games\nHaven't seen enough short McDermott I haven't even seen enough of this guy chemical who makes the decisions that Terry McDermott you cannot have this man on your roster get rid of all\n\nWhat you need to do is this\nYou have to do what happens now in the ... in the movie or you didn't like the movie but uh what was it called again a Moneyball okay you know like Moneyball\nButtermilk in Monterey Brad Pitt I mean really you you're going to have it Brad Pitt is a [laughter] really being really Billy Bean's go looking to come on [laughter] here's we remember what he does win or the late Philip Seymour Hoffman playing a was an art how I think it was yeah\nLike it's usually pencils in\nCarlos pain at first base\nSo what does Brad Pitt do he literally just trades Carlos painters that are how can't pencil minimal wind up anymore\nSo maybe what needs to happen is Kimberley Roula\nGot divorced brand and being the gym to just drop Nathan beat 'em and just released um he's not going to be met so that show the government can't play what's amazing is like apparently this is becoming an issue in the locker room and I'll tell you something I Believe it and here's why\nOur good friends Rodney Harrison comes on the show and sort of off course part of a safety blitz weekends your many of the same billiards\nHas talked about the fact that players want to win and a player knows which players\nAre most capable of helping your team went\nSort the coaches want to be stubborn and continue to put Nathan Peter been out there there's no way the players back then move because they know he's not a good quarterback\nYou cannot keep putting them out there or else you lose the team and I'm not sure what the ah the dynamic is beyond the Germans motives to continue putting them out there because the guy is done nothing but fail he's not an NFL quarterback I'd rather have\nAnd unprepared Derek ... who's been sitting in his boxer shorts eating bond bond on his couch watching soap operas on daytime TV in semi retirement starting next weekend rather than a prepared Nathan Peter because then they prepared Nathan determined he's a target\nMachine they should agree dent and and the bills should have had a better choice when Josh Allen went down\nThey signed Derek Anderson ... they should have thought about a mentor for Josh on once Nathan Peter men had\nTo think or in Baltimore right I Do it's inexcusable for dates and Peter Mitt to continue to play football for the Buffalo Bills I'm Sorry he's shown that he's not as you stated earlier an NFL quarterback what more do ... does\nTo say in the does organization who makes those decisions if it's not ... I don't know but it's incredible it honestly is incredible to me that this guy still has a job if you look you you want to win the football games the Buffalo Bills are trying to win football games is not a\nI'm not to try to in football games with Josh Allen has quarterback because he's not an NFL\nQuarterback as we speak right now\nNo one here he will be\nBut [laughter] I mean you you can't tell me that they're trying to win games when when Josh Allen is so limited that they only have him for Eighteen times in a in a football game\nThat's what I don't understand\nWhy they want they actually got in that game but here's the thing of ... like you want you want to give this guy a chance you want this guy to have an opportunity to develop but yet if you're only going to have him throw Eighteen times in a game\nBecause you're afraid to let the ball come out of his hand in the past because you just don't know where it's going and chains are may end up in the other teams hands\nIf you're not going to live with the lumps and bruises of as a you know a raw rookie quarterback you might as well let a merit out because you need them to get that experience what kind of experience has been getting when he's barely reading defenses when he's barely dropping back to pass\nHere's what makes no sense to me Dan also\nDid you see the report on the Sunday Morning football shows\nAre unlikely to trade ... according to the eagles because McDermott values\nWhich ... is a good football player and they're not going to train them did you see that I did see that yeah okay\nSo he's not willing to part with Osama ... because one of the better players and they're trying to win obviously right that's what he's saying we try and went right we don't want to work with a a good football player if you could look it up or something then why is Nathan paint on the roster\nHow is the on the roster I I don't understand it how are you trying to win with Peter and even as a backup quarterback\nThey can't help you can only that's the I don't I don't it doesn't make any sense\nHere's the thing doesn't this make you question the judgment\nOf Brandon being the GM who trades away a dream of carrot and leaves the team with the roar of quarterbacks English trapped in Josh Alan and then they hire for Josh Allen\nRight no major exactly\nWhat it would help I think\nAnd you have Nathan beat them through through five picks and a half\nAnd his only action last year as a starter and you go into the season with those two guys a quarterback you get rid of ... you know ... you get rid of AJ McCarron and you go into the season with Alan and Peter man doesn't reflect poorly on Brandon being\nSpread the bean is making the decisions are made many believe Sean McDermott is pulling the strings there I I don't know I don't know it's either McDermott of brand debate so yeah\nBrought you buddy Afghan someone it's pre diabetes awareness partners\nBut he can't say that in

because of bargaining and people have been talking about is that a residency requirement for emergency personnel Weiner to give us an update on that because they called me about it and\nMaybe a little background to this I was referred to um the council of by a older person same blazer who expressed a desire to have more or less restrictive a ordinance related to residency and therefore\nIt would allow a city employees to live further from the city um it do it because it's a a subject of a bargaining of negotiations related to our protective service unions with their police and fire\nOr groups or the decision last name was to postpone that item or until uh the bargaining um occurs um uh by the by the unions are with the unions\nAnd uh and then I Will be considered as part of those discussions in negotiations so I'm again the proposal that older person blazer or want it to see was um that are residency are related to um a emergency personnel be expanded so folks can live\nA further from the city um does that work in emergency services\nOkay and the council did unanimously approved a resolution in support of the Caribbean building part or project can encourage foundations Tribune building project as part of the packet of stuff that's going to Madison to his show community support hopefully get some state money for that project\nUh so this item was disgusted that committee the whole where um the uh council discussed and last night uh the unanimous resolution was passed in support of that project I'm so that was a resolution at the council had drafted a and then ultimately I'm a approve last night at its meeting\nAnd like you said it'll go along side or those ah requests or or requests of community organizations for support of the project so I'm the council was able to affirm their support for the project with that too though\nSo we won't be facing aid any job eliminations I'm a as a result of this\nUh where people will lose their jobs I Can't stay in the future that you know we may decide not to fill a position because uh we consciously made this decision to be more efficient um so we can reallocate those resources elsewhere in her\nWe're up against a flat budget um expectations from the state\nUh and so it becomes a ... a difficult balancing act sometimes to balance the budget given that most of our budget is wages and benefits so I'm sure the timecom where we're not able to balance the budget or um or wage increases come at the expense of eliminating a position that was vacated maybe it's her retirement\nI Can't say that those circumstances may happen uh her more may not happen soon\nHow does the fact that this isn't a lecture in Europe and that\nYou know when you never know what's going to happen in a lecture books say there is some dramatic changes and Madison a new governor or whatever\nThat could change the dynamic and all of a sudden in terms of the rules that you are going to be operating on once the new administration or the new leadership gets in power and and so do you have to kind of subconsciously or something planned for that eventuality just in case\nOr well our budgeting practices are very conservative we generally plan for the worse that aside reserves for fleet maintenance replacement for example like generally\nAside from a fire engine that we're going to replace probably in the two thousand Nineteen budget through borrowing in in some part we'd been studying money aside for that replacement like we do in our public works construction\nOr a public works department that we have a we maintain a healthy fleet maintenance and fully replacement reserve\nMany budgets are there are some of this struggle with that because they didn't set up replacement accounts prior to act ten or or or levy limits becoming a coming in place so there barley and for those things annually now we we set aside reserves we we have a replacement accounts within our budget\nAnd the one hand our budget is somewhat inflated because we're setting them money aside for future um expenses on the other hand it keeps our tax increases flat so you don't have spikes I'm borrowing initiatives for example for fleet\nSo um we we definitely budget for the worst um I think when we look forward to new resources coming into play fortunately we have a replacement um a capital improvements plan for placement planned for much of our infrastructure\nThat uh we need to us we need to plan long term so we can tell legislators in Madison for example that we have we can't accomplish as much road reconstruction a road maintenance that we'd like or for the sake of our main is of our entire system or and so therefore if there were just a new resources that came into the picture\nOr we will be able to articulate well what we're going to do so it's not a political process necessarily well I like my street done well no we have a plan that these are the this is the schedule which these activities are going to occur\nGiven that so up all of this in terms of budgeting and all that goes into what should a city do what kind of services do what do people or what the people water are are willing to pay for it so that's always a challenge right where are you on the council yeah\nI think it's a major challenge when we talk about changing any services right\nRightfully so many people don't like change um I\nConsider myself at times one of those individuals as well and so if we were to consider eliminating a service and starting a new service or or growing a service at the expense of another service which are the decisions we have to make in our current budget constraints um you know we often times don't make those changes then because\nThe council gets a few calls and says well you know we don't we we'd prefer we maintain that existing service so therefore the new service doesn't occur um and so are the change doesn't happen and I think um you know sometimes our ... our decisions are our pan has forced when\nFleet becomes obsolete or or beyond its useful life garbage right right we were at a juncture there or do we continue to provide the same method of collection or do we change I'm ... and and as the new services have demonstrated to provide benefits\nAnd um you know more efficiency for our operations and therefore the new service one out\nOf them will be I Would imagine in advance so that you know there'll be a big public education campaign like it there was with recycling we\nLearned a lot in the launch of single stream recycling and we're still learning I'll admit that even after launching this over a year ago um and so how we communicate with the public has changed right when we think about\nRadio communications or a newspaper and social media and so we're trying to trying to reach as many residents through the various channels as possible\nBut residents have to listen [laughter] right so we can send messages all day long but if they're not being received it puts us in a tough position so we're trying to find ways for example are going to be using a communication very soon I'm to the extent that people are going to have that option again of the size of their garbage Ben\nI'm you know smaller homes or you know if it's a two bedroom home them in a single stock garage they may opt for a smaller garbage bin\nWhich frankly is about the same size garbage uh that probably has as consume or or that that needs you know the need for a small home today are now if you have a large family or or or\nThe number of children you're you're going up for the the standard size which would be the larger Ninety six gallon ban which is about to say which is the same size as every cycle and so it's a big garbage bin\nAnd for somebody like me that puts out a bag every other week perhaps or maybe once a week um the small been would be one that that all opt for like salmon I thought one single stream recycling afforded people the opportunity to recycle more right right um so we're going to be sending out communications so folks want to\nTo sign up for the smaller recycled their garbage bin excuse me that they'll have to opt in for that there isn't an automatic so people will get a letter from the city and they'll have to to respond accordingly\nMarket before we go to break 'em better cold fall so far in the last the last two earlier this week we actually had some power outage because of heavy wet snow and power lines that handle like\nHow are we in terms or snow removal budget going into this winter there is some fear now that we might get an old fashioned one\nYeah I saw some indications that it might be a cold and in heavy or a wet winter and I don't know if it's the ... assuming we are going to get I mean I'm not really made snow yeah um well you know we set aside annually uh reserves for snow removal so\nWhen we don't spend money in a in a low snow removal year we set those aside in in segregated in the snow removal budget\nUm so we're sitting sitting find with adequate reserves its those small snow events are those heavy ice events that really wreck havoc in our budget we'd actually like large snow events because um you know we're we're removing that snow or as as ice events we're spending a lot of material costs great\n'cause you're assaulting or ... or something during and you're trying to scrape the streets I'm so those create a create a mess plus they wreck havoc on actually the street services right for God going over a street surface for a one or two or three inch snowfall with ice or sweet um it doesn't it's not as good as you know ...\nOr you know also I talked to are you in the past and your predecessors are the costs but you have to pay for salt and a leg what's the market for that like\nYou know I was just given a statistic and I don't remember it on top of my head but our salt um cos\nAh when we came to the ... budget process one streets put together their budget salt costs have just grown astronomically and and unfortunately\n... generally that means we buy less salt right if you have a fixed budget um but for me now at the same time we carry cell reserves than we do have cash reserves for snow removal activities so um you know that's one of those budget that we don't have the option to remove it right\nMeans and method we may change how we do things in terms of removal and snow plowing but generally the material costs are unforgiving right we have to acquire the material and and keep it on hand\nNow what would it take our first break in the phone lines are open at someone five four to four twenty six hundred if you have a question for Wisconsin Rapids ... want to talk about the budget and its budget writing time uh wanna get into a a little bit too about um you know\nOn some of the triangle project may be some of the other projects going on in the city and then you have your concerns and we're looking at your concerns as well so like I said both phone lines are open at someone five four to four twenty six hundred here on the morning magazine back with more right after this\nIn week one of the high school football playoff the assumption royals will travel

HR dot com [noise]\nI've I've noticed in the last several weeks that that the timing seems to be off on them a little bit or they don't seem to be running efficiently as they used to um [noise] what most times when I'm traveling west bound to come into the city\nAnd ... and and I and I get a red light at St Clair it holds the traffic for a long time and and and there's really nothing matched approaching that intersection from the ... or from the north\nThrough your aunt or is there something that could be doing too\nWell I was I was thinking the caller was referring to some of the detector loops because there's some ... and their meaning that if there's traffic than it triggers the signal\nAnd and and I know there was All right we thought there were some there and they seem to be working you know early on\nUp up until maybe a month or so ago oh stop seems to have happened to him there's a lot of times at West bond traffic all ... up there oh maybe six or twelve vehicles and we just wait and wait and wait and not those comments from the western nothing's coming from the northeast shoulder some parts of what it's worth\nThe adult thanks for the things that have not I'm\nNot a complaint just an observation\nShall serve thank you we uh we did introduced new timing to the entire expressway system or in so we were part of the the trial phase with learning pays with that is where we're there um areas that maybe got worse ah or\nI think we we generally don't here they get better but but we certainly appreciate the the input and I know that no one to engineering\nYeah I'm I'm kind of suspecting that somebody was a ... with the timing there at all but whatever\nYeah we yeah we were we time the whole entire not the entire system but the majority of the east side system was retired so I'm there definitely could be an impact there and then I'll share that feedback with engineering\nOkay [laughter] well thank you thank you for the heads up yeah or something\nLike that you don't know about an engineer doesn't know about until the gentleman did what he did this didn't call up to you know what's happening here because that could cause especially during rush hours a bit of a traffic jam [laughter]\nWell yeah traffic patterns change right now we see it now with the the suffering of ninth graders to Lincoln high school and that has an impact on people's traffic patterns in traffic volume certainly uh you know the Lincoln's record or near the expressway now has impacted and and and as well as the but we've heard a input on Second Avenue\nOr in the expressway as well that ah you know people that are going to to a middle school now to pick up\nKids or or even just traveling that area you know there's there's impact and so we know part of the challenge with timing is it's a point in time now when we uh we assess these things before and make a change we want to make sure that we're taking all of that into account sometimes it's it's a there's a there's a trial period and in in the judgments I Need to be made after the fact\nIt looks like we're going to get here you're going to be a popular person may have another caller for you you're on the morning magazine with member like\nHow are you all\nDoing fine sir\nGood good yeah I got one question for you at the restaurant in a mall parking lot why do I have to trim my we've said

just I just drove by and I just looked terrible and I thought jeeze I got to get my lawn up and why don't they I mean just 'cause it's closed and doesn't feel\nRight now the YMCA owns it then it's their responsibility to\nTake care of them and maybe there's a need for a direct communication with them to let them know that that's right yeah thank you very well thank you and you're on the morning

Aguilar in the back of the right legs Machado ran out a ground ball and the tenth inning of the game last night but naturally the play has fueled speculation obviously players have called him dirty it's not the first time\nAnd he said quote sometimes dirty deserves dirty it's no dirty little secret to Machado deserves retribution\nYet tit for tat impulses could be way too costly for the brewers especially in a series that has been as close as this one plucking Machado in putting him on base could lead to a key Ron digs would get worse if my league it's a warning from an empire which could lead to an objection for him or a teammate later in the ball game\nThere may be a chance for the bridge to extract revenge next season and baseball's old school way but for now\nThere is a smarter way if less immediate and less visceral for the brewers tune to flick to point to inflict pain he used to simply when the series the brewers have to have self restraint when it comes to going after some one of those particular fashion and now is not the time\nUm so that's out of USA Today if you haven't read it already posted about an hour ago but I I for those that and I'm just I'm there with ya\nYou'd love to see him drilled but\nAs the uh the last sentence says now is not the time\nJust when that's what your concentration should be a a five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six\nFor eight if you want to chime in feel free because ah we're we're chatting a lot about this upcoming game obviously getting you ready for the game the day I'm you know we already gave you went to the brewers are lined up was going to be as far as\nWhat they are of throwing out there today weight Miley goes to the hill against Clinton ... Shaw and the rest of the lineup looks like this because you have Lorenzo Kane a leading off playing center Christian yellowish batting second plane ride Ryan Braun he's playing left in betting third have sous Aguilar\nIs a bad thing for us to playing first batting fitness or non press playing second Mike moose stock as at third ah air crafts behind the plate and then our CIA short followed by weight ...\nIs your line up for your Milwaukee Brewers and hopefully they can walk away with a victory and bring this thing back home up three games to only needing to win one at Miller Park game five gets underway four oh five central time today so make your plans for that I'm sure you already are if you haven't already\nGet ready to hunker down and check it out for yourself and I my assumption is there's a lot of people either one that is certainly going to be quote a veil over a meeting today after four o'clock or two they're already leaving work there they're already getting out of there they're going to go someplace and watch it whether it's a sports bar or\nJust heading home or maybe going to sneak somewhere and listen to it on the radio whatever happens to be all the other thing is is remember that uh you know we're going to be covering it for you again tomorrow Chuck Freeman is out there we talking to check tomorrow is he going ... jumping on a flight he's he's not coming out of flight until late tomorrow so we'll talk with Chuck tomorrow as well\nSo make sure you tune right here and listen to all the the coverage that we continue to give you and I and I highly recommend

listening to us from all over the country or the state\nOf find it there and you can listen to him and baby ... bills Schmidt is they give you the post game show but I'm looking forward to I I think the brewers I think the ... gonna win it's a nervous I get it you may end up biting your nails the last time they face Clinton perched on a regular season game at Chavez Ravine to Dodger Stadium they got to help me out of them\nGot drill remember that game they allow the Twenty one runs a seven home runs\nIn that ball game they did get the Clinton ... because they ended up getting five runs but only two of 'em off her show they scored early in that when they put a put up a run in the first inning and they didn't didn't score again until the fifth ... strong but are they still were able to plates and runs against it felt like he is infallible\nSo I think they can get to them we'll see if that happens today have five five eight three zero eight six foot I\nAs much as we can talk about president for scope and what's Travis jaws doing you know it's match ups and left these and writings and such but I'll say this\nHe does it mean a damn thing if Cain yellow Jeannette Aguilar don't do anything as much as our CIA has kind of held it crashes been uh go to guy who stock is nice to get off the ... but he and his cane yell at each and Aguilar bronze giving you some hits\nBut Cain yell edge and Aguilar me to get off the shot they just do Aguilar has been fishing for that breaking ball on the outside and when they bust him up and then with a fastball he's been woefully behind it\nDuring the late August game against Oakland A's players noticed Astros players clapping dug up before pitches and believe that they were relaying stories stolen science to pictures and and the batter's\nBox so it's not the first time\nThere there you know hey the old adage is if you're not not cheating you're not try it but\nNevertheless the Astros had been the target of a numerous investigations as of late and this is something that why they did need into if indeed they are doing shame on them shame on that paid five five eight three zero eight six for what's your level of confidence today in the Milwaukee Brewers just throwing it out there what's your level of confidence today\nOr you feel like you're ... you're looking at this going you know what last night was last night today back at it quick turnaround no problem get that last night that bad taste out of your mouth or you're looking at this going man I'm nervous going into this game maybe as a fan you are\nI look at it as last night was last night on ... they're going to get a when I think the Dodgers got a big win they stole the confidence they're looking to go ahead today they feel really good about the guy they've got going to the hill but the guy that they've got going to the hill has traditionally not pitch one of the postseason has traditionally not pitch well in September\nAnd by well I'm Talking to his standards\nAs he put up throughout the season this year no no exception\nGives up more home runs more base hits more runs all in September and October [noise] I don't think there's anything different here I think the brewers can get to them I think the key to this is getting the brewers off the ... with the top of their Lana\nKane yell at each Aguilar Bronx been okay can yell at you ... you need some hits from those guys today and things will start to fall into place your confidence comes back and specifically the reins okay I never ends okay and he can be the lynchpin and all of this\nNot even Christian yellowish but if Lorenzo Cancun set the table and kind of take a little bit of that pressure off of Christian yell at you I really think things begin to fall into place\nBut I look for a bomb the day from Aguilar I something in me just says he is due to go go yard that's all he does\nHe he doesn't hit the ball and all of a sudden they'll come out and just blow one up and just he'll knock over a scoreboard today but just throwing it out there a five five eight three zero eight six for eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight I think you're hoping
