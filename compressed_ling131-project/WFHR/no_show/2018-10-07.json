so any time we can get back together and and to reminisce about the old days is a great Grand Central\nDelhi limited been stumped prairie you've been in the area it's all a lawyer problem there and then for you the weekend seeing those 'cause I Would imagine we signed a bet about this that when you see all these\nGuys come back some memories just walk back and it was yesterday or somewhere else or you know just one thing\nLeads you sweat battle with each other as practiced in your age your the same thing and\nThis is just refreshing right give them back and forty five years of the guys are going back a few times like myself shack for the regiments who live around there so you get a chance to do that [noise] um [noise] the other members come back\nBack some of whom are true of [laughter]\nYou do those things and and [noise]\nYou know now we expect things top twenty program right at the expectations\nWhen we were doing it was much different and we were to grind to get to that point I think that's the part that\nHelps us when it might be twenty five years to see somebody but it's like it was just yesterday in the locker room that's pretty special bad\nFor you in a rat you hear what was it like for you the first time you walked into the stadium or even like don't wait for the locker room\nFull different of\nA nine to reflect on that we say someone who it was not like this when we were here you know not as I was full but the stadium look different\n[noise] um the locker room the weight room I mean it's it's amazing what looks like now in some of the the nice things that they have down for us\nAt the time we thought we were living up there I Am right that's\nRight but nothing like it is a day I don't know I think you have to have that obviously to get the best recruit um\nEveryone is trying to outdo each other and so um if you want to get the top notch recruits you going to happen to be able to be able to offer facility that that\nThat they really are I was really struck in a in a big tend to work with the special the documentary of your season came out ... however many years ago was two or three or whatever but [noise] rent last was here and you know he's a great year\nThat he had drilled Fletcher is well in the back feel like I'm ready to fall back [noise]\nBut one thing that struck me in that whole specials a comment from Barry what he said the all the running backs if I Need one yard as I got to have one yard Brent lost his my guy you think about that for ... all the running backs to going through your view of all I did and ... that was special\nOne that was really special I mean it's I think a couple of things wanted it to some of us you know in our team [noise] um because of rent last really sounds kinda signifies that uh [noise] you know the Wisconsin brand you know and the and the helpless [noise]\nUm [noise] to say that Dr grits [noise] um you know he's he's nicknamed the alley cat and ah [noise] you know I think it was I think it was a true statement like ocean we've had a lot of great ones go through here but he didn't know if he gave to him he he would get it\nAnd I know the deep as well do you guys ... you're talking about this yet a knack for turning people over there they think they might have a little something going against you guys they might get a couple of yards here and there but there was just that you guys all got registered as expected that they might get away to some point you're going to knock the ball out her pick I'm all for absolutely\nYou know back then the game is that saying it's a little bit [noise] um I think I Will be kicked out of every game boy you know but um everyone I think what was best with everyone knew their role and responsibility and they they um they told us that really preach that\nAnd so a guy like Nelly you knew that he had had the thirty to cover the field and then a myself wherever they need they need to be the banks somebody will come in and banks buddies so\nUh we just had a ... mixture there until your point uh we got I don't know we we refer or a we thought of ourselves as the bend but don't break the fence but I I've heard that reference before\nAnd so when we needed that turnover we knew we had to go get it\nWas one day I I think for us when we look back I think we are twenty three interceptions in Ninety three which is a ... not just the bees but linebackers getting in the ... just tonight I Know ... back into your good teachers and coaches back there and he was struggling with not being here tonight but um but\nYou look at things in part of all we really fed off to the movie practice hard right we we hit each other we got after but what was really good for us to help create turnovers is trying to pick this local head off in practice at the same as the dog to the Mike grown and [noise]\nI mean that made us better um 'cause we understood how you how to react in and go against a really good office that\nThey could do some things do you practice that I think made the games a little bit but I won't say easier for a little more comfortable with the rule that you had and and that's a you know that that to me signify some good team or a good team but when you can battle that each other that way and help each other get\nBetter than I thought that team as much as the term lunch pail has been used to describe you guys and that's accurate you guys are just really good money right I mean he approached his tail produce on on that team and I do bad like last year the question\nFor the world's most refreshing beer Twenty one means Twenty one celebrate responsibly with Coors lite Coors Brewing Company in Golden Colorado [noise]\nWalk her back to the higher jobs can't bread old stadium jumps out and got no student normally we would be up is that for the post game shows but\nSix thirty kickoffs where I got seven thirty kicked off the ... to that kind of move us up here so we're hanging out and you know what let's just start kind of where we left off before we dive into the game tonight but\nYou know what an honor and privilege was to hang out for a few minutes at least for me personally I I was the fan boy here when you know they're all bubbling Reggie homes I mean you you just got no I get it\nBut now we what do you guys really were the cornerstone you were the foundation I mean we go back to the twenty I I'm going to check the results are before you bail out of that I put I put a ... question up by the way a bedroom post game that's to our uh our handle on Twitter tonight [laughter] um\nWith the celebration that I twenty five years at the Ninety three Ninety four ... team a dreamer old matchup Ninety three Ninety four Ninety nine for oh gotta give similar to the sixty two\nYear old they didn't win the game and right now I hate to tell you\nBut the Ninety nine I mean this is at the front of it or not he three Ninety four now I I wouldn't necessarily disagree with that\nBut I Will say the Ninety nine team probably never would have happened had we not wanting to Ninety four games is because nobody nobody what it was like okay great you got there one time and your last right right so there's a little bit with regret I actually talked to Chris Macintosh on that before the game\nHad a chance to speak with him and he was highly recruited out of ... and he said that game\nReally helped him want to become a badger um and I think it was a senior captain that you're in in Ninety nine and\nUm you don't think about the impact that you have right whether you're a coach and kids are where you're playing in front of people and young kids and um I think when you take a look back a lot of this stuff to the the impact that we did have um [noise]\nWas was the first time right when the game for the first time when the Big Ten championship for the first time in a long time um\nAnd we're going to get some guys in there that they bought into what Barry was to all of the coaching staff and those were all the really good things but I Will not deny that that team when you look at Chris Chambers early Evans or Ron Dane or you go on and on the road that top to bottom there are probably a better team\nI Will say we would have gave him a hell of a game I Will tell you that\nWell I Will he be the you know they showed the rose bowl game before the fans to well if you came in early you grow up they had it up and the jumbo screen\nAnd it's I watched that tonight I forgot over time how many great players were on both sides of the ball in that game\nWe we all think about wing cook Ken I'm running out but you know Jay Jay stokes was going to UCLA team right engineer Miller was done that I see a light beam and is is I watch the game I went wow he played in that game and he played in the game and you looked a lot sooner than that\nFor that\nYeah you know when you take a look at it I think that's the one thing that very never really for us focused on one guy whether it was on our team or on the other to fight we we knew that have played makers joy gallery in Ohio State we knew he was really really good\nBut that wasn't the focus we focused on the overall picture of the team and that's where you play you don't play one guy and I think that's how we approached a lot of that stuff okay\nWinter standard good boring come up with a game plan to kind of take out of that and we had enough play makers on our side\nI'm honestly defense but I just on our side with Wisconsin that we're able to overcome some of that and the guys play with heart and passion and you grind for two years ago five and six and you're that close we we play a little edge because we're tired of losing that way and then we wanted to get over the whole\nI think the main in why your legacy as the team has grown over the last twenty five years\nBecause of what the program has done since and that if you guys would have done what you did and the program fell back and maybe it popped up again and then it fell back I can thinking that twenty five years than we've seen\nA a a a I'm trying to think it was it Gary Barnett that led a northwest yeah team to enroll spray\nAnd I think back to Illinois they they had a rules ball Michigan State had a pop Michigan had had some pasta Ohio State through before everything changed as far as the rose bowl being the old brass playoffs and all that sure if you look at what this program has done then oftentimes we talk about what Paul has done here since he took over but\nYou know what it's all the coaches have done very stepped aside they've kept his legacy alive yup and I think that's where your legacy and your group has grown because the fact that the program has increasingly gotten better we mentioned multiple roles boils down to that\nThink when Barry came in he ... he was young what forty years old roughly forty one whatever was um had a plan and he knew how to win the big thing because he'd done it I was Hayden Fry and damage guardian and Bernie Wyatt and brought in some guys that were with them at um Notre Dame and jump ... um\nHe had guys that they knew how to win and knew how to coach knew how to set the tone knew how to recruit\nUm and I think that's the beauty of the plan really hasn't changed I mean the way you recruiting in type of players are going after it might be different facilities certainly are different um and how that impacts recruits in families and the education to get here and they've done a great job of the department promoting\nA academic supports and and you across the board right\nUm but I I think the the ... for us as some guys that come here no it's it's kinda like we're going to grind we're we're going to play smash mouth\nBut we've got no skill guys if you want to go to school with\nYou can do that too I'm In through the years you've had different players uh different positions that have stepped up for a number of years we had great Titus that we get some really good receiver and our kind of getting back to tied into running backs the lime light might have been consistent defensively\nFor a little bit short on the defensive back side with some young players but some good young players um it kind of the ebb and flow of things but when when we switched to transition from one or the other other guys are stepping up and that's where you see that does come into play and the guys are bought into what's being sold here and that hasn't changed from year to year in\nThe Florida State has won national championship now they're really great we don't do that will level off with things and I think that's because of the hard work and the way coaches approach things in the expectations academically in an athletic leave that coaches put on the kids and and it's not so much scream and yell right\nI Want the best for you I'm going to push you and challenge you to be the absolute best you can be in in all phases while you're here\nAnd if guys respond to that then you see the product on the field in the classroom and and good things happen that way and and that's I think a credit to the type of coaches that we had written that this isn't just football right you see with basketball we see with women's hockey track and field for a long time with the nutty comb and cross country who's going to be hosting the NC double a shirt a few ... I mean\nIt's really cool to see how this whole program has evolved in growing with the expectation that you're going to win\nI think it also kind of ironic that when the program appear to be going a bit sideways\nWhich authorized it I'll always refer to his coach but he went back to the blueprint yeah and he went ... back pretty quick and he went out east and he knew what he had to do\nAnd he went and got tall and he got Joe Rudolph beer and you know really really well he was a part of that he was a key ... Ninety three Ninety four team for sure and those guys right at the ship quickly\nIn other programs back to where it was before again\nGoes back to the expectations bill Callahan who was the coach for for Rudy in the office aligned he talked about attention to detail an expectation I don't know if there was a guy that expected more of these guys if you took one wrong step he is on you\nWhether it's right or left it fall back what\nIf you took it wrong he would replace them film ... over and over and and so you he was blue in the face but that's the expectation I think that's the same way that the Rudy approaches things as as he teaches at well aiming points seeing the target hitting the target for work and and that's why we've been successful with those guys that expectation\nI don't think we'll ever go away you know we should\nTalk a little bit about this game that was here tonight that\nYou're at a bigger at right it's kind of lost that it already has all get together and you know it's interesting to started I was on Twitter ... adventure post game and win Wisconsin went up thirty forty ten\nI'm I kind of tease it a little bit I said hey you know badgered nation breathing a sigh of relief I said a lot of surprises coming up in the post game show and then boom they hit a touchdown I went back on Twitter and I ... I wrote I Hope I didn't ...\nI did that another surprise at All right so here's what we're going to you can hit us up onto it or if you want to get at badger post game that's our Twitter handles also the emails still works better post game and Gmail dot com and you've got the toll free number as well if you want to jump on I Know pad and walk a shot standing by to take a quick break Scott will come back we'll get to pat\nAnd we should talk about these games that I did um badgers at this point of the seasons got\nYou know I think you are who you are they're dealing with a lot of them up right now from an injury standpoint\nUm I use the term to some of my colleagues were discussing the back into the ice speaking of the defensive side was her babies out there\nAnd they were learning trial by fire I think that's the term that Matt used with a coach Chris to bed earlier tonight but we'll talk about that and more as we continue state whether it's our for post game show continues right after this break for go further and this is Patrick football field\nRemember Ahmadi tumor the biggest thing I remember the rose bowl watching TV a Nelly when mark Montgomery got just an incredible uh you guys rallied um I remember a run in the naked for that go ahead touchdown\nUm I remember watching it with my dad was upstairs listen it is right now with him and my mom and my brother\nAnd my brother just show and he's going to run out of time it's going to run out of time it was Wayne Cook a came to learn that are\nGood and brother in law a proposed to my sister and in their states they were in one of the ... owns in Pasadena and I think you got engaged that same day Nelly Scott notes that are\nYou guys will never know what you did for the state I'm In that game\nYou turn the tide on everything I remember one came very became head coach in the show when he said if you don't have season tickets now you'd better get him because pretty soon you won't be able to you guys were something else uh nobody thought you could do it\nUm I think UCLA was ranked number sick you're shutdown case though shutting down it was shot him down\nGo ride it created a dynasty I go right\n[laughter] but I don't know how you follow that out so we do we believe we simply ought to ... and you want an update on the quest your dog get an adventure Boesky my Twitter tonight I'm I wrote earlier as we salute the Ninety four Rose Bowl champs who wins dispatcher Rose Bowl matchup\nNutty for badgers Ninety nine badgers or the sixty two badgers\nRight now the badgers got fifty six percent Ninety four badgers ... percent get Reggie on Twitter ...

... really good job I think ... if I remember I had the one quarterback curry\nChase them down you see the speed of those guys that inside linebackers Tyler jobs and I thought I had a really good game um cause you know just like a balloon fell on top of it and then they turned that turnover boy to do it a point and that's\nThat's just understanding how what what can I Do to help the team and not going outside what the expectation of your job is in that particular play\nBut making sure that you when you can make a play you make it and then when you make a play\nHow do you make it bigger with the turnover and I thought tolerated a great job with all those guys I mean there are on the top of a leading tackles for the team and a lot of them have solo tackles regretting their own space\nAnd that's hard to do Martinez is good make it can hurt you with his arm and it was his feet but um I I thought our guys just really covered well and again things to improve because there were mistakes and some things that were blown but overall I thought the linebacker set a great job\nWell you mentioned the linebacker specifically TJ Edwards let's go back inside the locker room I tell her with the badger senior TJ Edwards\nLet's begin with something that predates all of us player is bringing the Ninety three team back stab them here and then he got saw them play live certainly seen and heard

Thirteen of twenty four was not picked off tonight I'm a hundred and sixty three yards and one touchdown he was stacked once longest completion twenty six but the badgers wouldn't next week at Michigan not to take a\nJab at the quarterback who's got to play better has to play better yeah oh I think he's going to have to for sure uh eh that's an area where you you need your your quarterback to be solid consistent and you met her in the second half yeah he did and it got better that\nI think overall the dolphins has to start fast right they they got to be able to get out and go and Taylor has to have a couple of punishing runs which means you all kinds of wine has to go out that as that improves now you open up the passing gaming\nAltogether you have to come and rally right from the get go you can't be patient and you can't wait you have to find a way to to throw a first punch that's the Amish in ... Michigan is going to react and then you have to be prepared to embrace yourself or their first punch\nAnd how are you going to respond defensively that some type of game that you're probably going to the next week and who could last the longest I think will come out on top I think the thing about Alex that impresses me the most though is that he's a fighter yeah and I mean you go back last week against Iowa\nOr yeah look I mean ... weeks ago and it was on my way to have to go against I Will you go back and look at that\nHe engineers that drive to win the football game right right and I mean today struggle in the first day I mean it it it was on display everyone saw that but yet in the second half right at the ship\nFound some receivers stayed in the pocket make some big throws a certain times guys may catch just for them starting that running game picked up but yet he's the guy that drives the office of unit and in the end they put forty one points on the board yeah I mean they were able to do that against him pretty decent fee for the athletes athletes out there for sure\nI'm the one thing that I really like about already broken is\nWhen he comes off this island and he's got eighty thousand people scream and yell at him what he did wrong he already knows trust me he already knows but the communication with coach Chris with Joel Rudolph was on the field with them I'm On a headset with John but Meyer who was the quarterbacks coach\nI'm teaching and learning as a there they go in and how am I going to transfer that information to memory soy don't don't have that same mistake\nAgain I I think he's heads up that way not does that mean that he always can produce physically or guys catch the ball always form no but I think he learns as it goes through the game which is why you see ... some of those improvements made in the second half because he's got a four fold first half\nOf that memory bank or to transfer into the second half and if it's consistent that way for him and his guys I think that's where you start to see some of his true talent come out\nForty one twenty four the final here at the Capitol check our final time out to have some final thought and we'll talk a bit about Michigan as the Ford wrap up show continues says badger football from ... feel\n\nHere I thought we were a day or whatever that's okay for the right here will you put those final thoughts together right now is we kind of put a cap on this\nGame here's a thing like with Michigan right ... um we we go backwards as soon as we talk about nine and three of bunch that that was a big game for us that season listening to be a big game for these guys this year\nAnd it and it's memories you create memories that ... that we're able to share this year but these guys are going we can we go out and creating memories and and one of those is having an opportunity to go over to Michigan and when\nWhich is a hard place to go um\nIf you have to understand what's coming at ya young players are going to have to learn awfully quick um but I think there's a great opportunity for those young guys to really grow up this next week\nOr they're going to have to grow up quickly especially in the back and as we talked about their litter with the injuries and to give you missed it got Nelson was fly were they targeting pedal the by the way I Would have had a few of those I felt\nWhen we're taught that you knew you were taught differently at that time of the physical part of the game not that it's changed a lot of guys are still fast a strong but I how you have to approach that as much differently and\nIs very bad so somebody is going to have to fix this problem it's going to become clearer and clearer what has to happen\nToday so\nI think it's a great question though\nAnd I'm very I'm Glad you asked it but I also I think writing is a great thing but they all know what the problem is they don't want to deal with it they just don't want to deal with it [noise]\nIt's sad but true All right you are listening to the ... on money show or hey you know with a\nTon of resources on the website and Jill and money dot com including links to Social Security how to manage your account on line and Social Security estimator\nAnd also of this link to a cool service called P.

this was a lot of men and my mom being in lots of family there\nI Would certainly but I think I think it'd be by submissions 'cause\nI don't want to go to Robin fighting over a guy fighting and you drink the guy a check for going in dollars and he's out partying for two years on your show it was certainly true you're not going to have that it took me a little soft because he didn't really need to be there in ... this was\nYou know is for him because he has to make money so yeah I can be on the side\nYeah eighty million bucks I mean you know me I live up in the mountains on her but you had any eighty bucks I can live cool for two weeks you know let alone have a million dollars for two years I mean you gotta be kidding me look ... a chip on his shoulder ever since the press conference winter rye New York city last\nYear and you know McGregor running his mouth with it there but yeah you're right a guy who's been fighting over a guy who has since ... and this guy's never lost around now on the scoring I didn't see did McGregor when we went around for did he went around one two or three or none of them\nAre pretty well for me to be talking to was it took him down and beat the hell out of him\nWhy don't pray for somebody who could be decided his dad was in the box and of course that's not to be on the stand up boxing when they're caught a victim of art round three but\nGot I'm On the ground like a joke and and we were slot open ocean right after that happened\nI saw I saw that too is a number of men off jumps out of the cage goes after I Believe the jujitsu coach of Conor McGregor and and and then you know they just started going after them and in Seoul mainly look there's all this is going to do is just drive more and more eyeballs to watch the sports\nI Hope this wasn't fabricated 'cause it really looked like this was a natural reaction on both sides\nWere really a struggle McGregor stuff he said about his family at all the trash talk to him to answer the by David Bloom or Moshe ... there was no respect he just started screaming and yelling at him talk all the way out of the way it looked after cars to just you know it's like you said it will happen there\nAnd walk out the car and got back up too much space\nSomebody who could be clearer adult weren't sucker punch the adults back toward the base so that guy's got to go to jail but I mean we used to be arrested and do some jail time for that that was ridiculous\nRight where where was this fight again though\nIt with him that great city of Las Vegas\nAnd you know me I mean you and they'll be all on you and I've seen plenty of things in Vegas the other nobody goes to jail anymore meant that they should do but\nI don't think I should have gone to jail for activists in Las Vegas I tell you that well the same way\nWell fortunately at the statute of limitations is up I found out it's only an hour and a half which is why I Love Vegas man so they don't catch you by the end of the show than

combing forty or I don't want to see those guys at a club in Vegas getting tips denied drinking the ace of spades holding each other's hands up there and pulling down bad\nChecks I Do not want to see that I honestly want to see could be any time you seize McGregor I don't care if it's in a mall and he's trying to get a chair Eli made it a hotdog on a stick and want to see him jump the line that found him again\nI think that would happen to either it's just really really a car they they had a police escort both of them out of the way that the fighting that when I'm a regular thing Rob a year ago it on the property it was a big show with way shortly and start with each other and then there was a big circus but\nIn reality they were taking the private jet together from Scott what's the best coverage when they got along with all due respect him for tonight is a doubt I can be really really a scar McGregor\nWell good and that makes two of us ... let's talk about when we were there and they may and with boxing look I Know nobody knows more this network or about boxing\nThey knew and people often say well until we get real heavy weights 'cause that's what America's built on a bronze drink than Bruce I really can't find a way to get into it because with the guys are never really heavy weights for middle weights or light weights for example what is it gives us this attraction\nIs it the fact you can use your legs you can basically do everything but ... with a screwdriver\nRobots that gives you a lotta I like the like but you know\nThe crowd that to me about that it's an art science but I Love yelling at the heart but after about two hours ... minutes by car to have it on the way I learned that pretty much doing nothing and I'm yelling stabbed him up which is\nWhich is why I prefer a boxer but I think it's also a lot of the job we we joke guy just dating a living hell out of each other that to me it doesn't get any better as a sport\nI Would agree but until they start to say that there's a concussion protocol that they have to go to you know how you and I feel about that kind of stuff you know what you're getting yourself into what you're signing yourself up more\nUh forget it hey you know what the us as well to that why can't they find a cure for cauliflower ear I mean one set things pop it's gone forever right isn't there a way you can fix that thing drain it apparently not\nThink so I guess they went to their careers were granted because I was going to continue to fight will be counterproductive because it's going to happen again but\nI don't think that would let that cauliflower I think it's from a light on the ground in sharp contrast to the years and then ... and ... and stuff 'cause they don't want to say that all of the I think it's a badge of honor up actually like it\nWas does it get them out of listening to their old lady and what I'm saying I Can't hear you my ears off jak\nRight in with that they are trying to do that the key to

Thursday they played Seventy minutes on Sunday and then read the shore week and last Thursday Night Football is here to stay but but you have to feel as as somebody from a patriots perspective looking at this\n... you got a little lucky there you're facing a team that was kind of beer down and beaten up and had all that extra working on Sunday makes it a lot easier to put the put on the gas and beat it seemed like the cult under those circumstances\nIt does you know like you said you know the cold to play five quarters on Sunday or you're on the road or at home against Miami that game was over half way through the third quarter so you're sort of coast mode and take the fourth quarter off\nAnd then you you have to walk through his in order to get on a plane travel Nazi Slater set up to go as the colds you know how much they enjoy you know playing these Thursday night games that that was a bang up team\nBut they fought hard but it's yeah it's good to be three to concern now this year started it's great to have that look back\nAnd now you've got the chief coming up in nine days acts to tell him to get ready for we were talking about this earlier with with Patrick ... homes and everything he does any of the three step by step drop find the guy open fire a laser and you know forty yard gain\nAnd it gets flushed out of pocket another play runs around make things happen we hear all the time about bill ... approach to take away with the other team does bad\nI don't know when you take away from the chiefs what do you do to slow down the chiefs off that\nI I think you gotta you gotta perfect you're not perfect you really are polish regrets on defense um try and get them to come up here and traits ogles for touchdowns scale you they're going to get their yards there's no doubt about it was called bunch games gets the chiefs whether you're or\nDoubted arrowhead they they they stress the perimeter of your events these calls are great game um it's just at the end of the half and then to games\nSometimes the clock gets away you know from an Eddie ... coach team and we've seen it a\nBunch of times um I don't know I don't know how to stop the home and watch them a lot this year I you know it just looks like a shortstop out there playing quarterback gets athletic he can make all the girls ...\nUm it just doesn't seem like the games too big for him and that's pretty impressive I think you know going back to last year that was a better cook Columbus sit watch Al Smith run out off heads and understand what they wanted to do with that off as\nWe see all these great young quarterbacks right and and I don't know why it changed to the point where it's no longer a fifty percent bust raid the quarterbacks are coming in their highly drafted they're making an impact\nAnd and I don't know whether it's coaches embracing what these guys did a college in incorporating that into the office of attack but either way we see more and more of these very young quarterback\nAnd yeah Hey Tom Brady lucky wants to buy those forty five we know that that the status but\nBoy at some point it's gotta be tempting for the patriots to flip the page over to somebody to get one of the great young guys could you imagine having Patrick ... could you imagine having banker may feel how tempted to the patriots going to be each and every year going forward to go get one of the guys now that we see that more and more of them are turning out to a great\nDeal I thought yeah when we talked about so my radio show or two years ago we thought there is going to be young quarterback problem in his leg you know after breeze after Rogers after Brady office burger river's really don't have it and I know people like they'll they met ride that Stafford addict or just stack guys just don't know how much they win\n'em but here we go I mean we've got two young guys on our division hill which are shelling and of course and Donald a Baker made so now he runs around town at the guy Jimmy here\nBut you can't keep to franchise quarterbacks we know that it's sad what happened to him a San Francisco look see them play for a year but uh I think these guys come in like a grown up fifty sixty times again young quarterback for the owner or college which has them reading from a concept that route standpoint to be ready to the next level\nThey're they're thrown at fifty times game in college there doing those seven on seven camps everywhere they're throwing their throwing they're throwing their throwing and finally it it's all working you know there were those years where the NFL coach who complain holiday running these college often is we're not going to do that I think now they're saying let's do what these guys\nLet's do what they're good at it they grow into the game and I just think the temptation is going to get greater and greater each and every year because what Tom wants to do is only half of the equation the other half the equation is how long the patriots want him to be the guy and I think to the extent that the crafts\nHad been the impediment to moving on if there's any truth to that and who knows at this point\nBut at some point you got you gotta you gotta ripped a band aid off at some point you got to say we're missing out on an opportunity to for our own homes owned Baker Mayfield any of these guys flood the NFL is going to be a point where you're going to be the last one to not have one\nBad I mean hey you know we should we look at history books we talk about our daily on and off a few such a long time ago right especially on something as time passed him by the end of the last forever so uh I don't know we we enjoy what we have up here it's a depressive cyber touchdowns yesterday we\nWill never see a guy like this year but I I'm anxious to see the balls that eventually postal check post ready but uh I don't know Mike what Africa hope you saw me on your show that'd be nice\nFor are you are or you know the patriots won't be relevant then so we want to talk to you are you are you [laughter] are you feeling about the team big picture now that you know out of that whole of one and two and three and two arrows seemed to be pointing up is this a team that still has all of its goals within its reach\nOh yeah yeah I mean I guess he's wide open I think it's a dream team race potentially\nBut I'm usually around ten we can to Fifteen Bill Bill really understands the league and all that he's going to be able to schemes each better get better just two weeks alone [noise] um and if they just keep dart helpless ... eyes James why I'm not\nTrying to cover James coming out of the fact that he looks as good as he's ever looked at it it's hard to say that on top of it you know with the way out on them so they keep their health will be fine\nNow how 'bout certainly Michelle I mean I knew when they took it running back in the first round they're not going to take them and put them in a rotation they're going to use them and now that he's healthy he's really come into his own\nGay looks he looks good I mean there are a little town if at first I thought they through to the fire and that's a hell of a sudden

the NBC Sports\nRadio mobile apps\nRob Bush go back at it with you and other Sunday Morning\nOut east it's still Saturday Night live out here on the left coast is we're working our way towards week five of the national football league in what a great book always my\nFavorite month because uh the September warm weather is gone for a lot of places in the country all you gotta do is watch these baseball games watch the college football games the sweater sometimes heavy coats are already out there is certainly a net\nAnd its shell in the air hopefully we have a long long winter\nIn store but she had to take it from a guy who lives out in Southern California where the weather's always warm is why I had to move a hundred miles away up on top of the mountains so it's cold as I look outside of the nice bombing Chris forty five degrees no other place I'd rather be eight five five three two three four and we see\nIs the number to chime in but it's always cold it's nipping at this time of year for baseball which means the wrong production is down the pitching is on full display and that's what I like to see I've always been a guy who's a band about pitching first ... first I'm partially\nHave a couple of sons who went on a plate college baseball they were both pitchers which was nice for me is want to start or the other was a closer so I could a show up on every fifth day and watch one start and I would only show up to the yard when they had a lead towards the end of the game to catch the ninth inning and\nThat's why I like post season because we don't need those five start or so forth and those guys that just tend to kind\nOf mock it up while we're waiting for the number one guy to come around\nThen there's the Houston Astros was really the biggest question is who is going to be one egg behind Justin Berlin or do you like Garrett cold cold wasn't number two in the rotation throughout the course of the year I guess that's just the way it fell right\nDallas ... still pretty good\nLand smugglers he's got that junk that he throws they're actually a great pitcher and I mean junk and believe me the bashed a sense you can\nAnd then there's Charlie Martin who if any team in major league baseball would take a guy with as many wins and it's good of busy RAs Charlie Morton had an old is your number five guy how can you not like the Houston Astros well you gotta like the red Sox the red Sox won five more games right\nNot until Saturday where the Yankees put it on a pretty good and we do\nThe bats and John Carlos Stanton or the bats with of course there and judge back to back home runs for judge now the ninth inning and then the first any between game one in game two really just picking up where we left off and how about the Gary Sanchez to Sanchez\nThe guy who's been much maligned this year by Yankee fans and rightfully so\nAh didn't really play the Yankee way if you hear all the fans have gotten on 'em and they don't put up with that stuff I mean the the Yankees fan base is a no nonsense fan base not running out ground balls how dare you try to play catch or for the Bronx bombers independence drives and all the history that has gone before you\nBut yet what does he do he uh breaks it open with a moon shot I'm almost five hundred feet\nFrom three rounding or as the Yankees beat the red Sox and Yankees out hit the red Sox and ball game warden game too and they have a split to show for it as David Price continues his struggles against\nThe New York Yankees and look there is sometimes people say well this guy has your number of this team has your number\nI mean price I was looking at the numbers here in thirty innings pitched against the Yankees he's given a fourteen home runs\nAnd that was just after the judge home run that's why I stopped counting right there\nI'd watch some of the other games that were going on as well to to be prepared for the show I got one eye on the the college football game literally in front of me listening to a hockey game I'm watching baseball on on on TV\nBuddies got an eye bad watching another game trying to grow through the scores it all comes raining down and how great of a month is October you have not only major league baseball winding its way down as we're just a couple of weeks away from finding out who the world champ will be good we have\nA rematch of last year's World Series quite possibly\nCastro's of look great\nThen you have the Dodgers who happening around a lot run in the postseason Atlanta team that's a couple of years ahead of schedule certainly the lesser of the opponents with Colorado or Atlanta but\nHey the Dodgers play who the Dodgers play in Atlanta still won the ... east this year and the brewers are playing some great baseball as well get in that little bit later on in the program but with the Yankees and the red Sox you get that split and now you head back to\nNew York where the Yankees have taken away home field advantage of the Yankees can win game three game for that'll be it would be an early exit for the best team in baseball Chris Sale was what we thought he would be a game on David Price\nIf you look at numbers and if you look at history is what we thought he would be in game two to one of the reasons why are you may like the Dodgers is yours because Clinton Kurdish off for the longest time has had a reputation of being a guy who jokes and can't get it done in the postseason\nNow granted remember what I just told you about the Braves not necessarily being world leaders a young team in about three years from now see how much better the Braves are\nBut the ... one of his best performance is I've seen in ages that he had in game number two for the Dodgers and that has them sitting pretty going to Atlanta or for games three on Sunday\nBut Garrett colds your number two for Houston oh obviously the nice thing is now what do you play with Tyco callers Charlie Morton any one of\nThose guys any one of the long bullpen guys can come in and spell you just to be able to get you to revert or sooner who remember when he came over mid year\nAstros players and even if they wanted because he was coming off a suspension for domestic violence say so we're going to let this guy talk we're going to let him have his say have is the eastern word is talking to my connections in Houston that he's been very good with the team\nHe's answered questions he's been nothing but a great teeming since he's been there now they're giving them the opportunity yes the leash maybe a little bit longer because there's talent backs

there because I don't trust coats I don't trust the quarterback against could have bought new to the schedule\nAnd put a lot of winnable games as you mentioned being Atlanta on the road that you you'd planted and I think ultimately for them but they don't have any to can't take a weakness now I don't know in January with the overriding strength is it's going to get them through but\nThere's nothing about as is while they really can't do acts and teams like that we find a way to win ten games get\nHey why are the chiefs who were undefeated and who came back was a nice when ... got a pretty good defense\nWire that she's just a three point favorite at home against James which NFL home fields worth three bones the laws that are basically saying this was an even up game do we like the jags and that defense that much because many homes are straight up on fire\nJacksonville at the expense of all their number one point allowed for community than their number one in ... against the number one in passing or to get\nThat all that I Would take Kansas City in this game that she's her home or do you have the best fault and to me that's all right now I Know there are a few things that are better but if you are and the city that all I can put it on folks they they do it we can and week out more homes at the hands down if you can lead to for a week\nAt all he's got a long way to go to prove himself would you do walk him pretty evident that he's not going to be a flash and he thought I might be questioned without and bill is the same questions\nIn for a year and a half now I Know the defense is really good\n... are you getting out of poor because there are some weeks he plays really well there are other Wi Fi control for X totally submarines that came so for me give\nMe the quarter pack give me a home field I Do think it's a good game and I pray practical to Quebec and they have the right now or what's going on but I Would Kansas City because of her home and because it clearly have a stark advantage quarterback\nAndrew Iran's inside of dot coms are get mad at you know me being a Seattle native in a sea hawks ticket holders basically sold all those games this year\nI Do know the NFC West I Believe I don't like either line rams are only giving up seven and a half\nIn Seattle no are all Thomas I mean nobody's planes and to see any talk Michael Caine drugs out there getting ready to throw them in the bubble fugitive styles okay uh yeah seven and a half more like Seventeen and a half the rams when that and the niners at home only given three and a half of the cardinals really I mean come on\nThe record and older terrible what we'd be talked about the bills\nAnd the door for pay the bills are really bad that crazy when in Minnesota I think most people would agree that was an aberration [noise]\nBut the cardinals are just unconscionable I mean the cardinals are going to be lucky to want to get in here so I'm with you all the niners even with ... and they're like they're not going to all the games but they're going to be competitive and they're going to be ... if they don't that's a serious indictment or that kind of food that program building\nAs far as the rest of the sea hawks your a sea hawks and you are my friends will be very nice I Would agree with you that that line is too low if you're a better you probably want to hit the rams pretty hard and that came\nOut of a problem with that I mean hey when you're a college team can be your pro team in that town like Washington surely could see offices here stay the battle of hotshot anybody care or any one of these teams going anywhere or if you're outside the Lone Star state just forget about it\nI mean Dallas Dallas is bad Dallas we not only the bad they're born they just have nothing I I Know people must Kelly is fantastic but everybody else\nThat team I mean how can you get excited about the von often it out on her back Prescott Twain I mean they weren't the cowboys and that team is the lions they would never be on a prime time and for the Texans are concerned book I I\nDon't rule them out completely because I Do think how could that the line is terrible the coaches awful I

at\nPhilly who you like yeah you're just going to the eagles I like them to win at home I like the eagles at home too and in part of the reason because even cook is still not ... percent don't even know if he's going to play today but uh he's on my fantasy one of my fantasy team he's going to sit until I see that guy explosive and a hundred percent and he is not that and against a team on the

continues once again here's what a\nPerfectly natural for parents to protect their children from harm\nBut can being overly protective of child affected negatively for life here with the story info tracks Roy Mackey Roy thank you Chris Dr Kevin ... is an internationally known psychologist and speaker and now the author of a when your kid is hurting helping your child through the tough days\nDo you think kids are hurting more today than previous generations and mail you can give us some examples of that\nAbsolutely but I got news for your parents your kids are hurting every day they go out the door they're wondering if today is the day that they're going to get hammered\nBy the peer group that in fact I've got six charter schools out west in Arizona and Colorado and\nI like to go into the classrooms and I like to have fun\nAnybody who knows me knows that funds my middle name and I've been talking to the kids about what do you say when somebody really put you down or ... out makes fun of us cetera and I've taught the kids to say when somebody has really snarky to you while I didn't realize you felt so bad about yourself\n[noise] and I wish you could see the expressions on the kid's face is 'cause they say oh\nThat really takes the widow that person's sales does ... does so again I think as a parent you have to be aware of that is charging once said the Jane Jane you don't get it there's a jungle out there well there's a jungle for our kids and I think if you really want to help your kids\nYou can snow plow the roads alive for um in fact I just put a an op ed that talks about concepts somebody's calling lawnmower parents said I've been calling it snow plowing the roads alive for kids for years\nYou can't put a helmet on them and send them out the door there's going to be some bumps bruises but there is a smart way to do this parents and that's what this book is about when your kid is hurting and the subtitle\nSays it all helping your child through the tough days in other words the tough days or comment is just a matter are you going to a quip you're a kid for those tough days are not one of the\nThings you write about is the importance of listening which sounds pretty obvious but in many cases teenagers clam up and hardly say anything certainly nothing of what they're going through so what can parents do in that case\nNumber one lesson this one's worth\nGold as a parent stop\nAsking your kids questions kids in hospitals have a lot of similarities kids have questions husband is a question kids hey do why word\nHusbands would hate to why we're in fact a side note for us husbands the worst thing I'll wife said her husband is honey we need to talk I mean that means a lot of words are coming your way gentleman quickly better duck\nBut back to these kids if you want a kid that talk to you and this goes for husbands as well say honey I'm\n... something by you um I'd love to know your opinion now there's the key word\nI'd love to know your opinion about this er about that or if a kid says something say tell me more about that now tell me more about that is a command and English language but it doesn't put the defenses up what questions do so perfunctory how has your school's today I\nWould you do it today in your kid goes to his room there get yourself out most of the door and our places in Texas buddies like a woodpecker that's got a bad case of ADHD and they shut you out of your life you know so he ... the Boston airport here we're talking with\nDr Kevin lemon and internationally known psychologist and the author of when your kid is hurting helping your child through the tough days I think a lot of parents have a tough time finding that middle ground though you talked about snowplow or the helicopter parents\nVersus stepping too far back are there any suggestions there on how we can find that sweet spot in the middle\nYeah I've spent a lifetime talking about that\nThat I'm a person of faith so my reference point is God and I would ask anybody as a person of faith in God and authoritarian dizzy grab us by this girl for the neck twister lobe for good measure and say you will that issue will do that\nThis is the way I see it that's not true but he is a Supreme what authority so up God's our model done apparent ought to be working hard on being an authority without being authoritarian but I'm telling the parents and the ... are famous for bringing kids up\nIn a authoritarian way hey you gonna do it I tell you to do as long as you live on his roof\nThey get that look off your phrase right now change

whole health and wellness Judy gamma along with doctors to bargain\nOkay so today and actually with Larry north because the doctors are out a little while they were going to be having fun fun fun I Love today's topic is about taking control like polar disorder we got a special guest coming on with us Michael pitch he has a book owning bipolar\nAnd uh you know this book has just been released and it's something you definitely want to pick up owning bipolar it's great for the patient and the families but it's also good for practitioners but before I bring him on Larry\nI thought we talk a little bit amongst ourselves about our own experience with people with bipolar\nWell I've been pretty open about my upbringing and your suicide so high and the tragedy I I've had two friends whose children have taken their own lives there were ... adult children early twenties yeah\nMy both my parents had attempted suicide on multiple occasions so it was in and then it occurred to me as I was in my twenties and thirties am I going to get this semi depressed am I going to have bipolar\nI'm pretty sure my father was bipolar\nAnd I think that we we counter certain people he had a gambling addiction to write he had a gambling addiction but he had a personality disorder more than anything and so and again when I think the doctor come time he'll talk about the mood swings so er visits to track he's in a good mood gambling her by her dad or my dad\nBut then when the losses come or he's broker he has to do something to get money\nAnd then the anger and the behavior was pretty rough\nBut also I think in our daily lives we can ... there's probably people that I've grown up or if it were my childhood friends and they were my friends I Love them but I've noticed some shift says they've gotten older some negative\nAttitudes some behaviors that I didn't notice when I was maybe a kid or in my baby recognize it made anyway and they do to recognize how about yourself\nBut you know I have the I have a family member with bipolar and then that this particular family member also struggled with alcohol addiction and she sent that what do you call a recovering alcoholic I don't recall drought and they were covering\nAnd um she would call me like in the middle of the night and go on these rants and I'd have to go to work the next day and so I had to you know it's tough because it was the ... block her number but then I always had in the back of my head what if something happens to her and I need to go there and I've lost her number\nSo I was only ... I'm afraid to walk her number on now she's so much better she's not you know I'm no she's she's not drinking and and life is so much better and we have a really good relationship but it was really rocky\nFor a long time for the simple fact of life when you have a family member has bipolar disorder life is really hard for everyone in the family is not just that particular butter yeah it affects everybody and oh my gosh the reigning king\nUm okay so if you don't know right in the ... should know and I'm going to have to make an introduction Raymond king is one of these like over ... he's an

from California State University and he has a mass or science and psychology from Layla\nMarymount University and you've got a great book owning bipolar how patients and families can take control and bipolar disorder and you know if you are a listener and you either have bipolar in a family member of bipolar or maybe you work with bipolar oh my gosh this is the guy you want to talk to him because he\nHas such great stuff in in a Michael thank you for coming on and talking to us about your book only bipolar\nThank you so much for having me it's a pleasure to be here today\nIn your Thirty years you'd be enlightened done like marriage counseling and family therapy so why bipolar why did you pick misspoken\nWalk into a therapist for over Thirty years and I've during the course of the time was treated a number of political problems that relationship issues for adults adolescents but several years ago for whatever reason I started to get a run up sort\nOf a new patients uh referred from treatment facilities with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and\nGiven that that seemed to be sort of a flux sets of of people coming in it was important for me to kind of get my hands around uh the concepts of bipolar disorder and provide a patient can end up families\nAre some good information and a good a formula to expect going forward for treatment in particular I noticed that we family members that might a company patients particularly young patients are teenagers and so forth who came in ah their parents would often remark about how little\nInformation and support a was available for them at least what they could find locally and it may be online and a broader scale and\nAnd I mentioned this in owning bipolar and and the perfect for the book there was one particular parents who just made a very to me\nI'm studying sort of um a proclamation to me and and repeated it actually a couple of times of how little is available to somebody like herself are who are searching for you know where to bipolar come from what\nCould a parents expect I'm going forward for children and for that matter spouses caregivers um family members of all kinds of expect and what to do with that individual is go forward struggling with their disorder either in treatment or prior to treatment [noise]\nSo um it was something of a clarion call for me to do further into research and begin to come up with a concept that idea is to help people specifically and not just be a sort of a transitional a professional in their lives but really help them\nA Guided through that entire process and as it went through the research I found from what I found to be very interesting and\nIn fact disturbing statistics about\nBipolar and that is that about two thirds of all people with bipolar disorder or misdiagnosed and among those about two thirds of that group and this diagnosed group of\nThose people are usually diagnosed with major depression alone and not the kind of depression that we see in bipolar disorder and that's and that's a very important distinction that we can talk about like even a more to the point um\nWait an average about ten years before they're treated properly though that that is from the beginning of the first sentence of bipolar disorder to where they're treated properly provide quality or they wait an average of nearly ... years and so you can imagine not only is\nWhy do you why do you think that is why do you think that they wait so long and and that and often times they refuse treatment so\nThere is actually several\nReasons for that um when you talk about if you treat 'em certainly\nDenial and here's treatment waited bipolar diagnosed um provided all expected and the idea is introduced to individual we can expect that there is some element of getting a lot of like\nHow people with substance abuse disorders me at first and I have a problem to carry similar and bipolar disorder that perhaps for slightly different reasons hearing there\nBut it can look very similar to that so you have any experience with addiction recovery you probably know what to look like Michael here attached to it as well\nAnd I also think that because bipolar disorder over the years has um frankly knocked in um [noise]\nHard to like myself I'm which respect to the unique kind of church we could tell them what to look for diagnostic we treated\nDifferently I think a lot of people kind of fall through the cracks of the mental health system even when they're searching for answers and searching for the white pine tree number ... might\nMichael let me ask you a question because I find a lot of people throw the term around rather loosely the iron wrong that they don't even know like at the water cooler at work or someone gets out of a relationship or has a he must do share that a lot and so\nSo so I think some people are probably labeled incorrectly where others might be labeled correctly but what is bipolar and\nBecause we are going to break I'm going to I Want to end on on that and I want you to be ready to answer that when we come back\nI'm Michael I you know what is it and how do we know because I think that's real important but I got to

of stabilization a few people will get it right the first time so to speak but very often\nA it's a struggle and particularly when\nA bipolar hasn't been identified and like you said they may receive

wrestling yeah well that's almost what would they go to immediately yeah he's getting close yeah that is it's easier to show the guy out than it is to beat them into unconscious right but I Want to see the fighting I don't want to see them you know how to each other at all [laughter] you know your pin down so you when I mean what is that\nWhen I don't want to see is guys jumping into the ring or even in the fight and sucker punch in guys from behind especially guys who just got choked out you know and then you just got back on the ... the guy jumped into the rings you if you watch the video

working before the games kick off the top of the [laughter]\n... so we had our we had a little talk about about the M M A a word\nGod I Know you're you're a big music guy down and uh\nI Know you're not a huge NFL fan but\nI Know you also kind of keep up to speed with everything where are you out with this NFL season [noise]\nUm well I don't know I the rams are doing really good and who were here in LA we're excited about that everybody's a I'm going to the game and a couple of weeks some I'm really looking forward to it or you are you sauce all live in San Diego and the charges or\nLA too so I don't know um now the team I grew up with is the Bengals and they're not doing anything so I don't know the other two great or they haven't been painted ... there\nAre two or three one start\nThere they're like the second best off and so the NFL\nRight we gotta talk them up or just I mean I have [laughter]\nYes you should jump back on that bandwagon bass but I'm Glad that you brought up your time and and you had a great run a teaching in in San Diego yeah I'm Glad you brought that up because I've I've tried to convey that to people I was asked about\nAbout this during the week and one of our shows here it it'd be sports radio about the the chargers being here in LA\nThey are going to host the raiders today here in LA and it's going to be probably Seventy thirty [laughter] in favor raider fans at the game today\nBut maybe you could you could put it in words I I I've I've tried to be as kinds I Can't I don't have an axe to grind I don't have anything against the chargers I really don't but I've said they they just don't belong here in LA they belong in San Diego right and the NFL clearly\nClearly made a a huge blunder letting the move to tool I understand there are type fraternity and the Spanish family shot it as as a way to you know double their investment in and do all the value of their franchise moving here to allay and they had to take that opening\nBut still it's such it's it's a lose lose across the board and I I I'm I'll be is a bold to say Steve\nI don't ever see a scenario where they will be embraced as an elite team at least not in my lifetime\nI don't think so either they just don't have a fan base here and the people in San Diego are really really upset with the team and the owners I mean really really upset so they've lost their fans in San Diego ... a good portion of them and they have yet to gain any in LA I mean I haven't heard one single person go hey how about those charges you know nobody is talking about it here\nI I mean you know sometimes sometimes you just you gotta you gotta you know tighten your belt and suck it up and do the right thing and I just I Wish you know before the the new stadium opens in Inglewood for the rams and twenty twenty\nI genuinely sincerely that the NFL will do the right thing and find a way to get them back to San Diego because can you honestly Steve can you imagine they're gonna open at that brand new stadium okay\nLots of seats lots of expensive seats the tickets are going to be sky high what how bad of a look is that going to be if you know the chargers for their home games you know or half full\nYeah seriously it's going to look really bad I mean it's great now people are gonna be laughing at yeah I mean it's great\nNow because they're playing at the ... center where the it's a small intimate you know twenty thousand plus a venue where where the the LA Galaxy play their soccer games really you know if you're here in LA ... if you have a chance to go see a game it's it's cool it's totally intimate it's like going to a high school game you're that close but\nEven then even with that\n... like we just said I mean most of their home games are like road games because fans of other teams here in LA\nBuild a stadium up and get all the tickets so like like I said today they're hosting the raiders it's probably going to be Seventy to eighty percent writer fans for this came today\nI I Would say more maybe more yeah\n'cause I Love the raiders\nBut but when they go to that when they go to the new stadium\n[laughter] I mean even if you get every charger fan\nThat lives in LA to go they're not going to fill that up\nI agree I just think it was a very strange move them because usually when the team leaves they go to a different state\nYou know what I mean lately different place if you're not familiar with\nHow close San Diego ... LA it's like one highway drive like two hours up to up the road you know what I mean it's just\nAnd then the people in San Diego have a great rivalry with everybody in LA it's two very different places yes they have the same weather and they're on the coast but that's it that's the only similarity between those two down yeah and and as you know the people in San Diego hate LA they hate it hate it\nAnd people from LA or only go to San Diego on the weekends 'cause LA's a great place to be out of against guys we're both\nSan Diego and San Francisco I mean they hate LA LA\nAll right and in one of their note here we've got the Dodgers going through the sweet tonight in Atlanta you mentioned that they're they're playing great they're doing really well I Would be surprised if they didn't complete the sweep tonight with water bill or on the mound\nAnd you know we do have you been around see we've talked about this daughter team a lot over the course of the season and it didn't look like\nEnough pitching at least early on and it seemed like they were just kind of throwing in guys left and right and\nHere we are now and all of a sudden\nHere it is October and basically they've essentially founded two brand new aces to go along with Clinton Kirsch a hundred review who was lights out and getting one and walk your view or who's going to start tonight or in ... three all of a sudden now\nThey have a formidable rotation formidable rotation I should say and you know what that does the when you have a good rotation and your starters don't get knocked out early\nThat helps your book and they don't get over tax they don't get overworked they can do their job and then all of a sudden with that the way that does drop into swinging the bats\nThere are not only a I think I'd be clear favorites to get to the to the world series now in the national league but they're going to have a shot even though everybody's gonna pick whoever wins in the American league\nWe got a lot of stuff to root for here in Los Angeles yeah it's good times you've got baseball football recovered and then every angle\nYeah good times for sure Steve thank you my friend thank who's going to hear your buddy you got to spend a burger\nThose outstanding work for us here behind the scenes on NBC Sports radio right\nOr somebody the activists in the inactive who's going to be and who's going to be out if you try to state your fantasy land if you want to know who's going to play and who's already out we'll let you know who that is and again coming up at the top of the hour to kick off our number two\nHour quarterback NBC Sports radios mark Malone is going to join us get his thoughts on the action today that's coming up I'm jumping sports Sunday on NBC Sports radio [noise]\nI just you know for the NBC Sports radio [noise] worth\nA look at news for weather and other great information it's a new report was called Milky camp Thirteen twenty WMA jar [noise]\nIf you suffer from edu needs senior doctor about the little blue pill you know it can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle what if I told you that a certain little blue pill just came off pat\nIn December eleventh in that scene active ingredient that's in a little blue pill is now available in generic form available to you just thirty dollars for a month supply\nThat's a big discounts no more getting ripped off by the big pharma companies with forums dot com you can bypass the doctor's office pharmacy visit and see huge money on your prescription ... just go to Fort hymns dot com slash hope\nConsult with a licensed physician ad following their confidential medical review you can have the proper prescription deliver directly to your door for a fraction of the price and today will supplies last you can get started with a trial month for just five bucks\nThat's right five dollars here's what you do just go to for him dot com F.

tonight\nOtherwise cloudy low sound a lot around forty five and when I had to eat the pick a team miles per hour sunny side tomorrow I think it then your son's nightly high level laughing around these data tags under storms likely tomorrow night down on the wine cloudy\nSeventy you may need to make the same lines\nFrom Rajiv ... yet Jennifer cheap skiing\nIn the um W.\nRamsey your husband's your show America\nYou with us thanks for being here open owns a triple eight eight to five five two to five to five\nFive two to five [noise] and Brad is trying to\nSolve the hour in Phoenix, Arizona welcome to the Dave Ramsey show Brad what's up\n[noise] I think for taking my call they sure how can I help I have a question uh we uh my wife and I are just getting started and baby step to\nAh we've got about Ninety thousand in that and we currently have a three vehicles two of them are mine that I use for work they're both paid off um I use the truck and then I also have\nCome your car that I use regularly on most days of the week but the truck I have to use one per week to call a trailer her car she owes about eleven thousand on and it ... percent interest\nWe could probably get by just sharing my two vehicles [noise]\nUm but we've just been since the Carl on his ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of some of the dead or should we or should we keep it because it's ...\n... ... percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay off the eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off water all three of these cars worth\n[noise] um the truck is probably worth about Fifteen my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell it for about ten\nOkay 'cause one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value\nOK okay not violating that though show or good or the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand good and how much debt other than the eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\nOr we have about Ninety thousand okay\nThat that that includes the car the car and what is the Ninety thousand on\n[noise] mostly student loans or we have some tax stuff a medical bills\nSo can you pay off forty five year making one forty and be debt free in two years my answer would be yes\nYeah and um that would mean that if you want to keep her car there's nothing out of line with keeping it but just by at all I mean we're not going to keep the dad a regardless of the interest rate we're just going to get rid of it but you know so but if you told me you owe thirty thousand dollars on her car and I would sell in a heartbeat\nOkay because I wouldn't we were they wouldn't it wouldn't fit neither one of these equations\nI mean you wouldn't be dead already in two years probably and on top of that uh uh of of course you'd have too much tied up in vehicles and so that would change my equation that's how I use it just a decision making paradigm that's all it is gives you a critical thinking\nI'm I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby stuff for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars cash [laughter] um I Know that other than my house\nUm which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I call it Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have no equity in it I mean I have about fourteen\nAs a gift for my one year old college fund um so I'm going to be putting that into a check five twenty nine I think for him and kind of picking out some stock mutual fund to kinda see where it goes from there\nOkay um so my question is what are kind of my\nWhat do I do with this kind of piled cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses for for um you know every any given month is about twenty seven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so pretty much the only income right now [laughter]\nUm so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then I Want to know what to do with the rats shake shack throw it towards my how we all know that every year or should I put it someplace else\nWe teach Taylor is a process we can all the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial bland and as you lay the foundation then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first went through second and so forth\nSo I'm baby steps one as spouses dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nUm that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so uh twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate\nAs adjusted emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now uh what do you make\n[noise] um so I'm about Seventy eight year\nThere's the household income yeah okay All right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a pension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played and uh the card as well\nI'll tell you that mandatory\nOkay alright I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four O. one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have just opened up a rock or re ... with a better man which is one of the the hundred\nFor me I'm familiar with what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo are coming there they're they're doing pretty good but none of them are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in a row boats at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time in her life so that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would just go to smart bastard die Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the investment business so I don't care what you do okay I don't think my income at all\nBut people have always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each uh-huh unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there are fifty five hundred is eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded a Roth IRA is and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds\nI spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stock mutual funds and it's also what I recommend\nAnd I put forth in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international\nNow once you're doing that and you know the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got eight and mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine\nOkay and just watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and so you you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that that's maybe step three is ... by babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different the ... you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it and once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget or at any extra money\nHouse 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's maybe step six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr what you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I find that my budget I'm going to keep jumping around that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nBy Dave I'm great how are you doing sir better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have ah currently two hundred and twenty three thousand ain't got a hundred and Ninety three thousand is pretty normal it's currently with the U.S department of treasury um it as a result of having been additional service academy or three years ago\nAnd the remaining thirty case like a pretty normal that I'm obviously much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact it will eventually end up any collections account\nIf I'm not able to pay the amount for um\nYou know um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred ... a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year also\nWhile or you learn you guys are on the Internet um side and so what I'm going to just put this tonight for in the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can give you got wonderful income you'll be different\nTo years it's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start someone twenty thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou're not getting a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nIs er so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either ask that serve through in the service or you're assigned to the\nRecruitment and\nUm and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not it it it goes over to the U.S\nTreasury so you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get ... for a period of time and has forgiven\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge and have to pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with the show I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nA common theme around here
