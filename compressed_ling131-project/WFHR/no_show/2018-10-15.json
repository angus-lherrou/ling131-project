constant battle every night tech said Michael was a high ... high wire act you'd never knew which way that issue is gonna fall between the\nThe great individual and the team\nBut um you know tech said Michael played those three years at you and see and that made the difference he really had enough of a\nBecause at you in the system was so tough enough team background where you can really make sacrifices you had to make\nKnow what a lot of people don't know and I learned that in your book my games will during that year off when filled up in Chicago bowl that year he had off before there and before he came to the Lakers as the head going\nThank you for having me for a second day oh\nWell that book the show from two thousand for about the Lakers in their history that is the Bible for not only Lakers fan of the ... fans but I learned I I've been a Lakers fan my whole life living here in LA and I learned things from that book but I never knew before particularly one fascinating thing I think that gets lost in history\nJerry ... canyon was officially hired as the Lakers coach I think it was before maybe metrics rookie year but before all of them before they hired\nContracts are done and it was a done deal and they were getting ready to meet with Dr bus I I Believe in the foreign ... what Jerry representative and get everything side in his agent never showed and then it wound up being in maybe in a Lynch mob hidden just fascinating stuff to explain the whole thing here\n[laughter] well you know it was actually the second time the cherry Tarkanian was going to be coach of the Lakers the first time was Seventy six before they hire Jerry West Antarctica backed out all the\nPeople un Elvie got upset all the big contributors and the powers that be and so he decided not to coach the Lakers and then by in Nineteen Seventy nine things had changed and he was ready to move in ...\nWas a sort of um an interesting complicated figure he was a lifelong friend Jerry Tarkanian he was his agent\nHe was a automobile dealer he owned part of the Rolls Royce dealership and LA and uh\nHe uh he he he would take a bunch a underprivileged kids to ball games and he was also doing business with the underworld and\nQuite a figure and he was a show a guy lots of jewelry and driving around a Rolls Royce usually cared about thirty seven granting cash in his pocket\nHe was quite a figure and he met with jak can't cook and Jerry Buss Jerry was in the process of buying the team he met with them at a Beverly Hills hotel and at that meeting they agreed for park to become\nCoach of the Lakers and they scratched out there all the ideas of the deal and it was a work up and they were in agreement and he left the agent left ... left in his red and white Rolls Royce and an hour later\nIt shows his body was um [noise] uh\nOr his car was parked\nIn the parking garage and the universal city Sheraton [noise] and they all of LA was looking for him 'cause this this high profile figure disappeared in LA had a record heat wave a hundred and five degrees or\nYou know the the there was a big pressure system that it was like it broke a hundred year heat wave and the body it was a mob had his hands were tied behind his back he was killed within an hour of leaving that meeting and they didn't take his cash any of that stuff\nBut he was a he was murdered they didn't find him the the smell from the ... is what alerted a you know one of the people from the hotel that was the ms\nAnd nobody was never arrested or they didn't have any clues from the scene or about the murder [noise]\nAh no no one was ever arrested three suspects uh three that people who were police suspected of doing the killing one was a large blonde man\nBut that three of them were killed later for very different things one of them was killed in a famous wonderland murders oh yeah\nAnd uh and they died under different circumstances and I'm Vicky ... says business partner left el ... went a Malley as they can just to get away from it all I think he ended up that it was really weird thing\nUm and and know it was never solved for mob is it had all the parents is of a mob hit [noise] you know it's funny I've just gotten\nSome new information on that release yes and I'm looking into it for another project I'm doing and uh it it's funny some ah some new information has a resurfaced\nIt's funny I was going to ask you a ... have you ever thought about releasing the show maybe since that was in two thousand more updated version over the last word teen years and now now you've got some great new information\nWell I've thought about it um [noise]\nAh you know I I that koby book was a very that was of almost six hundred page book that was very hard my book Michael Jordan the lives that came out on twenty fourteen these big biographies a\nReally tough to do the Jordan book um thank goodness just cells and cells and you know it's a comprehensive look at is life and family but\nAh at the same with the Jerry West not that one cells and cells but ah these big biographies takes so much work I'll be honest with you Dave I'm exist\nRight the books in my I'm burned out and exhausted [noise]\nRoller blade can be doing a date with your embassies we're going to be towards voted outcome so if if they didn't get whacked Jerry turkey needs to go to the Lakers and who knows how that would have Changed History and how long he would've coach the team and uh what what why shouldn't\nHave question because it was you know show time yeah Easter was of coaching Jerry Buss wanted Showtime\nAnd I think certainly that fit magic skills as history shows so it would have been interesting I really would I Will say it's always tough for usually has been tough [noise]\nFor college coaches to make the transition to the NBA\nAnd I know the Lakers from some tough times trying out here and there [noise]\nAnd ah so you know it wasn't a slam dunk but I think your certainly would've been interesting um but but Jared Tarkanian was so rattled by the grisly murder of his lifelong friends that there was no way he could do any of that\nA great stuff all the good talking to you again we're out of time hopefully we can do this again who's been too long to man up right there you go to the great roles and may be author of a well Michael Jordan and Jerry West and Kobe Bryant and and and mind games in the shoulder 'cause I can go on and on about all the great books that he's written and yeah the wife's\nJerry ... aides and they in a contract agreed to right before Jerry Buss bought the Lakers and he's whacked by the mafia well by the mob allegedly a mob yet according roller blades and be and boy how how would that have Changed History of hurricane\nAnd actually find that contract as easily live\nSo time Lakers I Would have been fun to watch\nAnd then one of jak McKinney haven't fallen off his bicycle in Nineteen eighty ... open\nStay with him and he's worked with him

I was his biggest fan coming out of the University of Kansas I thought Andrew weakens what's going to be a superstar right that by this point in his career he'd be top five in the NBA elite player on his way to the hall of fame\nBecause you want to talk about natural ability a natural gifts\nDon't hold on sit down when I say this but this is true Andrew Wiggins has Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant ability he's six foot eight he consults out of the gym he's got that was fast\nBring me he was a great defender coming out of college I mean he ... he has a soft shooting touch this guy is on believable athletic he's Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant athletically he's every bit as gifted as they are\nBut there is one problem what area that it's not as gifted and the one area that he is sorely lacking is heart Dr Wilbur when playing hard and and having that mentality that that's what separated guys like Jordan and Kobe Bryant and the other great players\nThat owned believable competitiveness and that desire to win and that her ... year stuff Jordan and Kobe's heart into Andrew weakens you'd probably have the same type of player that's out off the charts gifted he is so to me butler is correct Andrew\nReagan's is soft he's too nice out there he doesn't want to be great he doesn't want it bad enough a lot of times I watched it looks like he's coasting Carl Anthony towns of soft\nHe he's tremendously talented he can knock down freeze he's unbelievably skilled for a seven for her\nBut he settled for junk science he settles for threes or he doesn't fight hard enough on the boards did that simply he's not great he's soft way against a soft Jimmy ... is correct when he says that\nAnd this is why I think ... desperately wants to keep him on the roster\nAnd I tell you what if you would think there will be the guy to do it but Andrew Wiggins and currently up any towns desperately need about a science Fifteen shoot right up the ass\nOr this way and maybe Jimmy ... there's the guy to do it as he did in practice last week somebody's got to do it and Kevin Garnett it just hits coast today they asked him about the better sort of timber rules and he said what you mean that that's showed that belief show up there in Minnesota\nSaid it's a mess\nAnd then he said he said Jimmy Butler um doesn't have the juice\nTo go around threatening and talking the way he does because he's not LeBron and he's not Kevin Duran he's not near that level and you hear him talking and demanding trades and cursing people that practice he's not quite good enough to get away with that much gone out also said was agreeing with ... those are those are the guys with soft or they don't want to be great as bad as he as he does\nSo I'm hoping I liked the symbol seem I like to make about but I like watching them last year when when when when\nButler was healthy that I it looks like it can't happen but I'm hoping they find a way to work it out\nAnd that butler stays in these days long term although being a phrase ... at the end of the year I Would doubt now the question is do they continue to try and trade him to the Miami Heat so get involved a new teams maybe back off now after they saw what happened to practice and say well\nJust wait until the summer and get a free agent although the danger in that case of somebody else praised for him\nYou never know maybe he falls in love with the place maybe or a ... situation type situation happens we're George kind of fell in love with Russell Westbrook in Oklahoma City and said hey I think I'll stay because the Lakers thought they were going to sign Paul Georgia's a free agent over the summer now as it turns out\nAnd this is what a lot of people don't know\nAs it turns out though when ... had his problems from San Antonio and he demanded a trade from the San Antonio spurs the Lakers lost interest involved or at least they lost interest in IMAX contract which is why do you want it\nThey kind of turn the focus away from him and they were a laser focus on koala letter because and obviously so because lenders have better player than Baltimore's\nSo the Lakers focused on lettered and they tried to make a deal for them and they couldn't make it happen then he gets traded to Toronto so the Lakers are we making another hard push for a co-op let her over the summer and Jimmy ... there are these little and clay tops another Golden State warriors although I don't think we're going anywhere but those are going to be the three targets and to mark his cousins\nWho will not be a Golden State warriors next year\n\nBecause you know he signed a one year deal for the veterans minimum and he was all he wants to do is prove that is to kill me just helping any plays well this year then it'll be looking for a Mac seal somewhere and it won't be in Golden State so that'll be another guy in the Lakers radar and some other teams\n\nBut I I'm I'm going to defend semi butler here or ... maybe his behavior wasn't as professional as it could be but when he says Carl Anthony talents and Andrew where they can sort of soft or I I agree with them they are in states where the NBC Sports weight on NBC Sports writer

therefore beat the Kansas City chiefs forty three to forty\nThe fourth quarter alone yes the fourth quarter alone featured thirty points scored\nThis game was a shootout in every sense of the work but it didn't start out that way you know the patriots started out in the first half and this really was a child you have sort of Kansas City chiefs protests and the first half\nThe patriots did a great job of confusing Patrick months\nIn the first half the patriots were effective offensively showed him a show was running the ball and they were dominating they were they were out physically\nThe Kansas City chiefs and the ... that that we all hurt and talked about going into this game was that teams with quarterbacks twenty five years were younger we're owing twenty three teams Fox borrow since two thousand and one so under build ...\n... ... and twenty three\nOpposing teams were in Fox borough with a young quarterback under twenty five years old Kansas City chiefs fit that mold right with Patrick mumps\nAnd in the first half you kind of saw why\nThe ... still a lot defensively\nTo confused patched months the dumped Hightower interception was the perfect example of it because he had faced it like he was coming in on a blitz\nAnd then dropped back in the zone coverage I thought that was just a phenomenal disguise of a defensive scheme by the patriots and by high tower\nIn my home and never saw him\nAnd so then they convert that short field into a touchdown all of a sudden the patch or up to three and then after holding them to a field goal the patch thing go up Seventeen to six\nEventually going to the house after another interception of Patrick homes which was a really bad interception because knowing the situation there you're down twenty four to nine\nIt's the final position of the half you have to speak with points a touchdown would be ideal but a field goal was your worst case scenario well the worst case scenario worse than that was turning the football

war reaches up\n... women seven to\nThat was the color Red Sox radio networks got started work here with you it's an old time NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio at a cow what a big night for Boston sports\nYou had the patriots victory over the Kansas City chiefs and the red Sox defeating the Astros as they even up the American league championship series at a game of peace and David Price has not won a poll season game and still didn't it after his outing here on\nBut it's but it's but\nHis team did win the game and that's a big that's a big step forward right because they see a you know every time he goes out there he loses the game I think it's over Lebanon now but for the first time his team wins the game he came like an out\nShy of getting a victory though 'cause they only lasted four and two thirds innings gave up for wrongs but his often dealt amount Jackie Bradley junior with a big time three run double off the monster in the third inning\nWhich gave the Sox a five for lead that they held onto until the seventh\nInning way and [noise] it got to kind of feel for the guy but more teen mom the NATO had a Gary Sanchez\nEnding [laughter] those of you know what I'm Talking about are probably laughing right now but this was as bad of an ending for a catcher as you can have them all the NATO is he's an all star he's a guy throws out a ton of base runners but in miss seventh inning\nHe did not look\nGood it ... it was quicksand\nMickey bets walks to lead off the inning\nAnd then without any other batter putting the ball and play ... around the bases and scored a pivotal insurance run for the red Sox\nWon wild pitch to past balls he got the second in the wild pitch to third on the past ball he scored another ... that was such a huge\nHuge drawn because then they go up six five\nAnd then our series six four and then batch drives in Iran in the eighth to making seven for Craig Kimball makes it interesting like he always does and the ninth socks hold on to win seven five and all of a sudden we got a series\nThese are the two best teams in baseball\nThis was going to be competitive you knew you were going to get close games I was just rooting for a good series and that doesn't mean it it goes seven you know you have a series that that doesn't go seven that still is a great series\nRight now I'm not sure what type of series this is going to be this was a good game to flip back and forth and watch as you're trying to watch some football I don't know if you're in Boston has handle is like ... how did you handle watching both you had to have two TVs right\nAnd I'm sure like was it depending on which bar or restaurant you wouldn't do that determine what the volume was on I mean I get there it's a playoff game right but football football this is Patriot's chiefs on Sunday Night Football\nI Would say that you had the baseball and start the game started before the patriots then you're just stuck with the baseball so it was over and then you had plenty of time to have the volume solely on the the the patriots game I was flipping back and forth\nAnd\nThis had the makings of a classic game\nI like what the Sox did out of the bullpen again every decision that our quarter makes just seems to work out for him and it included bringing in Rick pour cello once again\nIn a relief spot what she did in the division series against the Yankees and it worked out as poor soul strikes out too and gets through the eighth inning\n[laughter]\nYou know the biggest concern for the socks and I said this before the before the post season began except I thought it was going to be Nathan you've all the is the guy to the bullpen\nBut if you recall what I said was the biggest concern for the red Sox going into the post season was the bridge the chemical which is not a a a surprise I think everybody knew about that but my comment was that the red Sox\nHad the guys to get through those innings and those guys were starters\nAnd I felt that Nathan you'll fall day was going to be the starter that our quarter would go to out of a bull pen to get them through the eighth inning\nBut it turns out it's written for so poor soul does it against the Yankees now does it again here against the Astros and you have all the after the performance against the Yankees the seven innings he's now going to start game three against Dallas ... in Houston\nSo price to Barnes to ... to pour cello to kimbrell that seems to be a formula that's working for hours Cora now next game it could be you have all the to Barnes\nKimble\nAny any ... you don't have to bringing anybody else in an ideal world you have all the does what he did against the Yankees just seven innings but who knows\nWho knows how the game will play out only ... the game flow will dictate who quarter uses out of the bullpen but this was a fun game to watch and the red Sox did the victory and now the series heads to Houston\nTied at a game apiece Alex court on the bullpen\nOutstanding job ... from the postseason we drove those guys are sort of massive so we live with them and you're going to try to go to those match up some\nMonitoring tomorrow when they made some good pictures Frasier was able to use his fastball up or cello and then again those very impressive\nDavid Price we've got to start says the team won despite him\nIt wasn't on the line I Dreamed up to half the night but um we are are off ants or defense you know everybody rally together that's what his ... year no one ever starters needs to be picked up you know they picked us up and vice versa sells big\nGarrett Cole got start for the Astros a you know he was ... call for a little bit it was the big three rung double though\nAnd in the first half you kind of saw why\nThe ... defensively\nTo confuse Patrick mumps\nThe dung pad high tower interception was the perfect example of it because he had faced it like he was coming in on a blitz and then drop back in the zone coverage I thought that was just a phenomenal disguise of a defensive scheme by the patriots end by high tower\nAnd my home was never saw him\nAnd so then they convert that short field into a touchdown all of a sudden the bats are up ten three and then after holding them to a field goal the patch thing go up Seventeen to six\nEventually go into the house after another interception of Patrick homes which was a really bad interception because no one in the situation there you're down twenty four to nine\nIt's the final position of the half you have to speak with points a touchdown would be ideal but I feel those your worst case scenario well the worst case scenario worse than that was turning the football over which is what ... did there he throws an interception pass go into the locker room up twenty four to nine\n\nPatrick Rome's did not look good in the first half everything went right for the patriots offensively defensively\nAnd it was just going to be a matter of time before they pulled away and the final score dictated it right well with the first possession of the second half Patrick Boyle homes with a classic Patrick moments like play\nDiluting the rush wrong she was right throwing down the field Karim ... sixty seven yard touchdown reception\nNow all of a sudden okay she ... back in this game\nTwo teams go back and forth trading field goals Tom Brady fumbled bad fumble he's got to get rid of the football there and you would expect him to get rid of the football there you know that he he feels the raw she gets rid of the football surreal voids hits but that time and just held onto it a little too long\nBrady fumbled there it leads to a chief possession touchdown\nAnd Kansas City deciding to go for the extra point instead of a to point conversion which is a decision that I Love the\nI Can't even tell you how much I Love to that decision\nLudlum and the ... of\n... and that decision you see people criticize me all the time because I tell people you can net chain you cannot chase points and people will come back at me and say oh you just can't do math or you don't understand football situations\nIt was the end of the third quarter\nYou never go for two unless you have to go for two\nBecause assuming everything pleased that the way it does which you can never assume much just get out of the way you can never assume that things play out the way that they do but had they missed that to point conversion but wouldn't have even come down to it\nOr they probably would have had to go for another two again down the road what if they missed that one\nAt that point in the third quarter knowing how high powered ... offenses you are at the very worst if the patriots have to really really long time consuming drives at the very worst you're getting the football back twice\nThe patriots are going to hold the ball for Fifteen minutes right\nSo at the very worst you're thinking there's going to be at least two more possessions for your office maybe even three maybe four you don't know at that point you still have a whole quarter a football left to play and so\nYou kick the extra point you go down twenty seven twenty six you hold the patriots dual field goal now thirty twenty six and then just like you felt your office could do\nScore a fence because she got a fantastic kickoff return quick score off after the Ninety seven you're kickoff return now you're up thirty three thirty\nPatriot's day march right back down the field and they scored a touchdown now thirty seven thirty three cheap them punt patriots ad a field goal and [noise] it's forty to thirty three at this point with three minutes in Fifteen seconds left\nThe chiefs start on their own twenty five and one play\nSeventy five yards ... killed two bath house gain tied at forty\nPaths get the ball back and they hold on for the final possession the final play of the game Steven ...\nWith the game winning ... this was a classic game and maybe not all time classic but certainly the most entertaining game of this season so far\nIf you are a purist if you're an old school NFL than you didn't like this game because the defenses cannot stop anybody and yet there were a couple of defensive stops there were the two interceptions by the patriots off my homes there was a fumble by Brady\nAnd there was an opportunity to that that the bats held enforce the chiefs to punt there\nBut this game was further proof that the NFL and I tweeted this out at Scott's on air is turning into the big twelve\nThere have been more touchdowns and I don't know what the status after weeks six but it's probably probably the same thing but after a week five the stat was more touchdowns\nMore points scored through the first five weeks of this NFL season than any evening NFL history and I'm sure after a week in which we saw in eighty three point game\nWe saw the eagles put thirty four falcons over the box thirty four twenty nine charges put thirty eight\nJets beat the colds forty two thirty four\nYeah the cowboys putting up forty\nI'm sure that trend continued because in the NFL now the rules are made to benefit the fences\nThey understand that fantasy football is a huge part of their ratings and fantasy players need points\nThe NFL's making rules to increase the scoring because it's a fun game when you're watching two teams score and it's not a fun game when you're watching the

years against the five in Kansas City chiefs with Patrick mobile homes a quarterback who's lighten up the NFL\nAnd after a game last week reading through a touchdown pass and they didn't rolling in the first after that he's playing great again and the second half and telling you this more homes kid is for real but the patriots are down there at the chiefs three yard line is going to be Thirteen goal right now down by three was six minutes to go in the game\nInteresting to see what the patriots will do here if they don't get it on their own and completely you know me one hundred percent of the time I'm going for it I'm not settling for any feel goes M. pumps energy and it's for down territory for me\nBut bell executives if they don't score here and there were probably kick the field

downs you can run that clock all the way down\nDon't touch my goodness and you can run that clock all the way down\nAnd maybe kicked the game winning feel go forty one year old Tom Brady\nJust broke two tackles do the head first into the end zone for a touchdown from the three yard line and got spun through their kind of like the old helicopter move by John Elway on the super bowl but there's a

what a great win for terrorists Crawford last night although he was pushed a little bit by a good young fighter and Jose ... junior talking boxing talkers on football some MBA talking everything with a great Steve Ken what's up say\nGood afternoon by the way that number fifty seven for the chains I wouldn't let him back on the plane [laughter]\nYou you can [laughter] you cannot let ready look like Michael Vick on a [laughter] a deeper holding a penalty for me I'm not even matter what\nCan you imagine the film room when it's a slow white forty one year old guy breaks you're tackling leaks into the end zone and scores that's going to be held for him\nStatutes that are more mobile there were any right now but [noise]\nHave you on that she's right now you got to squeeze the clock I think during perfect position and get one possession the patriots have not stopped you much in the second half if they get the ball path that say the forty their own forte at that point then I I play dates Mitt football I don't kick the ball and re circumstance at that\nPoint you want to control possessions you want to score the game winning touchdown with not enough time for Brady to do anything absolutely I agree with you a hundred percent I Will you wanted to\nYou know good clock management Steven you know this you gotta use those time ounces a weapon you don't use time outs when you're up against the clock or out of desperation you use them to create it for positions for yourself and to take possessions away from the opponent\nAnd nobody does that better that ballot ... Alexei on any rain event some issue boy in this regard during is really good coaching career\nWell I Would break into the into the sound waves if I were the ring when patriots and get into Andy Reid headsets and tell them it's a playoff game here [laughter] maybe maybe that would have Steve Dennis Crawford last night up poster Jose innovators junior I'd never seen them fight before pretty good young fighter twenty seven or no\nPushed him a little bit landed some good science pretty I thought it was an even fight pretty much after six rounds before parents kinda figured a mountain wore them down and hit him with a great shot and stopped him and it was a good fight\nThe first half the length and the height the benefit is certainly caught some issues and you know this is not what I call a great big well through it I mean it's first title was one I Believe a one party went\nUp to thirty five forty and now he's going to settle in at Walter Reed where he doesn't have any problems making the one hundred forty seven pounds limit mutt again clashed showed and as the round went on you saw what happened that the separation of powers skill\nAnd productivity really began to show for terrorists property was able to basically beat up on the game better vetoes who I I agree with your name on a couple of early rounds now the question is Dave I'm based on the division within the sport who is Crawford faith\nNext well I Know who we should say send this would be the ultimate fight for the real boxing fan for the boxing purists but the fight people it would be Aerosmith of course the bus or the politics of boxing being what they are how realistic is that\nI don't think it's realistic right now especially if you listen to some of the rhetoric coming from the other side or a guy like ALS fences flat out telling cares Crawford that you're on the wrong side of the street well here's the issue\nIf you make the big enough there is no wrong side of the street you come to a common ground you hopefully turn it into a big pay per view of and what do you make more money than ever and you give the fight that the fans want look right now there's two or three fights\nThat are being held down by politics Joshua Wilder and then you have the fight that we are talking about between the will to wait and then lo and check on my key Garcia and unfortunately every single one of these fights\nIs bogged down by boxing politics and alliances\nWell what are the politics or you know explain to the audience here in ... when you said when ... says he's on the wrong side of history what does that mean and how does that stop the play\nBall on the ... a female boxing champions ... which basically means you're promoted and advised by al ...\nWho has an output deal or not a deal but he is an alliance was Showtime and now Fox starting in December so they want to keep 'em on those those private platforms under the other fighters under the ... the\nTop rank has uh the promotional rights to tears Crawford and they want and they have a deal with ESPN so it's basically different channels same problems\nNow if that ever were to happen I Know after a crop or had been sensational knock out on the phone from last night I don't know do tests of touring the announced they were all screaming and there's no question now tourist Crawford is the greatest fighter in the world nobody can you know of course they're going to say that 'cause\nHe's one of their ... but I like to mention that I can I just think he's a bigger Welter wage and the pressure he would put on him I think expense would wear 'em down\nAnd you know look I think Crawford among the very very elite is the number one I'm not sure I mean do you put them over Lohmann shank go or the Japanese monster to know you knew it certainly has to be given some credence because he's an impressive looking fighter I think\nThat he's in that elite class but you're right if you look at Errol fantasize and the fact that in many other arrows a boxing but when you had to weigh in the\nMorning of the fight he might be a fix the pounder look I think Crawford early on\nWind rounds and build the lead the question is could Crawford withstand the pressure and the strength of Errol spans who really is a two fisted punter and very physically strong\nNow Steve back to the game here now here's the strategy comes in Kansas City has a poor and seven on their own thirty with four minutes to go I'm not putting here down thirty seven thirty to I'm not given Brady the ball back who is the master throwing underneath and converting first announcements he's only up to time outs that\nWow but did they store did they score too quickly three now Tom Brady got three minutes left in the ... only at one time I get into people go right to get one with three seconds that maybe the the score too quickly back out to the guest outlined from UC I'm Alive dot com ... through the Japanese network the great deep given joined us knew what Steve this is this law believable that game\nOf the best regular season games I see but you don't like that you take it all but on the flip side if you have a chief you know you in fourth stop your memory is still out one time out there still a lot of the two and a warning you know all the other\nCat and mouse with the game clock so this fascinating stuff here\nOr the patriots won a reverse settlement on the first plane it'll be about a second in three yeah they can do this thing down all the way down to about three seconds if they get into a Kansas City territory maybe football team Rick you'll sort of slid on the twenty yard line there Steven giving himself up before his gourd\nHe made me no no my band the thing they view the patriots you up to ... a little bit because when you're a tyrant killing that opposite sides\nAnd the arm of more homes I literally don't know if there's any limit to what you can do all festival in just two or three plays with Kansas City\nBalancing the last play the game is going to be with three seconds left when they kick a field goal to win it as the patriots so I don't think you\nWrote a new one coming up to the tune that warning this huge point their hair [laughter]\nWow Steve came from others leader champions that we're ... we're down to the two minute warning disputed champions at UC alive dot com All right I'm going to be a third fight between triple around but they don't get those assigned to find somebody else here in the meantime I mean that's really going to get to a number three\nI think it's a possibility I spoke to Tom lawful couple of days ago and he said to me\nIs that they're going to fight before they're not going to just wait around for that third fight for canal oh now as you mentioned canal of fights December fifteenth at the Madison Square garden\nAnd the rumor that by going to be on that new platform the zone 'em when he fights rocky fielding as for what happens after that I'm not sure but I think that's a reality that\nWe can go off can fight can you name it another fight on pay per view that does the type a number of that just like I'm not so sure one exist\nNot like we I Want I might be able to find out they're expensive cropper but that wouldn't do anywhere near the numbers that one would do\nBecause at this moment neither guy can be considered a bright star and even Joshua while there I mean I I'm very curious to see how the the article Wilder Tyson theory fight those on December first\nFrom the staples center in Los Angeles so uh where the time being they're not going to have the rematch I Believe they'll go their separate ways but based on the financial success and the artistic value of the first to fight\nA third fight is always a possibility\nAnd almost nobody in America knows who Tyson Syria's unless you're a big time boxing fan and a lot of people don't know who the onto wild there is even though he's an American heavyweight champion so why is that by the state will see why isn't that the ... in London where they could sell out maybe a hundred thousand seats at Wimbledon\nWell I think the weather is a factor that's what I've been told has come to a certain point in time or outdoor fights in the u._k. simply aren't realistic second of all I my understanding is\nThe Barclay fatter is book I think ah the former first lady uh Michelle Obama's having a book signing so that makes it available\nAnd I heard that ... most of the venues in Las Vegas or specifically the T Mobile were bought and the Mandalay Bay which we've been to before they that only has twelve thousand capacity so they wanted something larger\nAnd let's face it LA is a big media market but in Kansas thing the opinion of a lot of the u._k. and British boxing fan they'd much rather go to Las Vegas in LA\nUh what what what what what about the ... what's out there for him never talked maybe he ... ground for one forty for a super fly but I don't know what's out there for him now that they could attract pay per view that would get people's attention\nI I Would say a fight with my Garcia\nI mean they both are lightweight champions and I believe that he will be ... woman shouldn't go and so they both have to buy health\nSo when you have two guys uh to both and they can fight for it on my key as a lightweight he is not going to be fighting else that's next December eighth Roman ... will be fighting Jose put there I was at the garden on ESPN that's a fight that I Believe that the public that's the one the urine for\nTell us about this rocky fielding God was fighting next how good is the Indians he does he have any chance to win\nAnd that's why they chose a modern day Donny la la la la\nWhen when you choose a guy named ... well known champions\nUm fit move up and wait the pink cherry pick about they usually faith a guy that's not the best that that division this is not an ... this is not a callous man\nThis is not a you know a good word to remarry forgot it as a secondary belt was knocked out by ... Smith and won and as I like to say there's a reason why they chose them\nSteve I'm used to live but do you see on the line on just be the samples that were doing it they went through the NBC Sports sports waited knock on well the patriots are down to the Jews forty seven minute and two seconds left the clocks running that seems only have one time out left it's looking like the patriots last player will be a feel good with this down away\nAnd then I think they are now in field goal range as I don't know if we're behind me or\nI Am Gronkowski devolve down there it is so I think now if you're the chance he would hope that joke is our check\nWell now now if you're the patriots you take an e you take two nice right\nIn front of the world I mean what you do you got time out\nAnd you're right I wouldn't even hand off your I think that's another thing that I I don't understand Mario quip of all I like yeah I Know a couple of weeks ago you're not even trying to get your point in time we're just keep adding a bar but I think to myself if you're not trying to advance the ball but waste time why not just plug into the line with the\nState of Oregon takes two to use their against than when they're in they're in the top five when they're in the final four on right now absolutely oh wow well let's see so somebody called the time I was at the patriots there Steve for seven seconds\nIt was a boy they're they're taking a safety okay well now are you now you're center taken ... go down to three seconds kick the people go when when the game yeah I guess if uh you know what can you do there Steve when when [laughter]\nWhen time Rick you'll get the ball and he's behind every but you can't tell them not to score there you're leaving on time\nWhat's going to Kansas City and only in this game I thought my home's missed a couple of touchdown passes the red zone efficiency was not very good day when you're on the road against the great quarterback and coach like Brady and ballot check field goal eventually get beat absolutely seven every single time\nAnd what three times in the red zone or three feel goals right in the first half of the ... that'll do you mean ... really bad intercepts them down to his own goal when the patriots turned into a touchdown I I go to the pro here signal that that that's what the lab Kansas City for the other side it was that the wind tonight\nI don't want the line all but they you know even in the feet mold impressed me he did a fresh and check the widow young quarterback then I got\nFrom the second half auto I thought I thought my own little great I think the great stuff as always sought by the coast wow\nTimeout patriots so we're going to break you know they're going to be lining up with a game winning we'll go with three

he's been doing this for ten years and that he never has a sore arm and he's better than ever here at forty one\n\nAnd ... like I said an easy to call Alex ... Charlotte's in but I mentioned this last week there was a writer for men's journal [noise] uh and he wrote an article a couple of years ago that I shared last week\nWhere he he's a mountain climber and he had a fall and he broke his right he'll and that's a ... I've known people who have broken their heels with some of them but never been the same that is a nasty nasty injury so this guy and\nAgain he's a writer for men's journal he is a a you know health enthusiast he he's a mountain climber and said outdoorsman\nAnd the doctor told him to not put any weight on the hill and just stay completely off the heel pretty much bed rest for three months before he started doing any exercising or any rehab and the doctor also told him it would probably never be the same don't expect to live anywhere near the lifestyle that you used to live with this kind of injury\nSo living in the Boston, Massachusetts area this guy came up with an idea he was reading about the TV twelve clinic and reading about Tom Brady\nSo he decides that he's going to go to Alex Guerrero as a skeptic no he he he didn't believe any of this nonsense with Guerrero and I and I'm sure he thought he was a fraud on the starlet and just like everybody else\nBut he had he came up with a great idea I'm going to go cigarette or I'm going to go to the B. twelve and I'm going to see what the results on I'm going to publish them and maybe I can expose this guy so he went in there was a complete skeptic so he goes in there and he's got a mangled\nRight foot it'll purple and it just nasty I've seen the pictures with a broken ... is a tough tough injury to come back and again the doctor told him\nNo exercise and don't put any weight on the field for three months has to be total total rest until the ... so he goes to see ... TB twelve and ... that's absolute nonsense poppy Koch we got to get you exercising right now\nWe're going to put weight on it and then he put him on um\nUh me uh uh on uh it's it's kind of a stair master thing but it's more in the air will only put ten percent of your weight on your foot instead of Ninety percent\nSo many and then he explained to him we've got to change your diet completely around who's going to happen to drink a you know a gallon of water per day he's going to change their side around to completely anti inflammatory diet change this diet around made him drink enormous amounts of water high vitamin C. Hi vitamin D but the whole thing\nAnd then on the first day he had to put a little weight on and he said he had heard of it hurt like hell but then gradually you know after about a week or two he started feeling better he was exercising on it he was starting to walk on it again\nAnd I'll be damned after after five weeks he went to the doctor and the doctor said I've been practicing for twenty five years and I've never seen anything like this this fast recovery from a heel injury in week\nTen and you can look this up go go Google minister colonel and uh you know TV twelve hours go round the guy who wrote the column about rehabbing from the heel injury you could look it up here\nIn ten weeks and again the doctor told him twelve weeks no wait on the foot no exercise total rest total rehab keep your foot Meir no wait on it for twelve weeks before we start any kind of rehabilitation process\nIn ten weeks the gentleman from ... was back climbing mountains again full speed stronger than ever\nLanding on his feet pain free that he wrote the column and said hey you know I was a skeptic I what can I say and the doctor said he was flabbergasted that anybody he'd never seen anybody recover so quickly from the heel injury now\nWhen I watch Tom Brady play now you see this good at forty one because of that was ... Alex girl has nothing to do with how great Tom Brady is was a quarterback\nBut the question is what Tom Brady still be playing here at forty one at this level without Alice ... I really don't think so\nBecause this is a totally different and it totally unique training method he doesn't he doesn't like weight training at least not heavy weights\nIt's stretching is deep tissue massages yoga it's ... it's more flexibility then reduce weight training and the interesting thing here is what I read this a men's journal article\nWas telling us got you've got to convince your brain to heal to make you feel better sort of got to send the signals and that's why he had a meditating he had him doing yoga he had him doing you know light weight on his heels less than a week after we broke it\nBut he said we can send the signals reconsidering the algorithms we can tell your brain to make you feel better and by God and you know that came through better circulation through a better diets through\nExercise it's just it's just amazing when you read this car was called that would that work for everybody I I don't know was that worked for every industry who knows\nBut I really think I think I was growing up beyond or something here\nAnd again when when you look at traditional American medicine a lot of it you know drug treatment you know and that's one of the big reasons why because we've got such a problem here with ... and ... and drugs like that and people getting addicted all over America sometimes I think doctors are too quick to prescribe to prescribe painkillers\nAnd he looked at the traditional eastern philosophy Chinese medicine is more ... more meditation more stretching more exercise which is what ... chocolate eggs so who knows but the bottom line is Tom radiate forty one years old it's incredible how 'bout that run today\nBut I tell you what number fifty seven with the Kansas City chiefs he had him dead bank in the backfield wrapped him from behind and maybe it's the new rules nowadays of course comments were made a very good point after that play he said these these guys are so scared now and so trained not to hurt the quarterback\nYou know maybe a couple of years ago either grabbed him from behind him pow pow drive them into the ground this time\nLooked like he tried to bring him down gently\nAnd Brady breaks the attack and then takes off like a bat outta hell it was I think we need to start calling them Hussein Brady right now who said both Brady dived head first in the end zone take the high low hit all our Brett Farr from the super bowl I mean excuse me away on the super bowl against the Packers and the late nineties\nJust magnificent at forty one years but what can you say\nAnd I'm a forty niners fan I'm a Joe Montana fan but God Bless him Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time stays with you an embassy sports radio [noise]\nAnd we see sports radio is coming [noise] coverage of high school sports either right here I Am twenty to twenty four\nStation [noise]\nHe started at the Y. project at home\nThen you realize convenience isn't always easy why in the eye why does it mean why is the SAT T E D I F why do it for you customize and install a secure smart home that you can go home with your hands with the sound of your smart secure as I did in stone young for you with a T.\nV.

West Virginia and he and his mother were looking at the camera and they just these eyes were burning both\nOf them and he he was very much or a function of his mother\nAnd I know you had a lotta dealings with text winter over the years right in mind games about the ... and writing books about the Lakers as well when he was assisting Phil Jackson died I think it was Ninety six this week so what what is your memories about tax and uh ... what are you friendly with him and stayed in touch over the years\nOh yes Texas um changed my life you know he became a dear friend but just the ultimate source for a journalist he could never do anything but tell you the truth [laughter] he was always available for me\nWhen I was coaching some AA you um I started coaches or some additional basketball so that I could learn his triangle and you know it's sort of a special thing to be able to pick up the phone and discuss things with the master\nAnd that was sort of a my relationship with tax it was wonderful\nHow do you think he'll be remembered or maybe the architect of those primal championships in Chicago and with the Lakers as well and I I doubt bill would've everyone's talking about often so we haven't met he'd be hadn't met tax and he wasn't an assistant with him\nYou know fill wouldn't have done that and yes he'll be remembered as the architect but he was also the master of basketball fundamentals Scotty Pippin and Michael Jordan or with the dream team they were on a bus coming back from an event\nAnd a Scottish looked over Michael and said can you imagine how good Clyde ... would\nBe if he played for tax\nBoy that's scary to think that's an interesting thought you know it's funny my favorite story um when I was covering the Lakers or Texas or you know he sat right next to fill in the bench and I looked over there you know I was in the second half\nAnd he was yelling and feel it looked like he was kicked off and uh and then after the game I walked up protecting the locker room and I said what was that you said to fill in the third quarter\nTypical next winter he said I told them it's time to get off your ass and do some coaching when I\nHear tax couldn't get really fiery yeah you know he could get angry of guys weren't playing a gay right way he took a ... his head off one night in Chicago and kept center woody Hayes moment when he was coaching and college\nHe got really upset at a player but he was loved roundly ed\nYou know he was the kind of guy who would take on Jordan about things and he was always fussing Jordan about his chest passes that drove Michael crazy Michael would get back at him by running up behind tax and practicing yanking down his shorts\nAnd their Texas bare butt hanging out of his jock straps but it was a um he\nHe he was a unique spirit of pure spirit and probably there are many many many people who have loved basketball was every ounce for their art\nBut for taxes somehow when even beyond that and it was fairly you know he'd jump right in front of a shock might be coming down on the floor and he was going to make a point or he's going to try and take a charge from shock\nYou know he terrified people watch 'em practice sometimes with the things they would do because up into his eighties he you know he was a work in medicine ball and the jump rope ... it was quite figure\nSo rolling roller blades and be the great author Tony days you'd NBC's ... dot com I remember I think I think this is in mind games one of your book so he used to always still Michael Jordan when you go into the room why don't you try to draw the foul and just lay it and you can get a three point play instead of trying to duck on everybody\nMichael just looked at it [laughter] and that\nYou know I'm Michael was the pit of me of the individual and tax was all about the belief in the tea\nAnd and yet\nTax had tremendous respect for Michael\nUm but there was always sort of a real tension and energy between them because there was a constant battle every night tech said Michael was a higher ... high wire act you'd never knew which way that issue is going to fall between the\nThe great individual and the team\nBut um you know tech said Michael played those three years that you and see and that made the difference he really had enough of a [noise] because at you in the system was so tough enough team background where he can really make sacrifices he had to make\nA lot of people don't know and I learned that in your book a mind games will during that year off when Phil ... he had off before there and before we came to the Lakers as the head coach\nKind of doing it for one more segment here the great roller blades and be the author of a almost too many great books to count and do role and thanks for joining us for another one here\nThank you for having me for a second day oh\nWell that book the show from two thousand for about the Lakers and their history that that is the Bible for not only Lakers fan of the ... fans but I learned I I've been a Lakers fan my whole life living here in LA and I learned things from that book but I never knew before particularly one fascinating thing I think that gets lost in history\nJerry arcadian was officially hired as the Lakers coach I think I was before maybe metrics rookie year but before all of them before they hire jak McKinney in contract for done and it was a done deal and they were getting ready to me to what Dr bus I I Believe in the form of what the Jerry and representative and get everything side\nAnd his aides and never showed and then it wound up being a maybe an alleged mobster hit and just fascinating stuff to explain the whole thing here\nWell you know it was actually the second time the cherry Tarkanian was going to be coach of the Lakers the first time was Seventy six before they hired Jerry West Antarctica backed out all the\nPeople un Elvie got upset at all the big contributors and the powers that be and so he decided not to coach the Lakers and then by in Nineteen Seventy nine things have changed and he was ready to move in Vick Weiss\nWho was a sort of um an interesting and complicated figure he was a lifelong friend Jerry hurricane and he was his agent\nHe was a automobile dealer he I'm part of the Rolls Royce dealership in LA and uh\nHe uh he he would take a bunch a underprivileged kids to ball games and he was also doing business with the underworld and\nQuite a figure and he was a showy guy lots of jewelry and driving around the Rolls Royce usually cared about thirty seven granting cash in his pocket\nHe was quite a figure and he met with Jack ... cook and Jerry Buss Jerry was in the process of buying the team he met with them uh\nSo tell and at that meeting they agreed for park to become\nCoach of the Lakers and they scratched out there all the ideas of the deal and it was a work up and they were in agreement and he left the agent left ... left in his red and white Rolls Royce and an hour later\nIt shows his body was um [noise]\nUm or his car was parked\nIn the parking garage\nAt the universal city Sheraton [noise] and they all of LA was looking for him 'cause this this high profile figure disappeared in LA had a record heat wave a hundred and five degrees or\nYou know the ... there was a big pressure system that it was like it broke a hundred year heat wave and the body it was a mob had his hands were tied behind his back he was killed within an hour of\nLeaving that meeting and they didn't take his cash any of that stuff\nBut he was a he was murdered they didn't find in the smell from the ... is what alerted a you know one of the people from the hotel that no Muslim is\nAnd nobody would never arrested or they didn't have any clues from the scene or about the murder\n[noise] ah no no one was ever arrested three suspects uh three of the people who were police suspected of doing the killing one was a large blonde man but three of them were\nKilled later for very different things one of them was killed in the famous wonderland murders oh yeah\nAnd uh and they died under different circumstances and\nI'm sick wife says business partner left el ... went a Malley asked they can just to get away from it all I think he ended up dead it was really weird thing\nUm and and know it was never solved for mob is it had all the parents is of a mob it\n[laughter] you know it's funny I've just gotten some new information on that release yes and I'm looking into it for another project I'm doing and uh it it's funny some ah some new information has a resurfaced\nIt's funny I was going to ask you uh have have you ever thought about releasing their show maybe since I was in two thousand more updated version over the last ... years and now now you've got some great new information\nWell I've thought about it um I you know I I that koby book cause a very that was almost six hundred page book that was very hard my book Michael Jordan the life that came out and twenty fourteen\nThese big biographies are\nAre really tough to do that Jordan book um thank goodness just cells and cells and you know it's a comprehensive look at his life and family\nBut ah at the same with the Jerry West not that that one cells and cells but ah these big biographies takes so much work I'll be honest with you Dave I'm exhausted\nAfter I don't smoke in my I'm burned out and exhausted\nWrong and they can be doing a date with you'd NBC Sports when it comes so if if the wife didn't get whacked Jerry turkey needs to go to the Lakers and who knows how that would have Changed History and how long he went to coach the team in one last\nQuestion because he was a Showtime yet he's there was a coach and Jerry\nBuss wanted Showtime and I think certainly that fit magic skills as history shows so it would have been interesting it really would I Will say it's always tough for usually has been tough for college coaches\nTo make the transition to the NBA and I know the Lakers had some some tough times trying that here and there and uh so\nYou know it wasn't a slam dunk but I think certainly would've been interesting um but but Gerry Tarkanian was so rattled by the grisly murder of his lifelong friend that there was no way he could do any of that\nGreat stuff all the good talking to you again we're out of time hopefully we can do this again who's been too long to man up right there you go to the ... role in the author of well Michael Jordan and Jerry West in Kobe Bryant and and and mind games in the shoulder as I can go on and on about all the great books that he's written and yeah the whites\nGenerally Tarkanian aids and being a contract agreed to right before Jerry Buss bought the Lakers and he's whacked by them off you will by the mob allegedly\nThe ... and boy how how would that change history of very hard candy and [noise] and that can be fun that contract his age and had lived [noise]\nCoaching magic in Korean park Showtime

I was his biggest fan coming out of the University of Kansas I thought Andrew weakens was going to be a superstar right that by this point in his career he'd be top five in the NBA elites player on his way to the hall of fame [noise]\nBecause you want to talk about natural ability a natural gifts\nSo hold on sit down when I say this but this is true Andrew awakens has Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant ability\nHe's six foot eight he can jump out of the gym he's got that was fast twitch reflexes the spring he was a great defender coming out of college I mean he ... he has a soft shooting touch this guy is on both labored Lee athletic he's Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant athletically he's every bit as gifted as they are\nBut there's one problem what area that it's not as gifted in the one area that he is sorely lacking is hearts Dr will win playing hard and and having that mentality that that's what's separated guys like Jordan and Kobe Bryant and the other great players\nThat owned believable competitiveness and that desire to when I met her ... your stuff Jordan and Kobe is hard into Andrew Wiggins you'd probably have the same type of player that's out off the charts gifted he is so Jimmy Butler is correct\nAndrew Reagan's is off he's too nice out there he doesn't want to be great he doesn't want it bad enough a lot of times I watch him he looks like he's coasting\nCarl Anthony towns of soft\nHe he's tremendously talented he can knock down threes he's unbelievably skilled for seven footer\nBut he settled for jumped saucy settles for three days or he doesn't fight hard enough on the boards that simply he's not great he's soft way against a soft Jimmy Butler is correct when he says that\nAnd this is why I think ... desperately wants to keep him on the roster\nAnd I tell you what if you would think there will be the guy to do it but ... Andrew Wiggins and currently up any towns desperately need about a science Fifteen ... right up the ass\nAnd maybe to me but there is the guy to do it as he didn't breakfast last week somebody's got to do it and Kevin Garnett did his coach today they asked them about the Minnesota timber rules and he said what you mean that s showed that bleep show up there in Minnesota\nSaid it's a mess\nAnd then he said he said Jimmy Butler um doesn't have the juice to go around threatening and talking the way he does because he's not LeBron and he's not Kevin ... he's not near that level\nAnd you him talking and demanding trades and cursing people that practice he's not quite good enough to get away with a botched gun at also said was agreeing with ... those those are the guys are so often they don't want to be great as bad as he as he does\nSo I'm hoping I liked the symbols seem I like to make about but I like watching them last year when a win win butler was healthy\nThat I it looks like it can't happen but I'm hoping they find a way to work it out\nAnd that butler stays in these days long term although being a phrase near the end of the year I Would doubt\nNow the question is do they continue to try and trade him does it might be he's still getting involved a new teams maybe back off now after they saw what happened to practice and say we'll just wait until the summer and get them as a free agent although the danger in that case of somebody else praised for him\nYou never know maybe he falls in love with the place maybe or a ... type situation happens we're George kind of fell in love with Russell Westbrook in Oklahoma City and said hey I think I'll stay\nBecause the Lakers thought they were going to sign Paul Georgia's a free agent over the summer now as it turns out and this is what a lot of people don't know as it turns out though\nWhen ... had his problems from San Antonio and he demanded a trade from the San Antonio spurs the Lakers lost interest involved or at least they lost interest in a Mac contract which is what he wanted they kind of turn the focus away from him and they were laser focus on ... letter\nBecause and obviously so because lenders have better player than poll George\nSo the Lakers focused on lettered and they tried to make a deal for them and they couldn't make it happen then he gets traded to Toronto so the Lakers are we making another hard push for ... over the summer and Jimmy Butler if he is a very liberal and clay Thompson of the Golden State warriors although I don't think we're going anywhere but those are going to be the three targets and to mark\nHis cousins who will not be a Golden State warriors next year\n\nBecause you know he found the one year deal for the veterans minimum and he all he wants to do is proof that if the killings was helping any play as well this year then it'll be looking for a max deal somewhere and it won't be in Golden State so that'll be another guy the Lakers radar and some other teams\nBut I I'm I'm going to defend semi butler here or ... maybe his behavior wasn't as professional as it could be but when he says Carl Anthony towns and Andrew Wiggins are soft or I I agree with them they are\nThere's days with your embassy sports weight on NBC Sports radio dot com [noise]\nThis is ... and you're listening to NBC Sports radio [noise]\nDo you\nWant to tell you what if\nA jar if you suffer from E.

Dosanjh nine hundred milligrams a day three times three hundred they found out they did not take well they started off with good intentions every people seem to take their first capital in the morning because they remember\nAnd then they get busy through the day and they forget to take their new pill or they forget to take the pill\nSo they found out a large percentage of people that did not get results with St john's wart was because of inconsistency of taking the dosages\nSo a German company\nSet out to do a major research project and find out if a nine hundred milligram tablets daily dose was just as effective as taking three three hundred milligrams daily dosages\nBy taking a nine hundred milligrams daily dose you could get by with just one nine hundred milligrams tablet daily\nAnd they were proven right\nBy giving the participants a nine hundred milligrams daily tablet once in a morning bound to be as effective as three three hundred milligrams dosages because then nine hundred milligrams daily tablet\nCovered the effects for twenty four hours\nSo taking nine hundred milligrams tablet once a day\nIs the effective way to take St john's wart does not need to be\nTaken a divided dosages that's what they found out because for some reason the study is originally from ... that was spread out through the day thinking that\nIt was more effective by spreading it out over over a period but it does not need to be taking a divided dosages nine hundred milligrams a day\nIs as effective as taken three three hundred milligrams dosages and just as effective as Prozac now St john's wart may interact\n... what we call the M. A. L. O. inhibitor mano mean ... inhibitor for other drugs though it's always good to check with your doctor if you have questions but to get a nine hundred and ...\nWhat I was being John's wart once in the morning and you do not have to take more during the day you'll find it and be more consistent you'll get phenomenal results and is more effective without the side effects\nNow here's one of my favorite recipes I don't eat dessert I don't want sugar in my my food I don't want to eat yogurt and what kind of desserts can you eat that as free of sugar\nSo I negate delicious super high energy

R. C. T. Studio Theater tickets are seven dollars at the door if you care get out of here\nYou can go to W. W. W. dot W. R.

I mean this impacts businesses\nWell yeah and and and it's and there's a parallel to our business we we see that in in our\nIn our industry in our market there's a lot of people who I mean everybody has to have a place to live kind of like the cell phone right but when you talk to people who are maybe paying and I'll just use the number here that's pretty typical seven eight hundred dollars a month for rent\nAnd there again one like Terry was saying one disaster away from a financial crisis\nThey'd love to buy a home and there's a lot of homes that are available that you can buy with the seven or eight hundred dollar a month payment\nSo they could own a home for the same kind of money that they're renting if they had the money for the initial down payment and the credit ability and things like that they may even have jobs established for long enough period of time um our our community was just recently changed to\nA status that so does actually through USDA program but it's called the rule housing program now in the city Wisconsin Rapids our income demographics have changed to the point where\nA hundred percent financing is available for homes there still closing costs and things and that sometimes creates a barrier for people to just can't get over that hurdle but\nUh again that's made it more affordable and we're seeing people this year that have been able to buy\nThe first time entry level homes that weren't able to in the past both because they're they're they're finding ways to get a little resourceful and get some resource and then you have some financial ability but also some of the changing things like the real housing program so\nThe it's real and that's a that's a real example I see in my business but then also talking to a lot of folks and Terry's right that the one we did the training this year and you sit down and you have to make those decisions where am I going to cut back\nAnd they're not that they're not the luxuries there that they're the needs and you have to sometimes change your expectations are doing that\nDoing it and simulation was hard enough but doing it in real life you can see the struggle people face now and the statistics are there it's worn out of every three families in our in our area\nAnd that's scary because we we can lift those people we can look up the whole ethical economy as\nThe Louis ... you know even even with the simulator currently try to put people in Paris to do it because that's a big part of it too if you're at two adults household um you might not have the same thoughts about where you cut\nYou know what I mean so so you might think well we just we can just you have less food you know and somebody else might think while\nWe can't leave the kids with a neighbor instead of quality childcare so then then that also creates them potentially create some friction in the family or some challenges and so so I think that there's just a lot of um a lot to learn around that our population and how as a community you know we we help raise the tide\nOrder not to take a quick break and then we'll be back with more about our United Way here on the morning then it goes in right after this\nI'm John a volunteer United Way I'm hearing Lincoln elementary school to find out what this place and who knows better about what kids read than kids right plus ask them\nYou know I

despite one hundred rushing yards but the badgers John open Taylor nonetheless a tough night for the badgers and coach Paul Christ was proud of the\nYou know the guys\nBattles and plays and and you know that's often to Michigan so good football team and then we certainly didn't do enough things throughout the course of the game to deliver so it was a chance to to beat them and uh\nYou know you look back at it and I thought I thought early on you know we had some of\nRadio have now we can begin we had the invocation\nYes and uh in the first Saturday we got ten stops in the second Saturday we have nine stopped normally car will be tried to do is have a minimum of seven or eight but\nWe had a lot of ah different citizens that came forward they want to participate in following some great stories they wanna tell and so we said why not I mean it's more for the public more for everybody so that that will be a lot of fun\nSo what it basically says here learn how to pass from citizens a point by says they emerge from the darkness to tell you about their experiences and our version of hunted history\nIt is for anybody that hasn't been there before Carl it's a it's very interesting is historic most stories are based on fact some you know our little bits stretched a little bit but I Am you know those goals are wearing ghosts will make a few stretches once in a while so [noise]\nBut uh you're basically you are by your um stamps or whatever and you get in a group and then we have a storyteller when you come in and originally there there by then you've got a nice fire gone and got somebody who's telling you stories around the fire\nKeep you warm and got hot apple cider apple cider that we pressed uh most of it ourselves out at the\nUh during the harvest spare so that's kind of reusing what we're doing there in another application\nAnd then you go out in a group and you have a guy that has a lantern that takes you round and there's a tale guide on the back in and you go from stopped to stop and like I say on this first Saturday the twentieth we have ten stops in on the twenty seventh we have nine stops one of the parties can make both Saturdays so\nA new goal from place to place a sometimes the guys will give you a little preface of what you're going to see just to give you an idea that\nThat may be you know prepare you a little bit for filling a little bit more of the story because most jobs or three to five minutes\nAnd and they can't take more time but otherwise we start backing up people are right on the on the route and everything so uh it's a great time we've got a three on the first Saturday they're going to be outside we got we just put applies today for him and we got you know fire\nA fire pit nearby for them to warm up and that sort of thing but for the public good it's a great time because they can dress for the weather if the weather's cool\nDress board to or if there should be a chance of showers or something you just bring an umbrella or something like that so uh it's it's our people that ... the ones outside that will have a little more of an issue but with the fire pits and everything I think it'll be fine and we've got great ah ah\nInvolvement a couple of people from community theater are involved in that have been involved from year to year such ... yeah\nGreat job and then we look forward to it so basically how walking around the site ah basically we start\nOn where the parking lot area is and and you go to listen to the storyteller and get your hot apple cider and then we start walking around in led by the guides down the road across the bridge or the weekly a bridge\nThat by the way people do know that is on a national and state historic a place as a registered and it's the only stone arch bridge in would county that's existent anymore is built like with a Roman Arch in it and it was built a\nBy stone that was bought from the weekly family in the late Eighteen eighties uh bought by the tone of Saratoga and they put up the bridge for weekly roads so it's got a little historic character and some of the\nYou know it's kind of interesting you know the river being so high as it was Carl last week and ... down a little bit\nWe had a school group out on friday okay and I was there and I was going to go walk across our bridge or wouldn't bridge not or other bridge\nAnd it was a foot underwater boy because what happens is when the river gets really high it acts like a dam and it doesn't allow these creeks or whatever to do discharge their water into the river 'cause the rivers higher than the creek and sort of blocks it ... all the water backs up and of course we had a lot of rain in the previous week or so\nSo it all blocked up and sold to\nThe water gets like a big pot and there and then all of a sudden it backs up and then we\nI was going to go across the bridge and I thought oh they called there's here as water all the way up I Know you're going to do that so I had to let the guides no there were bringing the school kids to come around on the road bridge because we can get through there so what were you walking down the road rage any way for the\nFor the spirit walk and then we got our first stop is in the bar and then we got a gentleman in there it's going to tell you about\nSome ... making and it's a true story of an English a trap or\nAnd I'm a you know normally we think of the French Voyagers and the French rappers but this is an English trapper new took place in the eastern part of Wisconsin so so true story early Eighteen hundreds and he'll tell the story of of this piece that he was putting on for friends and family and everything and it's really really interesting\nAnd then from there we go on to the house and we have two people in their one will be reading a letter and and there'll be a ghost kind of walking\nBetween the people in and doing a dialogue rather than just a monologue reading that letter and be talking back and forth and uh we let you know that\nIt's a little haunted history but nobody is going to grab you are or nothing's going to recharge at you so it's it's really safe for kids and everything and the kids will have a good time some things that may be a little harder for him to understand but a lot of families come out\nAnd if they got a two year old well what are you gonna do get a babysitter for two hours and you'll probably bring out your baby in the admission prices reasonable as by for adults too for students students anybody in school from you know from a first grade to through high school\nAnd and the preschoolers are free so I mean doesn't cost anything we have a lot of people come out with strollers and that is take the child out of the stroller and walk into the buildings and everything [laughter] so I get done with the house we walk in the back door the house of course and we walk out the front door on the riverside\nAnd then we had down to the warehouse and and that source as Steve Martin might address and are going to do a little thing there uh\nI think they're arguing about something about burial or something and they always do a great job on it and from there we go to the cabin and walk in the river side door\nAnd there'll be a Norwegian immigrant in there\nThat will be telling them with his story his life\nAnd and then you walk out the back side door of the cabin and they're around the firing\nWill be too young people telling you about the story of their lives and how they died and that sort of thing and it's really interesting is too high school students have been involved with us for a number of years and they wanted to do something originally they were going to do something the schools but they decided to do something\nOn their own by themselves and so we're ah thankful for them to be involved with it and then from there you go to the phone calls in a roundup ... will be in there and she'll be telling a story I Can't remember it I thought we\nPretty much what we do as proof read the stories is to make sure that their timeline in in in what they're saying sure is okay but not too scary or something like that and then from there you go to see the blacksmith old Ivan he's in the blacksmith shop and\nHe when he's ... and I are in use ah telling stories and so it it's a good time and the blacksmith shop and [noise] and ah\nWhat's got a nice as we got the the buildings that are heated spread out a little bit so you know houses heated\nThe cabin is heated and the blacksmith shop is kind of heated 'cause he's got his porridge going and he also has a has a story behind behind the people so they'll get warmed up a little bit if it's a cooler evening then we walked down by the Crick on the west side of the Crick a\nWe have a soldier that\nFrom the first World War we normally don't move up that high but the story is really really good and I think it's a\nSense I think it's about the hundreds anniversary coming up or the first World War I think it's appropriate for our era to tell that story and about this soldier there'll be a little preface this story because to get it in context of the guys will tell probably about a\nA you know about a minute or something like that just to preface it and then you go down and get soldier and the captain of the ship that he's on will be there\nAnd are are good old friend Tom Bremer will be the captain of the ship so he can expect a lot out of him you know [laughter] he's sure looks like the part of a cat and he does now say that's a perfect world for him and he said and then this big old\nBig old captain's chair and you can just imagine you know it'll be really good and then of course walk across the bridge or they're walking bridge a cross the creek\nHeading east and then you walk in wind around on our our historic pads their some of our nature trail area and then behind the schoolhouse there'd be two gals back there on the twentieth they won't be there on the twenty seventh day of other commitments there they were young ladies that we're working with us when they were\nUh ten twelve years old and they went through high school and now they went through a tech school or college and and they're still help you know as you know when they're not\nConflicts with work schedules and that sort of thing so we're we're always happy to have the ... sisters and and it to be involved with us and there'll be behind the schoolhouse and then we go into the schools\nAnd they're preparing I think for Halloween and so we'll see some of what they were preparing for and and and probably get some treats there too I Would think from the school um arms that are in the school how so\nAnd then you're back your Guidall take you down the road\nOr from the school I was down to

Clements medical Sirius Radio end or\nMike this is about as much a must win games a package looked at it in a while sort of the ...\nYeah I think so um 'cause to me this this Packers team as a two and three team not two two and one I should have won that game against the Vikings a ... they should have lost that game against the Vikings and he's had a field goal kicker that they got fired the next day\nAfter going over three and missing a chip shot to win the game so\nAh the Packers have a lot of things to prove and they're not going to get a very good opponent tonight because they're so banged up one of the issues I think that is a\nA well we'll be watching tonight is that Brian blog either right tackle but got put up on the injury lists last week with a knee injury and Mike mccarthy said nah not concerned about it there was a Saturday morning press conference of a crappy old\nAh but then ...\nYou know during the regular season it's very restricted about what you can see at practice right and there's like maybe ten twelve periods and you don't get to see any of the real scrimmage ing or team\nSometimes a little bit of scouting it's mostly ... it's it's really become just more of a photo op the teams are so concerned about things getting out of hand even not only schemer game plan\nBut personnel and injuries\nSo as they were a kicking out the media from the ... the last practice the other day um most of the guys were All right okay so we get we got to go through out the door and there was one camera man from channel to up in Green Bay it was still kinda\nBreaking down and stuff and all of a sudden he sees the cart go up\nAnd there's Jason springs laying on the ground hello the backup right tackle wait a minute and Brian block is already lived listed is limited with ray and the problem this would be your backup and they have they had to carts springs off the field\nSo Mike mccarthy was asked at the at the next press avail on Saturday morning what's the status of your backup right tackle Jason's breaks\nSome little ... practice so are still look and see how it goes through today in the more\nThey don't usually get the card up rules set back I mean no no no I wouldn't think so\nAnd I'll ask for Aaron Rodgers who of course got cut off the field when in the locker room and then came back in the second half and beat the Chicago Bears and the best quarter to dissolve fences play the fourth quarter that game usually it's something pretty serious but he's springs is listed with an ankle injury so we'll be keeping an eye on that night\n[noise] um you know I I understand that springs and now he has not played great um but I don't know anybody else you want to stick out there it's just what I'm thinking oh yeah this is what I'm saying here already thin you know I'm a ...\nOr a banged up team they do have some pretty good pass Russia's on that timid from the tape that I've seen\nIn addition to that you're also a team that right now is being flag out a tremendous rate your officers winds been for quite a bit as well a lot you know I mean you're talking about frustrating right now\nWhy and and the penalties like like Josh Jones the safety who wants to play more as a second round or but you know he hasn't been in the game and dom capers used him a lot last year move them around he ended up getting burned off\nTypically when the Packers play the Vikings then they put them on special teams and he's almost leading special teams and penalties he gets behind the runner and that to sixty five yard kickoff return from time Montgomery and draws a hole in ...\nI mean there's some families that have killed his team are and taking them out of the game early so\nYou know when Mike mccarthy first got in Green Bay two thousand six two thousand seven ten and brought in an awful lot of draft picks address the guys are really rowdy like really flying around the field and they were they were immature bunch but they were physical bunch and that's how you end up going Thirteen and three in two thousand seven\nIn what it turned out the fires last year\nBut they had a lot so McCarthy did a pretty good job than a sort of turning things around and getting these guys to settle in\nAnd so he was asked the other day do you think you can pull that off with this group and what you did ten years ago to reduce penalties in the middle of the season\nNow off the Gary season there for another it's always the players are different than we were back then\nEverybody has a training process in India out there just was in the process to get the the flow going where you need to go so we were dressed to\nGo there will be held more discipline particularly if you know the free stuff ... and things like that there's really no there's no excuse for that also we that we have and we're all those off of just continue to work the techniques of each and every\nYou know position and then they look at the common threads of of of each leader I mean they're both about every week so it felt like it's sort of just popped up so [noise] and and that's football\nBut ... you know what I might McCarthy's ... shell of a sudden he just keeps saying that's football\nNo it's not\nIt's due to discipline football or just football or I get it if you've got an aggressive penalty that's one thing you know hands down field you know pass interference things like that the taunting penalties the fall started penalties the penalties are from\nUm I'm going to call them what it called preparation penalties that that's where you started to get frustrated I always forget look you get Hansi down field it's kind of give or take I get it\nYou have a a taunting penalties standing over a guy screaming at him a those are stupid penalties\nYeah I I wasn't that was a controversial call I didn't understand that I didn't think he was ... it was just\nOh yeah the minute the minute he got the minute the play happened I said that you're gonna get fined or you're going to get the ... and sure enough the flight blew just you cannot it's one thing it'd be screaming a player you know you go back and forth to John Jack Lew you can't stand over isn't it funny though you had your legs spread all over the guy screaming at him\nUm you know he's got sixteen players on his injury listing for some reason the teams just ridiculously banged up including Joe stabbed left tackle who's going to be lining up against either Nick Perrier or claimed Matthews so you know that this kid this backup and doesn't have a lot of time to throw as well um\nBut you know so they'll make some big place they'll get some pass rush they can uh they can create some turnovers\nA but they've they've been given up the turn over the last couple of weeks and they came within two points to points of beating the chargers I think the chargers are good football team but they fell behind they lost as you mentioned the Arizona Cardinals by ten\nSo Shanahan was asked you know if you can figure out even though your team is banged up\nWhat do you come out of your twenty Eighteen loss in Arizona\nI'm a number of things you got to protect that all better and alec I get a hands on it but then we can get open faster and then we walk better to give them a little bit more time and then called better place you guys open so it's not as hard fell a little bit of everything but we're very well aware of that her five turnovers last week cost of the game then I'm that'll that wasn't just last week if you ever do that that'll\nBe pretty much every week so we got to get that fixed then we also get a better answer them all over the more to to help us and\nThe forty niners are in total rebuild mode when they brought in all veterans like Richard Sharon Mr legion a boom Mr Aaron Rodgers wasn't going to throw his direction entire game just a couple of years ago remember that game right\nSo Richard was asked about well you know I got along your lungs young players and you've lost your quarterback and a couple of other you know they're they're running back ... not going to be in this game he's on the news report and so richer was asked is the fact that you guys are one in four because you got so many young players to learning how to play in the NFL\nThe stuff to talk for for me 'cause I don't I don't I don't think of you as an excuse you know some people do um some pretty tough on guys a lot a lot of ways uh because you know when you're young you think they're paid high level and a lot of young guys do pay the higher level I think that just gives people an excuse to say that I don't get enough and through\nThe composer of as a person who wants to do to win every day and go for you for drugs they stick together and stay focused on task at hand and and don't start lollygag him and give Lucy Lucy and think oh man you know well with me [noise]\nI'm trying to do and I think the coaching staff has done a great job you know college and even John coming in speaking to them and making sure they understand the there's urgency but I think I can continue to\nPeople remember Richard Sherman yeah for the rent that he had with Aaron Andrews mhm being loud and and I'm coming off the air and say you were trying to throw it to me were were you know those kinds of things\nI Love Richard Sherman I usually don't like pro wrestling type you know football players right but it because this guy is always backed it up he's paid some unbelievable\nShe ... playoff games and he's smart as can be the smartest can be\nAnd he'll if he's taken an opponent and your quarterback sucks he'll say that at the press conference right but when it comes to Aaron Rodgers he's always said oh man Aaron Rodgers he's the real do polling respects twelve and saw richer was asked over the weekend\nWhy is Aaron Rodgers so great\nEverything that makes any ... any quarterback grades really smart um it was great control and I was off as you can change if I thought that's what he's filling a\nYou're not giving any pie and here's were poor with why it's good enough for you know in the years that are fighting here to report is good enough that they they kind of knew what he was faking\nI'm he's great at manipulating they pay for a game um you know if he sees used to and they don't uh venue hurry if at all I can get a penalty and get a free by the king of the free for a\nGreater understanding ... even through the care of a new or anything or is to still take the time if he if he wants to take a shot down a fairly takes it you know predominantly predominantly per game and the first place initially\nIt's always been that way um you know but it just makes them shots he makes some deep down deep developing meanwhile\nRichard Sherman's march chickens and half the position coaches and so right smart football player\nYep no doubt a real quick before I let you go Mike so we talked about this thing being kind of a must win and we we you know obviously about uh you know the the Packers off offensively or they need to kind of get this thing going\nThey need their starters back Toronto mode divine pay Randall now you know you have mark was about his face gambling now you know like when you mean St brown catch passes next show and make a play um we were talking earlier about the run game\nI'm looking for this thing to really depending on errands need tonight I'm looking for this thing to start to collect these guys are all back I'm looking for a finally this thing needs to start clicking\nIt gets into this question about Aaron Jones and why wasn't he on the field and the second half of the game where you go into the half time twenty four to nothing as well we don't like him as a past protector no that's your best player in the field if you saw yesterday's game between the dolphins and the bears\nThe differences when the dolphins you know brought brought ice water\nIs a is is finding a number Fifteen over the middle on a couple of slants sinus of a fast guys can cut up the bill the fastest player a guy who can make a difference who scored twice on the bears yesterday and the air and Jones is that kind of guy get the ball in this guy's hands Jimmy Jimmy ... not making these plays divide the seems to have doubled coverage\nYou know back in twenty fourteen when you ended up playing the sea hawks in the NFC championship but that was a season or the Packers they led to leak in school right now we're up at fourteen every week right and they're in Rogers was asked what was the difference between that season and this year is why you guys are off to such slow starts when it comes to scoring\nYeah that was fun I was there was a that was a good here for a first time scoring especially I spend a lot of fourth quarter isn't the sideline out here\nAs I remember um [noise]\nBut I think we gotta keep being aggressive early on and and uh [noise]\nJust be a little more detailed and focus from the start you know we we've had some\nPretty damn good second half of all you know a lot of it's been in in trailing situations or we need to find that in mind that at the start\nYou know like I said to be a little more a\nMore detailed and not some better excuse me in the beginning I\nGuess I'm surprised that they don't run their model huddle or no yeah a little earlier\nAnd there's no sense of urgency early on it and and I guess there shouldn't be I mean if you're running scripted plays you should be able to master what it is you're supposed to do but um it seems like it's always there down by a couple of scores and then they go to the the quick rhythm it passes get things in things start to move the football um [noise]\nI Can't put my finger on it just there's there's talent and not like there's not talent when he keeps it when you when you hear and Roger said well you know I think we need to get to detail and this and that and my question always is what does that mean\nWhat does that mean you you know I mean guys are running bad routes I mean you just trying to throw your guys one of the bus without throwing your guys on the bus I mean when you're talking about the details are running the details that you want as opposed to what the coach is one I mean I I don't know what that means\nAnd although devout to Adams has got a touchdown catch for four or five games so far this season he's got twenty six receptions say in the last two years he's tied with Antonio Brown for that same period he's twenty five years old\nAnd it's he's if he's from the bay area\nUm it just doesn't seem like this guy is being used or they're getting him open or getting the Baltimore are getting plays the feature devout to Adams so then you should be you know the top ranked receiver in the NFL\nAnd he was also asked hey Richard Sherman might be up there lining up against you you know do you get up when you had to face a famous veteran like that\nI don't know what I'll do that he can definitely they'll play I don't get up for anybody I mean I don't see anybody on my schedule and go I Can't wait to play this guy I mean I think that way I Hope that they put that they should or or the other way around but um\nIt's a yeah I mean it'd be good it'd be a good match\nA lot of respect for another player who part about the bond to Adams as the other day in practice or during those drills where we are talking about her in a segment um there's a couple of receivers on the practice squad and he's over there showing up footing ... it's because he's got some of the best foot work a day in the league\nAnd he's out there showing guys that aren't even on the active\nBut and maybe when he when you want a veteran does that he's only twenty five but it was a veteran does that maybe that makes some of those\nFourth and fifth and sixth from picks also pay a little bit more attention to like look at this guy he's over you not only our best receiver he's over there teaching these guys are going to be out to try and compete against us so the volunteers really grown into a tremendous leader big shoes to fill behind Jody Nelson\nBut devout to Adams is the real deal they just need to get them to football\nYeah I was going to say he's got his work cut out for him with Richard Sherman but also as you said look you still can play but he's an older guy you know I still think divine today is he's not a burner but he still had let it get up to go get it and if it if you get into Chris Brown running\nAnd he's good at it as you mentioned he's still should have openings\nAnd against Richard Sherman the guy with a spoon Greg ... Juan Williams those are the guys will probably be out there in combination trying to cover the ... and Randall if he gets back in the field tonight we'll see you think he makes about doing a I think so actually you know because he was he was\nWas limited all week and it's it's been a while since I've been out with a hamstring yeah probably a game time decision bill\nYeah if uh if they don't need them I wouldn't plan just my thoughts keep them for a couple of weeks let him completely rushed up and get them back because you're going to need them come LA and when you get a win at home yeah you'd better get one at home 'cause you get your body weak\nAnd tonight at about eleven o'clock everybody in the locker room we talking about cobble I'm going to ... they're all they're hard to get their plane tickets that's the only thing I can understand why this locker room was so boisterous this past week even after a ... million last of the lions and it's because\nMovies high school or do you want to get a jar which goes around twenty four hour information [noise]\nCBS News on the hour presented by there are works really mind\nPam culture CBS News has confirmed that Saudi Arabia is preparing to admit wrongdoing intermission involving Washington Post columnist Jim ... who vanished during a visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul CBS has the butter been joined just live with the latest\nAnd Pam CBS News can now confirmed that the Saudi Government appears ready to admit that Jamal because she'll be\nDid dies the results of an interrogation that went wrong sources say the Saudi Government is prepared to admit to go to shows in the Saudi consulate in Turkey\nDid begin the interrogation but then things apparently one to for this of course would contradict previous statements by the Saudi Government denying any involvement Saudi officials at one point said 'cause she'll be left the consulate alive\nFor ... for them and CBS News\nPresident Trump got an up close look at the damage caused by hurricane Michael\nDevoted when you're above if they don't play the devastation\nMr Trump's toward the community and Lynn haven Florida governor Rick Scott crews are still looking for people who were on accounted for and the hard hit town in Mexico beach CBS or ...

that we have a business that we don't own she claimed that we're paying for cars that we don't own cheaply claims that we're paying 'em from mileage for their business again that we don't own\nThat's
