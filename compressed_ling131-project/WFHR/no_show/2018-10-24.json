played a physical game I I was out as a young person you know you you take a guy out and that would get the crowd into it and I like the physicality I didn't mind the the brutal part of the game and

'cause we love to be hated and\nYou know when you're always came out with when it was just that much more sweeter so that's a swagger where for continuing to get back here\nYeah and you're also bringing fans back to and hopefully more and more calm I tell you you got Nineteen goals and four games you keep out in the book like that people are going to come in\nFor a while and so we have to do our job and sort of our players and uh you got to got to put it the product on the ice had people want to come on ... a good money or to to be a part of it I think they will and will just build their own reputation and then they can come see you know what his trance transforming transpired but it's for we know it's one brick at a time and\nWe like we haven't we like her culture and and guys are building trust every day and er and continue to just pollinating our guys and thrive on that\nLose fifty fifty vows we can't lose face off and just try to paint a picture of if we're going to be successful some of these things have to be cleaned up I thought we did a better job Sunday but uh\nYeah so I Try to keep even keel if your number one number five right now are a number of town or you're not even rank\nThe whole key is to try to get better and says a lot of cultural tell you whether it's in hockey football you want to be playing well at the end of the season 'cause that's when everything matters you get in the playoffs you get a chance to run through your maybe your league championship game playoff championship or alternately prizes winning the national championship and so\nIf you do with not and really staying focused on that process what your process what do we do every day\nAnd stay focused on that so they get wrapped up so I didn't read a lot of papers where we didn't have the Internet and we didn't have the phones like we did today\nAnd that that's what I was getting in social media is probably the worst thing I've ever ... that's what I was going to get to so so when you were playing and you know and I grew up with newspapers you'd go and read the box scores whatever the case may be in this day in an issue as well [laughter]\nTop man either they're not going to pick up a newspaper anyway the problem is they've got their little computer in their head and so they go on Twitter and they may only follow a certain amount of people but those followers made retweet something at all of a sudden there's a headline about like John do you got four goals the last two games right\nHe could be on Twitter and say hey look at me that right and all of a sudden you any knows it's worldwide so I'm just ... it's a whole different animal now\nAnd then you know he might have a friend that plays for Michigan Tech you know they get their likes and dislikes and all of a sudden they get like ... materials so bad you would think and so you know it gives the poster right and their locker miss I can get himself fired up ready to come down here and play the game but\nYeah so that's a whole different ball but I think I don't know from a coaching standpoint you just try to focus on what what the task at hand that particular day and try to do that over a period of time and really a lot of cultural talks laws that confer the processor and then being true that\nYeah you stuck to the process last year you had your team in position to win the national championship you out played Colgate and the national semi final and it didn't happen didn't and that that's the game though yeah it can be so rewarding and so heartbreaking at the same time\nIt is and you know I'll talk to our team as we go to the next you know probably four or five weeks to talk about the process as a you know trying to continue to improve and trying to keep focused at practice and doing all the little things because\nIt all comes down to doing all these little things over a long period of time to really strengthen ooh and so uh if you do that it really gives yourself an opportunity to become a team become United become your strength and numbers and then if you're playing your best hockey is\nThe end it gives you an opportunity to win but as you mentioned there is no guarantee that memory you know down in St Louis a couple of years ago when\nThings were looking real good we're walking into you know Minnesota got upset were walking into a championship game and I'm feeling really good about you know the outcome and we've been through the process and you know at the end all of a sudden you know a gold tender plays a little bit better than she normally has in the past you know makes enough saves and they capitalize on ... and you walk away from the rank\nVery disappointed because you won't get that opportunity too often and then you know last year against Kobe it's the same thing played well enough [noise]\nDidn't get a balanced and get a break and you know you walk away from the rank you're disappointed in you know\nLong summer get ready to training camp and then you know try to do the same thing this year we're stay true to what your you know you believe in you know do things for the right way and do it for a long period of time and then you become pretty good and then at the end it's like you take a run at it and and sometimes it works out and other times it does but that's why we do\nIt right exactly how it worked out here are very soon mark

reads\nGrievance against the Cincinnati Bengals you might remember\nThat or read had told members of the media after his visit with the bangles that the team was interested in signing him\nOnly to therefore withdraw their offer\nAfter the owner Mike Brown personally asked Reid\nWhether or not he planned on kneeling during the anthem well an arbitrator hired by the NFL they'll surprise there rule the Bengals were within their rights to ask greed if he was going to continue to kneel during the plane of the national anthem out here here's my issue with this\nAnd by the way I get it he's an owner he might think that might affect his bottom line but generally speaking in a\n... year younger than I Am you probably gone on a lot more job interviews as of late than I have and and rules have changed but uh it it it's my understanding now than when you go through a job interview I mean they can't ask you what do you think about your personal life or personal viewpoints political religious or anything else\nAh or I mean people will come down on your with all four feet and I'm thinking to myself how to how then did an arbitrator\nA rule that the Bengals were within their rights to ask greed whether or not he planned on continuing to deal for the national anthem\nAre absolutely right you you you're not allowed to ask those kinds of questions in a formal job interview or even a informal one as far as I Know yeah but yeah I I I'm\nYou know had there been an official NFL policy on the issue\nThen I feel like then they could come under the purview because it's an official NFL rule there is\nA documentation and and the rule book that talks about the anthem and uh maybe then it becomes a job question but because and I feel ownership was unable to come to an agreement with the NFL PA I Would still think that you can ask Derek read about these kinds\nYeah well I'm just saying just overall in in the United states of America these days and we got so damn sensitive in my opinion but I get it\nUh you know there are discrimination laws against\nYou know asking whether or not a woman plans to get pregnant over the next six months to rise right or whether or not you're you're a Christian or a Muslim or whether or not you're Jewish all kinds of different if you ask those questions I mean you're actually discriminated against these people\nAnd my guess is that the NFL regardless of whether or not they had some some formal ruling and about the national anthem would come under that purview\nWithout question without question\nI like I say it's just it's interesting that again this arbitrator hired by the NFL so uh I mean on the surface it looks like Harry Reid probably didn't have much of a chance with regard to\nHis grievance against the Cincinnati Bengals however\nI should tell you that ah the NFL PA has argue that the Bengals decision to pass on to read was solely\nRelated to the fact that he planned on and where would I guess wouldn't give him a definitive answer one way or another may continue to meal ah which as\nYou know a situation that the Panthers had been willing to deal with reads collusion grievance by the way he's got a second grievance this one a losing grievance against the NFL is still pending and it's not expected to be heard at least not in the near future\nUm [noise] you might remember an arbitrator recently sent calling captain exclusion grievance to trial denying the league's request to throw that case completely out\nSo well we'll see what it's called but but regarding regarding read\n[noise] uh as I said the Carolina Panthers took on\nThe Philadelphia Eagles sin of course a a member of the Philadelphia Eagles a safety Malcolm Jenkins right Malcolm Jenkins says the guy that kind of formed the players coalition that coalition was able to basically leverage\nThrough their negotiations with Roger Goodell and ownership a nearly a hundred billion dollars\nThat will be dedicated to social causes around the league that are held a dear to players or I Will Eric read who's a very very close friend to call in capitals in fact the first guy to taking me\nMexico on Capitol when they were teammates in in uh San Francisco uh decided to go out and meet Malcolm Jenkins at midfield before the game\nAnd I had to be restrained\nHe felt that Malcolm Jenkins a corrupted if you will that cause the cause of ... and then tried to monetize that bind to go shading this this multi million dollar deal with the national football league\nA afterwards the members of the media cornered Eric read in the locker room and ask them how we felt about Malcolm Jenkins and here's his answer\nTo leave a lot of players\nThem all going to capitalize on the situation\nJust started like I'll get it organization\nKnew what he was doing this I\nHad to go and that's\nAll right so there's an I've got an issue I I guess I mean and listen to those er Eric reads personal feelings with regard to Malcolm tickets\nBut I Will say this whether you're Malcolm Jenkins the player coalition whether you're calling capital or Eric read uh the fact that uh apparently and my guess is that although those of social issues may vary slightly from team to team or player to player\nOf the fact that Malcolm Jenkins was able to um form this coalition of players get to the national football league owners\nAnd I don't want to say store but let's say negotiating a deal worth nearly a hundred million dollars that will help\nAt least from his standpoint some of the issues of\nSocial issues in communities around NFL cities I think it's a terrific thing and it had ever agreed come out and basically call this guy a sellout [noise]\nAh sounds to me like it's more personal than anything else I mean we were where we expected or were players expected to just sit on the sidelines until Colin Kaepernick decided to do whatever it is that he decided to do\nAnd he's a smart kid so distracted\nAre so many other than\nSuddenly he realized he forgot his homework again that\nLeft on the Cape\nSchool staff\nWhen you can see learning an attention issues from their side\nYou can be on their side that's why there's understood that or a free online resource for the parents have the one in five kids with learning and attention issues get personalized recommendations practical tips daily access to experts in more to go from misunderstanding to understood dot org ... understood in the ad council\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to NBC Sports radio and sports fans sound up\nOn Louis on Twitter at NBC Sports radio\nAnd call it five five three two three four\nBecause every\nWhich way the ... um\nWas a back every body as we roll along on this Tuesday evening rather blustery here in Scottsdale, Arizona where the ... under center studios are located and it was that way early on in Boston before game one\nGot underway on time and right now the Dodgers have come back to ... to to against the red Sox and we're in the mid third right now\nUh as ... and a Christian Bale continue to battle it out we've had some ... so this one some hits them hit and run it so it's been a nice game so far to watch\nI mean one of the therapist so much stuff going on in the national football but what we're still a week away from me the NFL trade deadline right and um we've got more Cooper the got belt to the Dallas Cowboys by Oakland yesterday he like apple gets sent to the saints\nUh today but but some of the other really interesting stuff going on in the NFL\nIs what's happening here in the valley the son of course I'm Talking about the Arizona Cardinals while they went out and spend a bunch of money on sand Bradford\nHe could be a bridge between this year and they're Ricky first round pick Josh Rosen the rookie quarterback out of UCLA um same wrapper was horrible\nAnd therefore Rosen has been starting in fact they haven't even dressed\nOh San Bradford in an attempt to save about three hundred twelve thousand dollars is a roster bonus every game he's active so it's a money making a measure in Arizona a nonetheless other rumors started to uh to grow louder and louder this week that uh Patrick Peterson\nA has gone to the front office and asked to be traded that when I say asked I don't know if it's a demand or or not and listen he's under contract so I mean there is on the cardinals can do what the hell they want to do with him I'm not so sure that I Would trade him to be honest although as I said in the past and I'll say it again\nNobody's untouchable and depending on how much somebody is willing to give you\nA everybody is up for trade right even a guy like Patrick Peterson but he's a cornerstone under a contract for the next three years but this\nNew system brought in by Steve Wilkes\nA has been an abject failure they've already filed fire the office of coordinator\nUh MIke McCoy and I'm interested to see what by rental after which does as ah the former quarterbacks coach will now be calling plays and designing the office every week in the game plan\nA it'll be interesting how does involve a David Johnson does he make it easier for a guy like Josh rows of on the side of the football uh it's it's pathetic to watch\nOr listen Todd Bowles was the former defensive coordinator there and then of course Jane ... a James betcha was there until Bruce areas decided to leave and this was an aggressive defense of went after people oftentimes put a guy like a Patrick Peterson on an island and he was comfortable with doing that\nShe works as a guy that plays a a little bit more conservative um some Tampa to stuff more zone and it's been\nAbout let's face it it's just not been good right now this is the football team that is one in six\nAnd don't even look like they're close from weekend and week out with regard to um you know making at a competitive season in the NFC West and so Patrick Peterson says I see this thing getting worse before it gets better I Want to get the hell out of here a Steve ... was asked about the new head coach in Arizona here's how he responded\nI haven't heard anything on guard that he hasn't spoken to me about it at all I'm not going to indulge in any speculation I'm going to sit down and it's also Patrick bags or the cats and he's he's well respected around here he's well respected throughout the league and uh yeah so we're in a difficult situation yeah we are one in six nobody feels great about what we are right now\n[laughter] yeah it was so when you were perennial all pro and consider to be one of the best shutdown corners of the national football league or what you're playing for his chance to win the Superbowl he looks run across the lock room and his teammate Larry Fitzgerald who is likely in his last season as an NFL player and fix themself my God am I going to be there am I going to hang on here in Arizona and then ultimately\nYou know fade into the sunset yeah I got a big bank account nice cars nice homes those kinds of things but these guys play these these alpha males play for a championship he wants a chance to win a championship and there have been\nSeveral teams that have been mentioned with regard to Patrick Peterson the saints being one of them but they didn't have really enough cap space to you know bring under their umbrella Patrick petersen's a salary so they want to cheaper out and made a deal to bringing you lie many are you I mean you lie apple I should say [noise]\nUh but there are other teams out there including the Philadelphia Eagles that might be in position to um to to bring in a guy like Patrick Peterson what do you do if you're Michael did well and if you are Steve kind of a general manager\nI think you sit down and you listen to a guy like Patrick Peterson he's earned that right to sit down and have an adult conversation about business and then I think you you explore the situations but I think you also so Patrick Peterson here's the deal I mean we don't intend to be this horrible football team for a long time we think we've got our franchise quarterback it's going to be an up and down season this year and we need\nOf a centerpiece of cornerstone if you on the defensive side of the football\nThat we can continue to build around and these young players that we bring in can look to you for how it is you're supposed to be professional and football saw 'em again do do I think that this deal is going to get done either now or before the uh the end of the trade deadline I I'd be shocked if it if that happens\nI mean Patrick Peterson and I've had the chance to to meet the guy and and get to know I'm a little bit the is not a malicious person he's not going to do anything vengeful he's not going to say well I didn't get my way and and then create a big seen these just won't eat these unhappy wants a chance to win\nAnd somehow Steve time and Michael Been well documented Steve will sell though I think he's the lesser of the three have to find a way to convince Patrick Peterson that he needs to hang in there All right and to be honest with you I just don't think he has won three course\nThat's just the way the cookie crumbles I mean you're a great player and you've made millions upon millions upon millions of dollars or would that organization and do I think you owe them anything no you don't own it but you sign a contract you got three years left on it\nI'd be shocked if this thing got done and Patrick Peterson got shipped out [noise] probably five five three two three four to be said for them to join the conversation so to to bottom of the third one on one out\nRe continue to monitor being one of the world series when we come back or not you know who is the host of Gulf advisors road trip on golf channel or was out

getting a lot of flak for ...\nWithout a plan pebble beach from sixty two hundred yards and therefore he did he uses driver I if he has to use his driver they say it's more like a Fifteen sixteen handicapped he doesn't have to use his driver he's more like\nA four or five handicapped but he's so good with designers and he's so good around the green she's got amazing touch\nSo he was really impressive and the Jeremy robotic he's\nNo joke I mean he's a legitimate one one or two handicap and plays to it eight pounds the ball off the tea dead straight every time he he was he was he was having his way with the term course\nThe monument ... it was ... and he's ultra competitive I think as you probably know\nLive in a life you know sort of growing up in a competitive atmosphere golf is a great outlet for these guys are great sanctuary for all that competitive a competitive spirit they have Larry Fitzgerald when you talk football it was it where he was you can tell he's kind of just at the end of his career you know he's kind of going through\nGoing through the motion you know he he's got to give himself up for yet another season of intensity and the and the ... you know the the tackling and all the the ... you know the stuff that the beat down his body takes\nYou talk about golf it's like he's talking about Christmas morning but I did about the game he likes to say he plays golf to support is he plays football the supporters golfing so it's fun to be around those guys\nYeah I got about a bit of ... a a lot of these shows are appear on television and again this is called the Gulf advisor round trip debuts tonight at seven thirty eastern time I don't know if it was your idea of the producers idea where the brain trust there in golf channel ah it it is\nA both enjoyable entertain at the same time did you guys try to do anything different because to me it's it's a fantastic what can show\nWell for me I I'm surrounded by a great team of very talented group of people um in terms of producers who'd shooters so so and I've been working with these guys were over five years we'd all over the world and we we've been doing eight minutes in the past for morning driving that we've taken it to a thirty minute show\nBut for me I Try to I Try to tell the story of a place like Scottsdale through the eyes of an avid locals so take Larry and you get him talking about what he loves about GPCs Scottsdale and playing in that event you know usually plays the ...\nIt's it's his energy impassioned coming through about the area Jeff ... lived in the area for years nowadays is set up at ... ... talk show tapping into his energy and enthusiasm and passion for the area and to me you know Jeremy robotic same thing he said he's been all over the ... all of the world\nAnd he said we're going to live in Scottsdale so how and why and and and what what does that bring them that's what I Try to come through a in the show it's not about me it's not about my endorsement it's about them and their endorsement of an area and then if you are left to decide is this a good place for me or not\nAnd I think at that maintains that level of authenticity and it and and inspiration that I'm trying to get people to get up off their sofas and to consider a destination they might not otherwise consider and and and take a trip\nYeah well as winter starts to grip on the north east of

nothing side day for the best pitchers and all the baseball going to do and what one of them has not even made it out of the ...\nThe other one is teetering on if he's going to make it out of the fifth inning\nChris fail departs with the red Sox leading three to two in the fifth inning it doesn't matter he's not the pitcher record well unless the Dodgers score these two runs into the red Sox don't pack on any run than actually critical could lose this game\nBut the fact is for Clinton Herschel all lived on a pitch that for the first time in what six years Clayton ... is actually the owner dog for a start well gee I Wonder why oh that's right\nSilber and well while he pitch to a gym against the brewers\nIn the adult CS\nHe kind of revert back to old ... and here in the world series that guy that shriveled up when it all accounts for about two thirty nine he already in the regular season twenty alright well over forgives up two runs per game more because it's going to shoot up by the way\nPast a you know it needs to shoot up past\nFor a while he learned the already this last start against the brewers and it's probably going to raise the guinea has given up three earn runs in for anything so far and he might tack on to that tally 'cause\nHe has been pitched very well given up stakes hits here so it's amazing to me how quake Kirsch of who I think you can make an argument over the last ten or twelve years that's been the best pitcher in baseball just cannot get it done what accounts you don't just shut up the critics you go out there in a game on at Fenway Park near shut down the red Sox lineup\nThat's how you shut up the critics\nInstead of just more questions because Clinton car show once again just looked at average your best shot I mean it's hard to explain but it is psychological when it comes to Quaker shah\nClean this postseason though it's been better than\nAdvertised in the postseason I'm I'm Talking about\nHis first October fifth against the Braves eight innings ...\nThat's not choking not one rare that's a great start then his next outing against Milwaukee three innings for ... not no I wasn't helped by the false yeah then against Milwaukee again seven innings one on wrong that was a gym but then here's the problem is it easy to ... start to start rather than a year to year\nWay but you said John against the Atlanta then is averaged then pitches a gym and now he's average but here's the thing about it Shawn claim current showed the best picture of the last decade\nWhy is it hard for him to string together quality starts including again one of the world series when the Dodgers have to get off to a big start\nBook it's about the same deal look it David prices even worse ... greater than both those guys right but who who else is in Clinton herself class look across el\nHe's pretty good right he has the Iraq over five in the proceedings only picks point of UNIX right in the seats that are ... are still he he has struggled in in the short\nTime he's been in the season Chris el struggled yeah this is nothing new I don't you know with a lot of great pitchers yeah but you know what do I crochet I was on a level and fails probably also Madison Bumgarner get it I'd ride he's not Bumgarner\nBerliner didn't pitch grade that last game again no right now he's up and down as well yeah I mean it's great last year ... dominate but he's he's more up and down here's the thing here is there for a narrative though is that he's a good posters of his here's the different Sean for Landrieu will string together a bunch of good starts\nWith ... more hit or miss really yeah but he was undone by those three her name I Know the old fashioned way we will not want to have it in a six five to forty I got on\nBase just 'cause I was just joking I Know but it's just it's mind boggling I'm not trying to downplay the greatness of Clinton cursed heat down places himself of this postseason performance look a guy that we talked to Lake Tahoe Greg Maddox the greater regular season started bringing that he wasn't great in the post office I'm also not on the other hand was you're right\nThat's a difference I mean the difference is Greg Maddox didn't get it done when he counted in the postseason regular basis is the IRA was well above all run more I Believe in the postseason to want to do the regular season the bridge over three thousand in the regular season ... years of raised under two\nAnd ... it's a strange I you know pressure is there's no question about it I couldn't imagine the amount of pressure that's on the shoulders of acquaintance curse All right this is an organization that he came up they drafted him the first round that uh Dallas\nAnd look I mean you know that it's all on his shoulders he's the the next line of great starters in Dodger history Rite Aid goes\nTo him from coal facts that drysdale too you know her shy guys like that ... the guy why can't anybody say anything nice it was I had a Dodgers\nAny from your on the Fox broadcasting now are huge and how many times that we heard about that one hundred and eight wins by the Boston Red Sox and there are a great line up now you're saying curse has to get it done\nIn one yeah ... don't you expect it from the best pitcher in baseball in the ... with the greatest line up in this season in major league baseball yeah you're on John Gray line up throughout his career come on man Yankees are not playing right now\nTrying to be appointed most hormones in baseball history of the year [noise]\nNobody can say anything nice about the Dodgers\nI what what do you want that to say\nHe'd like to say I said they're going against the greatest line up their season here in the right answer me this question everybody up to the plague maybe you're a microcosm of Los Angeles why'd you cut them slack\nYou know what are your co worker at all it's it's hit or miss her so we know yet but he's all going up against the greatest line up\nBut he's also the greatest picture in the last Fifteen Years in baseball\nDoes he already has a three and I and his career is\nRecord lows hitting pitching has hit or miss period not when it comes to claim cursory young at right now he's finished twice certainly other times any given day a pitcher can have a bad day\nNot when you set the bar so high for yourself and that's the problem he's a he's his own worst enemy when it comes to this because the fact he set the bar so high with the greatness of playing curse on the regular season that the expectation that God tells you\nWhat part in it and then there's the bone want to hear about clean his job that's not a ... hour not Nick doing your job when you're Clinton curse Shaw\nHe's pitching to the tune of aid to three nine ... re no they don't drink fifty three career is not an age of thirty no it's not the guy has never had the guy is not had any are re over three seem so can you hear that in this house and what is the end it was what does that has to do it just to\nI don't do any does play in the national league right at Dodger Stadium right so that it does help a little bit\nA little but he's still you know go ahead yeah yes I'm tired

think about I fly or write slam dunk contest jumping over a damn ... that's what I think of I I just don't think I'll play Griffin is a three point shooter\nGame it's just moving farther away from it

mistake\n[laughter] well I don't know if I go that far I mean I'm not one to judge a draft after just about a quarter of the season are a little bit more than that and you know I think their philosophy Dan with respect to say on Barkley is not just the guy that's going to impact this team this year but it's going to be a guy that's going to impact the team\nFor years to come now you're right I agree with you the quarterback is by far the most important position and the options on the roster behind Eli Manning are\nNot necessarily attractive there just is no proven commodities Alex Chinese throat fourteen regular season passes in his career with the volume of change as you mentioned and ... that has yet to play ... regular season stats are you really don't know what you have that have ... and even if you throw him out for the\nLast few games of the season that doesn't mean you're going to get enough of an indication but one thing though I Will throw out his vision organization that has not necessarily turn to the draft to build the bridge or perhaps provide stability of quarterback now I Know that's\nNot the most popular allowed to go about finding an answer Dan I'll give you that but\nThey did find carry Collins and\nHe provided stability and help them get to a Super Bowl before they ultimately fell\nOn the line at it and had the opportunity to acquire him through the draft would fill up river so the reason I throw that out is you know they may decide to perhaps pursue it teddy Bridgewater who's had ties to ... going to be a free agent after the season with the New Orleans saints and teddy may save themselves\nDo I want to sit behind Drew Brees or do I want to have an opportunity to compete for starting job so that's one route perhaps that they can go to while at the same time perhaps draft of your quarterback this year or taking their time and looking at what the free agent market as or maybe even going all in and try to acquire Derek off from the raiders\nOf Oakland wants to part ways with them so you know everybody focuses on the draft and I still would argue there's other ways they still go about acquiring with quarterback who's a free agent it still may be young and have a few years to develop and have some more promising years after that to be able to produce rated states\nChowder buddy ... on Twitter Atlanta medal of course the series like them also giants radio network pre in half and post game most hearing going deep informant NBC Sports radio Lance almost half way through the season Pat Pat trimmer\nAnalytics said do smart and he's going for two in that situation I'm more of a traditional come for common old men frankly I'm a young man but I'm going to kick the extra point a gun for an extradition touchdown take an extra point and try to win over time but not just me\nSays so far through seven games the performance of the head coach pat termer\n[laughter] well you brought up the two point conversion and the aggressive they've said he showed yesterday I'm with you I mean I'm a traditionalist too I Would have taken the conservative route I'm not in\nFavor of chasing points no matter how the map turns out yeah the kicker who's done well this season and I'll drink roll shots and you know you're let him do its thing as the opportunity comes to tied the game you go about your business and you play for overtime just like\nI was against among for evil going for two to when it when I think a tie in the standings is much more beneficial than a loss because it gives you half a win and a half a loss\nAnd it could be the difference between making are missing the play offs but getting back to your question about pat Sherman or with respect to you know what he's done and what he hopes to do moving forward clearly he understands that this ... needs to be more productive and what I mean by that they've got to find a way to get into the end zone and this is now the third straight game Dan that they have produced\nOver four hundred Toto yards of are saying well that's great\nBut for hundreds of office doesn't mean anything if it doesn't equate the points and ... is an off into mind the guy who was developed a lot of quarterbacks and has had success most recently with the Vikings now I think it's unfair to compare what he did with Mina showed it to the present day team with the giants because\nThey had the number one scoring defense in Minnesota and the giants certainly don't have that so that was a nice a luxury to pressure off of the fence Assad of the ball but you know he understands there's a lot of work to be done with this team and the expectations are high given his off into background just like if you had a defensive coach and the defense wasn't performing you\nWould expect to see more of that facet of the team so you know right now they need to find ways to execute him the rich and whether that be changing play cold weather that theme running the football more effectively or whether that be the quarterback making better decisions I think you could point the finger\nAt all of those facets show you know it's a small sample size for what\nHe's got so far it's a mix of the lack of execution out of the players mental issues in terms of mishaps on the field as well as I'm sure coaching staff members said to themselves maybe they wish they'd had a player to back\nLance you are around this team you deal with fans on the broadcast you do for the giants\nAre you in the reaction you're getting from giants fan is there a at this point [noise] pretty much discussed with go back and juniors antics I mean are people getting tired of his antics on the field\nI think it's a mix I think that probably I Would lean towards more of the majority going towards that their irritated and they're fed up and they've had enough whether it be what he said in interviews whether it be to your point the activities\nOn the sidelines but at the end of the day you know they just invested in Oakdale back I'm sure the giants are certainly not in a position where they're going to part ways with him because\nWhat team is all of a sudden they're going to give you a great asset to take on a guy that just like a lucrative contract it it's just most teams don't have the luxury to take that deal in on their salary cap restrictions that they're operating which do you know I I think people need to look at this more from a big picture perspective\nThey don't like him as he made mistakes then he's absolutely made mistakes I think the interview was a bad decision on his part with respect to\nThe SPN spot but at the same time what he does on the sidelines I Would argue as had no impact whatsoever on the teams production outside of the Josh Norman agent and a few years ago with Carolina when he put himself engage report Josh Norman endangering costs the steam filters Asia and then he was ultimately suspended the following the Vikings game\nThat you can argue Timmy hurt the team\nAnd argue with me though that\nPutting your head up against the football on that or you know showing emotion yelling and screaming is necessarily having a negative impact on the team he's grown men\nYou know they're not necessarily looking at old though that can for directions to complete a five star tests or for the defenders to make a stop on third down so I don't see how those things are to nominate one with one another when the fan base get your noise I think it's a matter of Dan this team is one in six\nFifteen as had one playoff appearing since the last one of the show both on the two thousand election season and fans are allocated because there's not positive results and when you're irritated and there's not positive results and you're frustrated and you're on the answer is it's easy to point the finger at a guy who shows too much emotion on the sideline\nBob Seeger was the big forgot to tell you when it's I really am media smack you had known about them and it's not fair to them just doing a man smack your head against something in the old days Lance\nYeah well you know in the concussion era now you've got to be a little bit more careful in terms of how you go about your business and and I understand\nThat people get irritated but you know what I Would argue it's a\nEmotional sport and at the end of the day it's for entertainment sometimes I feel that people take football a little too seriously I understand we're invested in this we do this for a living where we're breaking things down we're analyzing it so now we have to develop opinions but we really going not irate over a guy celebrating in the end zone a little too much\nLike what can be at a few years ago and then what mother wrote a letter to the Panthers\nComplaining that even small model and it really ... you know this is what football is all about now I think the other day I thought we were supposed\nTo be entertained not to cycle analyze the mental fortitude of players I think that's getting a little too far in a little ridiculous\nI agree with you people take it to the game enjoyed for being a game so I Do on Saturdays and Sundays I enjoy seeing their drinking some brains you know healthy wings watching football I don't care if the showcasing\nThe towns that are coming on\nAnd she loves those wings she went down in Florida in fact some of the Don has come on you know there's you see the loss of like a bystander overlook that fact that that's a bad job hunting seriously when I was disappointed in you yeah I I thought you'd

course but no one can hear your little one and only Babe Ruth ... new book coming out the big fella Babe Ruth and the world's he created the author Jane Levy joining us in gene a lot of\nBooks have been written about Babe Ruth I read a lot of them what's different about yours in the sense of what angle are you taking when he talked about the of course the re Babe Ruth\n[noise] so you know that's I knew that was going to be the first question everybody out so as a result of that I had to come up with a good answer and that's why it took eight years to write this sucker um I actually spent one whole year before I agreed to do it\nReading everything that have been written about him and the one thing that was really clear and striking was it there was nothing about his childhood in any of the books are by ... minimal\nAnd it was I'm curious to me as a reporter like ... what happened you know a ... it's just like\nAlmost as if he emerged from St Mary's industrial school they reform school but he was sent to on the western edge of Baltimore fully fledged in at in Nineteen fourteen to go to play for the Baltimore Orioles\nSo I suspect that there was a story there and the difference between now and when Bob Kramer roaches fabulous book hadn't marshals smell Tsering ... wagging I'm an even leave mom fill in two thousand six is that\nDigital the digital ... and that's a hard word to say of 'em all the newspaper archives of papers that are that are still being printed and those that are the phone as well as state archives\nFamily documents made it possible for me to ferret out the untold story of his childhood which is so much worse it made me as a mom just want to pick up that seven year old boy and hug him because it's the cans and it's ... it's really awful\nJay and you know there's so many stories about Babe Ruth and you wonder how much of it is myth and how much is truth the story I've always heard as he was an orphan grown up in this orphanage in Baltimore that's not the case though is it\nNo in fact there were two minutes one that he was an orphan and the only reason people thought that was because people thought St Mary's\nRight it wasn't he said that the reform school and they took way we're boys and what were called incorrigible kids sent by the courts and the ... the other ... do you miss about him was that he wasn't incorrigible and that's and his parents had gotten some justice of the peace to sign off on a\nOn a on a ... you know can signing him to the school neither of those things is true what is true is this\nHis parents' marriage disintegrated his father caught his wife\nWith his bartender a I'm a dining room for\nAnd I'm accused her in in the depositions that I was able to locate of trading sexual favors for boos and he accused her of being an alcoholic\nAnd he said um that was it he threw out he had her arrested um and he got a divorce and may Nineteen oh six which was published in the Baltimore Sun\nAnd it was published in the Baltimore American\nAnd yet somehow Babe Ruth ... as a as an adult managed to keep\nThis completely out of print and who ...\nWho would want that to the public and so his ... his mother would die in Nineteen twelve of what the birth certificate and I get certificates said was exhaustion and also tuberculosis and his father never wants to see him\nWow unbelievable Jane Levy author the big fella Babe Ruth in the world he created joining us going deep the enforcement NBC Sports radio later life of course he was known to be a womanizer he may have a little too much here and there but I always ready at a soft spot in his heart for children is is because of his upbringing\nI think it is um you know he told his daughter Julia roof Stevens only one thing about his childhood and Julia by the way and a hundred and two is going strong a and what he said was I never felt fall\nAnd that's both a statement of Couric intake because the brothers around St Mary's only had six cents a day to feed each kid\nBut it was also a a statement of of a loss of emptiness if you look at his eyes and a lot of the famous pictures they're actually kind of sad and so I think he spent the rest of his life once he realized what was out there to have\nA feeling himself up with beer and food at women and cigars trying to fill in that place that um that emptiness but you know down to ... if if I may ... it's interesting that despite his reputation as a sort of wild man the\nFirst thing he did when he got out of St Mary's\nWas not there on a mock but to get married it was an act of complete conformity tried to give himself the family that he never had that it didn't work out that he discovered that or you know there was lots of fun to be have in the world is hardly surprising to me\nThat she wasn't showing incredible baseball skill while at obviously this reform or Tory school what would life has been like for Babe Ruth baseball season from up a life of who knows what\nWhile

is that this guy was always discover a described as a governor ...\nBecame you know quite style and I mean he really dressed and he became in some ways quite polished you know he knew how to hold a teacup with his finger out\nAnd and and which which fork in life to you is\nThat a big dinner I'm so he really did evolve as a person and he really did a lot to hide his peccadilloes because after twenty five which was the ... here for him in the stomach stomach ache around the world and\nWhen he got suspended by Miller Huggins and find five thousand bucks for staying out all night\nUm he

right sort of the others can be a marquee matchup\nDo I think it adds to it you can try to just tell me the magic bullet the Lakers aren't in the same class as the Houston Rockets right she can watch with a grain of salt saying to yourself yeah All right whatever I mean it'd be fun to watch LeBron but hard and Paul there's the better team\nBut now you throw the drama and what's gonna happen now what's gonna happen around those on the court balls on the court I he's the bad blood still simmering feud still simmering to wear something else can happen it kills more much must watch TV it's not always the bad thing to have this I Know people will get basketball fight at all it's terrible for the game which is awful\nYou know what when the fans are involved I agree malice in the palace when the fans are involved that's over the top that's bad\nWhen the fighting in hockey the fans don't get involved right it's all on the ice when you have fights like this that occur on the court\nThat's

last he's down to into this procedure than we are at the IRA will rise because I'm a poor performance now that you watched it I watched that kind of expected a shorter game with two great starters\nDidn't get it but ... disappoints again I Know he pitched well against the Braves I Know he pitched well in that final game against the Milwaukee Brewers bought disappointing has to be a word to use your set because her shawl just didn't have it tonight\nYeah but not entirely shocking we'd been using him a lot he's not a hundred percent\nUm you know he quit in ... in the postseason there's always a crap shoot I I Would uh you know legalized gambling or not I would not put a bet on quickly ... and as far as cell is concerned I mean this is a guy who's been hurt he's had elbow problems he's had stomach issues\nTo bring issues\nAll kinds of stuff and you're either I didn't love him in in game one but this is the story of the red Sox season they win despite themselves uh they always find ways to do it and they get it from all\nNoon is through at home or I mean\nThat's what the red Sox season has been and that's why the red Sox are going to win the world series the only question will be is whether or not this is dramatic or not 'cause I I took the red Sox insects\nAre and that's giving the Dodgers a lot of respect but I'll tell you what if if price can be half as good as he was against the Astros\nThere's a real good chance the red Sox go up to oh\nI actually said Red Sox in five on yesterday's show 'cause I'm not going to give the Dodgers that respect I think Boston just flat out better team they won sixteen more games than regular season\nPlaying the tougher half the baseball anyway and the American league them playing in the national league so you know I think it comes down to the fact that they're just disappear your team and they're hitting is unbelievable but getting back to curse all real quick said you've been around baseball his entire career\nLook I mean it's just over a hundred and things in the postseason you know it's a crab shoot it usually does not paid well once in a while you'll have a gym but\nIs it all men are we at that point when Clinton curse showing that counter ... you know switches October he just something obviously happens mentally and physically it's the same guy what happens mentally\nNo ... but I'd be perfectly honest I did not think\nThat Clinton Kurdish I was going to put together an amazing post season and I have a feeling when he starts again because he'll start again in the series yeah and I think he'll be better he'll be better in Los Angeles\nHe'll be better you know this is the first time in Fenway Park that often says a killer off and now they've got weapons from all sides I just I'm not reading that much into everything you're saying is right I just I didn't read too much into ... and I had really believed\nI never for one second thought that this is going to be a pitcher's do\nAnd what I didn't love was there was runners on base every inning\nThere was something happening in every inning and it seemed like every inning was a quote unquote stressful inning and those that up and that's why the innings pitched statistic is misleading and that's why some of the pitch count stats are misleading because you know the difference between a stressful inning and a non stressful and in\nEvery inning for ... and say I was very stressful\nHow about seven of nine with two walks between bad spent intending Martinez you want to talk about big bats coming through from Boston my goodness that Boston show that often tonight\nSo I just remember the conversations at the winter meetings last year when when the Yankees got uh what's his face Stanton yeah and and I I I I picked the red Sox when I got all this crap on Twitter for him but\nI did I I I think the red Sox were an overall better team now if you want to talk light up to line up you know my favorite statistic misses the epitome of click bait in today's media\nWhen I I Know as I did it and then I'll be dot com that you don't get me position\nBy position comparisons that's not the Superbowl we're not a linebacker going up against the right guard but [laughter] not happening\n... baseball played and I think that when people talk about the red Sox what they have been able to do is they have been able to score whenever they need and that red socks off and has been able to generate runs for for big blast but they don't wait around for big glass it's a great great lineup\nBe killing the fuel for both teams Seth clearly are the bullpen and look and that's why as you mentioned that reading seemed to be these stressful innings ... Boston bullpen frankly better than the Dodgers bullpen or is it both such question marks that you have no faith in either\n[noise] I just don't think either one of them the shutdown Bolton you know we haven't seen the always shut down both at in the post season was Milwaukee's\nAnd you know I just I don't think that either team and that's why you have all the uh you're going to continue to see starting pitchers on their throat days throw like the seventh or eighth inning\nUm again that's by necessity it's the same thing like when current council starting we'd Miley two games in a row heads out of necessity and it's not a desire to not trying to reinvent the wheel so this is this is kind of how it goes and and my attitude has been\nA for the red Sox is you know if you continue to put it runs on the bard because think about how their bullpen changed when they went from a five for lead to an eight for lead\nEverybody was more relaxed everything was faster the pace of the game was picking up everything changed from a one run game and I thought the Dodgers if it stayed on one game I thought the Dodgers were tied up they needed it another hit and they got that hit\nYeah our baseball insider said they were joining us going deep enforcement NBC Sports radio\n... in terms of their starters look at you know past sailing cursed by way neither pitched well it's a big question marks and David Price goes game to\n[noise]\nI mean you name all I Know [noise] sign up thing I think I'm getting\nMy\nName is an uncomfortable\nI got a little things I'm On the\nMain\nOne game and\nFamily I mean I learned catalyst\nYou can find with autism in children nprmontagne on\nEarly intervention make mine learned sign on to be done by Ron Eli onto the beach on the\n[noise]\nIs reducing the YMCA what you already know the why\nWe're so you think I'm sure you know the wife or a swim a workout even a game of food [noise] did you know we're more than that we're\nA cause you take your jumps on why someone else is getting job framing\nThe cardio glide she's earning an after school enrichment program\nPractice to download basing it all has its practices for leadership skills\nThat so why we work\nWith people no matter their age income or background and give them the opportunity to learn grow and thrive all with one simple goal\nIn mind [noise] sleeping on the news and we got so much more that does just that the one you might think otherwise that place to live the way\nWe're also about higher introducing the why\nWe're so much more than a place to cause\nThe YMCA dot net slash more\n[noise]\nIt's simple idea can be developed into something big that could change the world\nPortrayed my music teacher help me make a vision board it was a collage heavy weapons that are all my hopes an operation that\nOf my teachers at a time when you need to make our collages\nWhat am I never got a chance\nUnfortunately that's the reality our teachers face every day they're forced to spend their own money sometimes just to keep the cost him running\nWith the book for students to donate one million dollar donors choose our\nMaturity that help teachers get what they need to bring learning to live for\nOwners should that are held more than seven hundred thousand and project benefiting more than eight million\nIt's an idea that change in the world\nDonate in staples stores or learn more\n[noise]\n\n\nWhat do we\nHave here is our number three\nRed Sox winning game one [noise]\nBut like I thought first of all of our own making something I Do recollect early in the shoulder talking you're trying to tell me how great the Dodgers both an incentive to your knees you remember that Sean do you do you reckon like the conversation we had when I read the Dodger bullpen and Nick Anthony\nLee ... blue came from the defense that often you remember that right yeah there was watching a possible alright what about that one guy I'm okay\nBut you know the world series at most you up to seven so one game per and Boston bullpen did much better actually yes Boston Boston bull pen in five innings Boston gay bombings crap three hits\nOne earned run one walk and they struck out five Dodger bullpen pitched\nA four innings given up for hits on runs a walk in seven strike out and one game it's OK well but the Achilles heel her\nThe bullpen blow it one game okay but you are sticking up for this book I'm just saying I better pay and all that but I clearly the run on us not just tonight or they very open pick hall both both yeah they do they tell terrible but the terrible I really buy as\nMany Madsen on Social Security point [laughter]\nI ...

when you have to national teams it well do the times or ... or ... or even right in the world okay so you guys out there than it was like ...\nYou have the other thing is in Boston they are going to stay up to watch that game\n... wait a minute but here's the thing the super bowl doesn't draw a hundred million viewers because you only have the fans those two teams this isn't the super bowl is a different ones for under saying is a sport\nThe sports showcase for baseball the number one showcases the world series you don't want to gear or just for the two fan base or you think\nRatings would be better if major league baseball started the game at seven or nine rather eight or nine I'm not saying the ratings and what I Hope to make you know I don't I'm not I'm not saying that no no I don't care about the ratings what I'm Talking about is\nAlienating the next generation of baseball fans 'cause you don't have an extremely started game and a seven or nine more kids would watch yes watched the game yes they're not going to start watching a game that they know there are no remotely nowhere near going to be able to walk\nBecause baseball is boring I loved it I play it but it's boring to watch I think that's so kids aren't what you can start this game it to you know twelve o'clock in the afternoon nobody language downtime\nBut you have to but you have to at least make an effort baseball don't make an effort to try to draw the young crowd\nI don't I think Ron known Fred now that's not true that Ken griffey junior um add just one example\nHave hip give away trying but he's not trying to make baseball more heavy juniors now young they watch the ad I saw it\nYeah they tried to make the the baseball more hip by saying that you know the the unwritten rules you know don't like shut these kids down for you know\nCelebrating and whatever and making it more but baseball's trying to go that route and Robin for the commissioner of ... and I'll be has gone on record saying in that time of play the ... times with games is concerned and try to come out and say yeah we've\nUh they're shorter by two minutes to remember that whole thing so this is on his radar so he does care I don't I don't\nThink he cares because if major league baseball care they'll get rid of these these old has announced his that's number one\nAround here and just the way they're going to say that they're old and an have their own leaders ... don't have a weight lifted I'd rather too often I hear Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz is supposed to be hip\nOn that end of every day but he says is bling bling your pieces in the honestly that does nothing for me I mean that's not hip and cool that you know they don't here's the problem okay the problem is it baseball is having to resort to that that's a problem\nI don't think baseball but they're cheese is going to be a whole theme or that's why he's on that panel\nAlex Rodriguez it would be a hall of famer as well if it wasn't for the steroids well he's a product that but but that's why they're on that panel there were great baseball players in the ... and ... he's one of the of our generation one of the GOP\nShould it be a panel in terms of proud to say that's why they're on the panel that because they're hip\nI think it helps ... she's with a prominent baseball player you know hot dry air that's why it would be hip but he's he's he's ahead in baseball I don't know who he is\nYeah I don't think kids care topic poppy is are they do is not a problem though are major league baseball but he's not on there to draw kids to to watch

to watch that the anger that can be dying that it was way behind off is a chores like homework has got stabbed or we're going to be off in nursing homes that's gonna be the baseball fan but I Do if there is nothing you can because there is just dealt with the games it's a different type of game\nAnd it's about an MBA made for this generation and it's because we get more you know you go\nPeople still look the strike out so they'll the walks people's ... way there's no\nThere's no attention span baseball has given up that's what they've done they've given up yeah but you know what ... regional ratings have never been better\nYou know kind of just lowering ask you this tendency lower in New York City football baseball when the Yankees are winning and winning but that's because it's a classic city I'm just saying and what how many ... he's alive at LA right what's popular NFL football or Dodger baseball Lakers no but much more popular here not be like but then I'm Todd hey there\nThere are only years\nLater how about Chicago the cubs or the bears cops no bears are close I mean you know but that's a clap for it so but ... patriots\nIt's not healthy when you have three or four don't have that no you don't you go city to city baseball's very healthy no it's not care for tens of thousands of people don't care attendance is down ... down right everyone goes down because they're smaller\nAnd smaller parks right no it's like all the good compared to like Thirty years ago they don't have these football stadiums anymore they have like a baseball you know specific parks like PNC Park only holds like thirty six thousand three rivers he's a whole double that right\nThat's a big part of it because the factor that in his lab but basically\nGood they're up actually this year ... but they'll help you know what but they lose popularity two percent I think they're up oh All right so how is it a bit if if you don't ask don't sport not that now that gives it certainly forty years or he you know four year olds and thirty five year olds grew up with baseball the kids were ten Fifteen now\nDo you hope they don't care true in in in New York you're not going to smile Leslie Nielsen sport Chicago LA stood Boston Houston\nNow now Houston stop it they care about baseball our number three number three\nNo but they do the Fifteen year olds care they watch the the Astros games because they're good right now they don't care enough well that's the more they're not gonna have to be good they are more about the\nThe Astros in the rockets that they don't care about this sport they just carrying their teams popular in good ones that team goes back in the toilet not gonna care Roger look baseball in Houston has a\nStrong history you know that a lot of kids can play baseball news than have a hotbed only got there in Nineteen sixty you know what I'm saying that the high school baseball is all we have so much for the football is much better like multiples of

[noise]\nRed Sox have one game one of the world series got that right here it's over time NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com aid for the final as the Sox get the best of Clinton Kirsch off in a store that\nWas kind of expected right [noise]\nI Know that it was a novel idea Clinton Kirsch off for sale pitchers dual game one of the world series except you know the expectation is not the reality and Clinton ... has\nBeen bad in his postseason career it's had some bright spots this year ... in particular he's had some bright spots but historically he has not been good in the month of October and Chris Sale is coming off a second half of the season where he hasn't been healthy his shoulder there's been a little messed up and\nHad the stomach issue\nIn what she was hospitalized for last week you didn't know how long he was going to go into the game out deep he was going to go into the game\nHe goes for innings ... goes four innings cell gives up three runs ... gives up five runs\nThis was not the pictures do all that you expected\nBut it was the game that you had to see coming if you were a Dodger fan and if you're a Red Sox you knew that you're bull pen could be asked to come into the game early which they did\nMatt Barnes comes in gets a solid inning of work followed by Joe Kelly ... who's been our scores go to guy he comes in and then when he struggles\nAnd gives up around\nOur corner calls on water Rodriguez to get out Cody Ballenger every button that Alex Cora has pushed so far in this post season and for the entire season for that matter has been correct everything this guy touches turns to gold\nMeanwhile Dave Robert's on the other hand\nIt's amazing that we are criticizing day Roberts for his decision to take out Pedro buyers\nAnd go to Alex what\nYou'd normally not think that that would be the case you look at both pitchers and you would say yeah sure I'd rather have ... wouldn't that situation but buyers was dealing struck out too\nAnd then your call outs word\nAnd what is our score do\nThe calls on water on New Year's to pinch hit for Raphael ... a move that a lot of people were kind of confused by if you go on Twitter there was a lot of people that\nWere very critical of our score for making that decision and what happens all\nJust as you would think it turns to gold\nCheck on the rise of one of the only way\n[noise]\nCalling the red Sox radio network Munoz with the three Ron bomb over the monster and the red Sox got that cushion that they needed eight four was the lead you go to\nCraig Kimball in the ninth which I thought was unnecessary but Mm I guess you can kind of see why maybe just to give them a little confidence in a non pressurized situation because he has been so up and down this postseason I mean he's gotten every save but\nHe's given up a ton of runs and had a lot of guys on base Red Sox when eight to four the only issue that I had with maybe the the Kimble decision was\nIn a gang chew\nYou might want to use credit to roll for more than three outs\nAnd so why put them into the game when it is a foregone conclusion you didn't meet him it was a non ... situation and so\nYou didn't have to bring him into the game there\nBut then again I look at the other side of it and maybe that's what he was thinking which is\nLet's get him into a non pressurized situation let's\nAnd also the red Sox have and play in a few\nA few days\nSpain Kimball as in pitch than a few days\nSo they've had a lot of all the time\nYou want to get them into a game\nWhere it's a\nNon pressurized situation again\nAnd no you know not a high leverage situation and he can pitch and\nGet some working because he hasn't done a couple of days\nBut once again Alex corps\nContinues to make all the right decisions and well Dave Robert's not a good decision taking out by us and going to Alex would their eight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six to do\nBased on what you saw in ... one of the world series you're on Tuesday evening does your opinion of the series change\nAnd how long do you think this series we'll go I said Red Sox in seven I can still be telling seven\nThink that the Dodgers were witness came to I expected a split\nAnd then I expect the red Sox to weigh in two or three\nAnd that I have the Dodgers avoiding elimination against ex\nEnforcing their game seven\nMixed use a cold and the other way but he's a Dodger fan\nI Will now allow you to vent about your manager's decision to bring Alex went into the game\nYou didn't mind that I didn't mind it all\nHe didn't mind they were fighting\nThey did everything they can\nBut the highest was ... was dealing and that that that's just my take like why take out by as and bringing Alex would win\nYou know bias was getting the job done\nYou know you can leave by as interface ... and then\nYou get them out by as a truck out to ... he was dealing you bring in Alex would that forces court today and go now to it and ward on New Year's\nNew Year's with the pinch it during that changes the whole game\nIt was a one on game\nOne on one became a foreign game\nFor Dave Robert made a bad decision\nNow I understand that they\nObviously it's a reactionary business out would strikes out of the war on any as Dodgers come back and win the game were calling it a great decision\nBut this one did not work out\nIt did not work out\nLet's here from David Roberts on that decision\nYou know you look at both rosters ah there's a lot of depth and um you look at the ah the physician players on both sides grimy and bats and\nMost guys that are both teams have ah the ability to work pitch counts and get pitch tire so um you're going to go to the pan and plenty match ups and and that's kinda how I saw we saw it but they got to make it when they needed it\nHe got left the end all righty out\nHe was looking good on the mound\nAt that point you gotta keep him in there to face Raphael ...\nThat's the decision you got to make the I Know the numbers would tell you not to but just use your eyes have a feel for it by as was feeling\nAnd you have to know that if you make that move to the Alice would you have to anticipate all righty better being pinch it they're\nStill the metro you're looking for is not the numbers of wood versus Denver's the matchup you should be looking at is the potential award versus a right handed batter off the bench in this case it was and water need yes\nThat's where I think the Roberts failed here's our score I'm putting in yet and\nWe talk about it today you know when he came in probably he was a little bit disappointed even start because there's been sort of use every lefty but we felt that Ross he was going to hang in there with her show\nAnd I'm having him on the bench there was going to pay off you know you're going to keep all righty so fears is playing a he was playing to keep him in the in the dugout you know in the lineup was gonna probably give us a chance to win the game and you work out\nOf course the word that everything's been working out for our score\nEight five five three two three four and we see it's eight five five three two three four six to to Charlie it's gone from Boston your first year and NBC Sports radio hey Charlie [laughter]\nAnd it is good to hear that like you're saying as clear as almost like not Saddam just doesn't make\nA ... percent right the key component that everyone agrees is he's not Mr acts as a knows he's not too sure both look what you know at the moment I didn't realize this but in game one the red Sox\nAre actually won we've scored her you know having a you know again ate tonight and I guess Ben I'm telling you the first quarter I would've Bay View in the world series yeah\nGo ahead with reruns on your hips are clay and which is only happened one other time you know they just kinda went right for the red socks\nEverything has been going right through the red Sox and it's not just the six in one stat or whatever the ... with the game once the red Sox I think Kevin one\nUh I got to look up the exact numbers but I think it's like sixteen or Eighteen or fourteen of sixteen\nIn their last World Series games dating back to the past couple of World Series the free World Series championships before this\nThey've been like the hottest team in the world series you know next to the New York Yankees in that run that they did with the three ... so they have just been impressive in World Series but what does that and it means a completely different team now than what it\nHas been in the past but this team right now is clicking on all cylinders\nAnnounced they certainly are and how would I think there's only one way or\nFrom the team a shortstop and it was Twenty one the last two thousand the theme and the other thing you mentioned during the years you noticed we're almost better on the road which was a really tough act to follow I mean I don't think clearly the favorite for those seven but\nThis is going to be a shootout LA's just not going to roll over they got high powered up and they can't wait to see what they pull out of the hat while\nThere is is that for your Charlie they're Thirteen into in their last Fifteen World Series games that they joined the Yankees as the only teams to ever win Thirteen out of Fifteen World Series games\nSo that's what the status table one Thirteen of their last Fifteen World Series games Thirteen into including tonight as just an impressive run appreciate the phone call Charlie enjoy game too\nOn Wednesday evening David Price against on June ... eight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six to ... billion calling from Alabama your next door and NBC Sports radio a belly\nDoing good doing All right we'll man well first off I Want to say you know congratulations the red Sox have a super impressed by that when a but I really want to talk about just the fact that baseball\nYou know yeah among a younger generation of we don't really want to watch a whole lot of it anymore because you know when it comes on the football\nYou got sixteen games for the NFL\nAnd when you get the play offs it's one and done\nYou know and I'll be you that over a hundred and games you know there's no point in really watching until you know about August September when it starts to heat up\nAnd we did that and then you started to get your you know your fans that come out oh hair on their reason for this team or whatever it's too much like you were talking about a a analytic you know too much focus on that not about core you know let's just go out and play and Claire hearts out\nIt's no one cares anymore you know\nI Will I Will say this bill yeah baseball has an identity crisis when it comes to the national appeal but it's always been a regional sport\nYou know base major league baseball was always appealed in the individual markets in which teams are located it's not like the NFL which is a national sport there are fans of teams\nIn the NFL in every city in this country and a lot of it has to do with gambling alive but it has to do with fantasy and yeah a lot of it has to do with just the television product that they put on major league baseball's a worst television product than the NFL I mean I thought I was just great on TV\nIt's it's so much better on TV isn't going to live because when you go to an NFL game live ... you realize they stand around for a whole lot [laughter] there is only eleven minutes of actual game play\nIn a sixty minute football game so when you go to live it's like hey they're standing around again and look they're standing around again it's the best sport to watch on television or hockey is the best sport to go to live in person\nBut baseball that's a whole different conversation baseball bill he has always been a regional sport\nYou know fans in certain cities will watch their team a hundred and sixty two games during the regular season you watch your team throughout the entire summer and then it gets more of a national appeal wants to post season rolls around because it's broadcasted nationally so you get those\nMatchups with teams that they hope can appeal to the mass audiences\nHere you have a good series because you've got Red Sox and Dodgers to national team is in two huge markets if this were the royals are against the Indians are well that wouldn't be the case but if this was like the royals against\nUh give me you know a National League or the brewers it just it wouldn't be the same\nYou wouldn't have that appeal and it wouldn't be as large of a story as it is with the red Sox and the Dodgers which are too recognizable brands\nWith star players up and down both rosters but I get your point is well taken appreciate the phone call that baseball has always had this problem and it's only getting worse now with attention spans being shorter and shorter\nAnd with more younger fans gravitating towards the sport sport of football or even NBA basketball which has grown with its social media presence baseball's going to have to address this they trust\nTry to deal with the pace of play issues and their concerns\nBut it's always going to get Trump's in the ratings by football [noise] speaking of football\nTaking time out from the world series conversation to talk a little bit of football on the program which we do each and every\nTuesday night into Wednesday morning and then we'll get back into the world series conversation Chris Landry Landry fall dot com bubble insider will join me when we return over time here on NBC Sports radio on NBC Sports radio dot\nCatch the morning magazine with Carl hill Tuesday through brought eight to ten AM here on central Wisconsin twenty four hour information station am Thirteen pointed that what you have a job you were in BC sports radio update now\nRed Sox game one of the world series eight for over the Dodgers putting pressure on tags are five runs in foreign ... give up three runs it is four innings\nThere was a Sox bullpen securing the big three six pictures combined to allow just one run on three to five innings while

Davis nuggets beat the kings one twenty six one twelve I'm got side and bring her listening to NBC Sports radio\nAnd NBC Sports radio dot com [noise]\n\nBut it takes a lot to get excited about back\nBut most facts cats they be twenty percent parts and accessories that's twenty percent outbreak that twenty percent off oil builders twenty percent all virtually anything you can fit inside the Ninety nine cent never reusable bags so tell your buddies there's a bag they just have to check out the parts couple people that that will know\nParticipate in up on the front door was was less than minimum wage to supply hopper instead I'm thirty one Eighteen\nRenowned medical correspondent and endurance race champion Bob Barr not empty\nPeople ask me how you keep competing at the age is Seventy healthy living is important would sell his pain if you have paid you can't train so in the pros I discovered salon ... plus this unique topical pain reliever contains two states and in fact get anesthetics nothing as work better for\nIf I don't feel like a match up well if I Can't stop them\nI mean if I'm Boise State against Oklahoma and I am gassed and I have no chance of stopping I'm ... I'm going to go for it because at that point my chances of trying to win on one play that writers on and win over ... against the better team\nSo that's where you can't use analytics the rubber stamp every decision based upon what other people are doing in different situations how does that fit your team\nI've been I mean I I ... in the early\nI mean the late eighties early nineties in the league we were doing analytical stuff\nUm it's just that it's more it's more now something that you read in the public in the media but in no disrespect but all that stuff there's a lot of hocus pocus when you're talking about generalities because it doesn't affect\nYou it may\nFor me you're analytical standpoint as a team this may say how you're doing and the red zone or and the the the Green Zone or the deep red zone or back in your in this is what's worked for you that helps you but\nIn a game to game situation you may be having more success and breaking your tendencies and so it may cause you to do something that is a little bit opposed to what your analytics have said\nTo the first you know six or eight games of the year so you have to all that's what we call that's why we have quality you hear the term quality control coach and that's what they do they sell scout and break down their opponents in addition to opposing opponents and that's the biggest thing by the way that takes place junior by way\nThat's why it's good to have you buy with a little later you get rest deeper into the season but you also have more film data to go on your team so you break down your team is if you were playing your team and then you go in and try to break tendencies because you know everybody else's breaking out in the same film\nAnd they're saying what you're saying so you need to make sure that you do different things out of similar\nPersonnel groupings informations and plays and that gives you some advantages to try to get the upper hand on the opponent\nGoing forward oh you mean that coaches not just responsible for holding everybody back on the sidelines that the strength that tried to get back coach of the things that during the course of the equality\nCoaches are usually up and the press box and they're usually a sign like the office of guys one of them is responsible for calling in the personnel changes on the front and the personnel changes in the secondary um and all have responsibilities in the game now the the get that coaches other's\nDuring this guy's ass that's right that's right the strength of conditioning guys and the cowboys acquire a morning Cooper\nFirst round pick in next year's draft to have their own them the cowboys and they have the one thing I'm from the bears in the ... the reason why I don't hate this Chris and a lot of people are not on my side a lot of people were criticizing the cowboys\nYou know morning Cooper is thirty four twenty four thirty four twenty four years old right and he is a two time pro bowler he's a guy who had back back thousands yard seasons in his first two years in the league he knows what it takes to be a number one receiver and this week\nLet's look at Calvin Ridley on the other hand a guy who a lot of cowboys fan said that they should have drafted in the first round instead they want with waiting vendor Russia Nineteen\nKind of really twenty three years old so you you use a first round pick\nOn a gun now who you know what you're getting as opposed to an unknown with a draft pick that hasn't played in the lead before and he's basically the same age as the guys who the fans wanted you to pick in the first time this year so why are they getting so much negative feedback about the well\nI'm first of all there are a little different um Ridley is a more polished receiver and and he's more consistent catching the ball Cooper is got big play ability no doubt any is young and in terms of the age that's ... negligible you're correct\nBut he hasn't been as consistent catching the football and hasn't been as consistent as a route runner and he's not been as he's had a lot of injuries that that have kept him out of certain games and I think is retarded his development I still think he can be a really good player and it gives them big play ability I don't um\nHave a problem with ... you know the player in the potential he could he could potentially give the cowboys\nI Do know this that that no one else was offering a number one so I think maybe I don't know 'cause I don't really pay much attention to who's saying what and what not but\nAnd now you tell me a maybe the criticism is that you know they gave up too much less than they were aggressive with it 'cause that's what Jerry does once a guy and you know he Jerry's like a\nYou know what you know data church often and he's going to spend whatever you can get his wife took the picture of the manner you know\nUh doesn't matter so listen if he ends up being a big time play maker for them it helps their off and they want\nYou know overreact to it but let me say this is the the writers were dancing to get another first round pegs ... what can the writer they've got five picks in the first round the next two years\nIt's what they do with them that into a particularly good job last year and last year's draft so the picture great what you do with them is what's important and from John standpoint John Gurdon\nIt doesn't have a lot of patients who doesn't develop players technique work very well and he doesn't do very good job of roll with young players you know and that's where I go out and get a joined you Nelson and once you guys ready made certain ...\nYou know he's not as good of a teacher of young players on the draft and all these young getting all these draft picks well what are they going to be doing crafting young players so I you know it's one of those cases where\nI don't know that that I'm excited for the writers are the cop parties really I think that at least with the cowboys he could have a player who could be really good but they do give up a lot for him for the raiders I'm concerned about how poll Miller's plan right now the first round pick last year which I thought was overdraft that\nAnd you know they've got to you know you mentioned Cooper's been a player that's been productive for have traded Mac liberated Cooper and they're clearly and rebuild mode but do you trust John Gurdon available to rebuild I I have to raise my hand and say I I'm not quite on board with\nThat and he's Chris Landry Landry ball dot com I'm Scott ... when we return we'll

one and it didn't work out for the other let's talk about game one of the world series with our baseball insider separate you follow him on Twitter at sat on their score evidence so let's talk about the decisions I'm looking at the the decision to take buyers out and go to Alex would for day Roberts I thought was\nAs I thought the decision to pinch hit pneumonia as for divers was an intriguing one and it worked out for our score because what hasn't worked out for our core so far this postseason duty as with the the the big bomb over the monster and the red Sox pulled away from the Dodgers weren't you make at the time of pull decisions\n[noise] well you know my attitude has been all along that our score is going to win the mega millions\nBecause I don't want anyone on Tuesday night two billion dollars on friday\nI Know it's crazy if you look at the ... Alex ... has done you know what he has been able to find is every time there's a deficiency find a way and for his off and you know people talk about home run totals and and and and and be peas and all this nonsense\nAnd I have said this all along the red Sox find ways to score runs\nAnd you know to me\nI knew going into this game and it was not going to be a pictures to Chris sales on a hundred percent Clinton courage I was not a hundred percent putting her struggle in the postseason fails been in the hospital\nThere's there's too many mitigating factors ah the question will be is whether or not review settle the red Sox offense down because they're not going to be too well\nYeah and another thing you know ... uh struggles and order New Year's comes in and and excuse me in water Rodriguez comes in and retires Cody\nBallenger and Kimball gets the ninth inning even though it's a four run lead that one I question the little bit for Cora do you think that that was just about giving kimbrell in ... in easy glowed yeah because you know me build up the confidence knowing that you might need them for two innings are on Wednesday\nWell everything had been stressful in the whole game if you notice mhm so this idea that you know you're talking about a guy who's\nBeen dominant and they just needed him to be dominant again and you had to get him back in the game it's very much reminiscent of when Craig council use Jeremy Jeffress in a game that you did say ... what are your burning him for what they need is they needed opportunities to make sure\nThat this picture can gain his confidence back and they couldn't guarantee that so you know my attitude has been\nYou look at what's going on with regard to the way kimbrell has gone he needs routine he needs to be out there every day he is used to the regular season and guys do not respond well to all the time off\nAnd you know in this circumstance they the Astros series ended in five games they didn't have a full week but they had nearly a week I think it was six days so Kimberly wasn't seeing any action Nathan evolve they hadn't seen any action the problem is it's very hard to stay in a rhythm\nYeah I guess if you look at it that way than I Do agree get him some ... I guess I I'm just coming at it from the sense that you might need kimbrell for more than three outs on Tuesday and so using him here on excuse me on Wednesday using him here on Tuesday now maybe you don't use him for multiple innings on Wednesday again to\nUnderstand the logic I you know the ... ... you know protecting the future you don't know what the situation as you know that that game could easily be eight one often and it's a it's a non factor so you know just because we're having this conversation that we wind up being a you know a chance\nOr you know for for Fifteen ending\nYou know they're gonna run out of people and you know how to use\nThe litter and all that stuff but uh no I I understand the logic I just think you know from the standpoint it was much more important for Craig Kimball to get an even if you notice the first six innings or that came before the newness home run those\nWere all stressful and it you know that's one thing about ... ... you know ... innings pitched and uh you know the the pitch counts and and those things that don't get calculated stressful pitches and for both those pictures a sale and Kirsch or those first for ... for a very stressful yet to men out I mean\nTo have any ... that that that\nPlays a role and you know it when it comes to longevity it's not like these you know that's another thing that I like the year it'd be the starters didn't knock it out of the fifth inning think were gassed they were they pitch to humans effort and the fact that it was a three three game through for is a miracle\n... telling us that there were no baseball inside of Scott's a number of years over time NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com what'd you make of Clinton ... struggles in this game\nYou know it's quicker show no none of the surprises me um you know Clinton Kurdish has been a guy who has been a hot and cold um I just I Do not think this was safe money\nI Would you know it was too because betting is illegal now um I did not think going in that this is going to be a pitcher's dual I didn't like this match up everyone's talking about this ethic match up and I didn't see it I did not see this for for an instant and I said that the last week you know the one thing that we looked at with these\nYou have a legitimate juggernaut of an office in Boston and you have a pretty darn good offense in Los Angeles they are going to hit mistakes and it's not that these guys were making careless mistakes it's just that both pictures weren't on their game\nLet me ask you because both starters didn't really go a ton of innings do you see a scenario in which you could bring ... or cell and or both back for a game for\nI don't think so I I I think the Dodger rotations pretty set 'em if anything failed could get pushed back you know but that if the red Sox are up three one\nUm my prediction is Red Sox and fix because I think that the red Sox win tomorrow I or later today I think that what the what will happen is Boston will go up to oh I think they'll lose two or three in Los Angeles and\nThen they'll come home and when sick like that that's\nHow I can see this I'm I'll be interested to see what kind of performance price gives them\nA that to me is the key to the whole thing obviously and then what happens is that they can stretch everybody I think at the very least\nFail and crush on meet again in game five and if there's a chance of Boston's up three one there's a chance to curse or has a chance to pitch his last game as a Dodger potentially a in a game that you know keep them alive\nI have Red Sox and seven that's what I had before the series and even after name what I'm sticking with it\nBut you know my issue you know my my issue is always um [noise] uh ... whenever whenever we talk about a game seven\nWhat's a ... they really liked him and I thought OK\nOur score on countering with newness\nWe talk about it today you know when he came in front of he was a little bit disappointed that either start because it's just sort of games every left the voting fell that rough he was going to hang in there with her show\nAnd I'm having him on the bench it was going to pay off you know you gotta keep all righty fears is lame though he was playing so keep him in the in the dugout you know in the line of who's going to probably give us a chance to win the game and the workout\nAbsolutely worked out\nCheck other runners of one of the only ...\n[noise]\nThat was the call and the red Sox for radio network you know every decision that our score as made in this postseason and this entire season as a whole\nHe's been absolutely tremendous this has been the best team all season long a hundred and eight wins and now into the world series\nTheir favorite to win this thing\nHere they are now three wins away\nThey've won Thirteen at the last Fifteen World Series games too that's just a fun little stat that really doesn't mean anything because obviously those teams are much different but\nIt is\nIntriguing\nThere the favorites Nick ... what are you gonna say I I\nI don't get why everyone including you mhm is getting all excited over one game\nThe Dodgers lost the first game to to Milwaukee zoo\nAnd look what happened it's one game and yet\nBut I just kept pace with them in to that new home rod so let's let's stop a moment\nAnd just think about one game it's getting too so that everybody\nIn like a true Dodger no I'm speaking\nLike a everyday any team\nFan it's just one game\nThat we didn't do anything different than than they've been doing some ... there's no need to to give them praised for something miraculous that they didn't do anything miraculous\nNothing done miraculously no they want a game that they were favored to win the bank you've got ... You're welcome [laughter] one game one game\nOne game and now there'll be favored to win game too [laughter]\nAnd then getting through the\nSame or why are they favorite the word damn to\n... because of their home\nTheir favorite to win game to the doctor with the I'll tell you what the ah\nWhat the odds are for that right now let's see it could be ah\nLet's see if there's an updated on the odds on that\nOh man website is blocked\nGuess just being here at work I Can't go to the site that I get my odds from\n[laughter] I'd\nI'd try to get the current odds against look and see what ESPN has up there one thirty five Red Sox minus one thirty five right not as heavy favorite as they were in game one but they're still favored games three we don't even know who the starters going to be I assume oh it's gonna be Walker buell or\nYeah probably pour cello\nFor the red Sox because of all the came out of the bullpen here in in in this game\nSo what we've seen\nStore ugly from\nAlex Cora has been he's brought report cello in\nOut of the bullpen and then turn to\nNathan your body as the game three star\nMaybe this is the opposite plan now you go to a your body out of the bullpen and maybe it's worth four cello in game three but at home I Would give the Dodgers the edge in game three because Walker viewers or a ... he's he's had a pretty good year\nAnd a Dodger home and then again for honestly again for the wild card because you could go with rich shelf you're the Dodgers\nRight he'd be well rested but let me throw this at your neck how how's Boston\nA favorite game too just because they're home but the Dodgers aren't favorite endgame for when they're home\nWe we are joined out for those games yet but it just doesn't make sense all talking about the Dodgers will be favored in game three I said for you said they weren't even game for\nI never said anything about favored around singer odds alright ... for that game ha won't be out for that game after being elected named three\nI'm saying here's the thing with gains for\nPay attention\nYou get thrown rich\nOr or\nIs it crazy to bring back Clayton cursor\nWhich don't Tuesday but only through four innings\nHe only through four innings in this game neck Seventy nine pitch is\nNot exactly a\nHeavy workload ...\nHe'll have Wednesday Thursday Friday to rest\nAnd then pitch Saturday Night\nIt's like three and a half days rest\nI Know what short rest and you could easily just pitch 'em on for days rest on in game five\nAnd I guess what happens over the next couple of days will dictate it but let's say you are down\nIf you down three oh you're definitely go to ... in game for that that's just that's a no brainer\nIf you're down to one\nWould you go to ... on short rest in game for neck\nNo I think I Would\nAnd I'm not worried about the short rest because he didn't throw a ton of pitches only you know Seventy nine pictures and not really a lot for him\nHere on on game one end\nDistorted at Fenway so I'm not really a shooting at the start going to be at Dodger Stadium I'd much rather you know I like him at home than on the road\nPlus if I put him in game for and let's say you know I only throw them for three innings I don't need him to go eight shutout innings but if I throw him for three four innings and I can bring them back in game seven is that uh when I go home game\nAnd then I wouldn't throw I wouldn't but it was but it all out but it allows you to bring them back in game seven\nTo wouldn't you want ... one for seven availability\nBecause maybe he can make a relief appearance in game seven or even start game seven\nI just think that the fact that he only through four innings year\nMakes it much more feasible for him to go in game for as opposed to have to wait until game five and then not be available in game seven or maybe the only available for one inning games that potential I don't\nKnow all I Know it it's not as lopsided have as people are making it seem that the campaign until the new\nBook I said Red Sox in seven that's not lopsided\nWell everyone at five five three two three four six to to do with that when I was radio\nThat coverage or\nYou

a start\nWell gee I Wonder why oh that's right the caliber turned October and well while he pitched a gym against the brewers\nIn the ... the s\nP kind of revert back to all Clinton here in the world series the guy that shriveled up when it all accounts for about two thirty nine he already in the regular season twenty alright well over forty gives up two runs per game more because it's going to shoot up by the way\nPast a you know it needs to shoot up past for a while he learned the already this last start\nAgainst the brewers and it's probably going to raise the getting given up three earn

... it's hard to explain but it is psychological\nWhen it comes to ... well I mean clean this postseason though it's been better than\nAdvertised in the postseason I'm I'm Talking about his first October fifth against the Braves eight innings ...\nThat's ... that's a great start then his next outing against Milwaukee three ... not night but he wasn't helped by the false yeah Ben against Milwaukee again seven innings one Enron that was a job but then here's the problem is it do you think the ... going to start to start rather than a year to year\nJohn against the Atlanta then is the average bed pitches a gym and now he's average\nBut here's the thing about it Shawn claim curse all the best picture of the last decade\nWhy is it hard for him to string together quality starts including again one of the world series when the Dodgers have to get off to a big start book it's about the same deal look it David prices even worse ... greater than both those guys right but who who else is in clean herself class look across el\nHe's pretty good right he has the ear right over five in the postseason only pitched ... pillow model are still he he has struggled in in the short\nTime he's been in the season ... struggled yeah so this is nothing new I don't you know with a lot of great pictures yeah but you know what though I crochet I was on a level and still probably also Madison Bumgarner get it I ride he's not Bumgarner\nIn overland or didn't pitch grade that last game you know right now he's up and down as well yeah I mean it's great last year we dominate but he's he's up more up and down here's a here's a different narrative though is that he's a good posted his here's a different Sean for land or will scream together a bunch of good starts\nWith ... more hit or miss really yeah but he was undone by three ... and I know the old at Fenway leave all your body temperature McCoy six five to forty I got on\nA mission that I was just joking I Know but it's just it's

season started reading that he wasn't great in the post office and also now on the other hand was you're right\nThat's a difference I mean the difference is Greg Maddox didn't get it done when he

Y. netting and had the opportunity to acquire in him through the traffic would fill up river so the reason I throw that out is you know they may decide to perhaps pursue it teddy Bridgewater who's had ties to ... who's going to be a free agent after the season with a New Orleans saints intending may save themselves\nDo I want to sit behind Drew Brees or do I want to have an opportunity to compete for starting job so that's one route perhaps that they can go to while at the same time perhaps draft of your quarterback this year or taking their time and looking at what the three major market as or maybe even going all in and try to acquire ... from the raiders\nOf Oakland wants to part ways or them so you know everybody focuses on the draft and I still would argue there's other ways to still go about acquiring with quarterback who's a free agent it still may be young and I have a few years to develop and have some more promising years after that to be able to produce rated states\nChowder buddy ... on Twitter Atlanta mentally of course the series like them also giants radio never pre and post game most ear ongoing D did force but NBC Sports radio Lance almost half way through the season you know ...\nUh analytics said do smart and he's going for two in that situation I'm more of a traditional calm traditionalist call me an old man frankly I'm a young man but I'm going to kick the extra point a gun for you know next to Josh touched on an extra point in trying to win and overtime ...\nMe says so far through seven games the performance of that stature [laughter] well\nYou brought up the two point conversion the aggressive is that he showed yesterday I'm with you I mean I'm a traditionalist too I Would have taken the conservative route I'm not in favor of chasing points no matter how the map turns out you have a kicker who's done well this season at all drink roadsides and\nYou know you're let him do his thing and it's the opportunity comes to tied the game you go about your business and you play for overtime just like\nI was against Mike ... going for two to when it when I think a tie in the standings is much more beneficial than a loss because it gives you a half a win and a half a laws and it could be the difference between making are missing the play offs but getting back to your question about pat Sherman or with respect to you know what he's done and what he hopes to do moving forward\nClearly he understands that this off ants needs to be more productive and what I mean by that they've got to find a way to get into the end zone because this is now the third straight game Dan that they have produced over four hundred yards of I'll say well that's great\nBut for hundreds of office doesn't mean anything if it doesn't equate the points and ... is an odd fences mind the guy who was developed a lot of quarterbacks ... most recently with the Vikings now I think it's unfair to compare what he did with Mina showed it to the present day team with the giants because\nThey had the number one scoring defense in Minnesota and the giants certainly don't have that so that was a nice of luxury and took pressure off of the fence decided the ball but you know he understands there's a lot of work to be done with this team\nAnd the expectations are high given his off into background just like if you had a defensive coach and the defense wasn't performing\nYou would expect to see more out of that facet of the team so you know right now they need to find ways to execute him the right show whether that be changing play called whether that be running the football more effectively or whether that be the quarterback making better decisions I think you could point the finger\nAt all of those fashion show you know it's a small sample size\nFor what ... showcased so far it's a mix of the lack of execution out of the players\nMental issues in terms of mishaps on the field as well as I'm sure coaching staff members said to themselves maybe they wish they had a player to back\nLands you are around this team you deal with friends on the broadcast you do for the giants\nAre you and the reaction you're getting from giants fan is there a at this point pretty much discussed with the backing juniors antics I mean are people getting tired of his antics on the field\nI think it's a mix I think that probably I Would lean towards more of the majority going towards that their irritated and they're set up and they've had enough\nWhether it be what he said in interviews whether it be to your point the activities on the sidelines but at the end of the day you know they just invested in Oakdale back I'm sure the giants are certainly not in a position where they're going to part ways with him because\nWhat team is all of a sudden they gonna give you a great access to take on a guy that just like a lucrative contract it it's just most teams don't have the luxury to take that deal in\nOn their salary cap restrictions that they're operating which do you know I I think people need to look at this more from a big picture perspective\nThe hotel back him if he made mistakes then he's absolutely made mistakes I think the interview was a bad decision on his part with respect to the ESPN spot but at the same time what he does on the sidelines I Would argue as had no impact whatsoever on the teams production outside of the Josh Norman incident a few years ago in Carolina\nWhen he put himself engage report Josh Norman in danger\nAnd then he was ultimately ... follow it to the Vikings game that you can argue Timmy hurt the team and argue with me though that\nPutting your head up against the football on that or you know showing emotion yelling and screaming is necessarily having a negative impact on the team he's grown men\nYou know they're not necessarily looking it'll go back and for directions to complete a five dark patch or for the defenders to make a stop on third down so I don't see how those things are to nominate one with one another when the fan base gets annoyed I think it's a matter of Dan this team is wanting sick\nThis team I had one playoff preparing since the last one to show both on the two thousand eleven fees and and ... because there's not positive results and when you're irritated and there's not positive results and you're frustrated and you're on the answers it's easy to point the finger at a guy who shows too much emotion on the sideline\nMom sick of his antics forgot to tell you when it's I really am media smack your head down at the helm and it's not fair to them just doing a man smack your head against something that we used to the old days Lance\nYeah well you know in the concussion ever now you've got to be a little bit more careful in terms of how you go about your business and and I understand that people get irritated\nFor you know what I Would argue it's a emotional sport\nAnd at the end of the day it's\nSports entertainment sometimes I feel that people take football a little too seriously I understand we're invested in this we do that sort of living where we're breaking things down we're analyzing it so you know we have to develop opinions but we really going that irate over a guy celebrating in the end zone a little too much\nLike what can be at a few years ago and then what mother wrote a letter to the Panthers complaining that\nWhole model I mean really that either they just want football's all about\nNow I hear today I thought we were supposed to be entertained not to cycle analyze the mental fortitude of players I think that's getting a little too far and a little ridiculous\nI agree with you people think it's a game enjoyed for being a game so I Do on Saturdays and Sundays I enjoy doing their drinking some rooms even healthy wings watching football I don't care if the\nCasing the towns that are coming on\nAnd some of those wings you when you look at it for the fact that some of the ... come on you know this you've seen enough

question\nShe could bring on Michael Jordan you bring up LeBron James Wayne Gretzky other greats of course but no one can fear for years to the one and only Babe Ruth a new book coming out the big fella Babe Ruth and the world he created the author Jane Levy joining us in gene a lot of\nBooks have been written about Babe Ruth I read a lot of them what's different about yours in the sense of what angle are you taking when he talked about that of course the re Babe Ruth\n[noise] so you know that I knew that was going to be the first question everybody out as a result of that I had to come up with a good answer and that's why it took eight years to write this sucker um I actually spent one whole year before I agreed to do it\nReading everything that had been written about him and the one thing that was really clear and striking was that there was nothing about his childhood in any of the books are by ... minimal\nAnd it was I'm curious to me as a reporter like ... what happened you know ... it's just like\nAlmost as if he emerged from St Mary's industrial school they form school but he was sent to on the western edge of Baltimore fully fledged in at in Nineteen fourteen to go to play for the Baltimore Orioles\nSo I suspect that there was a story there and the difference between now and when Bob Kramer roaches fabulous book hadn't marshals smells during ... wagging I'm an even leave him on fill in two thousand six is that\nDigital the digital ... and that's hard to say of 'em all the newspaper archives of papers that are that are still being printed and those that are a defunct as well as state archives\nOf family documents made it possible for me to ferret out the untold story of his childhood which is so much worse it made me as a mom\nJust want to pick up that seven year old boy and hug him because it's the cans and it's ... it's really awful\nJay and you know there's so many stories about Babe Ruth and you wonder how much of it is ... and how much is truth the story I've always heard as he was an orphan grown up in this orphanage in Baltimore that's not the case though is it\nNo in fact there were two minutes one living was an orphan and the only reason people thought that was because people thought St Mary's with an orphanage right wasn't he said it's a reform school\nWe're boys and\nWhat were called incorrigible kids sent by the courts and the ... the other ... you remember about him was that he wasn't incorrigible and that that his parents had gotten some justice of the peace to sign off on a\nOn a on a ... you know can signing him to the school neither of those things is true what is true is this\nHis parents' marriage disintegrated his father caught his wife\nWith his bartender a I'm a dining room for and I'm accused her in in depositions that I was able to locate of trading sexual favors for boos and he accused her of being an alcoholic\nAnd he said um that was that he threw out he had her arrested um and he got a divorce and may Nineteen oh six which was published in the Baltimore Sun\nAnd it was published in the Baltimore American\nAnd yet somehow Babe Ruth ... as a as an adult managed to keep\nThis completely out of print and who blames them\nWho wouldn't want that to be public and so his ... his mother would die in Nineteen twelve of what the birth certificate yet certificate said was exhaustion and also tuberculosis and his father never wants to see him\nWow unbelievable Jane Levy author of the big fella Babe Ruth in the world he created joining us going deep the enforcement NBC Sports radio later life of course he was known to be a womanizer he may have a little too much here and there but I always ready to soft spot in his heart for children is is because of his upbringing\nI think it is um you know he told his daughter Julia roof Stevens only one thing about his childhood and Julia by the way and a hundred and two is going strong a and what he said was I never felt fall and\nThat's both a statement of Couric intake because the brothers around St Mary's only had six cents a day to feed each kid\nBut it was also a a statement of of of a loss of emptiness if you look at his eyes and a lot of the famous pictures they're actually kind of sad and so I think he spent the rest of his life once he realized what was out there to have\nA feeling himself up with beer and food at women and cigars trying to fill in that place that um that emptiness\nBut you know down to ... if I may it's interesting that despite his reputation as a sort of wild man the first thing he did when he got out of St Mary's\nWas not there on a mock but to get married it was an act of complete conformity try to give himself the family that he never had\nThat it didn't work out that he discovered that or you know there was lots of fun to be have in the world is hardly surprising to me\nJean if she wasn't showing incredible baseball skill while at obviously this reform or Tory school what would life has been like for Babe Ruth I mean did baseball season promote a life of who knows what\nWhile they trained him as a tailor and apparently he could make a mean\nCollar and coughing and\nWas very fussy and you know it became very stylish and one of the great\nStories about him and things about him is that this guy was always discover a described as a governor ... became you know quite style and I mean he really dressed and he became in some ways quite polished you know he knew how to hold a teacup with his finger out\nAnd and and which which fork in life\nTo you is that a big dinner I'm so he really did evolve as a person\nAnd he really did a lot to hide his peccadilloes because after twenty five which was the ... here for him in the stomach stomach ache or around the world and when he got suspended by Miller Huggins and find five thousand bucks for staying out all night um he shaped up\nAnd he you know among the many things he did first\nWas hire a trainer hire a sports agent refused

first couple of games now the second game he actually shot well right look it up All right you have it at first and third one great\nAh no no he's considered to be ready for this three for ten three four times three pretend three for eight\nAre you serious yeah he shot well from Freeport early in the first game three for six one for five one for seven one for three he's shooting thirty one point six percent for the field twenty eight point six percent from three point lead is averaging a whopping eight point three point six point seven rebounds playing or digital is twenty seven point seven

a musician\n[laughter] gee the in the straight shot and I mean this is the stuff that he picked up but it was like fifty she'll put it this way oh it's not like a get a belly button ring it thirty just figured out you know he's been involved the music his whole life here's why and look nothing against musicians I respect musicians on not want the judge but when you're James Dolan that you're born with a silver spoon in your mouth you couldn't afford\nTo like pick up music because you're not going to make your living with music right 'cause how many people actually make a living with music\nBut he had a silver spoon or the trust fund it's easy enough to like concentrate on music because money is not the issue like you you don't have to be the hungry starving artist right what's your point well point is okay he picked up your own and they should be\nHe had an opportunity to do it it actually stick with it because the fact that not going to be as primary career to what he's going to try to make money what do you think people\nThat you're rich\nIf you're a musician no the care of the music still my own or do I mean is it easier for him to pick the musical young age and continued with it\nBecause once you get the real world it's like okay I Can't really country my music because I have to make a living to support my family and myself but you don't know what kind of

plus this unique topical pain reliever contains too safe and effective anesthetics nothing as work better for so long pasta ... plus cream or wrong\nI I Would argue that the world series is not really for the entire major league baseball fan base is for those two cities than\nWe do not want to national teams it well those times or ... or ... or even right in the world showcased so you got Dodger fan in law does\nHe have dug her fans in Boston they are going to stay up to watch that game ... wait a minute but here's the thing the super bowl doesn't draw a hundred million viewers because you only have the fame to those two teams this is kind of Super Bowl is a different ones for today is a sport\nThe sports showcase for baseball the number one showcases the world series you don't want to gear or just for the two fan base do you think\nThe ratings would be better if they usually baseball started the game at seven or nine rather eight or nine\nIf I'm not saying the ratings and what I Hope to make you know I don't I'm not I'm not saying that no I don't care about the ratings what I'm Talking about is alienating the next generation of baseball fans 'cause you don't have an extra reason\nTo start a game and a seven or nine more kids would watch yes watched the game yes they're not going to start watching a game that they know there are no remotely nowhere near going to be able to why now I Do\nAgree with that because baseball is boring I loved it I play it but it's boring to watch I think that's so kids aren't what you can start this game it to you know twelve o'clock in the afternoon nobody the language down time\nBut you have to but you have to at least make an effort baseball does make an effort to try to draw the young\nCrowd I don't I think Ron known Fred now that's not true that Ken griffey junior um add just one example I have never hip yeah boy trying but he's not trying to make baseball Morehead heavy juniors now young wants the ad I saw it\nYeah they're just trying to make the the baseball more hip by saying that you know the the unwritten rules you know don't like shut these kids down for you know\nCelebrating and whatever and making them or have that to baseball trying to go that route and Robin for the commissioner of ... and I'll be has gone on record saying that time of play the titans times with games is concerned and he's tried to come out and say yeah we've\nUh they're shorter by two minutes to remember that yeah so this is on his radar so he does care\nI don't I don't think he cares because if major league baseball care they'll get rid of these these holdouts announcers that's number one\nAround here and they just lay there on the news saying that they're old and a man had there was no fall don't have a weight lifted I'd rather too often I hear Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz they're supposed to be have\nI done every day but he says is bling bling year pieces in the honestly that does nothing for me I mean that's not hip and cool that you know I think don't here's the problem okay the problem is if baseball is having to resort to that that's a problem\nI don't think baseball but there are these going to be a whole family\nAlex Rodriguez it would be a hall of famer as well if it wasn't for the steroid mouth he's the product that but but that's why they're on that panel and they were great baseball players in the ... and ... he's one of the of our generation one of the gap there I sort of be a panel in terms of promoting it they are they're on the panel though that because they're hip\nI think it helps ... and she's with a prominent baseball player and he'll hop but he was right there that that would be hip but he's he's he's like baseball I don't know who he is\nYeah I don't think kids ... big Papi is are they do is not a problem though are basically based right when he's on on there to draw kids to to watch baseball so I Hope there when it gets in my family is baseball ... what is baseball during a drug it's\nNot doing nothing nothing they can do really haven't started here okay that\nDopey commercial that they came out of ... and ... and then they had that there\nAre kids they had a rapper then right not all that and that's all they want to see\nWhat else can I just started ... kids can actually one that's going to make a difference yeah actually you don't want kids to doubt after ten minutes to go watch a video game then you said you're talking ... years soccer will be more popular the more boring but you don't want to be what America gets onto that they will not watching soccer to board\nWho actually came to our done two hours and Don Wright provided soccer's incredibly boring you know what you're saying but yeah it's our people located and buy a house and he's going to take over\nIn fifty years will be a long time soccer now whereas baseball can be fifty years\nHorseracing [laughter]\nYou're like you guys are going to watch them down yeah older white guy crowd like they gotta get read as all that all white guys are going to watch it that's it\nAin't going to die and that it was simply buying off is a chore it's like homework has got status and we're going to be off in nursing homes that is going to be a baseball fan base they plan to do it there is nothing you can go there to me is just dealt with the games it's a different type of game\nAnd it's on the ballot in the NBA made for this generation and it's because we'd have to get more you know you go\nPeople still look the strike outs up the walks people that are the ones they shouldn't wait there's no\nThere's no attention span baseball has given up that's what they've done they've given up yeah but you know what race regional ratings have never been better\nYou know kind of just lower you ask you this tendency lower here in New York City football baseball when the Yankees are winning and we're joined by winning but that's because it's a classic city I'm just saying and what how many if he's alive at LA right what's real popular NFL football or Dodger baseball Lakers no but much more popular here on the lake but other than I Am today\nThere there are many years

F. HR it's time now for the morning magazine brought to you by comfort air heating cooling plumbing\nNow with the morning magazine here is Carl hill\nThank you Jerry on good morning everyone and welcome to today's show on AM Thirteen twenty and streaming live at WNPR dot com we also walk them or buddy Jessie from Wisconsin Rapids community media who is a recording this and the high definition for viewing on their finding website\nAs well as on your local public access cable channel to channel depending on what system you're on the reason it's time for our monthly with Tony visit with the county board chairman Doug mind good morning sir\nGood morning Carl okay so [laughter]\nSo um I guess we might as well I've been asking all the public office all about this and we just\nTalked about it pre show but you get your reaction to the big news and beer in a recently about the expansion and the the big investment that's coming to Wake County and then in the paper industry\nVery very excited about that ah that number a hundred and eighty nine million is the number I haven't heard for capital investment and paper mills for a while a day in and specially in beer and and uh I think that shows some real commitment by nine dragons or to that meal ah it shows some commitment to the community\nAnd those are big numbers for for capital projects I I think I haven't I I remember the days from my days in a paper industry and that's a good number or I think it it tells us a lot about what they want to do their and their commitment not only did the uh to the industry and what that milk can do for them but for the to the community\nFrom basically it sounds like a night or they are filling a need with this paper board that they're going to be manufacturing for all the packaging that the as needed for all the online selling that's happening\nYeah I I think it's very proactive thinking on on their part part I mean they're talking about converting a paper machine from from\nTwo completely probably opposite mediums everyone from find paper machine NPR converted to to produce a packaging material a that's a that's a big conversion a I compare to what a dime tired to get a few years back with there are a number sixty six machine act on when they took their biggest paper machine and converted to fluff\nPulp and those are people that are thinking a proactively uh their their head of the game and they're and they're doing the right thing\nIn many ways I've talked about this with other all ... uh that the death of a plastic as the rebirth of paper we're hearing the re introduction of paper straws and stuff like that\nAnd we are we're taking care of the environment too it's yeah it's a win win it it's really exciting I remember the day that uh uh the the public relations a lady from beer and called me in and to let me know that that announcement was coming I was I was running all over the courthouse telling people holy cow a hundred and eighty nine million dollars I haven't heard that number for a long long time that's old time stuff from back\nBig we're seeing that in the city here in the city converting street lighting if anybody has driven down the river beer expressway saying the new lights they're not bad ugly yellow type thing there though\nHot bright white I fish in CLA de lights up in that sense of municipalities governments local governments are going all over the country into that type of lighting\nAfter actual and rightfully so\nAreas has has come a\nMiles and the fact is a as a county I think we're relate to the game\nThere I I think there's I I think there's really good opportunities for us there and I think that we need to explore those and see if we can do I I'll take I'll give an example I just had sold or put on my shoulder electricity put in my house and what what is going to do for me economically fiscally a it's a no brainer\nIt's an it's an old writer what it's gonna save me and it pays for itself\nQuickly uh and it's gonna pay me money went when I looked at the cost of it and the pay back on it I'm thinking why wouldn't they do this town is\nCrazy not to interfere actually just finishing up the system today as a matter of fact are\nGood for you looked up or if you're just joining us on the morning magazine welcome our monthly visit today with what county board chairman duct behind one of the things you talked about too was looking at revenue streams and and uh\nYou know making sure that there is particular services they're only use by a certain segment of the population that that pop that segment is paying for it rather than\nAll taxpayers are there are some examples of that and the budget\nYeah I think there is I think we are going to have a high tech I mentioned this last month as well and ... and Chad school he was heavily involved in that because he's got a number of you knew the related programs within the parks department for him we talked about some things like a premium camping time\nWhich makes sense absolutely and and and why wouldn't it because in in the private sector everybody likes to compare government in private private business well here's a perfect example it's I think I made this point last last month during the water ski show I don't think the motels or change charging the same rate that they\nDo on on Tuesday night and a write in February but a a\nR this weekend when you have all the other state cross country made\nAll big went to ... I forget about that that is a huge there that is huge yeah that's a great a that's a win for this area that's that we can pull those date meats and a lot of ... a lotta motel in hotel space gets a eaten up\nAnd they have an typically in that industry and the hospitality industry for major events there's an up tick in the price and why because there's high demand [laughter]\nYeah I Know when I go to copper harboring the fault of fish if I happen to uh pick a weekend when there's a a biking event up there uh my rooms usually about a Fifteen or twenty dollars more that weekend so\nSo you get one so the proposal in the budget will be for something similar in terms of camping fees and would count as it\nThere'll be something like that probably a and not only that but maybe you know if you're going to stay there for the weekend of the water ski show you're gonna have to book a week you know be a lot of those teams are there a week early to begin with and and so I don't think that's a in a ...\nAnd we also along those lines since we've opened up some county we've or the boards given the approval to open up some county roadways for HDTV traffic ... uh there's going to be some dedication of for camping spot checked extra for that are going to lend themselves to a TV campers\nUh they're going to be on the fringe you're going to be set up for a TV usage in a marriage and there'll be some kind of I don't know what she has got in mind there or what the\nWhat the her committee has in mind there but I'm assuming that there is going to be some kind of premium on that ah and we're gonna see how that's gonna work out I think that has some possibilities is well\nWhat about these were like Frisbee Frisbee ... there's going to be a slight fee it's not it's not anything that's going to make a difference in the budget but again they take it ... it costs them it there's a cost to maintain those those facilities or you're taking away some park space for a specific you\nI don't think charging somebody a buck or two to to throw Frisbee up throw around affairs Frisbee golf is a a you know intolerable by by anyone I Would think that if they want to go one good facilities and want them kept up properly that it's not a problem\nWhat about in terms of the last couple of budget so the big thing was\nWell you know the county went in and did borrowing ... and they said we can't afford to wait for the state to get its act together we have to get a get to work on our roads and bridges and you\nWith the interest rates being low at the time there was this site let's finances and get this work done where are we in that process we\nBonded a lot less this year we bonded at a ... we bonded for about three points for four or five million a\nAnd we still got a good rates the rates ... those ... the body and rates are going away they're not going to be as attractive as they were once we're there still don't get me wrong they're still they're still good and it's it's not a bad deal for the county but\nThe pendulum has swung back now so you you certainly want to look down the road and and try to get yourself out of that paradigm of annual bonding or at least limited to somewhat there's always gonna be things you want a bond for because there's things that you want to do right away and you don't always have the the\nOn hand to to do those things and you have to mine uh we're at the end I'm told by our our our highway commissioner that we're at pretty much at the end of our remedial work on our highways show that probably a lessons to pressure to bond as far as what we have to do now and roads\nSo hopefully if that's the case we buy and even\nFor less next year or maybe we can uh that opens it freezes up to to put some bonding and for some things that we that or we want to have we don't need to have it but we we think would be good for the county um\nSome examples I I think the powers bluff project is is probably one of the long term\nAnd that's an economic development project too because what it can do for tourism\nI agree I agree I I couldn't agree with you more and I I I think that's a whole area that that will walk down that road and hopefully we'll get get after early in the next year I'm going to be with our our uh her chairman a Adam Fisher from Marshfield uh we're going to get together and I I think we're going to\nUh I Would like to\nGet some input from the mayors of Marshfield in Wisconsin Rapids I think that can be a much broader approach meant just powers and pull off\nA ... that whole biking thing is just blowing up and uh\nIt's something that I again I think it can be an asset to the county\nMayor Bloomberg like here in terms of Wisconsin Rapids that kinda stuff works right in with what the city has been doing in terms of developing the trail system here and that's all and everyone tells you if you want to attract work even I have talked about this and every I've talked from people across the political spectrum all all agree\nThat if you want to attract young workers is not about the cost of living or whether it's the quality of living and people want to live in a place where they have\nAccess to have a recreational activities ... I mean they are they are looking a lot differently than in the past\nYeah and we and we've talked about that before those those ... young people today think a lot differently than they did when we were kids they don't chase jobs they don't change jobs do they want a lifestyle and it's very important to them uh\nAnd so you I Love with the city said he's done with the bike trails I mean if you think about a year now when the when there's a first piece of the of that\nPlan is put together you're going to basically be able to\nPark your car and get on your bike and beer in the right it's an ocean back without touching a road which I mean which is a very I I Know as an old guy\nMy wife and I when we bike I like to stay on the trails are off the road I don't like to ride my bike on the road because you know what there's if you get the wrong person coming down the road taxed and you're kind of sitting duck out there so I'm I'm a I'd rather write a trail through the woods and you ask me I'll\nUh I'll stay on those trails and or in the woods like at a at a powers boss project on a on a single track or something like\nThat and then with the power is bluff we should also note a for our listeners and viewers this is not going to be a public private partnership with their friends are the people doing fundraising\nUh yeah I and I don't know how that a particular a paradigm is gonna is gonna shake out okay um\nI I Know that I think as a county were somewhat committed to that uh regardless of how we do it okay um what extent we get partnerships you know we're certainly going to look for them that that's for sure uh I I think a big piece of that project for me what I'm excited about\nIt and nobody talks about besides the biking is there is a cultural piece there\nThere's a cultural piece there for the uh the whole chunk in the ... I've I've talked to Larry Walker who's or a representative for the district representative for the for the whole chunk and I said you know what we're going to tell that I Want to tell that story we'll come kill story that's important too would county uh and uh I Want that to be a piece of that\nUh because that story needs to be told and people need to hear that that's a great a great story so I think that's a part of that project to have a cultural center on the way I see it they have a cultural center out there all along with the bike trails and everything else that we're looking at would be great it would be Greenville\nWhere that goes right into people who are into a historical tourism history as a ... a very popular tourism or the driver and people are to love to go to history places ...\nAh with the skills and the abilities and the the great um energy that people with disabilities often bring to a workplace and I think people maybe underestimate\nSometimes we all do underestimate what a person might be able to do and so sometimes these trial work experience this temporary work experiences give that employer like wow\nThis person's great their show up every day on time they have a enthusiasm need they listen and pay attention and they do what I asked him to do and they do a great job\nOne could hire him for it happens a lot it doesn't always happen but I'm so Arbor what has been great about doing that um to give us a chance to let somebody trial to job and I'm sure that they have been one of the employers that has said\nI'm going to hire that person right so order flirt with your employer or yeah and they they also recognize and work with us on the learning curve so you know old he's he's part in all of this isn't just getting the person they're it's providing the support we have job coaches that are excellent in helping that training process we're in\nIt's time to spend with the person to take a longer a learning curve that might be a little longer\nSo our our staff are there as needed in those early stages and then our hope is that is the person gets better and better at the job we can back away we're still not far away you know we're just a phone call away or a text or the person can call us or the employer can call us this year right\nThis person's learning a new task can you come and spend some time with them on this or this person is having a difficult time on something they had maybe been good at it and maybe there's something happening that's changed a coworker manager or whatever so we can step back in which is the beauty of our supported employment program to be able to\nBe there but not really be physically always there\nI think that's a big thing too for their for business was thinking of doing this and that there is a support system there right so you're not going you're nut diving in by yourself mhm there's someone there or do you see is standing there who were or re health coaches that can help with this process\nGreat so it is it's a it's a three way partnership to personally employer an OTC working together to make sure that whatever needs to happen to to create that success were there for that so\n[laughter] uh before going to break her number one\nSure we have our our partnership award which is really um intended for anybody or any organization or any individual um that might\nOf China above and beyond and helping OTC what's our mission so it doesn't have to be an employer doesn't have to be a business I'm In this this year our partnership award\nIs a business and um anytime fitness um I didn't realize how extensively spread out anytime fitness is but they're in every community were in\nSo they've been an employer in every community that were in we have right now I'm eight individuals in the um eight individuals total I'm Sorry to in the Wisconsin Rapids location\nOne in the Marshfield location ... up I'm Sorry to in the Marshfield location my notes are are sketchy here [laughter] one in Steven's point\nAnd then one in a two and ... grill any of those locations and because there are of a franchise and they've got some commonalities between all of them I think there's a great culture that's been built\nFor being very inclusive in their staffing so most jobs within a fitness facility would either be\nCleaning sanitizing and making that place great for the people coming in or trainers there's not a lot of other things so most of the positions are in that area of making the facilities very clean and making the equipment clean and making sure that um people are welcome and they've got the tolls that they need all of those things\nAnd they've just been excellent in again\nWorking with the person from where they're at and really I'm supporting them being a natural good support if if the person needs a ride to work at times one of their staff members has been willing to do that so they're willing to um provide that support and they're just extremely positive when we gave the award to them you could see\nThe reporter between them and the individuals that they're employing is very natural Gary is and a lot of joking around and a lot of you can just tell that that's a place where people are going to enjoy working\nOr are we going to take record breaking and we're going to continue saying thank you and I'm Talking about awards and partnerships during our opportunity developments centers are updated here on the morning magazine back with more right after this [noise]\n\n[noise] and joined us\nThursday evening which a five year from Wisconsin

studying forty one here at a young Thirteen to ...\nIn the morning magazine in part to we're getting our opportunity developments centers update them Ross's here and we're saluting partnerships in the like and you had another one of the\nTrade we actually had a tie this year for partnership award and we decided rather than having the tie go to the the winter they were both winter so or other really really strong partner is Lincoln high school I'm\nIn a number of ways but it it first started with her project search here in Wisconsin Rapids this was I think we're in our fourth or fifth year there and\nAs a ... he was working to get this program going what we needed to do was determined with\nThe schools be on board with that would we have a place where this this internship program could happen and when we approached Lincoln high school they were immediately\nVery excited to get involved in is sold his program is for high school students with disabilities were in their last year of high school to get them out into a real work situation and get some really hands on experience in internships and to be able to get that experience so then they could become unemployed right after they graduated from high school\nSo um I remember presenting to the rapid school I'm bored this program and what it meant for the school district was that they really had to invest in\nSupporting us financially because the teacher that is part of of this program is from the school district or turn their position at us virus river hospital that's our other partner in this there there was a classroom in a classroom of of students of anywhere from eight to twelve students\nAnd a run Rasmussen in particular at Lincoln has been stellar I Can't say enough good about his positive approach to this and his support of\nOf the program he's gone to some much of the training so he's been hands on involved and stuff ... is the instructor that is a dedicated to full time to project search so these students get just the best of the best they get great teacher and they get great work experiences so Lincoln has also been working with us I'm\nWith a their transition program which is designed

sometimes\nThese are much similarity between what he's doing now than personal life than you know in the last time we competed go you go back to Denver and\nDallas uh he was on Leno when I was in New Orleans so there's there's a lot of opportunities that um love had a chance to compete against the way in his defense so yeah there's definitely some similarities but it's\nA specific to their players you know the in the design of putting those guys and could positions and he's always done that in in all sorts and there was always evolution that goes on in\nThe pet scans all kinds of games too so that that affects some of the patterns of the coverage is the name of your\nYour dream intrusion is\nAs opposed to travel\nHe's got a lot of it's the basics but it's you know it's built into our scheduling um will have a\nActivation workout up there you know start Saturday which we're a big part of\nYou know moving the jet lag through and things like that just you know a lot of lot of basic slow general rules and all of a sea being increased a hydration leaning into the flight you know one bottle water for every hour on the flight so I'm just just just uh we we refer to as the basics\nRight now and the weekend before getting out there to prepare for that she\nHad thing I'd just answered it I'm just staying staying on top of the basics and then I think moving to schedule up a day will help us because you know have the\nWhoever you know Thursday tomorrow will you know help cover abbreviated Saturday type schedule on friday and love I'm probably not bringing in an added an additional ... will do a little more work here on friday and then we would do on a Saturday or so later flight out there so that they can\nGet everybody can get through a hotel room that could have dinner and then you get to bed at a reasonable reasonable hour you know an overseas go at the time change and going to get up there on Saturday morning and then we'll work from nine to noon and then we'll be back on a normal schedule you know as far as\nA normal Saturday our guys are done at noon on Saturdays and then our next meeting time Hussein thirty on a Saturday Night\nLive\n\n\nWasn't as do they do they passed to set up their own\nI Do think they they're run game is the is the key and what makes them go when they do they have a lot of\nYou know actually passes right off of that is a good job of marrying the action past games that are run game and by the building to throw the football field so but I think like I'm any good often you know I Would think they start with Ron game you know\nIf you're you're probably but just based on our numbers but we always start with the rug game as far as installing can we build up from their\nNumbers wise you're throwing a lot you're running backs compared to some other teams that just your philosophy is not that high and you're listening to something about the way you run off into the limits on how much you can do that or what do you think those numbers are I guess\nThat gets to the product to really kind of all the games there and I think he moved through schemes and um you know it was a big part of how to utilize ... getting into routes you know whether it's free access a we have we call hot access for that protection responsibility or\nThey're involved in a in a protection scheme and then release up pretty I began so those are specific to each and every game plan\nWas on the reserves and he was\nThe decision was this was made that that he needed to go through the rehab you know so no\n\nPretty good ... years ago nobody hundred on a few guys cured all three more knowledge or possibly the underdog letting us know I'd\nI'd I don't buy that have a lot of the dress that um you know obviously when you get into those types of things I think it's just it's supposed to avoid it you know\nWhat is a pretty strict gambling\nPolicy still place in the NFL so what is the line do\nYou take\nA million just\nShut down the\nLine\nOr we talked about it I'm at something play time it's something that we do as a whole coaching staff every month part of our grading system and\nA valuation process so and\nYou know especially going through the by we can sell Scott thought or wherever it um you know and also you got to travel that if you got to be aware of you know going into these next four weeks so that we are going work for on top of it\nWas\nGoing to be one of\nTeams\nWere last yeah that's that's usually where it goes I mean when we go around the room and and we talk about uh\nYou know multiple will grade to the normal Monday schedule for us as well as well being as a staff and we'll go through all the grades of the Sundays contest and then we'll have a projection of how we think we're going to play the upcoming game and so we we kind of lay out an act of formula on how we think is who's going to project\nAnd then really until Tuesday mid afternoon where the training room has a handle on on what they think Wednesday so look like and so it's a it's an ongoing process uh but they did the priority is the office of coaches the office of players involved the fence and playing defense of players involved\nIn the sense of planning and then ultimately you know the special team responsible\nGot one who's broken up and say the opposite of usual\nUm Green Bay Packers getting ready to take on a LA and go out to LA and take on the rams and we can get in that discussion is it begins the gauntlet of five games in which they're going to need to win I Believe for\nMeanwhile you've got the brewers heading into it off season which they get a chance to relax a couple of weeks guys went home to families probably planting some vacation time going to get away and come back run around Thanksgiving\nAnd you start to get back to work start to get back in the routine to start to work on what it is that you lack this season and then after that you get through the holidays and poor before you know at pitchers and catchers are going to be reporting here in February so you're not that far off\nThere for months away\nEight five five eight three zero eight six forty a lot of people this one's from Bonnie\nWho says that I Believe that the Milwaukee Brewers are going to get one big name starting pitcher in and fill in the bullpen with the rest give everybody an opportunity and take the best north I don't think they are going to force young guys to fill the roles when maybe they're just not ready\nUm which could very well happen well they had no problem forcing young guys and that they had also yes no or the I don't know I think some of those young guys are ready I completely agree\nThey didn't it they didn't extend anybody so maybe they do after a starter but we'll see I mean if they don't they're gonna have to fortify the bullpen one way or the other they're going to pick up pitching but you just wonder where it's going to go but I Do not expect them to be breaking the bank on anybody\nAdrian says the number one need right now is to figure out what's going on at second base um [noise] I like what they're doing over there I was traveling showered remain only if they keep ... but I Can't see paying him upwards of ten to Fifteen million dollars maybe seven million and that would be fine I ... ... is not staying here for seven million dollars\nJust enough why he's made he's not sticking around for that\nA robber rights do you think that Craig council gets off for another job and what about David Stern now councils on the contract I mean so as David Stern David Stern has already um what was it San Francisco I think one of the permission to talk to him and and market them as you said no so\nThere are teams that will come knocking because they want would you have but\nBecause they're you know that they want to do the same thing they want to rebuild the farm system they want to be able to do it in an economical fashion that toward the team makes money you can keep watching the seat you can be transparent with fans and\nThen in rather than waiting five and six and seven years you can you can go ahead and turn things around if you're not completely bereft of talent in minor league system you can turn it around and maybe three years and that's what a lot of franchise is looking to do\nSo we'll see you be crazy not to come over and least try to grab somebody out of the system to say hey can you ah can you give us the insight and recommend will we need to do to fix our ball club\nI don't expect David started to go anywhere I don't expect great council to go anywhere everybody's going to be back next year the nucleus of the team's going to be back next year and the grand scheme of things\nEight five\nFive eight three zero eight six for a sham says I think this team is going to drop off some guys had career years this year\nAnd the arms can't hold up the way they did if they continue to use the pending the same fashion I Love with Craig council did\nBecause he was in a win now mentality but ultimately I think it hurt some of these players that were going to see arm injuries next year which means we're going to lose and pitching and not win as many games I hate to be the Debbie Downer but very rarely can you come back the next season and repeat or the Dodgers just did it\nHouston just got back to the Arabs see as it's not like you can't come back and get this far\nWinning it's different\nBut if you tweak a few things you get another health a year out again and yell at you you manage Braun and Travis job bounces back to what he had a couple of years ... years ago average wise in our series starts to world on fire by coming out the firing on all cylinders the way he went down in the postseason\nIt's a drastically different teams so why not you're talking about the same players virtually the same ability\nWhy not\nMike writes ah the Green Bay Packers are coming back from LA with a loss we all know what no one will positively stay I'm saying it right now\nHis team is not that good and they're being exposed Mike mccarthy is a terrible head coach it has been for a long time and Brian good against is no more than a lapdog protect Thompson this organization needs to be completely cleaned out I Would love to see somebody have the whole needs to do it I used a different word there\nTo do it and get rid of the stupid board all they are are glorified sponsors they get a chance to sit there fat blanks in a seat and say that they're on the board do something good with our money we're the ones that paid for this crap task team the Green Bay Packers sucking well for a long time the only thing good about him is Aaron Rodgers and you're wasting his career\nWow wow\nThat's skating that's a little bit over the top will drama filled give us a shot if you agree\nDisagree whatever it's wide open at this point\nAh Tom writes I'm ... cleared out some of these emails Tom says I think the Packers can get away and I think they need to be firing on all cylinders offensively just to keep up but I think this team has enough the fence to sustain their not ever going they are not ever that she's going to be a top ten defense but they can be a top Fifteen let's cross our fingers or you go talk so times bringing the optimism\nGood stuff for top final statement\nAbout Michael show coming
