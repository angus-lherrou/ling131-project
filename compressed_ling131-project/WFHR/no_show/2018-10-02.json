yesterday and\nI'm not a Cleveland Browns fan but\nIt can be taken games away the themes\nAnd then of course has come out and that the decision that absolutely screwed the browns yesterday in the\nFive to forty two overtime that looked at the grounds that other opportunities to win this game I kept screwing up the defense fell apart\nOffensively overtime they didn't do enough the raiders get the when John grew in his first one in ten years but you don't like to see a game that the officials to appoint play a major role in the outcome\nAnd what happened was with a minute thirty eight seconds left in a forty two thirty four game the browns are leading\nAnd Carlos Hyde gets a true yard games the brands Nineteen yard line\nThey measure and sure enough the browns have a first down referee wall to Anderson as much of veteran as you're going to find in the NFL to first down and just like that or less the browns miraculously turn the ball over they pretty much round the clock at that point first down minute thirty eight\nTo go so everybody thought that that puts the central replay command in New York three thousand miles away from Oakland\nThen calls for a measurement review if it's under two minutes of either half from New York the NFL central replay commands can call for a review of a measurement okay they can\nThere's a delay next thing you know wall theaters and gets on the you know the the intercom whatever it is and says quote elbow was down shore to the Nineteen yard line they spot the ball the team yard line\nThey signal a fourth down now dean blend dino who's a Fox Sports broadcast contributor now the former NFL officiating czar\nThis is what he said on the broadcast quote I don't see any way they can change this call on the field is it the way you know who used to be responsible for exactly what happened\nNo land goes were offered that showed a full view of where the ball was once Carlos Hyde was down the NFL comes out and said that the league pieced together two angles\nTo figure out where his wrist in elbow hit the ground and that was before the ball reached the Nineteen so they're saying is the NFL took to replace combined them\nTo make this ruling\nIs what they said quote from the line feed you can see the line to gain is just passed the Nineteen yard line or a replay angle shows his wrist and the elbow hit the ground simultaneously\nThen when you go back to the line feed you see the risk to the ground new you know the elbow is down at that point you're able to clearly see that the ball is short of the line to game here's my problem with this if it comes down to where you have to piece together to replace to figure it out\nThat means that human I obviously can't see that in fact every angle didn't showed until you took two and apparently put them together\nIf you have to go to great lengths like that you have to keep the call the field honestly I think it's ridiculous if you're going to call down you're looking for something that right you're looking to see if there's something there like you're going out of your way to make sure ... you are now taking replaced combining him to figure it out\nTo me that's going above and beyond what replaced should be\nAnd if you tell me elbow and rest and head you've now completely take it out the humid out by the way we've seen calls that have not been reverse because it's not clear enough on replay right how many times that we've seen that because it's irrefutable evidence to reverse the call\nIf they at first call that he was short that's one thing if the replay they can't determine that he got the ball the Nineteen yard line fine I get it\nBut if you have to piece together replace turn first to call that's going too far\nAnd that to me is where the proud got absolutely screwed up the NFL is looking for a way for the Oakland Raiders get an opportunity one last opportunity for John grew into with himself a damn game that I don't believe a conspiracy theories and I know people have said that I highly doubt the NFL sat\nThere behind closed doors and said we got a hand the game the group but I also don't understand why they would apparently think that they needed to screw the Cleveland Browns out of a with\nTraditional is totally ridiculous\nAnd I just think that when you have to go to great lengths like this to figure it out\nThat's above and beyond it's too much ground to force a ... they were obviously forced upon\nAnd tied the game Derek car seven you're a touchdown pass the jar to buy me a great great ... great catch ... and gets a to point conversion then you know ... on your order and overtime and look the grounds that opportunities they blew it\nBut I don't like to see the aftermath gave determined the way it was I mean that to me I mean Shawn we've all seen the replay numerous times I\nDon't know how you could reverse that feel that call in the field I really have no idea how you can reverse that being said Baker Mayfield said it was his fault the last saw him do you agree for turtles well no here's weight lead\nWere his fault the two interceptions I I Can't put on one of them was like one of those like\nHe's down the field try to make a play to to not have the game but over time right so that one one out but that's it and it's like a Hail Mary kind of thing the other one Antonio Callaway seemed to go the wrong way they definitely didn't help out Baker made you know that just Baker may feel being a leader and the quarterback of the team he's just got to shoulder the play put it on himself\nLook I mean the jets yesterday were slammed their defense was awfully gave the most yards in ten years but then Donald said that he's the ... you know like he he didn't get anything done so the losses on him any good leader of a quarterback is going to take the blame regardless of what the outcome is just Austin's on hill knocking\nGroup effort I mean did you eat those events did not pick up the off every hundred wind radiate yards allowed to bigger or ...\nOr the jet you're saying yeah yeah absolutely the defense well look the office to get anything done either we expect that right but you don't may play board does look like Tom Brady I Walk I'm watching the scanner thinking boy boy was Thirteen or fourteen right now for like a hundred and fifty yards\nEverything he did the guys are wide open there's no defensive coverage underneath mean shoot you know train Johnson's your big money guys are good quarterback is sixty Seventy yard touchdown against him come on but where's the defense\nI have no idea they got you know they they they stopped poodles twice in the first half facts I haven't been a problem for the jets is your work life here they've gotten to the quarterback second I think I'm going to the quarterback look I mean just to build a far superior team right now I mean the Jacksonville Jaguars\nWhat seems like the jets are the bills with the browns want to be they want to build with a good nucleus the young players the draft but they also want to be smart and free agency ... Campbell as one of the greatest free agent signings in ten years\nThis guy is been I mean you know he was good at the cardinals\nHe might have thought more years this yeah he was like twenty eight twenty nine I think when they sign right wasn't like some young really young player\nAll pro first the fourteen an ... he's been beat this year [noise] bottom line is he's been great that the New York and they had a better quarterbacks boils is it going to do it again that's even easily be the best team they ask you we haven't talked about is actually the best thing they have the patriots were back

Films are time [noise]\nLet's do it's let's see what you ought to come and gone on it's got side and bring it on my mind All right here yeah let's Cincinnati thirty seven thirty six winter's over Atlanta what's your one take away from Nike where's the latest defense that's my take on understand they've lost both their safety but\nIt wasn't as if they're playing great defense with their safety is healthy back yard of Neal went down the first week of the season but this is the Cincinnati Bengals we're talking about okay not exactly a juggernaut off as this is the defense right now that is killing Atlanta\nOffensively that's going a ton of points but if the defense doesn't shape up they're not going to they're not going very far in the postseason if they keep given up thirty plus points a game\nAll right let's move on Green Bay shutdown buffalo twenty two to nothing what's your one takeaway from this game ... just not that good\nI tell you what I listen to Josh Josh Alice terrible but he was he was what you expected it to be a rock\nBut here's what I take away from that game\nThe bills had opportunities to pick up Aaron Rodgers Aaron Rogers was not good in this game\nAnd although the scores twenty two to nothing you have to sit there and say well the Packers are great they did\nThere was the bills had opportunities to make plays defensively they did not make Aaron Rodgers does not look at the same guy he's obviously banged up\nAnd at twenty two nothing this could've been worse than the Packers often that we are accustomed to seeing showed up I was not impressed by the Packers even in this when All right let's move on the tip of the bucks walked up playing catch to Chicago migrants for eight to ten\nAs you know ms which will be ski six touchdown pass but then I don't want to lead lead you won't hear what's your take away from this year he can make place I'll tell you know what I'm Wondering if\nThe bears over the last year and three games before this one\nHave been protecting him too much I mean they let them arid out he may place he made some very nice throws me make throws I'm surprised she was able to make because\nHe's been nothing but just the guy who was first Fifteen NFL starts but he made some place where I thought to myself you know what I've never seen this from ... if he can consistently make that he's an upper echelon quarterbacks I have to admit now buccaneers defensive terrible but I have to admit that Michel ... was in fact impressive in this game that's my take away\nOkay the patriots\nDemolish and just cream the Miami Dolphins thirty seven one takeaway from this getting their back\nPatrons are back you know the doctors were three you know there are ten ten in one of his last loving starts\nThe pages Donnelly one they dominated\nThey get Julian Edelman back now right I mean this is a team that's having the right direction this is a team that went from a devastating horrendous loss were Brady played a terrible game against Detroit to within literally a week actually a little less than a week to turning it around and winning the game and this fashion\nThis is why even though the patriots don't have the names on all things outside of Brady and ... you could never count him out you saw the reason why right here\nTennessee gets by the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles twenty six twenty three in overtime you're one takeaway very as a Super Bowl hangover there's no question about it this is not the same eagles team that won the super bowl Tennessee's not a great team to give up that big fourth and sixteen play while playing prevent defense\nThey just don't have that killer instinct right now that they show throughout the postseason into the super bowl last year to beat the patriots vicious exactly why it's hard to repeat because you just see it's a different team the names might be similar and even better at times\nBut the eagles are not the same team we saw that in this game Jacksonville overwhelms the jets thirty one to twelve you want to take away\n[noise]\nAnd the jets the jets or what I thought I mean they're young they don't have enough talent the you know if anybody thought based on that opener against Detroit to the jets were something else they've come back down to earth they have a young quarterback they have a young defense\nThey can have a high draft pick a lot of money to spend that they're just not that good of a football team this was the jets not what you saw week one cowboys last so the lines twenty six twenty four they scare really luckily win that game you want to take away\nIf you established around Prescott better\nYou know you give us the kill your feet a memory he does this thing feeding your feet on the ball twenty five carries for a hundred and fifty two yard it opens up the often they don't have a lot of weapons on a wide receiver\nBut if you have that threat of a running game because you establish that run as they did you open it up for dad Prescott who played much better and I don't think it's a correlation he played much better with the fact\nThat is ... finally got apple carries\nMoving on Texans escape in Indianapolis thirty seven thirty four in overtime bill of rights lucky bill of rights should be open for\nAlmost blew that game that what it Eighteen point lead or something they almost blew in this game that's correct you know ... ... you're right they did blood and they have to come back in overtime in wind because Frank right decided to go for that a fourth downplay here's what it what it all comes down to bottom line is this\nThe Houston Texans have a lot of problems they didn't solve it in this game they just continue that the ... even though they finally got their first one of the Steve are you just talked about this game if you want to skip over ... forty five forty two over Cleveland and all the time\nBut this year and to me to to determine the outcome a game embarrassing Seattle ... Seventeen winter's over Arizona\nMy one takeaway is Arizona's as bad as I thought it was clearly in the Congress Asia or where I'm you know I mean that that you know look if they go to Josh Rosen smart move you got to go to the rest of the way it is going to be growing pains obviously but Arizona's just terrible team\nThey are up there with the bills and the jets in terms of the conversation for worst team in football chargers get by the forty niners twenty nine twenty seven\nThe forty niners play better than I thought that I mean twenty seven\nI'm surprised by that interesting so I you know what maybe the right to say we're not going to go out and and bringing the quarterback from elsewhere will stay with Egypt bathrooms you we have a guy that started a couple of games those last year I was surprised at forty seven point\nI was a surprise you didn't mention Melvin Gordon he ran for a hundred yard that an average like six point nine or ... summarize yet not going to happen again for a New Orleans thirty three Eighteen over the New York football giants you're one take away\nThe giants often says hideous and I don't know why I Can't figure out you lie manning has still managed to appoint there's enough name recognition they have not figured out a way to utilize back and junior ... how impossible as that and\nShe said one Barkley is getting nothing to run through we had one twenty eight year old gay and I guess but besides that really didn't do too much that giants all fences an apt and ... supposed to be offensive guy right well he's a disastrous and all kinds of God's ... New York giants off it is an absolute disaster\nHousehold outback I'm Judy you're not getting ten catches for a hundred and forty yards every week it's ridiculous they can't find a way to get into football ravens embarrassed the Steelers twenty six for seeing at home skills or they're bad football team right now I sat there going in my mind the whole time\nAntonio Brown has disappeared from his office he absolutely disappeared for this off and\nIt's a close game down the stretch it is a a at this point I'm looking at a a ... it's a three point game Seventeen uh fourteen heading into the fourth quarter and I keep thinking to myself where is Antonio Brown\nBen Roethlisberger has helped make Antonio Brown a hall of famer and vice versa\nDid he just forget the existence here how is it they went from the most dominant duo next to Matt Ryan and who you'll Jones right up there and that Ryan Julio Jones\nTo them not be on the same page I have no idea what's happened yet one of the ultimate weapons in the entire NFL and somehow Ben Roethlisberger is no way to get into football is a disaster right now in Pittsburgh and you have to point the finger at Mike Tomlin\nNo question about it and they also miss levy on bill they missed way beyond that absolutely is kinda integrate Oprah since that exact same not being assailed I'll tell you what the off at the winds but hideous I was watching it off it's wind yesterday not good\nI mean they were turnstiles yesterday brought this book it takes about his but might go to his decision making at times is awful absolutely awful so much you get into a Monday show well we can't get into everything so we'll get as much as we can put gas right here I'm going deep Airforce meant NBC Sports radio in the NBC Sports radio mobile apps\nAnd see how long you hold your breath\nNBC Sports radio that\nThe best coverage of high school for two\nAnd they're wanting to be able to you half H.\nR.

weeks of this you didn't didn't statistically you have the game that he had previously but with a true touchdown effort here late in the fourth quarter\nThe comeback kid you can start to call him as the chiefs remain on defeated\nThe Broncos had a ten point fourth quarter lead in this game\nThey had not blown a ten point fourth quarter lead at home since two thousand and four this defense was the first real test that Patrick more homes is faced with this season\nAnd boy does he pass with flying colors first there was the twelve place Seventy five your drive that my home is engineered when they were down ten points in the fourth quarter they get the ball back and despite penalties\n... homes completes a monster pass to enable them to get a first down and then\nMore down the field the left

team was down to when the three to Thirteen with little over twelve minutes to go\nIn the game and then they won twenty seven twenty three ... homes has been something else this season\nIf you ask me right now he is the most valuable player early on in the twenty eighth team season maybe ... tremendous performance on Thursday night but I think that it's more so Patrick most because I've been very impressed with what he has done with this Kansas City chiefs office\nI expected the Broncos to play him tough I expected this to be an atmosphere unlike something that we've seen him face so far in his young career\n\nChargers Steelers forty niners not exactly dominant defense is not this year the Broncos team this Broncos secondary this Broncos unit is a championship caliber defense but\nTonight in the fourth quarter they could not hold a ten point lead\nWe can criticize the bronco defense all we want but we have to give prayers to Patrick moms and yes the NFL come we we all thought the NFL's fault but the rest of his game completely\nScrewed up the game\nThere was a play the big third downplay that happened when my home scrambled and completed a big time pass right before the two minute warning should have never happened\nAnd you fans watching at home I'm sure you know exactly what I'm Talking about the clock ran out the way he clock ran out\nWas third and seven at the forty six yard line and they completed a pass for the first down before the two minute warning it should have never happened\nBut can't go back and review that\nCan challenge it it happened they let it go to play with the ball was snapped after the play clock it shouldn't have happened but it did\nAnd the Broncos deal had chances still had chances to end this game but they did not get the chiefs off the field Patrick ... homes\nScrambled he ran he showed off his speed on that Russian touchdown getting to the corner he showed off his I don't even know how to describe it it's Brett Farr like right that's what it is\nRemember one Brett Farr was in his prime and the pleased that he would make would would\nHe's we used to say it's like he's just brought it up in the backyard right how many times did NFL analysts say that about Brett Farr you know he's just drawing up plays in the dirt bike used in the backyard with his friends running around and just make things happen that's what Patrick homes is due in\nTears alluding a pass rush he's checking down from his first option to his second read to his third read and finding guys open he's extending place what Patrick ... homes is doing\nIs what people thought players like Johnny Manziel and Tim ... would be able to do at the NFL level because they did it in college\nBut they were not able to do it in the NFL because they're not as talented as Patrick more homes both physically\nAnd just overall in terms of the football I cue that goes into what we have seen from Patrick moms so far he is making the right decisions every time he is throwing the football\nEvery time he's throwing the football\nPlus the kid is six three has a rocket for an arm and can run by a lot of guys Thirteen touchdowns\nIn the first three games right\nCouple more here tonight to Kansas City chiefs are for no and are starting to look like the collapse of the AFC West and Patrick more homes right now very well could be the MVP of the first quarter of the NFL season\nYou know so he's a conflict kid he was confident before that it is not going to be will be overconfident from but I think it tells you that tells everybody\nReally the gee you're you're within striking distance or you know you have that opportunity to where the guy that can make plays guys around may plays too so it's a there's this wasn't just Patrick put ... voice was\nNow what about the ... overall\nThe office aside you know Patrick and [noise] I mean I've worked real hard\nOn that left hand to throw you know make sure you do that but there was some amazing plays Aaron and then [noise] you know came to this uh overseas ... just coming coming out now I'm having a big day to a hundred and twenty plus yards carrying the football and and um\nAgain [noise] tremendous job\nWell homes speaking of that left handed to throw a which we heard earlier in the show a talked about that place that was just very innovative\n\nAh I didn't think it at all I was kind of just scrambling left [noise] um I felt a lot on my back and I knew I couldn't do it with my right hand I Know we knew we needed the first down and so I kinda just like shot put it to ... and he got the first animated great play I mean it's [noise] I mean he's got to get the ball in their hand to mouth\nAnd we've seen quarterbacks like I mentioned Brett Farr we've seen Aaron Rodgers make that play a lot of guys or do that but it it's just the presence of mind to get the ball out and get it to your play maker\nYou're you're alluding to pass rush and he just got to do whatever you can put the ball on your left hand push it out there towards them more homes on the comeback when\n\nThe I mean I knew if I if I could just get the ball on our guy's hands that we can make plays a\nI mean it speaks volumes through his team and like how much hard in termination that we have a that the ... got up there but a lot of key starts off and just kept biting multiply kept fighting the running backs and receivers everybody kept biting and we came out with the wind\nJim you know for no after the first quarter of the season and your co change readers just raving about you use a lot of confidence that you can get the job done for this team at twenty three years old\nYeah I think it's all situational or sometimes you can extend the play and I needed a secret chances to make plays in or sometimes you need to stand in the pocket and just take what's that [noise] and I think the game I mean like I said they have great cover guys and they were covering up pretty well off it while I was getting enough Tom rocket extend the play\nAnd I we we weren't scramble draw a training camp and they were coming back to me and we were in there making plays on\nVon Miller for Denver talked about

for your computer on the run so that's what he's shown on paid you know so we knew um he was going to be about as far back in the guy but where the pressure on a guy he uh he made some place\nNow how about that play on the final drive where the play clock ran out and the whistle should have been blown but instead it was a completion perverse down\nParents what did\nYou ask the officials about the play clock and one is they tell you I did and he said I'm he looked up and down the road and they are\nI disagree you disagree I disagree\nMillions of Americans watching at home disagree but if that

the NFL as if he wasn't already through the first couple of weeks of the season after one quarter of the season Patrick ... is my most valuable player and that's where you know we're starting off your our evaluation of the NFL\nAfter the first four weeks after the first quarter of this season Patrick ... is\nThe most valuable player because he has changed the dynamic of this chief's office\nAlex Smith is a good quarterback Alex Smith in ... he could win you know he's he's that talented we saw what he's done throughout his career and yet even know Alex Smith is a pretty good runner\nRight remember him at you told us read option place in the urban Meyer and the guys are pretty good run of the football but he's not known\nFor having a big are these accurate throws the intermediate pass very well but Patrick more homes adds an element of a deep threat\nBecause he's got a rocket for unarmed can toss it like Seventy five yards in the air with a flip to the rest and when you have guys like Sami Watkins and ... that something you have to watch out for\nHe also can fit the ball into tight spots because of how solid his arm is the velocity which he throws the ball with allows him to put it into tighter spots than other quarterbacks and yes his elusive this the ability to run the ability to extend place\nThis is a different kids\nIt's a different Kansas City chiefs office

Rudy combined to non drowsy anti histamine plus a powerful decongestant for twenty four hours of congestion free breathing while nice Ali\nI still do the giants could\nPut some wins to gather that maybe\nThey end the first half of the season three and four\nIf the giants king when oil yeah three or four\nLet's think about that right now the giants are one and\nOnly when game against the Texans they lost the jaguars in a game where they could have won they the jaguars didn't play that great\nLoss of the cowboys game that they could have one and they lost the saints in a game in which at the half it was twelve seven and then in the second half or specifically in the fourth quarter they couldn't stop the saints\nSo things ran away with it it was a lot closer though a throughout the entire game and what bothered me the most about that performance against the saints New Orleans came into the game\nAveraging over three hundred yards passing per game allow it on the fence\nAnd you are manning didn't throw a ball beyond nine yards until the final drivers in the fourth quarter everything was thinkin Dunkin' thinking dunk and I get it if a guy's not open you're not going to throw it but you got a maybe just take a shot\nOpen up the rest of your office throw something deep even if you know what's going to be incomplete just do it to push the defense off of you\nThat states came into that game with the worst pass deepens in the NFL and the giants showed no interest in passing the ball down the field\nMind boggling stuff so that one in three they take on the Panthers the eagles the falcons and the next three games\nThey have to win two of those games\nThey absolutely have to if you're three and four going into that next structure of your schedule I think the giants have a chance to get to nine and seven and nine seven could win the division\nBecause look at the rest of the schedule for the giants Redskins forty niners books eagles again of course bears Redskins again titans coats and cowboys\nWith the exception of the bears game and the bears it's it'll be a giant stadium work but the mental and so a bears are all different team at home in the road you got the eagles are always tough not cowboys game which will be you know challenge for them and the Redskins they'll probably split with but look to look at those games coasts\nTitans who knows what titans team will show up buccaneers winnable forty niners winnable\nAnd yes the\nReds games winnable\n\nStarts with the next three got at the very worst go to and what the other team that has been disappointing for me to start this season is my Super Bowl pick the Atlanta Falcons\nThe falcons or one in three with one of if not the best offense is in the NFL\nBut defensively they are allowing over thirty points per game\nYou can not be a successful football team if you are allowing over thirty points per game\nAnd it's not just the amount of points to a wedding up it's the inability to close games out and I get it they had injuries and maybe those injuries ... maybe those injuries are are just too much to overcome\nBut she had a lead against the eagles and you gave it up you had a lead against the saints knew gave it up you had a lead against the bangles and you gave it up and I'm not just talking about leads at any point in the game I'm Talking about late leads leads\nTo the point where you know you've got to close out the game and winning\nFalcons have not been able to get that done\nSo giants and falcons my true most disappointing teams so far in the first quarter of the NFL season now it's talked about my surprising teams\nIn the early part of the NFL season after one quarter of the NFL season the most surprising seems to me\nI think the Kansas City chiefs would fall into that category because I didn't I certainly did not expect Patrick my homes to be this good\nSo I I Would put them in the surprising category although I Can't say that they're the most surprising team for me right now I think I'd have to start with the Tennessee Titans because Mike\n... in his first year as the head coach\nThe titans with suffering injury and injuries that markets more Yoda and he's got that goes special glove because it can barely old the football and whatnot [noise] this team sometimes does it make it look sexy they lost that game to the dolphins that took about twelve hours [laughter] 'cause the delays\nThen yeah they had a late victory against the Texans\nA nine six win against the jaguars and this comeback victory against the eagles titans are three in one\nAnd\nI I'm starting to feel like we should maybe be paying attention to them because this\nSeem it they're dangerous and I don't expect them to go on this round and go twelve in for Thirteen three but the titans are showing you through the first four weeks of the season that they will be in\nEvery game for the remains of the season they will be competitive in every game this season\nNow that ... to an injury so we'll see how that affects things a technical college going to be out a few weeks we'll see what they do a at the safety position without a Kenny Colorado\nBut look at their schedule for the titans bills ravens tough chargers tough cowboys whatever patriots tough Colts Texans divisional games jets jaguars divisional game giants Redskins calls titans could very easily be attend wouldn't see him\nAnd I absolutely think that we should be considering them as one of the favorites if not the favorite over the Jacksonville Jaguars ... yourself\nBecause they have that tie breaker over them right now it five five three ... three or four and received eight five five three ... three four six it's due to Jodie calling from Texas going on jury\nAh not much you got a I think that case Keenan Vance Joseph than woods experiment is over in Denver I have never never seen a team that same point lead in the fourth quarter and has it has the Conan facing a second and third\nAnd you're going to play man coverage and bring the house that\nWas dumb that was\nIt probably calling Jodie Jodie it hasn't happened as happens in two thousand and four ... thousand and four was the last time the Broncos bought ten point fourth quarter we eat at home we're talking about something that hasn't happened in fourteen years and you saw it happen you know Monday in a way\nKnew he was going to throw that game away and he almost ... almost to the pig\nToo when he tried to squeeze at all in the Sanders\nYelling at the game he didn't\nAnd then he went all the gang bangers town wide open all he had to do with it\nAnd he had no pressure oh that was a\nJody that one was the heartbreak or that one was the heartbreak and I appreciate the phone call we're up against a break here that was the heartbreak or because he if that throw is I I don't know three feet lower it may put maybe even if he puts a little more errands or\nThat ball [noise]\nThat that should have been the game winning touchdown Thomas would have walked into the end zone with the game winning touchdown there and look I don't know what the future is going to hold for the Denver Broncos at the quarterback position\nRight case keen them he is showing you she is the guy that can come in and be a stopgap right\nShe hasn't been a starting quarterback to the extent of well we're going to we're going to name him as are franchised guy he's been the backup that\nYou were completely comfortable and confident in coming in and taking over for an extended period of time\nBut if you're expecting you to be your

breaking came one sixty three on Monday Dodgers to the Rockies and the brewers defeated the cubs so the national league wildcard game all began the post season in Chicago rocky patch the cubs we're joined now by our baseball insider set\nEver who you fall once winter ... stepped on their score Everett and separate want to start the national league let me ask you what makes this Milwaukee Brewers team so special this season [noise]\nI think the way they handle their versus the um their team if not built for short periods of bill for the regular season I'm curious to see it that plays a role um but what they have done is there's two instances that\nOf a team that really rallied around good things\nUm and they took bad things and they turned them into will played weeks [noise] the first example is the all star game a right at the end of the all star game uh there was a report that\nA judge haters a Twitter ... when he was in high school was was you know disgusting tweets\nAnd he had to go through a whole thing and it was a controversy and then the next day they gave Peter innovation or to kind of show their support the fans that and they were criticized Milwaukee was called a racist town and it was a it was a story that was big locally\nAnd the brewers wound up playing the best baseball right afterwards\nAnd all of a sudden you say to yourself they they rally around each other for better or for worse so I'm not defending Hader and I'm not attacking hater either all I'm saying is the team was remarkable and how they ... they play each other\nThen there was an incident three weeks ago it was a Wednesday afternoon and it was one of the final games that the brewers and played the cubs and it was a game they needed and\nChristian ... was was arrested\nAnd counsel was destroyed and the media or the front office was questioned everybody was wondering what was going on why was this happening why is that a day off they had an off on Thursday you give them enough they on friday against the pirates are very it was\nAnd they want to eat in a row [laughter] so again like controversy faces that team and they really respond and I think it's amazing I don't know if you want to give council the credit or the players the credit or somebody that credit but they really are really fun team too because they rally around each other very wary well\nWell let's talk about the construction of this team and specifically by their general manager David Stern step because a lot of people were critical when they acquired all these bats saying well the brewers need our steamy pictures but he constructed they line up might not be your traditional defensive alignment correct\nHe constructed they line up that from top to bottom\nThere's no weak spots and I think that he deserves a ton of credit for the way that he has put together this roster this season\nHe uh he deserves a contract extension I don't understand what marketing philosophy was waiting for I Know you had legs a knee surgery or give due to a contract extension 'cause uh the metric of a throw a ton of money on and\nDavid Stern uh did what he could you know David Stern recognized that the trade deadline it was not worth\nTrading all these players for mediocre pitching they were not going to make a coal camels or or J. half deal no for getting caught handles he didn't know he was going to become a picture of the month like he had been struggling in Texas\nUm this is the same general manager that did not trade Lewis Brunson to Oakland for sunny gray\nThinking about that Louis Brunson wound up becoming the guy he traded to get crushed and yell and\nYell at you it was so funny how you know people are so fickle because I Love the moves when they were made and I do a lot of stuff in Milwaukee and I said I I Love these movies I thought they were big league type moves\nAre adding Lorenzo can ... and there was a guy in Miami that treated me and said you all his won't do anything without John Carlos Stanton hidden\nBehind them okay system\nIt's like I mean the you know two guys have to go out and go on the field and prove it and he is the MVP internationally I don't care what anybody\nDoes yeah absolutely talking to us that they're at our baseball inside of their Scott's Eisenberg overtime\nOn NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com so now how do you like the cubs chances in a wild card game against the Colorado Rockies it will be in Chicago 'cause they have the better record and John lesser will be on the mound is this a team that you think once they if they get by\nThe Rockies in the wild card game still has a chance to go back to the world series\nOh big chance I think first of all the two things that you have to recognize the number one one game and baseball is just that one game you'd never know how things are going to go um I don't think\nI you know I I feel very confident if you look at the last two elimination games by the Rockies they've laid an egg in both they lost the wild card game to Arizona last year in a very similar fashion fell behind her early couldn't come back\nAnd it it wasn't indicative of the way the Rockies and play the whole month of September I'm In this circumstance it's the same thing that going up against a bona fide postseason proven eighth\nAnd you know the the cubs if they when they get another shot at the brewers and you know they were all this talk today about all the Milwaukee fans that made the drive down you know Wrigley Field as they become Miller Park Wrigley north\nUh when the cubs play so\nYou know the fact that there could be a reunion between the cubs and the brewers um that'll be the prime time series you know what I mean that that would be the series that gets the most publicity it will be funny because they'll probably have to play a bunch of afternoon games if the Dodgers are involved especially when\nSchool or just being able to do when he was going to run into major\nCBS

[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nBack on doing decent force but NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com other great Saturday at college football action\nDo we have a clear picture of what the playoffs maybe like four months away from it but who cares so much wants to get into that stuff we bring our friend leaking Lipman covers college football for Sports Illustrated and let's get right to it too early to start the Notre Dame playoff talk after that big when I went over Stanford\nNever too early I think that they have to put them in effect right now they're under you did and they have a pretty clear a path ahead if they if they keep winning\nHe's is this something we can really put I mean in terms of the success legion all on the book in a quarterback change to games ago\nYou know I don't think you don't put it all on him I think not hurting defense is playing\nI'm like one of the best in us in the country right now and we kind of knew that that was going to be the case coming coming into the then but you know the decision that Brian Kelly made to a neighbor quarterbacks west before waiting for it you know we didn't really know it it his performance against for as a matter of\nWait for the ... not being that great but then of course his performance against Stanford throwing for two hundred and Seventy yards rushing for two hundred and Seventy two\nMagazine like Stanford that's pretty impressive he opens up the play book and adds another dimension I think in both the Wake Forest and Stanford games he hit\nTen different players and and the Stanford game the forecast chunky pat Hebrew word for different players which has just showing that he's getting that ball so many different plane makers and it's just opening up the occupants adding that different dimension that unfortunately brand new one bus just couldn't do\nOur leg and if we can start to Notre Dame playoff talk ... talk to the past twelve\nYeah I mean you know it's Notre Dame let's say let's fast forward and the the season is is kind of going the way that it's going right now if Notre Dame that makes the playoff there and that factor which means they're going for spot\nSo and there's five power five conferences which means you might knock out too and then\nIf you have all these one law teams and the ... well then they're not going to be included and watching ten teams right now to be the ... best hope and you know they have a good law against the Auburn but they also have a pretty tough schedule\nI Want to bring you into a conversation with me or many times in my producer\nAnd forth and agonized about disorder you're outside opinion you're disappointed inclined to not just because you're just almost knocked about respect for you all agents the factors their schedules absolutely garbage right and then she sees absolutely garbage\nAnd if you have an undefeated Clemson at the end of the year they should go undefeated 'cause they're the best team in the ACC and again it's the garbage conference you automatically take lumps in for the four team playoff overly won't last let's say Alabama or Georgia or whoever ends up losing the SEC championship game\nI think is the way that we've seen the play off the costs low class lecturing committee go the last few years\nYeah they're going to take an undefeated teams from a power five conference to matter the schedule now if you're heading undefeated clubs and they get one last Alabama navy Alabama law tell us your Auburn maybe the conversations different 'cause we're seeing how much\nThe selection committee loves Alabama and for Alabama to miss out on their first play off it would just be\nYou know just what what the world what what happened I guess I'm everybody would go crazy\nUm but yeah I don't think that you sent unfortunately even no matter your feelings about the ACC and not you know scheduling tough non conference games you know they play they play ferment and in Jordan either it's it's just like you know um\nYeah I think as a power five teams undefeated and they win their conference they're going to the playoffs\nThat's sad I I Would not put him and I just I Would not put them in to watch Saturdays I liked a mileage open and I watch college football I Would not putting glimpse of based on a what I've seen to be of course would have seemed to be used to use the whole village and we have to get the natural judging Penn State absolutely blew it on Saturday I mean that's a game that they had\nThe White House was phenomenal hundred ten close to ... eleven thousand people there beeper stadium\nAnd after the game James Franklin as you saw that the fact you agree program to just not only program so I'm going to ask you this what do you think like in Penn State needs to do to take the next up to become that will be programmed James Franco and talks about [noise]\nYeah I think that you know I was listening to something else earlier today and they were asking that very similar question and [noise] you know there were courting is on par with everybody else and it's just they if they make that play then maybe he doesn't say that\nYou know a lot of people are saying oh Well James Franklin made the wrong call it you know traces sorely he had the hot and says will record and you know totally art is\nUm you know they they they changed the play calls after a two time outs and some of these and shift but\nThey obviously made the call based on what they saw and it's mild standards you know get those yards and we're not having a conversation and maybe James Franklin isn't calling U.S team out thing an elite um I don't know\nIt's hard because Ohio State in Alabama are just so above every other teams we seen the last few years that\nIt's on I don't think it's fair to put that time you know pressure on your team when they are you doing pretty much everything right except for winning maybe that's your one last of the season and maybe get the next year maybe don't the games in Columbus but\nUm you know to get to that point it's just urban Meyer and next day that are at a different level than everybody else\nWas delivering cover sociable for Sports Illustrated your ongoing deep enforcement NBC Sports radio my problem is it's like the preseason Alabama fraud it'll tell you that right now but there's nothing worse than preseason bulls we can because to me you're based on what happened last year and what your finger during recruiting so\nTo me when I look at the top five now as much as I Want us to tell you obey was the best team in the contracts you believe they are the factors I Want to base things on who teams of plates\nShould Ohio State the number one I went over ... said on the road that's most pressing when\nWell yeah and they also VCU which technically knew full size but that was you know just outside Fort Worth stay for sure how the most damning daughter day and I would say probably have the two most impressive resumes right now if you're ... to present and the to the college football playoff lecture committee\nAlabama of course you know they they scheduled Louisville we didn't know Louisville wouldn't be as good as they were\nUm you know a couple of years ago but you know that's the way it goes and then you schedule teams like\nLouisiana Lafayette and Fidel and that just doesn't really cut it win Ohio State playing TCU and Notre Dame you know playing Michigan and you know has their independence schedule\n'em and they're winning those games so I mean Alabama's bowling out we're running out of ways to describe the way that Alabama's winning every single weekend at the end\nThey're pulling out came by like more than forty points per game and honestly they really don't have it really as a test for another month yeah um then tell a playlist view they've got\nLine that how you can make more\nLike teach any acute\n[noise]\n\n\n\nWe ever let you down now [noise]\n\n\nShe's on the air force and NBC Sports radio NBC for radio dot com on a disheartening last sentence the\nFat Ohio said on the ropes\n... point lead and they could not hold it as Ohio said come back [noise] wins is twenty seven twenty six so\nWhite outta beaver stadium very impressed by the way the largest crowd in Penn State history looked like a very intimidating place to play\nAnd James Franklin flat out blew it that go to the Penn State ... the lions who talks about this program being great but not all lead he's the reason why they're not only program\nIf James Franklin wants to figure out how to get to the next level and be Alabama be Ohio State be a program of that caliber just look right on into that mirror because after the twenty seven twenty six last take a listen to the tough talk from James Franklin\nSaul old is that we're way for for which we are just as Chris we're ... we're ... we're only\nHe's the reason why they're not only program you want me to highlight exactly the moment to show that they're not all leading a just a great program fourth in five you have a fourth and five and after a trace of extra early has a game of his life\nRushing for a hundred and Seventy five yards on twenty five carries passing for two hundred and eighty six yards he was your Jack of all trades\nOn more than five you don't give the ball is a guy who was absolutely dominated Ohio State for four hundred and fifty total yards\nYou give it a mile Sanders who had done nothing in this game total sixteen carries forty three yards one touch down a long run a twelve yards so instead of putting it into the hands of the guy that got you to the point where\nOn the verge of upsetting Ohio State\nOn fourth and find you give us a mile Sanders that's the difference between being an elite program and being just a great program\nThey'll play calling a James Franklin he's why they're great and not elite he recruit says if they're an ally program may play almost sixty minutes like an ally program but when the going gets tough\nAnd you have to make that one call to determine the outcome of the game\nJames Franklin absolutely blew it they had their foot on the throws Ohio State buckeyes they had this game this is the one you have to win because next year you have to go to Ohio State you're not going to get this opportunity\nYou had the opportunity to take over first place\nThen really well it's well not really because I mean Michigan undefeated in the conference but you know what I'm saying in terms of being the highest ranked team in the Big Ten this was your opportunity to do it the statement when you need knock it off the buckeyes of Ohio State\nEverybody's popular pick to win the Big Ten and go to the playoffs\nYou know what they are going to go to the playoffs and they shouldn't be the popular pick because of what happened on Saturday Dwayne Haskins do not play well\nThey didn't run the ball that great Ohio State is old didn't play very well\nNot having the poster hurt you could tell didn't get as much pressure on trace McSally if they would've loved they couldn't contain trades big sorely\nAnd yet my fingers is the guy they didn't know if it's the miles Sanders who's had some big games this year but you don't put their hands to somebody who's not your number one option with the game on the line\nYou know what this is it came to this is a came to the Lakers this year needing one shot to win a game\nAnd LeBron James passage of the brain in England who shoots it okay you wanna win or lose with your best right you want to win or lose the brawn James and if you lose the brawn James you can live with that because at least you had it in the hands of your number one option LeBron James your best player\nIs traced back sorely tries to go around the corner and doesn't get it I can live with that phrase mix early tries on these run path options and it doesn't work out to live with that\nBut I Can't live with trace mix surely putting the ball the mouse Sanders his hand and getting stuff for a loss because the fact is you gave the game to Ohio State would that play you took the ball out of your best players and that's why you're not elite saving doesn't make a call like that\nI don't think\nNick Saban ... hertz west or the ... the whole year where clearly he was not the better of the quarterbacks but you know what we didn't know what to uh was it\nWell these are true freshmen it's OK you're doing it to practice right once you get to do it a game situation we've had him in there here and there doesn't mean than the national championship you just don't have to say that we\nKnow Joan hurt should have been pulled a long time ago that is true but guess what they said to me he's alive he's lucky lucky he also has which we the fans could see John hurts was an ordinary quarterback right\nThat's true but you haven't heard the year before it played well\nWell he was all as a freshman but here's the thing jailing hurts has been matched by the fact that they've had dominating defenses and great running games okay so made his life easy to jail and hurts would kind of gimmicky and he would throw for twenty touchdowns into interceptions\nTier I tell in the sense of like you're not taking that many shots down the field you also had just incredible athletes a wide receiver it not Calvin Ridley it's a jury duty and guys like that right now he's lead loaded

Jeffries\nAlready ready for this member went through in four thousand yards meant something\nRight now there are six team quarterbacks on pace for over four thousand yards right now you have it quarterbacks on pace for five thousand yards yeah that's what we're looking at right now\nJoe Flatow of all peoples on pace for five thousand years I I Believe he is he's never crossed a he's ever pass for more than four thousand any\nFlack over twelve hundred and fifty two yards which would put it on pace for five thousand and he's on pace for thirty six touch thirty two touchdown passes as well this is from ... Joe Flatow's in your number eleven in the first ten years of his career he threw four thousand yards once\nOnce and now he's on pace for five thousand yards\nAll you have to do is like a little fire owners rear ends named Lamar Jackson and look at Joe Flaco go your wind them up like a toy and look at them go by the way I feel bad for my Jackson okay here's why first so I don't\nBecause he's a thirty second overall pick any gets guarantee that if our money and blah blah blah okay he's the medical quarterback but the way they use them in Baltimore as such a gimmicky player right now it's kind of pathetic so what do they have them do he comes in he thunder center and\nThey're running a wild cat\nOne out of style years ago when it stopped working 'cause every NFL defense figured out how to stop the wild cat and they do stupid thing where Joe Flaco goes out wide 'cause he's such a great athlete so Joe Flaco goes out why Lamar Jackson's under center and they're kind of afraid to have him throw\nYour drafted him thirty second overall I Hope to God he can throw some reason it's getting to the point where when he's ... he's understanding you kinda know he's not going to throw because he doesn't\nSo why even put 'em in there I mean that's not what's winning ... games right now Joe flak on the field is actually winning ... games I'm a little just perplexed every time I feel about Jackson going there 'cause I'm thinking this is a distinguished college quarterback who's got a Heisman Trophy and you're using them as a gimmick right now so somehow he's going to go from a gimmick\nTo being you're starting quarterback next year\nSadly Joe Flaco screwing up their plans because there Joe Flaco those five thousand yards and thirty two touchdowns a handful of interceptions\nHey Lamar I'd love to see that if this team which is an aid may team wins ten games in ... by the way they could win that ... that AMC north they really good weather because Pittsburgh sticks or right they could win the AFC North I Love to see the women MC north\nHorrible keeps his job of course get that hot the friend\nHow do you say no to Joe Flaco and release them or trade them for Lamar Jackson of Joe Flaco keep this up\nJoe ... it's going to be great I you know people have chaos right people are hoping for baseball chaos people walk college football playoff casts every year by the way I'm One of them I like the cats and sports show you like the chaos and sports too it's fun\nI Love to see the chaos and Baltimore with Joe Flaco you got to put a little more Jackson who you're afraid to throw the football right now as a starting quarterback next year or a guy throws for singles or forty five hundred yards and thirty touchdown and goes to the playoffs you get rid of Joe Flaco\nNo you're not you still want to contract oh that would be some chaos I can't wait I Hope it happens quite honest I got kind of like that stuff is funny right\nOn Joe Flaco enough on case came to me as early as you saw a gay skied them is tonight that way screwed up again by the way we can always looking to run a quarterback oh so he gets handed Peyton Manning so he's a freaking genius\n... no he was handed Peyton Manning hit remember who he inherited the Broncos team with the tea Bo yes as the quarterback coming off that play off when the ten people\nHad and then he ... landing Scott's to bring a Peyton Manning\nThat that you know this is the pay mad and we didn't know after his neck surgeries or would you would feel ever ever would regain is where you take this risk as every other team I wanted to write but he had had I was like no but he had a talk many into that and it was just for men and\nYes he had a dream of credit I give him credit for manning\nBut every other quarterback decision is made doesn't work trapping ... number you know first round yep pending arranged for Trevor simian\nYep giving money to case keen I'm offering Brock a ...\nAfter dropping him in the second round so there you go I mean John Elway sure I'll give them credit for for being able to win the recruiting diminish and you think you would know something about the ... hey Michael Jordan played basketball high level he's a terrible on her Derek Jeter play baseball and high level he treats Christian yellowish for Louis printed in a bag of baseball's\nMay be playing in a high level makes you a crappy talent evaluate a right\nNot everybody's are you do for the scout though he doesn't yeah well you know the difference all over him like on the brewers where it was his Jonah Hill right telling you what a trade for like you know money ball\nWhy didn't treat me like yours congregating spin contract I get it and more so students going to get paid in a couple of yeah I can see getting rid of him Christian yellowish just signed a five year fifty million dollar contract\nLike a year ago right\nFive years fifty million that's like he's he's paying you to play baseball with a triple crown wouldn't MBP or he got really believe in moral enough building them or let me try to get a stupid sculpture by the way he should get that these ridiculous ... nightmare that sculpture is\nI mean I Know that there's a lack of like a you know artistic class in Miami I get it but ... says it right I mean come on disgusting\nFire we got it [laughter] for the Ryder Cup real good I gotta

bet that sounds like fun time you invited Vegas picking reality TV show Nick invited Vegas slowing down [laughter]\n\n[noise] I\nDon't see the enforcement NBC Sports radio NBC for radio dot com shame on the NFL yet again I mean there's so many reasons to not enjoy the NFL these days\nWhy with his yesterday just I'm not a Cleveland Brown fan but\nIt can't be taking games away from the ...\nAnd then of course has come out and that the decision that\nAbsolutely screwed the browns yesterday in the last the Oakland Raiders forty five to forty two ... overtime that looked at the brands that other opportunities to win this game I kept screwing up the defense fell apart offensively overtime they didn't do enough the raiders get the when John grew in his first winning ten years but you don't like to see a game that the officials\nTo appoint play a major role in the outcome\nAnd what happened was with a minute thirty eight seconds left in a forty two thirty four game the browns are leading and Carlos Hyde gets a true yard gains the browns Nineteen yard line\nThey measure and sure enough the browns have a first down rent free Walt Anderson as much a veteran as you're going to find the NFL to first down and just like that unless the browns miraculously turn the ball over they pretty much round the clock at that point first down minute thirty eight to go\nSo everybody thought that that box\nThe central replay commander in New York three thousand miles away from Oakland\nThen calls for a measurement revue if it's\nUnder two minutes of either half from New York the NFL central\nReplay commands can call for a review of a measurement okay they can\nThere's a delay next thing you know walk Peterson gets on the you know the the intercom whatever it is and says quote elbow was down shorter the Nineteen yard line they spot the ball the scene yard line they signal a fourth down now do you blame the you know who's\nBroadcast contributor now the former NFL officiating czar this is what he said on the broadcast quote\nDon't see any way they can change this call on the field is it the way you know who used to be responsible for exactly what happened\nNo angles were offered that showed a full view of where the ball was once Carlos Hyde was down the NFL comes out and said that the league pieced together two angles\nTo figure out where his wrist an elbow hit the ground and that was before the ball reach the Nineteen so they're saying is the NFL took to replace combined them\nTo make this ruling\nIs what they said quote from a line feed you can see the line to gain is just passed the Nineteen yard line are replay angle shows his wrist and the elbow hit the ground simultaneously then when you go back to the live feed you see the risk to the ground new you know the elbow is down at that point you're able to clearly see that the ball is short of the lines again\nHere's my problem with this if it comes down to where you have to piece together to replace to figure it out\nThat means that human I obviously can't see that in fact every angle didn't show it until you took two hundred probably put them together\nIf you have to go to great lengths like that you have to keep the call the field honestly I think it's ridiculous if you're going to call down you're looking for something that right you're looking to see if there's something there but you're going out of your way to make sure Torry you're now taking replaced combining him to figure it out\nTo me that's going above and beyond what replaced should be\nAnd if you tell me elbow and rest and head you've now completely take it out the humid out by the way we've seen calls that have not been reverse because it's not clear enough on replay right how many times that we've seen that because it's\nIrrefutable evidence to reverse the call if they at first call that he was short that's one thing\nIf the replay they can't determine that he got the ball the Nineteen yard line fine I get it\nBut if you have to piece together replaced tour first call that's going too far and that to me is where the proud got absolutely screwed says if the NFL is looking for a way for the Oakland Raiders to get an opportunity one last opportunity\nFor John Bruno themself a damn game now I don't believe in conspiracy theories and I know people have said that I highly doubt the NFL sat there behind closed doors and said we got a hand the game the group\nBut I also don't understand why they would apparently think that they needed to screw the Cleveland Browns out of a with\nTraditional is totally ridiculous\nAnd I just think that when you have to go to great lengths like this to figure it out\nThat's above and beyond it's too much ground to force a ... they were obviously forced upon\nThe raiders and tied the game Derek car Seventy or touchdown pass the jar could buy me a great great ... great catch ... and gets a to point conversion then you know Matt in the crane hits between on your order and overtime and look the brands that opportunity they blew it\nBut I don't like to see the aftermath gave determined the way it was I mean that to me I mean Shawn we've all seen the replay numerous times I\nDon't know how you could reverse that feel that call on the field I really have no idea how you can reverse that\nBeing said Baker Mayfield said it was his fault last saw him do you agree yeah four turnovers\nWhile no here's what lead he had the two from bowls that were his fault the two interceptions I Can't put on one of them was like one of those like\nHe's down the field tried to make a play to to not have the game but over time right so that one one out but that's the end it's like a Hail Mary kind of thing the other one Antonio Callaway seemed to go the wrong way they they definitely did help out Baker may feel no that's just Baker may feel being a leader in the quarterback of the team he's just got to shoulder the blame put it on himself\nLook I mean the jets yesterday were slammed air defense was awfully give us the most yards in ten years but then Donald said that he's the ... you know like he he didn't get anything done so the losses on him any good leader of a quarterback is going to take the blame regardless of what the outcome is does Austin's on hill knock him\nAs a group effort I mean he does events did not pick up the off every hundred radiate\nYards allowed to bigger or ...\nOr the jet you're saying yeah yeah absolutely the events although\nThey often get anything done either we expect that right but you don't may play ball does look like Tom Brady oh I'm I'm watching the scanner thinking Blake bosses Thirteen or fourteen right now it's like a hundred and fifty hours\nEverything he did the guys are wide open there's no defensive coverage underneath mean sure you know train Johnson's your big money guys are good quarterback is sixty Seventy yard touchdown against them\nAnd come on the where's the defense\nI have no idea they got you know they they they sacked poodles twice in the first half facts I haven't been a problem for the jets as your work life here they've gotten to the quarterback second I think I'm getting a cornerback\nLook I mean just to build a far superior team right now I mean the Jacksonville Jaguars are what teams like the jets are the bills are the browns won or be they want to build was a good news\nTrack but they also want to be smart and free agency clay is Campbell as one of the greatest free agent\nSignings in ten years\nAnd this guy is being put in you know he was good at the cardinals\nHe might have thought more years of yeah he was like twenty eight point on I think when they sign right wasn't like young really young player\nPaul pro first team fourteen an ... he's been beat this year\nThe bottom line he's been great that the you know like if they had a better quarterback and for all does it get to do it again gutsy would easily be that the mass you've got to talk about potentially the bat the man speak or the patriots back\nInto that conversation or not yeah fourth and NBC Sports radio [noise]\nComplete look at news for weather and other great information for

that up that Scott bras and that incredible let's get some NFL here let's go over every game here I'm going to give you my points that really comes to mind right thinking each game doesn't have to be by the way on the winning team could be on the losing team right\nAs Stuart's let's do a show called this guy I mean you know you've got on Scott Simon burning up their minds\nAll right here yeah let's Cincinnati thirty seven thirty six winter's over at the Leno what's your one take away from that can where's the\nLand is defense that's my take on understand they've lost their safety but it wasn't as if they're playing great defense with their safety is healthy that Neal went down the first week of the season but this is the Cincinnati Bengals we're talking about okay it's not exactly a juggernaut off that this is a defense right now that is killing Atlanta\nOffensively that's going a ton of points but if the defense doesn't shape up they're not going to they're not going very far in the postseason if they're cheap given up thirty plus point the game [noise]\nAll right let's move on Green Bay shutdown buffalo twenty two to nothing what's your one take away from the ... just not that good\nI tell you what I listen to Josh Josh our terrible but he was he was what you expected it to be a rookie that needs a lot of seasoning but here's what I take away from that game\nThe bills had opportunities to pick up Aaron Rodgers Aaron Rogers was not good in this game\nAnd although the scores twenty two to nothing you have to sit there and say wow the Packers are great they did\nThere was the bills had opportunities to make plays defensively they did not make Aaron Rodgers of not look at the same guy he's obviously banged up\nAnd at twenty two nothing this could've been worse than the Packers often that we are accustomed to seeing showed up I was not impressed by the Packers even in this when are those who voluntarily bucks to walk the plane came to Chicago migrants for that than\nAs you know ms which will be ski six touchdown pass but then I don't want to lead lead you won't hear what's your take away from those can he can make place uh I'll tell you know what I'm Wondering if\nThe bears over the last year and three games before this one\nHad been protecting him too much I mean they let a merit out he may place he made some very nice throws me make throws up surprised she was able to make because\nHe's been nothing but just the guy to his first Fifteen NFL starts but he made some place where I thought to myself you know what I've never seen this from ... if he can consistently make this he's an upper echelon quarterbacks I have to admit now buccaneers defensive terrible but I have to admit that Michel ... was in fact impressive in this game that's my take away\nOkay the patriots\nDemolish and just cream the Miami Dolphins thirty eight to seven one takeaway from this getting their back pages are back you know what the doctors were three you know

but to look at just exactly what would happen we're joined by Dr Michael ... a professor of finance would start in university and the public policy analyst\nThis would involve I gather first and foremost a number of changes regarding making automobiles\nYeah that's a big one so I'm the agreement we have what China for whatever reason as lopsided in favor of the Chinese and to our detriment China makes a car\nSales here or we charge a two and a half percent ... we make a car sell it in China they charge us a twenty five percent or more on some products China was even trying to get out of the two and a half percent tariff and they did that by sending a car that was three quarters of the way finished\nTo Mexico Mexico would put a couple of things on it the hub cats and a few things and then say we produce the car in Mexico so we can sell it in the U.S without paying any towers at all this agreement says that large percentages of the car and more than Seventy five percent of the car has to be made\nIn Mexico in order to qualify for no ah terrorists\nSo that and uh same thing with Canada Canada has uh some agreements that are lopsided in favor of for instance or the dairy\nFarmers the u._s. can produce a product and the U.S a dairy farmers can produce a product sell it for a dollar a barrel dairy farmers costs three fifty\nSo candidate want to put to protect their dairy farmers say we're going to put two hundred and Seventy percent tariffs on that so something that costs the dollar has a two dollar and Seventy cents tower if it will sell for three Seventy Canadians can do it for three fifty\nThe Canadian dairy farmers in business closes the American dairy farmers out of that Canadian market this agreement begins to and that doesn't completely ended up against the end\nAnd presumably would be a model for other deals that we do down the road they're principally a one on one with the Chinese when you appear to my nighttime talk show you indicated that some of the trade deals that we have made with other countries are just\nAbysmal they are terribly lopsided against the United states in other words we ... we heard Donald Trump throughout the campaign and we're now started to learn to things or at least that bad it may be worse\nWhat in your view was the motivation my personal thought would be that the motivation has to do with the sense that\nThe United states is so rich and the rest of the world was oh so poor and therefore we owe it to other countries do shaft ourselves and ah and therefore make it easier for other countries but which is a pretty lame excuses in my view\nYes yeah I I'm not sure what exactly the motivation is but every single one of the trade agreements as lopsided in favor of the trade partner NAFTA what we have with the European Union agreements with China\nSouth Korea which we sort of fixed a little bit last time a last week rather and Japan to their all lopsided and as a result of that\nWere buying a lot of their products

break on some prices and a few Americans we will simply a drive a stake through their hearts and will rip out their jobs and and uh in some cases destroy entire communities but it only affects of you and the rest of us will get cheaper brooms isn't it pretty much the argument that it's been followed up until now\nThat's exactly right that if if we make things in China where they pay their workers are they started out of the hour a day there are a little bit\nUh over that but if we make things in in China instead of making it in the U.S having a shirt costs fifty dollars making in China bringing over here it only costs twenty five dollars consumers will be able to buy more shirts they should have a higher standard of\nLiving and that's good for consumers in the meantime though we've

James an MBA insiders suggests the price would have come down for the bucks to consider a trade for all start guard Jimmy Butler MBA dot com is reporting the Minnesota timber wolves offered butler in a trade for Chris Middleton\nBut the bucks more into buying those six foot eight small forward butler is a star and he has demanded the timber wolves trade him\nThe indication is Milwaukee might talk if the wool switched to Eric blood so or milk and brought them or both and such a deal\nI this is weird because I I'm I'm so in with the NBA news and I did not hear anything about this but off the cuff I can say\nThere's got to be more to the story because there's no way if the if the offer was butler from Middleton straight up Markey's doing that deal they've been looking for a number to let alone a guy who is an ape and not even a number two it's it's one day one be between him and the honest they would be a good match\nIs human butler did a lot for the Chicago Bulls and he's he's done a lot with his career he worked as he's done it all himself basically any somewhere catch ... he's the market grad I I'm a fan of his\nI don't know if it would be a good mix with him in any on us or not but I'll say that you know at a certain point you've got to grab but you can get by in the NBA there's not a whole lot of stars like there used to be\nAnd you you know you can get a guy like that who is a hard worker nobody has ever complained about Jimmy Butler's work ethic or what he puts on the court is defense is some of the best in the league is one of the best to lead players you can make an argument is the best to a player in the game [noise]\nUm so it would be any anything they could do with bullets so if it's middle to whatever it is it'd be worth it if they throw in a pick it'd be worth it\nI'm curious to see if it actually happens because Tom ... is is income is holding Jimmy Butler like in a bear hug and will not let him out of Minnesota like try and get a darned as too\nAnd and and him and the owner\nYou are a lot of different sides points in time to be though has done this is that what this this whole career he was dealing with it in Chicago he's dealing with amount

I Know him I get aware of him as a rookie because he spells his name the same way my friend Chris who is in our our picks right he's built his name with a K as well so he's always been a fan of has\nThis kid did something kind of interesting uh baseball's the tourists are being like you know status obsessed just sports it's ... it's one of the things I Love baseball I Love stats and I I like that about baseball fans do yeah I Know one day I've never heard of it and it is and actually nobody has is something that Chris Davis did\nChris Davis said the Oakland A's finished with a two forty seven batting average that's nothing really crazy or anything right well this is the fourth straight year that he's done that\nFor years in a row finished with the two forty seven batting average forty four to forty seven army to forty eight or whatever exactly to forty seven\nHow does that happen there there's a crazy mathematical impossibility so it's not surprising that he's the first player in baseball history to do it there's never even happened nobody's been done it like three years in a row metal on um Christ said quote it's just weird I guess it was meant to be I mean\nThat that is kind of a fascinating thing even before this streak he was pretty consistent because the two thousand fourteen before district started to forty four so I mean\nI never been one for average but he gets on the hot streaks yes with the long ball and a semi popular\nPlayer he's a he's a one of those clubhouse guys are they going to love them in the clubhouse job at the the ... you know ... pretty good at scouting over there to Oakland and did a nice job without him and everything but yet I just thought that was we're not Jerry ... why does the weird right you know you couldn't\nThere is no way you could even try to do with that contract listen Chris\nYou go to two forty eight yay yay and your guest house and they'll say that motivates a look at it similar entertainment stories the Late Show and the Daily Show will be going live on election night that's going to be kind of interesting that\nBut these were fun they were awesome and and they didn't get old you know you could almost read them tours multiple times\nWell Netflix is kind of um taking that idea Netflix has recently introduced a choose your own adventure element to some of its other kids programming and now they're looking to make a broader move by ... bring it to some other adult shows\nThe idea is to blend elements of video games with traditional TV by allowing viewers to make choices as they watch\nThey'll test the waters and an episode of black me or one of the more popular shows which makes sense because the show was about um implications of emerging technology which had black mayors one of those dark BBC shows and everything so [noise] um it'll be an episode from the upcoming season which Netflix in December\nThis will be the first of a new line of interactive content that they're developing to the other potential projects involve um adaptations of video games but there'll be shows movies or specials not actual games the only way I can think of this war\nThe ... just like the book you want to lead character to you know [noise]\n... if it's if it's Forrest Gump you you choose to have for sit there and and eat a box of chocolates and tell stories or you choose for us to get up and he'll run after Jeannie or whatever you know I mean as you can make a choice and\nIt's a it's an interesting thing on the other end of it too because uh actors are the best boy the guy holding the boom Mike and they're all going to be you know they're all getting their contracts going to have to look that a lot differently\nIf they're gonna be filming multiple more scenes it's\nHum as it is a loose comp here it's no different than when we hear um players talk about the you know they want to say and Eighteen game season in the NFL and the players like okay you're going to pay us more though you know I'm like that kind of thing and so there's a lot of guilt laws coming into play here and everything as far as how this goes\nBut maybe more importantly it they're they're attempting to try something different here and they don't have to Netflix to sitting in the driver's seat everybody else's driving is trying to catch up to them right now or whether it's ABC or its Hulu or Amazon or any of these people\nThey don't necessarily have to be taking risks are chances and it's a big risk there's a lot of money on the line here if it doesn't work out it blows up in their face and it's a it goes from being something cool to be new coke or Pepsi or something like that\nWhere it just it blew a you know we're we're a year from now or hey remember we're Netflix try that too yeah so it it's interesting to see them doing this I'm very curious to see where that goes\nOn to wrap up entertainment with a guy that I mentioned a number of times here we've talked about Bradley Cooper and I've talked about how he is one of those people that I think a lot of us can look up to in the sense that he worked\nIn a really really did not have anything handed to them you're talking about a guy really worked very hard to get to where he is\nThere's a great interview with him in a W Magazine where he's promoting a star is born which is coming up very soon with him a Lady Gaga and there's a lot of great press going out about that a clothing uh I Believe ... performance and he has a coat in there where he's talking about this where it's early days where um\nShe or he didn't do the same thing that a lot of us actors do where you're you're in the near for here in the final five it's down to you and three other guys and the director and the casting people are telling you all these three things\nAnd then you find out from your agent yeah they they were never really looking at you [noise] um so and so Tom Cruise wanted more money so we brought you in because day you know we got this young star and everything he's not going to cost as much\nSo we'll go to him a and and all of a sudden Tom lowers the price in town gets the job okay this is a huge thing the casting directors they paid actors against each other all the time we see what businesses you know we see a with a actually employees to employees were say hey this company will pay me more if you don't you know if you're not going to I'm going to go there right\nWe all you know we understand business this is a part of the job but it still can be really tough as an actor [noise]\nUm when all you have to go on is that you know bit of confidence that you have such great interview that he has and one line in there\nIn the end you have to reserve your attention for the work and not listen to anyone and that's a great line that's a really good line right there because\nYou you know you you had your supporting cast and you appreciate them and you're listening to him at the end of the day you just got yourself and you got to believe in it and that's a great line right there to anybody in any field can kind of take from where to get into our local and state wide news right now on the

W. A. C. dot org\nI'm and click on that and get registered and if you register then you are guaranteed a T shirt which is always fun and enjoyable to have a circle or most of your it's like a bright blue it's antiques sapphire I think is the proper name for what\nWe do have some partners in the community who helped to sponsor those shirts because we want to make sure everybody who participates that free registers can get one sometimes sometimes it is hard if we have to walk up volunteers and we want to discourage walk up volunteers but sometimes we just don't have the shirts because we don't want\nThem sitting from year to year will order what we need it but um we do have some sponsors of the of the shirts as well\nYeah so what kinds of rabbits rotary and the key want us club and that I'm part of why it's called there anyone from last year so this is our second year donating to us um and then Grand Rapids lines club is obviously a huge\nHelp with it too we have our um get together there so we all meet at the Grand Rapids science club where we have a hot breakfast pancake breakfasts again this year I'm In the morning before we send them out to wreak so I'm at Grand Rapids why it's called is one of our big\nBig how maryann as it's awesome to work with for me she's been very helpful and gets all her volunteer ladies together to help in the kitchen and I don't have to worry about that part so it's very helpful\nFor ... so you do get a free T shirt on her free breakfast and then a donor personal essentials\nYeah that's something we've been trying for the past couple of years and we've been pretty successful but we're always looking for more so um we're asking\nYou to bring in personal essential items and we donate it back to acorn apartments which is I'm On an apartment building for a physically and I'm a cognitive disability so they're always looking for a little bit extra help you know they're\nGoing to pick up a bottle of shampoo you know when you combine so that kind of thing just just accumulating and helping with some of their their essential needs um and you know really\nTrying now hard to recruit recruit those volunteers to feed you give you your aching assignments send you out and then um they ... when they're done yeah so\nWe give them all a little card with their address and all the information on it and my number on it and you know call me tucked yeah let me know that you've gotten it done so we can work it off our list and make sure that we take care of everyone and hopefully not have any yards leftover I'm I'm up to fifty six yards on my list right now\nWell what's the maximum you can have\nWe've done like Seventy five is voter yeah um but they have until October Nineteen does the cut off to give me a call either through to one one or through the office I'm at seven and five for two one zero three nine Daryl so you still have some time\nOrder but you know for the elderly person or ... or someone who's physically challenged or could use those cameras all that ... know about it\nTo the homeowner needs to provide the bags and\nUm we will do what ever is the instruction of their municipality so if it's who doesn't beg\nA port Edwards and of course it does not big which is really helpful\nSo then you just live radio loses [laughter]\nI Do that during someone else to show that we that we write those you know in those communities that gets right to the curb or whatever the instruction is but but otherwise if it's if it's Wisconsin Rapids or we even get outside of the city limits for sure and wrapping 'em so then you know the the homeowner does need to provide the bags on but that's\nThat's really all that they need to provide the um the volunteers come with their own ranks for to come with their own funding silliness and you know have a good time and yeah\nAnd lots of the homeowners will you know tell me when they register that like oh I have my goodies laid out for them and ready to go so they make 'em brownies they make them cookies they give them pop they have everything for them\nTo do that which is great I er here ... things of that interaction ... yeah for some of our seniors this was important\nIt is it's very important because they don't have the means to do this or the ability anymore and that's hard it's hard to be able to call and say I need help with this I Can't do it anymore and you're\nGoing to interrupt you but so do you have to have conversations I've read some great stories\nWe've even had some times where a volunteer group will say I want the same house I had last year or I Want to connect with you know so that's kind of find hid it you see these relationships forge and and that um we can help with the with the social\nSide of it as well because then you'll be hearing this November for so long you can sign up for their bureau minor you up to your guardians what\nRace you have to fill out um our form and it's right on our website to even fill it up you can download it and fill it out and just we just need to have it so we need to have it that day you can drop it off early you can bring it with you we just if you're a minor we just need to have\nThat so if you're a girl scout leader and you are rallying all your little girl scouts and there's going to be only two adults and twenty five kids\nAll need that that waiver signed you'll okay so they they they each need each parent so in in advance they should get the parents assigned to say it's okay if they participate and so it's twofold one just around the the liability\nBut then the other is a photo released says well because with social media and everything we want you know we want to take pictures of the groups and we want to make sure that we're getting that getting it out and sharing that uh but we also don't want to post a picture of someone who doesn't want their photo taken so the photo releases also part of\nThe former owner repair and it's on the bottom of the fire so accessible\nMedia release slash ... a lawyer abilities for Monday to [laughter]\nAfter standard language that you did I you know with with any activity that you participate in a ... you know we really want to encourage volunteers we want to encourage 'em families who have a need you know if you have an elderly and let us know we can get them on the list um but the more volunteers and what's the old saying right\nMore hands make light work so the more we can get the better and we've tried we've listened I'm hopefully each year making the event a little bit better\nYou may remember Karl back in the day we had we did the work and then had lunch rose um but that doesn't always bring everybody in at the same time you know you're a group of five had a small yard but a group of fifty had a large yard while they were done way before you\nYou you know that kind of thing so it's just it's that whole gathering this way it's a give everybody a good base get excited about it go out do the work\nWhen you're done you don't have to come back you can call or text and say with the address is done and we can check it off the big list um it it just\nIn listening to people and understanding that Saturday they're precious um and people want to volunteer and help but it you know if they can volunteer from nine to noon and not nine to for their happy about that\nSo I'm so we've just been trying each year to continue to make the event better and still meet the needs of those in our community who who need need to service\nSo November of ... of caring a tour group together for your tour\nAnd give us a call go on the website however you want to do it we can if you don't have access to the Internet you can always call me and I can help fill up the former\nHave been through treatment they know the toll that it takes on the body so that way they don't feel like they're alone they don't feel like they're singled out\nFor full support system ... yep for three or so and how does someone sign up where are they referred by a ... a where physician or ... or does it\nWork and I would say the majority of our participants had been referred by their physicians but there have been others where they come into the why they hear about the program and then they'll bring a clearance forum to their doctor and ask their doctor if they would sign off on it so there's there's both options of what\nWe know Carl is it every day in Wisconsin eighty seven people learn that they have cancer\nThree people are losing their life to cancer related deaths that affects a large number of people when we're talking\nChronic disease and what Aaron is able to do through this class is touched so many lives we've been doing this now I think for three years\nWe were the five whole athlete fired it fall of Thirteen\nSo would that impact that we're having we're also having a lot of those people referring others to the program\nSo they know of a friend who's also battling cancer when they go hey I remember this program really helped me you need to check it out\nRight and and the focus of the program it's not on the disease so now we're looking at what it means for them to be that new healthy right right and so people are really excited to move on to that next phase and she kind of focus in that area but do it in a safe supportive environment\nWhere we have that small class situation and we're able to give them the support that they need with the experts that we have on staff that are trained but also the ones that we bring in during those twelve weeks to give them\nThose resources and those tools that they can get back to that new normal and that's pretty cool to be a part of a program like that that's impacting so many people so when you talk about referrals it's coming from a number of different areas and the community is able to learn more about it and the reason that it's able to be free is because of\nUnited Way just being on right there on of arson borders so those donations that come in through United Way or through our our campaign dollars you know that's what allows us to be able to do programs like this so we're really thankful to those those partners and those supporters but we also just want to make sure that\nIf anybody's interested in this program if they know somebody that's been affected by cancer they think they could benefit from it that they get in touch with Aaron or they talk to somebody who maybe has been through the program because you're not just going through the program but you're also becoming a member of the Y. during those twelve weeks\nSo you have access to our why um and to everything that that means to be a member of the Y. during that time and a lot of those folks are staying on after the program to continue their membership because they found that new place that allows them to be part of that community and\nYou know continue their fight exactly exactly fall another big health issue besides cancers diabetes and you have diabetes prevention program we\nDo we do so this is a yearlong program\nWhere for the first sixteen weeks we meet weekly and um it's kind of like it's like a facilitate it it's like a support group ... similar to live strong\nWhere we get together as a group and we learn things about eating nutrition um things that will help us you know what their head knowledge and then as a group we support each other to help get through more difficult times where\nSay I'm a stress eater what are some options what what can I Do in the middle of a Packer game when they're losing and I want to just\nGo grab it grab the chip bag and yeah so it's it's a group of people that come together we kind of put our minds together in our heads together and and and support each other through um through different circumstances so that the program is based on um [noise]\nFat and that we're not making that bad but we're just counting fat grams because that's the easiest way to track calories so effect Graham\nThat has nine calories whereas like a car has four so it was more bang for the buck an effect calorie but again we're not making them when I get that bad but we're just kind of coming up with an a fat total that works for you for the whole day\nAnd then rather than having to write down every little thing that you're eating and whatnot you go and you look at the fat Graham on the package and then you just keep track of that one number rather than\nFor civil fires are a lot of folks who are dealing with diabetes let me sit down with a dietitian or whatever and like many of their mathematically challenge there going oh heck am I supposed to keep track of it was impossible\nYeah yeah and who has time right who has time to sit down and break everything down on a nutrition label a lot of us really don't\nAnd that's not to say that you know we don't have the intention to want to do all that we do ... yes yeah\nSo the first sixteen weeks we meet weekly and then after that we kinda we go to every other week\nAnd we see how we do accountability why are we stand on track or do we need to keep meeting weekly just to kind of keep that accountability there the goal is to eventually moved to a monthly sessions where people kind of hold themselves accountable\nAnd at the end the goal is a seven percent weight loss and just getting that exercise up to at least a hundred and fifty minutes a week yeah\nWe're going to take a short break we're going to talk about personal training pickle basketball you think you're a hoax\nWe got

five eight three zero eight six for a a guard buddy Kevin Kennedy listening to us had been up and most any new also says hey village oh good afternoon maybe I missed it what was the final total on the job or metrics ... for the seasons and hoping the team left a themes in Chicago\nWhat was the final total in that job we never did because there was a couple of games and the grand scheme of things that the brewers should have won in the ... so what is the final total beach should they've ended up winning a few more games along the way\nIt ended up being sixteen games that the brewers won but should have lost and there were twelve games which were were should've won but ended up losing so that came out two plus four wins above expected results there you go so still\nUm becomes took advantage of a couple of series the brewers took advantage of a series hotter team down the stretch has certainly been the Milwaukee Brewers so I understand where you're coming from\nI don't know how cocky I Would feel right now as you had that one game playoff in Wrigley Field and after poring it on on St Louis suddenly to be stymied by ... scene and would consider to be the best best ... baseball\nI don't know how good I'd be feeling about it the the cup certainly have the ability to score runs I'm not ... the cubs are not put it this way mark if you think that I Want to see the Bruins play the cubs because I think that the easier out wrong\nIt's not\nBut I Want to see the brewers play the cubs because\nThe only way that you finally get over on cubs in cubs fans in this Miller Park or you know south Wrigley Field north than all the stuff that goes back and forth the more that is brewers in cubs fans is divide is by beating them in the postseason I mean look at it this way\nFor whatever the bears do\nFrom here until the end of time there is nothing ever you can say short of meeting up with the Packers and the super bowl which won't happen because they play in the same divisions same conference\nYou can't do anything ever win lose at home the NFC championship game to hand how his trophy over to the Green Bay Packers in your house\nSo no matter what you do from here on out that will ever be tattooed and the lure of the rivalry between the Packers and bears when it comes to the brewers and the cubs it's been a shortly bribery going to be honest with you\nThe brewers for the most part having being in the rivalry discussion when it comes to the cubs because the cubs have always considered instill do their main rival to be the St Louis cardinals\n\nIt's just now becoming something\nBut the only way brewers fans who feel disrespected in in ... times the only way for them to feel better for this thing to become a rivalry in the truest sense is for this brewers team to beat the cubs and the postseason\nOtherwise the cubs will consider still the Milwaukee Brewers in up and coming team but still the net that flies around their face that they had the swat down they don't consider them as as\nI mean like look sportscasters writers things like that they do there's respectability factor there because they understand what the brewers are putting the get put together but when it comes to come to an sculpture like okay we're still in the postseason will still when this thing and then they go and be Milwaukee though like we told you so no big deal\nWhoever happens to be correct so that's the only way you're going to respectability factor eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight

life insurance and that's the general principle that you move towards a mountain\nPanther house off in December so they don't have any debt um\nAnd so you know as a matter of fact and the more wealth you have the less and less we need to worry about replacing your income for the good of your family\nMhm right if you're having up oil that your family is fine and you have no debt and your family's fine without your income then we don't worry about the subject anymore because you become self insured your family's falling to the point is is the family needs your income to live\nRight on to the
