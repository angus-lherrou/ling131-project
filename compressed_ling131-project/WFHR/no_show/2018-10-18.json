going to know um [noise] we watched that a lot and uh one of the shows or someone said something about a pack of\nAnd uh I at the time he laughed until it was pretty funny apparently but I just wanted to know and my wife and I are worth saving up and working to uh start our own ranch and a re they'll pack because I Want to know if you knew something that I didn't and maybe I should change course or something\nI don't even remember what you're talking about but um I guess I can comment on our practice I was trying I think we're talking about ...\nI Believe that it was you know went broke several years ago 'cause there was a new fad\nAnd a bunch of people ... and then there was supposed to be there's a huge demand for the meat and it basically a bunch of crap there was no demand for him your mate\nAnd pretty soon people just said daddy amuse everywhere but I'm a you know alpacas I mean I I Know I'm not an expert on alpacas I'm not even an expert on ranches but from a business perspective I think you're entering a pretty narrow market\nAgree\nAnd you better really no your stuff and you better really do this you can't do it just 'cause you read some article about alpacas were making people rich goes or not I mean any more than any more than cows are making people rich cows my people pretty poor all the time and some of them they make people rich\nBut as far as do other running a business a cult cattle you know and in a business and when it ceases to be a business starts to be a fad um or never becomes a business goes all of this was a fad than there you go so what is the deal what are you ... what do you get out of our ... what's the product\n[noise] end product is the police or you can use me um you can turn into sweaters and socks and so forth I'm very similar to Kashmir and the quality of the police you know um [noise] and ah there you can also breed and uh\nSo seldom I'm\nGoing to show them and all that um [noise] but ... it's almost completely about the fleece a and a big part of it is it's a ... and stuff so with everybody that have allergies my my children for example have allergies I'm\nArguing that are that you have you been in agriculture and renting before no this'll be my first venture into it um so why would our first\nVenture into ... with a very narrow product line\nWell that is actually the second half of it I'm a first start I'll be starting with goats and I have a uh my I don't have all of the expertise myself it's a good friend of mine who does and we're gonna be working together [noise]\n[noise] um I'm thinking oh he's doing\nOkay All right cool well as long as you got more than five years I Would use a simple growth stock mutual fund\nOr a series of them or something like that I probably would just shoes and this and the index fund\nBecause it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out I as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in\nAnd so I start a business and\nFund an index fund and use that to grow for the next five ten years or so and do you buy a house as long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nAnd that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar thing Scott and sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment\nAnd um even if I don't have five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and uh 'cause I can afford for it to go down if I mess up a little bit but you know that that's the direction I Would go good question Rob is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick crafting a so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a nurse and that that I Am wondering if I should go back to school again next year\nI'm so my question is if they work for me to go to a call now I'm thirty two years old my life\nTwenty nine we make a combined income right now after a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand a year or so if I go to school it's going to cost me ... years of not working\nOn that tuition of around Ninety thousand dollars mhm um [noise] but uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful together that would be close to a three hundred thousand mhm\nSo uh but\nUh what do you make a year now\nAre right now run Seventy thousand\nOkay so you're saying there's going to cost you a three hundred grand three years or three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket yeah okay can you cash flow than any other pocketing can you live on her income or you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school [noise] um but I don't think I can cash anything right now because I I and I also don't have a house or at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house\nOr or putting at least that putting a down payment for a house next year before I start school so\nThen you need to wait until you can pay for school I Would never in Thirty years are doing the show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school\nOkay you got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter of when you do it and what you put first ... seconds you might plenty of money to come up with ... grand yeah plenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just got to see in your budget how you can cash flow would um I can see it pretty easily ... owns it take to go through the class again or go\nTo a different it's a three year program so thirty grand a year or thirty grand a year yeah yeah and and she makes what\nShe makes a hundred and fifty thousand\nYou can't catch ... already granted I'm a hundred and fifty\nA law not when I'm not in coal\nIf you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and ... already thousand over a hundred and fifty to go to school year for three years\nI I'm Sorry fifty thousand it it's a it's going to be around a sixty thousand a year\nI thought you said it was Ninety thousand sorry I got that wrong it's it's a sixty thousand a year seems high yet it is a it is an expensive program you know go to a less expensive program so that\nMuch cash flow it whenever you're going to pay for it\nFigure out a way to pay for the pies you go you don't necessarily have an old style stacked up ahead of time but you got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you go get student loans because here's the thing everyone starts that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans just aren't that program has on student loans whether they finish or not\nAnd then you've got what's known as a freaking mess and so I'm not suggesting you're dumber you can't pass the test or something like that my life happens dude and the last thing you want the only time debt works as if everything works other than that that doesn't work and so we tell you to stay away from it\nThanks for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Joshua is in Dallas texas Hi Joshua how are you\nI'm good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nSo basically I Am stuck in between whether I should for bankruptcy or just go ahead and start paying 'em all my at all\nUm that Nobel basically all my debts except my car or any collection so that's why that's the only reason I'm basically contemplating um bankruptcy why are they only go actions\nUm they're like own medical bills um one is it is a car that guy I'm ... I lost my job and the I think I think like a phone bill in America mhm\nOkay so how much is the ...\nI'm actually only like a couple of grand ... what I have on there is a tiny ... or neutered and forty five dollars from an old apartment\nMhm how long ago was three and a half years ago\nOkay and how ... how much are much older and wiser medical data began\nI Would say about two thousand and how much of that if you got\nThe activated mixed in there with like my phone bill and payday Lowe now so\nYou're you're totally that's less than twenty thousand dollars\nRight and then I have a my car which is a twelfth out mhm okay and what do you make a year\nI'm a little bit old forty five I make a thousand a week I'm a independent contractor\nMhm when you're single or married you're married owner and\nI'm twenty eight on Saturday\nThe happy birthday does she work outside the home\nUm does she stay on their daughter\nOkay go ahead and well let me tell you what I'm hearing okay and I think I'm hearing maybe I'm wrong I'm a ... cat used to say that that is not the problem it's a symptom\nOf something else that's going on I'm right and it sounds like you guys have never told your money what to do you've never had any savings for emergencies so every time an emergency comes up you get thrown out of an apartment or your car gets ... and you end up with a mess\nYes they're so we've got to get you on a plan where you are telling your money what to do or you're going to be back here if I waved to one and made all this debt go way which is what bankruptcy might do maybe I'm if it did that make you have zeroed out all of a sudden except your car\nIf you don't change their habits that caused this mess on the first place you'll be back right where you are some guy do you agree\nYes there you know so we really need to get under that does bankruptcy doesn't solve that uh you got to solve that in the mirror you and your wife learning how to handle money I don't think you're bankrupt I think you're scared disorganized don't know what to do and have done nothing so far\nI think you can probably shuttle that old apartment that for three or four grand if you're saved it up and offer them a lump sum settlement uh I\nI've actually call them a multiple times where I started listening to you that was one of the first video that I was looking up without a debt collectors you know under use\nIt don't it doesn't change my answer to whether it's nine thousand or three thousand new still not bankrupt\nIt's still about you getting control your money\nAnd when you do that then you're going to see your way through this bankruptcy is not a debt problems such behavior problems got\nI'll help you out I'm a singer family the total money make over both read that take an extra job sell everything inside some of this mess to clean up I'll show you how\nToday Ramsey show [noise]\n\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of

tell you what I don't know I mean you got to sit down and figure out how you're going to do this in layers but maybe you maybe you assist her partially in return for her engaging in behavior that she knows you're supposed to be doing\nOK but so far she has refused all help that has to do with her ... up yeah I was a little kid my dad used to say straighten up and fly right you ever heard that\nI don't know what that man's I don't even know what that means I just knew we'd better straighten up I never did flies are I don't know what he meant but I didn't fly right you know but you know what

she refuses to do the things because the pain to go away\nAnd ... ...\n... and you're more concerned about her behavior than she is\n\nSo I think that I think I just sit down and tell her all that to

in the clan or all the headset stared each other right now Jose all to be hit a ball deep to rice will be best went back tried to play it's set it on the angle you look at [noise] I don't know if the ball was over the fence or not but uh his glove came in contact with some fans and now we're trying to determine if this fan interference\nWill just be a double will this be a home run a our guests are collectively here's what double guys you're saying double bread and Alex I think so yeah yeah I think it's can probably be a double decker ... not a home run well I think it was a home run a but I mean listen those fans pay big money to sit there by the way through Houston guys in the front\nRow it ... that has to play right bill to help coding chair of the none of the home run but without the fan or parents who makes that catch\nYeah but the fans pay good money to sit where they said and to have a play or go into their area and come into contact with him I think it's unfair as well\nYou know they might as well put the seats in the er the outfield dirt if that's how I feel\nSo why don't they you know why don't they do it like a like a regular you know where they've got a fence that hangs out over the ivy\nYou know what I mean so fans can't really interfere with the players and you know what's your band the third baseline and your department that that's all\nJust leave the interference the ivy itself\nYes yeah exactly so anyways um by the way I don't know what takes the damn well we've seen six replays they've had a still shut a book or not is still shot but they've had to close to the movie best now for God Knows how long as he's talking to his players and then they cut away to Joe West in the other two\nAre umpires that are just sitting there staring at each other with a headset on I mean really the New York can't\nCan't come to a conclusion what you're saying yeah you don't have no idea what the corner it's how to prepare you we are enjoying the stars of tonight and that would be Joe West and it's on par and grow\nThis is why we watched postseason baseball because we can look at Joe West that bought right now\nI'd rather watch Joe West of the golden corral buffet thing called a baseball game\nOh they calling out\nHow's that do home run do double that said out apparently they said the uh I mean I'm assuming because it sounds down to the fed itself or the fan himself came in contact with Mickey bets glove his glove closed\nA but how do you how do you determine at that point to me the ball seemed like it was either at the fence or over the fence or he's making the call so I I don't know how you can determine that if a fan was there he would have made the catch to me that's a double would have to be a double\nYeah you and I thought that was the last outcome I thought would be an out\nI thought it'd be double I use it was ... loves\nRight although the one replay I saw down the line it looked to me this movie one up over the wall his Mitt was passed\nThe home run line of defense so he's in the he's in the uh the the stadium stands itself where people are standing of course they've got their hands that they are trying to catch the ball so to me if the if the contact was made with the the fans the glove and the ball on the other side of the fence\nI guess you can call pass are passing affairs but but the fan interference but I Would think would be a double because you can't just assume that if the fans were there he would have made the catch right on the other side of the the the whole redline [noise] sort of way is AJ hitched

problem with that call I I mean you're you're assuming that he's going to make the case that movie that's going to make a catch and that's that's a big assumption right there for will hit bottom was over the wall anyways uh we'll move on a Thursday Night Football coming up tomorrow ladies gentleman a that will feature the Broncos\nAnd the cardinals are two teams right now who are struggling\nMightily John Elway says we're playing for our lives Steve will says if we don't play better we're all going to get fired as Michael Cohen by the way the office of coordinator here in Arizona has been under fire\nA for a lot of different things that have been able to school and he points there not one of the games David Johnson\nUh who when played under Bruce areas or was featured weapon in his office I mean he lined up as a wide receiver a slot in the backfield he rented now they're they're they're feeding him to football a little bit more but uh there are still coming up short\nAnd I thought to myself in fact I was talking to a couple of guys today big fans here in the valley of uh all sports issue cardinals cetera about this whole thing and I'm just you know wondering\nAt what point in time those might McCoy get his walking papers or\nDo you give the guy in a year or two because he's got a rookie quarterback I mean you've got Josh Rosen who by all accounts has played perfectly but not bad probably well enough to win a couple of games\nUm you know in years past you would say that as a rookie quarterback given some time\nBut it seems to me that the rope was very short here\nIn Arizona meanwhile all the Broncos had been pathetic we were talking about uh I gave up over three hundred yards rushing to the jets they got gas to get last week by ... really went over two hundred yards\nAnd the rams and are now you've got a bunch of guys who apparently have gotten the message from John Elway that a role playing for our lives and um\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nGive me money you're under center on this Wednesday night more along the lines are overly find find Ricky free for these guys did you did you hear the sound of a\nWay of looking at an explanation yet as to why we baseball on the side of the aisle to get\nThe right field that was over the wall that was followed by ... because he\nGot entangled with fans why that was an outmoded double\nI was doing my best to reduce closed captioning 'cause it's on the TV in front of me and they ruled fan in fair interference okay [noise]\nSo basically a bunch of Steve Bartman by the way this is in Fenway right so in front of you know there had been made all are they are they are that I mean okay I was wondering I was wondering how a fork pastoral fans got the front row there in right field those guys who came in contact\nWhile while now you know I I'm looking for an explanation and most\nBaseball insiders are not necessarily dumbfounded by seeing the word unbelievable uh almost as bad as the infield fly rule that\nGot the Braves are and also a joke from Bob nightingale the u._s._a. today baseball insiders so that there was replay of two thousand three does that mean that Moises Alou gets credit for making that catch and we've never heard of Steve Bartman\nYeah no I again I to me it seemed to me whether he came in contact with the fans are not that his ... was outside the field of play was over the fence you know if a fence continues to infinity vertically or his hand was over the fence so at that point in time I don't know how you can have an interference but it\nMust be an angle that we haven't seen or a definitive point of view that\nMay be Alberto river on his moonlighting for major league baseball\nMetal my prayer the rules expert\nOur job west I mean he's not going to die\nAll right uh wanted to uh to get to this uh this whole jaguars store which is really interesting Shankar the owner\nOf jaguars apparently has been in the ... for some time\nI'm wanting to buy ... stadium\nRight which is I'm I've done games that went way fantastic place it shoots a complex is mass like\nA hundred and twenty thousand people right yeah\nNo yeah that well Sally yeah but I mean everything around it is I mean the parking garages and they've got some retail stuff off I mean it's it's massive just massive it's beautiful place anyway she was a in these talks and apparently\nA those talks now have broken off and shot Khan released a statement today saying that he will no longer be moving forward by the soccer stadium\nThat also hosts those uh NFL games a con claimed that there's too much opposition for him to be able to go through with this purchase a in the state and he says quote I cannot rule out revisiting the opportunity of another time when perhaps the Football Association family talking about the NFL\nIs unified and its views on the opportunity what is certain is seeing a proposal of this magnitude come to fruition witness acetate an extraordinary partnership one capable of doing remarkable things for all of our respective constituents well into the future and quote\nA bunch of fancy words there that basically say there was some NFL Owners that had a problem with this and apparently he would like to be able to\nCome together for what could be um\nA deal that of monumental proportions are but it was going to require some extraordinary partnerships apparently he wasn't able to build\n... and ... by the Football Association is yes\nLike the the NFL Football Association I Believe is a European soccer [noise] uh I don't believe so\nWhat have you ever heard of Football Association associated with the NFL\nUm well I don't know when when have you ever heard football soccer called football over there in in London\nBecause shot Khan is originally based from London and owns a soccer team so he'd be referring to the other soccer teams\nOr that are so it's also an NFL team would it would be referring to it as football\nNo because you have the soccer team [laughter]\nLike the Football Association I Will Google this is the is the body that makes up all of the saliva British football permanently Jose like\nWatching and see I I took it the ... I took it the other way because I say hold on these\nIll association family is unified and its views on the opportunity what is certain is seen a proposal this magnitude come to fruition necessity resorted\nTo the Football Association as the governing body of association football in England the ground dependencies ... years old\nSo I took that wrong so you're saying now that the Football Association with their England got in the way and they didn't want to concentrate the Steve\nThat is correct I kind of I mean I could see it from both ways though because I Would imagine that if the NFL had a home base in London you know those that are waiting in line whether it be for Super Bowls are hosting draft you know they wouldn't want to see any line cutting just because we have a bigger a bigger stadium and a\nA larger slash newer fan base that would love to get their feet wet with these big NFL that's not saying that there is a Super Bowl happening in London and\nWith that that's not going to educate or anything like that but what was it obviously they're they're playing more and more games in ... and a shout God has already said that he is jaguars will play at least the game over there for the foreseeable future\nAnd so he's got a stake in this but there was that there was a lot of speculation in the in fact ... that he might move the jaguars to London I Can't see that happening and listen\nPeople it's amazing you know you take the the the train system there which I did back and forth from downtown London because traffic so crazy went way they call it yeah the two and uh it's amazing that hundreds of thousands of people\nAnd uh I mean every Jersey imaginable you I mean they're just NFL fans don't listen to the the rams could be playing the Vikings and it wouldn't matter you'd see you'd see jerseys from every team all thirty two teams there people are just crazy about it but I'm thinking to myself or are they crazy enough\nTo fill that stadium eight times and and still have let's say three exhibition games over there [noise] um which I guess would be\nA coup for the NFL but I just don't know how you do that\nNow the only other the only other way I think you could do that would be to be in a situation where a for instance a jaguars would play two or three home games and then go on the road for two or three weeks and stay on the road and then ... you know one of those kinds of things uh but I just don't know how you have teams and less\nOn the schedule the team that went to London would have a by the following week every week and you'd have to do that but I I just see it is [noise]\nI see the travel in the distance as too big a bridge to cross right now for the national football league I Know they want to continue to expand a you know their their footprint if you will internationally and they've they've they've done a really good job so far in London but\nThey but they talked about doing an exhibition game in China and like why the hell is going on China\nYou know it's we keep we keep talking about a potential\nI just immediately think of the the the conversation you had in the first hour with the LA charges and they can't get a foothold in the second market why withdrawn are\nGoing to walk in my back on the war was not enough infrastructure Barry owning a stadium all that kind of stuff with after that debate you have to figure out how those teams the other Fifteen teams are thirty two teams are going to get there and get back\nI mean it's hard on the entire NFL proceedings quick right we come back to ... our friend from Sports Illustrated will join us next year under center I'm more Columbus NBC Sports radio [noise]\nStill mourning magazine was Tuesday through friday than I Am with\nInformation they want to do with\nThe Web page or on your NBC Sports radio what brought\nMine used an object that is because I did I gave for being a else yes with the Astros tried to pull even with the red Sox were up to

back to the walking up three games to\nOpening night in the NBA have an extra boy the hearts of the garden I did I Seventy nine\nNBC Sports radio [noise]\nHey I'm Andy if you don't know me it's probably because I'm not famous but I did start screaming company called Harris the idea for Harry's came out of a frustrating experience I had buying razor blades most friends were overpriced over designed and out of touch at Harry's or approaches simple here's our secret\nWe make sharp terrible blades and sell them at honest prices for as low as two dollars each we care about quality so much that we do some crazy things like by WorldCom German blade factory obsessing over every detail means we're confident in offering a hundred percent quality guarantee millions have guys have already made the switch to Harry's so thank you if you're one of them\nAnd if you're not we hope you give us a try with the special offer get Harry starter set with a five blade razor waited handle shaved Joe and a travel cover all for just three bucks plus free shipping\nThey put their receivers and mine is split full picture the painted numbers on the field and the receivers lined up inside of those numbers as opposed to outside we wide receivers typically line up when you condensed information like that when you put your receivers and close\nIt bunches up the deep end and it makes it harder for defenders to interact because they now they have to worry about running into each other so I often what you get the centers wind up backing up and spreading out actually in that response\nSo often says if they want it combat is the best way to do it it's often it's not through the plane designed so much you can be through your formation and where do you put your wide receivers\nTerrific stuff again we're talking with any been away the NFL analysts for Sports Illustrated\nYou understand we got a Thursday night match up two teams that are struggling badly I Know you've been watching tape of the car does but I Want to get to the Broncos first\nJohn Elway says they're playing for their lives a defense is getting gas by the wrong key scheme them is in anything that they hold a he might be when you put the table and if you had to start one place that they have to get solved this week against Arizona where would it be [noise]\nWell I Would normally say run defense Arizona's running games are not doing much right now but it's it's mark is totally unacceptable for Denver to be at the bottom of the league\nAnd run defense they have a very talented front seven and not just a talented front that white guys who individually are excellent run defenders every week I put on the filming all seven of those guys linebacker Todd Davis Brandon marshals certainly von Miller and Bradley Chubb\nDOMA topical Adam gossip is Derek wolf inside all of them may flash plays and run defense\nBut collectively together they're not playing well and varying Stewart and Bradley Roby in the defense the backfield they've missed some tackles that's inflated the run numbers allowed right now it's a bad run defense and there's no excuse for because it should be off of their talent it should be an easily a top ten run defense\nIs is that again would you know staying within their scheme itself is is that just having good gap control and good responsibility or guys just kind of you know freelance or to get out of their desks and they're getting gas that way [noise]\n[noise] yeah that's a good question I I mean it's always a good neighbor whenever thirty seconds going to be a combination of all of the above I mean it takes a lot to get to bed last in the league\nBut I think this one show up as those defensive backs have been the least gaps sound they would be expected every team's defensive backs will be the worst tackling gaffe thrillers but those guys have struggling a little more than you'd like to see 'em so I Would ...\nBad um but it's you know that's a great question you asked Joe was there the coordinator I'm sure he can tell you have five or six would seem like little things that are quite big things that are run Defense Fund offenses very nuanced there's a lot of bodies and in very small amount of space and so it becomes about angles and technique\nYeah All right meanwhile Arizona a lot of people are willing to give coaches whether it's people from my McCoy some we used because you've got a rookie quarterback and Josh Rosen who's played All right I mean he has this at the world on fire but he has been horrible either but this football team continues to struggle when you put the tape on of Arizona what's their biggest issue\nI don't see an awful offense of identity and there is a reason they should have one I mean I hate to say should you know it's easy for me to say that my record I'm sure he puts in a lot of work\nBut for example David Johnson last season I wrote my field notes that they watch it never gets Minnesota he's not a part of the passing game he's not the they're not going to empty formations like they did on their Bruce Erin's\nWhere you really stressed that defense when you've got to levy on bell or David Johnson type of weapon\nThey're not doing that and one of my researchers after ... saw my film note said yeah the fat that we've found from next Gen stat David Johnson lined up on the receiver twenty percent of the time back in twenty sixteen is laugh fully healthy that he was a superstar that here\nIs wind up as a receiver three point five percent of the time this year they're just not using them in the past in gangs\nAnd the other thing is they don't have an intermediate passing game sites that partly why that's a big reason why Larry Fitzgerald he didn't know who he was you wouldn't think twice about them when you're watching they're often they don't design a whole lot more than they are not an intermediate passing team\nRight now it's outside the numbers throws which is fine Rosen can actually make those pretty well and it's selective play action beep shots but there's not a whole lot in between and the the byproduct of this\nIs their running game and passing game when you don't have an intermediate pass it runs gaming packing don't overlap very much and so now you're easier to defend tactically and I think we've seen that it hasn't been an overly creative running game\nAnd I got a bit of a minute left but you wrote another interesting article on Monday morning quarterback about the raiders and the John ruins return is essentially of last year for them explained to me one\nHe's everything you need to know about the raiders and is this is on the fence that Paul Gunther their coordinator to decision and to be fair he played this way in Cincinnati to he liked to rotate players\nBut not like this the raiders have one guy who's playing more than eighty percent of the snaps right now in general pretty much that flying back or to hear Whitehead\nEvery other position has been having the rotation addict guys or something in something out and it's not because they're a deep deep than doing when you are rotating it ten out of eleven spots what church coaching staff\nIs passively thing is we don't like our roster we don't like our players we don't we don't know who's good we don't have a lot of confidence in these guys\nDo they do I think they like some of the young guys but marking curtains been saying they're beating around the Bush all year sure they they they probably won't forty new players on that team right now\nWow that's that's nuts but you say I mean he didn't draft any of those guys another regime against these guys but as far as he's concerned they're not his guys you just move on and I know you're busy guy we appreciate you taking a break from watching all that tape my friend and I always enjoyed the conversation or have a good rest of your weak and enjoy the football this weekend my friend\nAll right Thanks Mark you got it any but only ladies and gentlemen

thing he wants to answer these questions it's as if he's looking at his watch going queen please finish this up\nI kind of a playoff game here I got to manage right\nAnd in the day and age of anti ... analytics you can't sit back like Jim ... smoking in the dugout going All right after seven I got to start managing\nLike these guys are all micromanage eager to get to the micromanaging 'cause we saw maybe the best example of micro managing we have seen yet tonight let's get to that here\nCraig council manager of the Milwaukee Brewers\nWanted kind of made me today feel that I should put a football helmet on and drive my head to the TV set\nThe thought of doing it except it's my girlfriend smart TV and I don't want to pay for it but the fact is when you start weighed Miley who last time I checked in game two one five and two thirds and didn't allow run I understand he's going on short rest here\nMonday through a grand total of five pitches in this game as the starter he actually gets credit as the starting pitcher in this game for throwing five pitches and not registering a single out\nBecause he walked off it around five pictures\nBankrupt council takes the long walk to the mound that's made baseball games now three and a half hours to four hours long in the postseason for nine innings three to two game\nTakes the long walk points out to the bullpen and I'm thinking to myself is he getting me\nIf there's over managing were watching it at its finest he pulls way Molly after five freaking bitches for Brandon would rough I Wonder if it's well don't I'm not going to downgrade what he did they just\nAre you trying to win games by just tricking the opposing team is that what it is August set your line of its left the heavy because wait Mali's on them out today Roberts five pitches later he's out [noise] yeah I got my brain and what are they now know bigger changes your line of work so well they lost that I find it to\nIts over managing but you actually sits there going how good trick day Robert to the Dodgers today how am I going to out clever and our analytic bay Roberts so wait Miley\nHey wait come here come here come into our steel enforced room that's been sweat for listening devices that Dodger Stadium by the secret service said\nI Know you're starting but [laughter] you're getting one batter calling so clever while skip that's awesome like I Can't believe this clever skip oh my goodness they're not expecting this one five to two last later I'm sitting here going and\nAnd you're so clever what you're so clever you're down three games to do now\nI don't understand this strategy I don't and look I just analytics in baseball to me it's ruining the game like why\nCan't it be easy anymore right why can't you know starting pitcher who may get an early trouble and he's allowed to work through it the way that you've always had in baseball right\nHow many times have you picture gun and give it up to run to the first thing you're like oh my goodness these teetering right he's on the ropes next thing you know six more shutout innings if you use the analytics today claim commercial would have been taken out in the second in it\nBecause he struggled early on gay but early runs given up three hits early and you know what happened the last five minutes that will be able to hit\nBut in the world of analytics or baseball it's like whoa you just struggling a little bit on what am I going to do well I guess we have to take him out because that's what the analytics telling me right only punches all into that computer\nWhat is the telling me\nGot reminds me of like sponge Bob where uh you know that that that that little plankton you know the plankton he's evil guy he's married to the computer and she spin out numbers and things like that that's what it is I mean these guys like ... council have the secret computer that they carry around like a nuclear football that travels with the president\nIs handcuffed to then\nAnd only that little computer it's like oh my God and when it was his computer telling me to do so and it's like everything it's all the little ... things that the analytics and analytics later you're down three games to being so clever later you're down three games to two\nLook at the sports though it didn't they get an advantage by putting in Brandon would roof you look at it splits against right handed hitters in against left handed hitters and not much of a difference as far as batting average against\nThen if you look at the Dodgers hitters just some sort of playing against anyone anyone yep many child's going to play against anybody any one\nMonth the early ... you're going to my own end as was in there right over ...\nHernandez his splits tell you that I get Fridays and left the ...\nSo what is you do what what exactly that credit council do okay this is what he did\nDavid Freese that's the guy [laughter] so David Freed the reason why you do this and you have a terrible hitter against right handed pitching so I don't know I mean he's better gets left and that is a ... foot\nYou know what show they sat there wondering how to beat the David Freese effect for an hour All right I got to guys this is how we beat freeze I don't care about them a shot or month the or any of the guys how are we going to beat David Freese here and game number four I got it skipped what's that will start weighed\nYou'll throw five pictures\nAnd then we'll bring your brain and wonder what do you think oh my goodness you're a genius tell you that that's incredible start you know your way might be a healthy unfold rats that probably five pitches pregame sex and that was it the way my way to keep us in this post season it doesn't work for me\nBecause here's the thing that's different alright and don't bring up Tampa Bay 'cause it's a difference Tampa Bay had to do this out of necessity right Tampa Bay just didn't have any starters\nSo Kevin Cash it's like how many did what am I going to do I can't call the entire AAA team and have the pitch games do you how do these games All right this is how I Do it because what Blake smell pitch guess what he actually was allowed to pitch\nYou weren't starting place for two innings intellectual telling you okay bringing someone else because he's gone through the you know the the line up once\nDark side to discover\nWow beautiful blessed that come together to created on forget ... century [noise]\nThis is the fourth or fifth one wants to run to you what the council and the U.S Forest Service says\nWell I'm Glad you enjoyed it but I think it's

actually pretty well just post season it's just that he's got\nTerrible here I'm not a fan of hair from one to get that out of the way to what our mind it but I don't like it not a fan or is it a an improvement over what he had before that that's where you have to\nRemember yeah I don't remember so it must have been decent enough that we don't remember I was like wild and walk you wish that we tried to keep it short okay for the wrong with that now he's got it all looks don't tied it looks like it hurts your scalp\nI don't know I I like All right oh I get you get that\n... that I'll be interested I couldn't do that you can blow it all tried actually when I was younger\nBut had longer hair when I was like Eighteen Nineteen he tried to grow it kind of hair really yeah didn't work with them because I have short haired it it's hard to read it it's a it's like angel hair pasta just doesn't work [laughter]\nHere's the thing about maybe even ... he's a dirty player okay the Milwaukee Brewers kept saying that yesterday after a little uh hey Susan ... kicked them in the the legacy went over the first base Baghdad years like as far back on the bag\nWalk a fine for today and undisclosed amount I I agree I've watched them play numerous times I Do find that it was a dirty play Machado the dirty player but he's a dirty job though after the game talking about taking this or do you have to say about it\nI mean you saw a replay probably so this was I trying to get over him for about thirty five thirty I mean I don't\nWhich one do we would go away by within a minute ago so whatever happens throughout the field in between the lines\nThat will be your friends though [laughter]\nYou might have waited to monitor the other but you certainly aren't friends out your did that look I play first base in high school you don't have your foot on the bag you have a ball of your foot against the bag when you're first base we actually use it as leverage for your for your stretch\nOut here it's good I I was wondering where the foot one yes it was a little far back on the base\nBought\nThe fact is much I don't have the entire half to right side of the back of a child was running inside the line which by the way you should be automatically out and you're supposed to be typed but we my baseball standards but\nMuch made it a point to kick ... why because ... leg without a bit far and you're spending your message which was the way it is dangerous rag your to do that if it's more of a bang bang playing the runners hustling down the line he's not looking he could clip at your and next thing you know he's going to talk about our job so\nDidn't have to happen but ... has a history of this look at the two times at second base that he went in the day before where he used his hand to try to alter or see get a second time he got called for interference and they end up calling a double play\nAnd like we saw they replayed it end Machado had you know at at smacked is growing area with his head he's a dirty bomb or yellow says right walk around the locker room and days of dirty and that for you right\nBut the problem with the shuttle is in that I'm not really I don't care about that that much okay dirty or not doesn't matter\nI still pay a dirty player because of dirty player could still be a really good player what bothers me about mainly but China is the fact that he would actually admitted that whatever one interview\nThat he's not a hustler he's not a hustle Blair he actually came out ... I'm not Johnny hustle I've tried but it's just not me I played the same way it's just not it's not the only\nWay we wait you're admitting in your contract year\nWhere you're on the verge of whatever this season ends becoming a free agent that could maybe the most lucrative free agent contract in the history of baseball you and Bryce Harper going to battle it out this off season for that honor and you're at a meeting you don't hustle\nI've never heard of a play by the way most major league players that we don't hustle the next time Albert pools breaks the sweat running in the first first base will be a first time\nThe only way I guess Rob you cannot whatever hospital the first base is if his dealer was waiting for him okay with his latest bachelor a cycle because he never hospitals\nVery few players like each year rower Derek Jeter that literally how slid down the line and make every play close even the routine ones and sometimes you make an infielder hustler throw and elite sooner and you're on base because they know that you're you know your your high telling you down the line\nBut I've never heard of pools I've never heard of I've never heard anybody actually admit they dog it\nI've never heard of bright Bryce Harper dogs down the line he got in trouble for that right as manager went after him for that but I've never Bryce Harper actually say yeah I I just don't try I've tried it in the past but I just can't change my habits but that's exactly what my mini Machado said\nWhy former major league baseball team would I give a ten year three hundred four hundred million dollar contract to a guy who just admitted that he doesn't hustle once that inks dry on a ten year three hundred and fifty million dollar contract what's he's incentive to hustle\nOnce there's incentive to play hard play harder not play hard he's collecting every single penny that contract\nIf a guy is brave enough to admit that he's not working hard which means I'm not offering why am I going to reward of\nHey if you're the Phillies good luck with that Goldstein and throw your money at this guy and watch them lollygag done to first base and the fans going to be yelling at him bone Adam\nMarketing the Yankees all this talk I I mean he had you been why wouldn't the Yankees won a guy that Mitch he doesn't play hard they already have won his name's Gary stand jets they had one in Robbie could oh do you need another guy making a ton of money no thank you\nThe angels I mean I've heard that one ... they have pools already he's only a younger version of a guy that jog down to first base line I I'm I'm just absolutely sick\nConsidering most of us would try and give up our left leg to be a professional athlete that much talent shot [noise]\nWas the way at first base for the dirty\nDidn't have to kick a suicide yours like he could have gone on the outside of the bag and done it\nFight them you know what happened then an actual world not just war that would have been an actual brawl why NFL so interesting article he got to get something back there for the divorce rate in your\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] what\nAre your NBC Sports radio with the tail for use in

that we do some crazy things like by world cause German blade factory obsessing over every detail means we're confident in offering a hundred percent quality guarantee millions of guys have already

he's dangerous\nSo far is absolutely correct when he assesses that'd be a film needs to get him out of the league\nHow many more opportunities this bond test perfect time to prove that he is the dirtiest player in sports to that you're talking about mainly Machado being dirty bomb tests perfect not only would have spiked hey suicide yard he would have stood on this cat with is clean and twisted\nAnd then sucker punched him in the back to just to top it off\nI have no respect for ... years the sad thing about bond as perfect but this is a guy I remember that Arizona State he was a heck of a player\nAnd then he wasn't even drafted because he had such a terrible history the Bengals pick him up on draft rookie Frasier I think he started from day one he's been up in terms of his abilities on the field bumped as perfect as a talented player\nBut his entire career and any accomplishments that he has had to this point to me\nThey don't even register because when I think of the name ... perfect I think of the most dirty player in sports\nShould investigate could Ben Roethlisberger had made up his claim of your next surely quota but doesn't it behooves the NFL and the neighbor player safety to investigate it if it happened\nAnd if in fact volunteers perfect pointed to Smith shoestring declared year next he should be out of the week because he doesn't let things go obviously you don't think the next time they play\nHe don't think he's going to be going after him of course he is that's just as nature he's uncontrollable\nHe's dangerous shown I'll tell you what\nI Love the violence of football I Do football's popular because we as a society love the violence right people back and they went to watch gladiators literally kill each other in the ring boxing at the height of the sport was incredibly popular in these guys are bashing their brains and the bleeding on the court entering we like the other night why you can literally have knockouts in that right\nBlood sport reloaded\nFootball something where you can literally get\nIn front of the field\nAnd attack people and get away with it but there's a limit to what I think we as a society accept and I don't think we accept bond as perfect and his style of football Sean absolutely and\nI Want I Want to ask you this\nOne of the chance of the NFL investigates\nTo find out if\nVon does actually did point at\nJews you and say that your next\n[noise] I don't think it's that complex was there already yeah I don't think they'll do it but he used to have him playing ... wants the planes another game has to wait right because you've already allowed him to play a game after these allegations came out of all\n... first of all what harm is there for the NFL conventional yeah fell could find out if if the gesture at or of even said they have cameras all over the place\nFirst of all you could ask better off the store you can ask Judy Smith Schuster you can start right there if both of them back it up\nYou say okay are they both lying about it as you said there's cameras all over the field you can see if there's a gesture toward Judy Smith Schuster you can kind of frankly at the angles to receive his lips are moving this plane and you can do to to verify this happened or not and honestly if it happened you kick him out of the league\nYou know it's drastic but here's what bothers me too about this Marvin Louis to me it's gutless\nMarvin Louis to me is the guy that continuously pencils von tests perfect into his lineup\nWhere's the accountability uh Marvin Lewis this part to ensure that he's not putting out there a guy whose sole intention is to hurt somebody else\nWhere it was a respect for Marvin Louis to his opponents to not allow a hotbed light Vonn tests perfect go out there\nGot to win games okay as Montana's perfect guy look he's not kill Mac right ... ... you go from you know being a pretty good defense being a great defense the way the bears had been until the dolphin game but that's the whole point I words\nThe there for continuing to put Montana's perfect out there for nine years where the hell it is well you\nBrought up a little Mac and I want them to get your thoughts on the ballot check saying that ... not in Lawrence Taylor class\nI heard that today yeah I Want your thoughts on that I'm surprised Nobel jak would\nSay anything to anything that isn't really that much of a negative gets killed Mac here's this study thing about it opinion which she literally ever\nGives you wait a minute you were talking about LT here as we're developing so what's funny is he probably also said that Mitch which are basically is the greatest quarterback he's seen Joe Montana that he rivals Tom Brady or here's the thing I Want to get your thoughts well here's a line obviously for Bill ... check adored Lawrence Taylor he was just offensive coordinated with the giants\nFor anybody to think there's anything remotely wrong with Bill bell checked saying look it might the way he went on to compliment the hell out of ... Mack okay talk calling him a great player blah blah blah the fact is it's not fair to al ... or ... Mac to compare the two\nCome back back of a player LT revolutionized\nA position All right so here's my question is LT the best defensive player\nIn the history of the national football league I thought of that question today actually because I have free time and I was you know I read those quotes from Bella check\nIt came down to two names for me\nHim an Reggie White [noise] I agree yeah to me I look I Know ... ... ... and then you can join leaking Jones and those guys Chuck veterinary these guys I I didn't watch these guys play okay\nWhen it comes down to the modern era football the super bowl era or or or later you're going to comment on I'm going to go from Nineteen eighty yeah and I was born in Nineteen Seventy Ira accurate right right exactly I became a habit of your horse was criticized a matter of fact she was the second year they start to accumulate fact the fact is\nReggie White and Lawrence Taylor were the most dominant defensive players I have ever seen\nReggie White was unstoppable you knew it was ... he would call the other way literally to strengthen the speed was ridiculous\nThe twenty Saxon twelve games one season Lawrence Taylor was literally unstoppable\nMean there wasn't a player as unstoppable as Lawrence Taylor says had to literally change everything about standard off and says to protect against Lawrence Taylor\nNobel check is a hundred percent correct and he's not saying it to be sly he's not saying it to be critical of clue Mac what he's saying is there was one Lawrence Taylor and there will always be one Lawrence Taylor they have been other great outside linebackers like Derek Thomas and guess what he wasn't Lawrence Taylor either\nLawrence Taylor is the greatest linebacker at least outside linebacker I'll say linebacker and the history of football and one of the two greatest defensive players alongside Reggie White in my mind from Nineteen eighty on in the NFL\nAnd I think that's the line for ballot checking bell check knows football and he understands the impact of Lawrence Taylor Lawrence Taylor coached Lawrence tell he coached Lawrence vale you a little biased\nBut I don't think he's biased because he has won one defensive player of the year or two to four hundred\nPlayed four five six years they'll pay fifty right climatic yes\nBy the way of life a little bit by the way he's not guilty but I mean he's really play five here so I the way of accomplish some more things not only that but if I may be able to go there right now Jay Jay watch the guy talking about right that would rival LTM Reggie White little Mac agree hundred percent yeah let's not let's not go overboard you did not answer my question\nIs it L. T. or is it Reggie White\nYou gave me two names I said who is the best he's the best\nTo do right you know I'm going to charge you you're going to have your Reggie White\nWell it helps that Bill Belichick was the DC for the giants during El Al ... prior to that house scheming and everything [noise] getting him those match ups and I know he's the speed demon undersized kind of outside linebacker three four revolutionize the defense that helped him a lot because it took awhile for NFL often says to you know\nI understand the free forum push us to admit to just do it right and he didn't invent the three four right bell checked but the fact that ah and so I I gotta go I got to go rent you what\nI think that you I was more dominant\nYou're going to do with the Memphis show butter to go Bruce Smith but\nFor Smith is I think when she was better than I think we look they they play the same position I Would go Reggie White in terms of the ease\nSome taken up the though still I think he was more revolutionary this position even more than Reggie White\nSpot about who's the better player who's the more dominant player I ... I think you're prepared more Lawrence ...\nBiggest Taylor could do more on a field\nReggie White was a great pass Russian I can stop the run as well let me speak for a size but he was a guy go sideline to sideline north south east west he was the most complete defensive player he was and I love Reggie White\nI was working hard but I mean there's nowhere to be found in the super bowl with the Buffalo Bills by the way\nAlso what state with the unit that point was that well then you know what I mean where did you why\nPets sixteen seconds thirty seven that matters\nThat's amazing by ...

better person to do so that my good friend Bryan Bollinger spent many years and all kinds of back on the NFL also now yet if I'm network Ninety seven by the the fanatic in Philly Fox Sports ... up all these breakdown nothing better than ball these breakdowns and I have to start by telling you this bride my producer Sean wanted me to tell you\nHe cannot stop watching ball these breakdowns there had passed after they they're great but that will be let's get right to it because you got right down everything you watch more film that anybody I Know\nHe's he like manning done based on what you see\nWhat are you know you weren't going to have this year than he could use your work all day\nViews about is all issues you can get no it hasn't been back that up with a flawless performance is what I'll say this was early\nIn the games against our against the eagles and when he just hit early on it really doesn't matter of your name is brandy are marrying or whatever I mean these guys get affected by that and they don't\nTrust the production and so they let the ball go through early begets you'd already in the pocket and I think that from you our this year Kenny settled down to calm down and make throws the care but you know there's a lot of things broke with that office right now that the guy\nIn the office of the quarterback has been affected by it um there's a lot of issues with that group right now\nIs his skill set still good enough to start in the NFL\nSo good in Europe but I mean the the\nBar at the quarterback position has been raised higher and higher\nYou know what I mean there was a complete and it was Seventy percent completion now there is is the new sixty percent of the guys are thrown under the boats Seventy percent and\nYou know it's just you know it's it's more of it was just a quarterback sleek right now I mean it is it is a passing on the air or where you are right now and go to the point where ... is hoping\nThat Kansas city's scores on Sunday night so we can get the ball back because he knows it's going to go down to win the game as all the all the gay that's kind of work that right now\nAll the while Barclay has been really as good as advertise maybe even better yet there one in five the New York jets are loving what they see from Sam Donaldson you break down\nOpinions obviously an Sam Donald as great as Barkley is should the giants have thought about the you know the succession past the lineup drafted you know Darnell based on what you've seen\nYeah say she would have because\nYou know I gave him ... incredible years\nTwo Super Bowls right nobody can sign up and ask for anything from the fire and they represent sitting in the organization is probably as he did he was the ultimate pro but nobody I mean you really can't expect greatness beyond Fifteen Years from anybody I don't care if it's breeze or greater anybody else\nYou can expect that much more and you never want to be the position we're picking number two again and if you could bring in a new general manager and you bring in the new head coach\nMaybe you should have just cut the cord and Brian Sandoval and built around a young you know a young quarterback right now the way the jets are in last Sunday for the first time since ... it'll be a kind of took the training wheels off let's go play quarterback and it was really good\nNow you know I mean so yes I think they should have done that but that's that's not knocking manning it's just\nFather time and change at the top and sometimes it's just better the weight Doug Peterson came in was you know Carson ways um sometimes just better if you're just you know Sean Payton Drew Brees I mean just kind of build new quarterback of the new coach\nChat with a buddy Brian balding you're here going deep to enforcement NBC Sports where you make sure to check up all these breakdowns great stuff breaking out all the stuff we talked about you watch a lot of the Packers Aaron Rodgers looks like the old Aaron Rodgers last couple of weeks ... even though he's playing injured besides what's wrong with the Packers\n[laughter] well ... you know they're not very good right now they can't really stop anybody I mean the Washington Redskins and wait for that\nThree hundred yards of office at halftime against [noise]\nUm they're playing a lot of young players they're secondary a habit of doing good against the wrong they weren't going against the run against the forty niners on Monday Night\nThat's part of it um I Would say that you know they're they're playing with the guy's name calling me a saint for how to mark has you know ... ... jobs because of the injuries are so [noise] you know they they've got to\nBe able to overcome the injury bug your last Mohammad Wilkerson started

season people whispering MVP MVP I even jailing Ramsey was saying he's a future MVP yet here we are six weeks in the Houston Texans obviously have not been very good when you watch the film under shown watching what's the problem right now\nOr the wind is atrocious to me it's just it's just bad\nUm it's been around blocking game is bad and protection right now they're playing the young guys they got to look you right tackle right now they got a young right guard I mean they're just they're just young\nYou know they've got a left tackle that is questionable if he's a left tackle this business right now I now I mean if you watch 'em they can't really function as an office right now and they may have the best we'll see what all the football\nIn the ... I mean is this is anybody out there but they struggle to get hit the ball what do you do three things happen but to show why\nShe's coming off an ACL care which is already amazing how athletic he all he looks and how healthy he looks but he just took last weekend that just you just can't survive those kind of hit I mean he was twelve times ... times\nYou know they had they force three phone calls it gets used it I mean no quarter back to the door to the type of punishment that he you know endured last Sunday\nMulti you know Andy Reid well you obviously reside in the Philadelphia area you've been around a Andy Reid you look at what he's done just your Patrick ... homes he did it last year with Alex Smith as well who put up big numbers how much of the success from homes he's his own incredible ability and how much of it is this scheme that Andy reads running for him\nWell it's a it's a lot it's a lot of both I mean you can't really independently say Warren versus the other I mean to tell their is free elite you know when you look at Travis Kelsey uses ... and his business if you looked at high retailers nobody faster you look at ... he did win the rushing title you're gone there was a lot of pieces in\nRight there but the one thing about anti that\nIf you watch these games out there and I know you watch but I mean if you really want to them and I think one of their games in Jacksonville couple of weeks ago and he comes over to the bench we're more homes after every series and he sits down with them more country should do this by the way when he sits there are ... and he goes through\nHave means that nobody's ever heard a plane I mean I really do your homework if you think you know the Seattle Seahawks and so they're kind of remaking themselves and they don't\nThe Oakland Raiders from the old series or the game and we're Comey right now it looks like they're going backwards because the author client has really fallen apart or the last collect your family they lost Donald parent that will collect your company will be back or they'll be better position but they're ...\nReally struggled last week and he looked like a rookie left tackle that wasn't ready to play yet and they're counting on him to be really good and he's not right now and so it's it's really uh it's ... it's a it's a little bit of\nEverything right now but mostly I see a big difference in Allen\nIs it fair to criticize green for getting rid of ... Mac based on what we've seen from Mac and of course what we've seen from the raiders defense\nWell I don't know I don't know if it's fair or not because I don't know if it was just totally giants decision\nTo not pay you I'm I'm not if one of them I question that decision because really\nThat's his job to manage the cap although right now he's got to have some input but you have Richard McKenzie do his job it'd be the general manager let Mark Davis in that group you know handle the finances why wouldn't you know what the best player so bearable I've never heard of a coach not wanting to very best players I mean come on back\nInto the leak player we all know that we've seen it but I've never heard of a coach ... ... in a league player especially one that he really had the chance to coach yet but I understand like business business you know somebody does on a franchise steel\nAnd don't want to be franchised I mean there are only leverage is to withhold their services and force you know the teams had well it is is\nYou know what is too expensive for what team certainly wouldn't want it to expensive for the Chicago Bears and they become you know immediately a playoff contending with him on that the fence so I I I don't want to criticize out because I don't know all the right actors that went into a death\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars coming to the season ball the high expectations Exxon believe in I thought they'd be a true Superbowl contender they might be but do you have any baseball that bleep morals can put together three great postseason games I mean to play off games AMC and the super bowl and lead to steam through a Super Bowl can you see\nThe play was the last two weeks but I Want to see ... ...\nWith a semi healthy office wind or other third left tackle right now\nI Would have him with the semi healthy office wine in a healthy let her for that because his team is built around let her for that and if he's not in there just don't bring a change um then you're asking for those to throw the ball with your call of duty west book and\nYou know and make things happen it it's not who he is he's just not consistent enough to do that but if you like they didn't the\nPlayoff game against Pittsburgh last year you get them play actually you give him a letter from that and you and you do pretty good job of really running the ball well it could totally the game like that he can make the necessary reads he can make some clothes he can extend plays and scramble I mean is it different team at politicocom that\nIs the foundation that football team and that's what they're hoping that for that could get back to the hamstring injury and become that guy\nChat with Brian Baltimore and make sure the checkout ball the on his Twitter ... ball the with the why NFL last question ball D you watch more film then frankly anybody should watch it and that's a great thing by the way when it comes to the business\nWe've seen all the rookie quarterback so I'm taking Lamar Jackson added is obviously but I'm Talking Rosen Alan ... Arnold and Mayfield it's early before the urine opinionated guy based on what you've seen I Want you to project\nFive years from now given the order of talent those quarterbacks who's going to be the best in your mind\nWhy Darnell Baker that'd be really good I mean don't all have the chance of being a leap player I mean he just [noise]\nI mean nothing phases um um he's got a good arm he moves really well he's got shot and he's just a fast twitch player I mean I don't think I don't know if he can be as good as cars who wins but he might be\nIt might be I mean you you're not quite the athlete not as strong as cars of what you know he's younger the cars are too he's only Twenty one right now he had the receivers\nThat the chargers at the top of the charts\nI'm told the football ... he has an incredible accuracy and touch on the football he just has Cooper receivers right now that you know they can't catch it and they keep drop of balls and so he often does it look nearly as good as it should look right now\nI'm a rose in an island where did you see most of the guys\nI mean look Josh town is a seat out teams would\nWould wait him because he has a fantastic athletes strongest hell ... can be um he's got he's got a terrible often wind has got limited talent around them I mean they gotta they gotta I gotta start building around Josh out and I think he's going to be fine and Josh Rosen\nThe office I mean these guys are playing the on off is what it is just no protection is\nLimited use I mean I\nI think Josh Roach it'd be pretty good I don't think he could be as good as Sam darnel or Baker may feel\nHave it the assessment of the young quarterbacks everybody Bryan Bollinger check them out on the NFL Network Ninety seven by the fanatic in Philly\nBall these breakdowns

I had buying razor blades most brand for overpriced over designed and out of touch and Harry their approach is simple here's our secret\nWe make sharp terrible blades and sell them in honest prices for as low as two dollars each we care about quality so much that we do some crazy things like fire world cause German blade factory obsessing over every detail means we're confident in offering a hundred percent quality guarantee millions of guys have already made the switch to Harry's so thank you if you're one of them\nAnd if you're not we hope you give us a try with the special offer get Harry starters that with a five blade razor waited handle shaved Joe and a travel cover all for just three bucks plus free shipping\n... sorry I thought that was going to be a longer too and he is the tea or coffee or something stronger woody out of their water water or you want me to extend the question of singing drink\nPlayer he's a dirty player lazy player and you know he's he's he's a poster child for what's wrong with baseball not what's right with it or you lose money paid\nI don't think it's a question lose money I think that if a team is interested in his services they're going to sign him there were no team was going to sign up and then change their mind\nVery you knew it mainly Machado was when he was an Oreo if people knew who he was\nAnd it was a dirty player and he stepped on what's his face as a ... foot ... yeah yeah ... and and so that that was a dirty play he talks about being lazy like he's entitled punk I him and we I could I could I could lose these guys I I\nBy any stretch but man do I want them to the Syrian\nI Do too I agree a hundred percent you know I I never had an opinion I mainly Machado except when he threw the bat down the third baseline of thought what a little you know Brad he ... he asked me is what like Twenty one or twenty at that point\nBut he doesn't run yeah he doesn't run when he doesn't have to have to see Santa [noise] I don't want I don't mean David ... and I just need I Need I Need a guy who just take the game seriously and just shows the sport a little bit more respect\nKenny believes that we have guys that low for down the line Brian Bryce Harper loved down the line but to actually come out and it may not Johnny ... and that you can't change the way you played to me if I can ... if the Yankees were considering this guy and I remember\nOne of the reasons why you can say they got rid of Robinson could always Rob is going to never hustle down the line\nGary Sanchez got booted out of Yankee Stadium for a you know a a rehab assignment\nBecause he refused to Hassan to place\nWith the Yankees knowing that this is the guy that's not probably come out the minute he doesn't hostile what'd you give a guy like this uh thirty five forty million dollar contract\nOr I wouldn't go away I I I wouldn't but\nSome teams gonna and if the you know if that's what the Yankees want to do or the San Francisco giants want to do with the Dodgers are okay or you know I I think that you know this is a sport that you know they're they're they're in a transition when it comes to pain guys\nAnd you know we wonder how many years you're going to start to see because you start JV Martinez almost not get signed up and he he he wound up signing for a huge chunk lower now I think they have a child is going to command top dollar but there are only a few handful guys\nUh that that will command that kind of money and you know I've said this about breaks are for a lot I think that the list of teams that he could go to has been diminishing pretty much all season long\nAnd I I think there's only a couple of opportunities I don't see him go into the cubs I don't see him go to the red Sox I don't see them go to the Yankees in San Francisco giants\nFans have better players or he stays in Washington\nWho's the better player of if you had if you're the Phillies for instance rights that they had some money they've been rumored to be interested in both of your the Phillies which player is the better player to go out and spend the money on harbor I agree I I honestly I I think we shot it was good I think he slightly overrated in terms of how people deal\nI think he's a he's not a good sort of\nBig I'm a big ... I'm a I'm a fan\nSo I I like Bryce Harper I kind of I feel like I get very sorry for you know I I don't relate to players the way I did you know when I was in my twenties but you know for\nFor a guy that you know I think has a perception that he's a punk I think Bryce Harper just he he is he is what's right he Bryce Harper is a good guy he says a lot and he sometimes talk too much but if the if that is worse crime\nYou know what I'm saying like his worst crime is that he says what he thinks that he doesn't use decorum okay [laughter] he's a little rough around the edge and yet I can griffey junior commercial with the kids play\nNever runs out of joining a grey cat is a great commercial\nIt's a great commercial because it's ... junior saying that he's acknowledged and what we all know the game is not what it was but it was better when he was there\nWhen he was kid dynamite was fantastic I had a post on the ... and got out of like a cereal box by the wayside\nThroughout my ... you want my view on my first ever gr a bigger story\nWhy not sure [noise] um do you remember in Nineteen Ninety eight Jennifer Lopez debuted her first song she was an actress first and she had her first song [noise] and we were at the king dome and I had one\nConfrontation with junior but I never had a social conversation with him and he came over to me and he said this line and this was the first time I ever considered him friend he said this song it was that song if you had my love\nYes Sean and Sean I Know has this on his iPhone or shown hands iPhone and [laughter] and he\nCame over to me and looked me right in the eye and says this song without the video is pointless\n[laughter] the icebreaker to do that with the icebreaker at that point I was like oh where those conversations go okay Jay was the reason why you became buddies this right and and I I couldn't tell you three of her songs but I Know that one\nSo we're like forty years you and him will be old and you'll be sitting there going J. lo song and you will be there in Cambridge and you're right is\nThis the the salt of the earth is as good as they come when my when my best friend was killed three years ago the first call I got from anybody was Ken griffey junior\nA class act no question about it our baseball insiders separate joining us the enforcement NBC Sports radio a lot of interesting questions asked to ease his pitchers that are going to be available in the market\nI Want to get into this little bit here set because the name Madison Bumgarner keeps popping up he's only twenty nine years old and he's been banged up the last couple of years one of your left on his deal there's the question would the giants be willing to trade the face of their franchises one what three World Series for them do you see\nPotential to move I Do and ah I said over the summer but once the Mets had decided that they were not shopping chick up to ...

Red Sox five o nine first pitch Dodgers and brewers eight nine ... nine eastern time first pitch and it kind of worked out because the Dodgers brewers Ron West coast but\nStill the fact that that game when extras didn't end until two o'clock in the morning so ended close to midnight\nBy the time these guys got to the ballpark it was probably one one thirty in the morning\nMaybe even later and then they had to be back at the ballpark for a two o'clock first pitch\nJust made no sense on the part of major league baseball absolutely no sense how do you schedule the team plane the night before to play the dating game the next day\nThat's just bad scheduling by major league baseball and here you have the dodge as the season to the Astros and the red Sox starting at at least it was eight thirty nine and tried to bump it up a little bit but why couldn't just getting started seven\nYears so worried about the ratings that TV networks have all the impact on it that CBS enough as one have to have their say\nTBS says we want it in primetime we it has to be in the prime time window we're starting after eight o'clock\nI just don't get it it would never happen in any other sport wouldn't happen in the NFL certainly when they control the television networks\nBut at best one TBS they they have their way with major league baseball they say we want to start at a certain time and that's why it starts at a certain time that's why it's the only nine thirty nine these weird start times you know instead of just like a regular eight o'clock\nEight ten whatever it is because of built in network time\nI I think that's part of the post season that bothers me a lot is the TV schedule but some interesting drama here in the major league baseball postseason any of the national league championship series correct council tried to get real cute and I actually loved it\nA lot of people criticize him if you didn't watch the game or you didn't hear anything about it ... with the scheduled starter for game five for the brewers against the Dodgers he walks Cody Ballenger on five pictures and then gets removed from the game\nThe Bruins don't have a lot of starting pitching you know they have a stellar bullpen and that's what ... council likes to do is likes to get through these games with bullpen and it's become the new frontier in baseball right bolt putting\nSo much we start the game gets removed after one batter\nAnd I actually thought it was genius I tweeted out earlier at Scott ... a lot here playing chess while everyone else playing checkers because by announcing weighed Miley is the starting pitcher Dave Roberts throughout their eight primarily right hand dominant line up\nHe had two left these and as opposed to in earlier in the series when Miley pitched in every single bad it was a righty he kept to left are using\nOn Wednesday but still you had seven out of the nine batters as right handed batters so my Lee a lefty be gets announces the starter gets removed after one batter and then you bring in the right handed pitcher Brandon Woodruff to pitch to the right hand to wind up\nNow he gave you a length which is what you wanted out of ... or anybody because the bullpen had to work yesterday and an extra inning a fair deal is five and a third innings which is a long outing for him he was up to run strikes out eight and five and you know fight off to the five and two thirds\nTwo runs trucks out eight ... decent effort\nYou only problem is the guy that he was facing was dominant Clinton ... who has had his ups and downs in postseason\nHe was as good as you can ask for as good as you can ask for he allowed one run on three hits he struck out nine batters in seven innings and get this retired the final Thirteen guys he faced\nLA went on to be the brewers five to they take a three games to two series lead now one went away from going back to the world series something ... talked about after the game\n\nYou know I think I'm like you said it it wasn't an easy maybe it was last year to get to this point and I'm really we had some work to do to be a back but um\nYeah if you would have told them strength training we have a chance to go back to the world series one game to go um we we definitely take them out I think so [noise] uh doesn't really matter how you get here but I'm thankful that we are here now for\nSure and as far as credit counselors strategy ... this was his plan all along\nAnd my we knew this as well Mali went through his press conference the other day you know the day before the start which is what happens in the postseason and he tried to be as Vegas possible not trying to deceive anybody but just not giving anything away because he knew that he is the scheduled starter for game six\nAnd that is what Craig council talked about after the game today\nYeah yeah that's all we were going to do all along a weight is going to pitch game six I'm\nYou know we if if we went down three one we were considering that having a way to pitch this game um\nYou know other than that this was this kind of what we were a or were decided we're going to do\nOkay so now you have weighed Miley the starter and game six the Dodgers going to go with ... with the game as in Milwaukee's brewers will have a little home advantage plus the brewers will have a little bit of a bonus in the bullpen because of the guys that did not pitch here\nIn this game plus they have the off day built in so on friday and we'll go to um\nYou know you'll go to him and then you know you'll go to ... uh\nI'm watching the red Sox here\nOkay All right I was I was very confused Nick I'm not sure if you're watching Red Sox Astros year this game coming through and so we all know Craig Campbell is that his struggles right and he allowed to base runners you wouldn't run in the eighth inning they bought 'em in the gay people out one on the eighth\nPeople step to the right wing\nThe arrests just went head over heels in my chair [laughter] wow what a cat\n[laughter]\nI guess they didn't really know a it'd be it'd be made the gets there or are you with the gravesite of you not know [laughter]\nI guess joke has to be able to get very a very exciting to think that a burger instead of waited a little bit because the\nBefore he drew me through law balls you should have waited yeah and\nI look there's there's two different arguments they're kimbrell was on the ropes yes and she years while he was allowed five runs on six kids and five walks in five and a third innings and the post season so she can be had\nBut bases loaded you know that you're getting a fastball there's no way that Kimball was going to start at at that with a ball\nHe had to get ahead of Alex Bergman and you are the guy that the Astros one up in that spot and so he got the pitch that he felt that he can drive yeah just needed a base hit and it was right down the pipe\nAnd boom he drove with the left field been intend to just came on and made a great play I'll tell you what if you use it you know if that boy was hit in any other ballpark I I don't know you know we're been intend to use playing but he can make that catch\nYou know I guess you're playing shallow because if it's over your head\nNot anything that you know you don't want to do it yeah I guess you're playing show to prevent the tying run but you don't want to get beat over your head because you don't want to clear the bases and the game will be over but a base hit scores that run from second so you want to try that that's a towel down at the plate\nSo it's a you know I I guess 'cause you you know point no doubles right\nDoes your easily allowing that tying runs the score for her so I guess you're kind of playing you're kind of playing straight up there in that spot\nBut that's just you know you want to talk about if I were the guys I wasn't a gave him the green light up against the ropes I wouldn't he gave them the green light because he could not ... there was one stripe thrown to camp\nRight I Know but you but you know what you need you needed to run their neck not one so you're not playing for a walk there you got your best hitter up you're playing for him to to to get a base hit and win that game when I was you know is that he's getting a pitch right there when I was coaching I always tell the guy wait one\nIn specially in this situation\nYeah but then you don't want him getting behind\nI I can see that because he's been so bad but that's the guy went up there you know if you if you gave me my choice I mean I guess Springer it's had a hot series ... bit is how does anybody yeah and now to ... kinda banged up you know out to be has got the ... the knee issue so you know he's not a hundred percent breakfast the guy went up there\nAnd and he got a pitch to ... I Can't I Can't blame him for hitting that ball that pose a hit eight and a half times out of ten that balls that Andrew been intending made a diving play\nA diving play on that All right here's more I got this um tweeted out here from\nThe Daily Beast is the game winning cats called on Russian TV [laughter] with me I don't know I did and I wasn't I didn't listen to this yet why I don't know what is it like a joke why with a Russian I don't know I don't know that I don't know if this is a a ... this is a a joke or if this is um [noise]\nAll right no [laughter]\nWhat excitement their\nWater excitement [laughter]\nWould eggs with\nA I mean that is a very that's as close as you can get that catch\nYeah that is unbelievable in that moment to have the guts to lay out and and go for that ball\nI mean how many outfielders would've played it safe and just let it bounced in front of them and try to keep that tying one third base you know because of you dive and it goes past you it's over game is over\nAnd now with the final score being eight to six you know\nAll the attention is going to be on the fan interference call on what would have been a Jose ... to run home run\nTo me this was Joel West making yet another terrible call on this\nJust an absolute terrible call by Joel West\nIt was in the bottom of the first inning ... hit it to right field ... went into a tremendous leap and the war is not that high to seven foot wall so he got up over the wall he extended his arm and his glove made contact with a fan\nAnd the than making contact with Mickey bats forced Nikki beds his glove to close\nAnd that prevented him from making the catch if you watched it in super slow motion on the one angle that they showed you had moved back to the glove not made contact with that than he probably makes that catch I can say that with confidence\nHe probably makes that catch if his glove doesn't contact the fan because he has his glove open and then he goes you make contact with the fan and the thin forces his glove the clothes and then the ball hits the fan in the hand and the side of ...\nNow does ... hold on to that ball or does she smack into the wall and drop it over the wall like there's a lot of things that could have happened that we just don't know but by role it's supposed to be fair to fear ends if the fan reaches out over\nThe field of play\nBut the famed didn't do that the fans didn't reach over the fence the ball was over the fence and I honestly don't think\nThat I Would have called that fan interference because he's got a right to the ball once it's in the crowd\nAnd I don't think he reached completely over now once it's ruled fan interference on the field which is what Joe West ruled that\nThey go to the replay and they have to find a definitive angle that contradicts the judgment call by Joel West and there wasn't a ...\nWondering oh that was the best angle was actually obstruction there was a security guard and the way you couldn't see it and so once they didn't have a definitive angle\nThey had the whole recall\nFan interference\nI was hoping this game wouldn't come down to it [noise]\nIt does come down to it but I bet you a once we hear what age eight inch had to say at the games I bet you he's not going to dwell on it because that's not the one reason why they lost his\nSons got run over time and NBC Sports radio [noise]\nCoverage of high school sports teams are right here I Am twenty to John was God's was twenty four\nStation or NBC Sports radio what [noise]\nThe Boston Red Sox won went away from going to the world series after an eight six victory over the Houston Astros this one came down to the wire Craig Kimball loaded the bases in the bottom of the night Alex pregnant with two outs aligned out to a diving Andrew been intensity and the left field\nMeanwhile the national league championship series the Dodgers are one went away from going to the world series after a five to victory over the brewers Clinton Kirsch all out just one run on three hits striking out nine and seven innings you retire the final Thirteen batters he faced\nNBA ... twenty foreigners raptors debut jaw there'll be Cleveland one sixty one off war ...

blew the game or you know ... of that and then grab it grab Mickey and invented many Rob the endgame\nAlmost God Knows there's game tonight but not polling Kimball that was a little surprising\n\nOh everything about this game Charlie nothing surprises me but everything was just that extra you know that extra special moment you talk about the ... the robbing the whole month you're talking about the call that was made by mayor by a by cowboy Joe West you talked about everything that went into\nThe Astros losing this game and the red Sox winning this game Craig Kimball had not allowed a run in four consecutive games in his entire nine your career he is allowed in four consecutive games here in the postseason Charlie\nYou can explain it I just can't see\nParents he turns into a price Scotty it's alarming and then of all these awesome and then both times that guy Nathan is thrown in the high nineties and he takes him out after one any good camera or the joke up a loser and let me ask you know when you just read the rural that ball\nAnd went into the players territory so the player didn't hit the ball the ball hit hit the the a spectator right\nThey jumped so ... jumped up over the wall and his right arm and glove we're we're over the wall into the stands\nAnd his glove made it made contact with the fans hand who was trying to catch the home run ball and it forced beds his glove to be closed\nAnd that's why he didn't make the catch to me that's not saying that appearance because that was over the wall trying to make the play the fan wasn't reaching over over the wall into the playing field\nRight now I Would just say that if you remember what Charlie Charlie if you remember that was probably if you remember that the the play the Jeffrey mayor play at Yankees Orioles Tony harassed go is in right field and Jeffrey mayor reaches over famously on the Jeter home run ball and pulls it into the crowd\nThat wasn't called ban and the parents but that is the most blatant display of fan interference on that call because he reached over the wall and caught it preventing Tony\nIt's in right field tonight the fans didn't reach over anything he was just trying to catch the ball was coming to him he didn't like extend his arms fully extended them a little bit but pets was jumping into the crowd pretty much to me that's not fair to fear it's the fan was not reaching over onto the field\nYou're diabolical mind is like a loyalists out you just adjusted my pack point my point was when the law says he went into this band that your right so when you said that he hid this man's hand enclosed the glove on fire said the ... and then ending argument\nWe've seen many times where they reach offering catches the rap\nSaw when he was Abu key word guy he's claiming the bank closes grow up your mind said something that's plausible and true maybe move because the glove by it and the fans than we really don't know\nWhat Charlie I'll tell you this one hundred percent in my opinion if ... club does not make contact with that than he catches that ball\nIf you looked at it in super slow motion he had lined up the jump was perfect his glove was open and then the ball hits the fans hand and the side of vets is closed gloves\nIf he doesn't make contact with that than he's making that catch and that was the opinion of Joel West who made that call on the field and when you watch the replay that that theory is correct the problem is with the wording of the role there is no fan interference supposedly\nIs the fan does not reach over and if the player is jumping up into the crowd\nSo I think that it should not have been called ... so I had a great that's would have made that catch so we would have made that catch if you didn't contact the fan but that's not fair to parents that's just him going into the crowd has his own risk neck so according to to west there's no\nBoundaries basically a player can just go anywhere you go anywhere catch the ball anywhere getting out anywhere because the it's crazy how this is not a home run and for for ...\nAccording to Joel West according to Joel West he felt that the fan reached over enough to impact moody beds for making that play\nBut I don't think that that is shouldn't matter that that is in it 'cause I don't think he reached over\nNo shouldn't matter because the rule is if the fan reaches over its interviewed on okay but he didn't he didn't reach over we knows where he's at the scene I watched it a few times I read it\nTo the problem is the problem is is that they didn't CBS you didn't have that one side angle that would have ... that would have given it so they're not ... they're not seeing the angle that we see on TV\nThey are but there was another camera that would've been definitive that's the one camera that's on the fence that's going straight down the line like imagine the fence imagined the fence is the goal line in football All right okay they have a camera that's on the line\nBut there was a security guard looking at the play but even so that camera just\nSo that camera caught the security guards back it didn't you didn't see\nThe play now if you would've saw the play that angle would have given you the perfect view to see if the fan in fact reached over that imaginary line imagine if the goal line you would've seen the fans hand\nOver that line and then that fans are fair because it's reaching into the field of play but dude even on the TBS version you can see\nThat the fan didn't reach over that yellow line\nI understand that I understand that I'm just trying to tell you they couldn't ... it would weaken the or the angle that ... the ... ... ... ...\nThat's not their job is to look at it remember the ruling on the field was not a home run the ruling on the field was fan interference and so in order to overturn a call that is on the field it has to be definitive proof\nAnd there was none in the angles that they saw on the animals that we saw because you can watch those NGOs and you and I might agree on it but five other people might not agree on it but one definitive look was obstructed they didn't have it that would have been to look that would have confirmed it a hundred percent either way\nBut that's it no run and that was the first thing they had plenty of opportunities to win this game he's national security you know bottom of the eighth inning bottom eighth inning Kemp gets the gifts to lead off ... and tries to stretch into a double and a phenomenal throw by movie bets\nThrows them out at second base what are you doing trying to stretch that into a double when you're down three runs and your leading off the ...\nYou know how valuable a lead off work to start knitting is especially when you're down three runs now

this game but it really could have been a much different ball game\nHad that been called differently um he was asked what did you see that prompted the initial call a fan interference and Joe West said well when he jumped up to reach for the ball the spectator reached out of the stands and hit him over the playing field enclosed his glove\nUh now I Would disagree with that because I don't think the fan reached over into the playing field\n[noise] follow up question so the ball had not yet cross the railings and he said no I Would disagree with that as well then he says and that's his glove

understand as part of the package and they are obligated to do it as part of the TV deal and you know they get a couple of more million dollars out of the network's probably for that access\nBut here as a fan watching the games my learning something 'cause out scores talking after the third inning wondering what's going to tell me his picture stinks the other team's offer me once you got to tell me\n'cause he looks just interesting 'cause the last thing he wants to answer these questions it says if he's looking at his watch going we please finish this up a kind of a playoff game here I got to manage right\nAnd in the day and age of an an analytic you can't sit back like Jim ... smoking in the dugout going All right after seven I got to start managing like these guys are all micromanage

I'm not going to downgrade what he did they just\nAre you trying to win games by just tricking the opposing team is that what it is obvious that your line up it's left the heavy because weighed Mali's

you actually sits\nThere going how good trick day Robert The Dodgers today how am I going to out clever\nAnd out analytic bay Roberts so wait Miley hey wait come here come here come into our steel reinforced room that's been sweat for listening devices at Dodger Stadium by the secret service wait\nI Know you're starting bought [laughter] you're getting one batter called clever wow skip that's awesome like I Can't believe this clever skip oh my goodness they're not expecting this one five to two last later I'm sitting here going and\nAnd you're so clever what you're so clever you're down three games to do now\nI don't understand this strategy I don't look this analytics in baseball to me it's ruining the game\nLike why can't it be easy anymore right why did you ever starting pitcher who may get an early trouble and he's allowed to work through it the way that you've always had in baseball right\nHow many times have you picture gone and give it up to run to the first thing you're like oh my goodness he's teetering right he's on the ropes next thing you know six more shutout innings if you use the analytics today claim commercial would have been taken out in the second ...\nBecause he struggled early on gay but early runs given up three hits early and you know what happened the last five innings that will be able to hit\nBut in the world of analytics or baseball it's like whoa you from the struggling a little bit on what am I going to do well I guess we have to take 'em out 'cause that's what the analytics telling me right only punches all into that computer what is it telling me\nKind of mind like sponge Bob where uh you know that that that that little plankton you know the plankton he's evil guy he's married to the computer and she's been out numbers and things like that that's what it is I mean these guys ... council had the secret computer that they carry around like the nuclear football that travels with the president\nIs handcuffed to them and

I was wondering where the foot was yes it was a little far back on the base but\nThe fact is Machado had the entire half to right side of the back\nOf a child was running inside the line which by the way you should be automatically out and you're supposed to be technically my baseball standards but\nMachado made it a point to kick Aggie are wide because ag yours leg without a bit far and he was sending a message which was the way it is dangerous rag your to do that if it's more of a bang bang playing the runners hustling down the line he's not looking he could clip at your next thing you know he's going to tell ...\nBut it's still a dirty play that didn't have to happen\nMachado has a history of this look at the two times at second base that he went in the day before where he used his hand to try to alter or see get a second time he got caught for interference and they end up calling a double play\nAnd like we saw they replayed it end but shot or had you know at at smacked his groin area with his hand he's a dirty bomb or yellow says right walk around the locker room and phase of dirty am effort you're right\nBut the problem with the shuttle easing that I'm not really I don't care about that that much okay dirty or not doesn't matter I still pay a dirty player because of dirty player could still be a really good player what bothers me about meaning but China is the fact that he would actually admitted to the best one interview\nThat he's not a hustler he's not a hustle Blair he actually came out and said I'm not Johnny hustle I've tried but it's just not me I played the same way it's just not it's not only\nWay we wait you're admitting in your contract here\nWhere you're on the verge of whatever the season ends becoming a free agent that can say maybe the most lucrative free agent contract in the history of baseball you and Bryce Harper get a ballot out this off season for that honor and you're at meeting you don't hustle\nI've never heard of a play by the way most basically players that we don't hustle the next time Albert pools breaks the sweat running in the first first base will be his first time\nThe only way I guess raw because no one ever hospital the first base the defense dealer was waiting for him okay with his latest bachelor a cycle because he never hospitals vary\nYou wrote Derek Jeter that literally split down the line and make every play close even the routine ones and sometimes you make an infielder hustler throw and it leads to an air and you're on base because they know that you're you know your your high tailing it down the line\nBut I've never heard of pools I've never heard of I've never heard anybody actually admit they dog it\nI've never applied Bryce Harper dogs down the line he got in trouble for that right is manager went after him for that but I've never Bryce Harper actually say yeah I I just don't try I've tried in the past but I just can't changed my habits but that's exactly what my many Machado said why\nFormer major league baseball team would I give a ten year three hundred four hundred million dollar contract to a guy who just admitted that he doesn't hustle one stat inks dry on a ten year three hundred and fifty million dollar contract what\nIncentive to hustle once there's incentive to play hard play harder not play hard he's collecting every single penny that contract\nIf a guy is brave enough to admit that he's not working hard which means I'm not arguing why am I going to reward him\nHey if you're really good luck with that Goldstein of throwing money at this guy and watch them lollygag down at first base and the fans going to be yelling at him bone Adam\nMarketing the Yankees all this talk I I mean yeah even why would the Yankees won a guy that admits he doesn't play aren't they already have one is named Gary stage yet they had one in Robbie could oh do you need another guy making a ton of money no thank you\nThe angels are member that one ... they have pools already he's looking at a younger version of a guy that jog down to first base line I I'm just absolutely sick\nConsidering most of us would try and give up our left leg\nTo be a professional athlete with that much talent show\nWas the way at first base\nYes no question about it\nThat yours like he could have gone on the outside of the bag and done it\nGoing to fight them you know what happened

then sucker punched him in the back to just to top it off\nI have no respect for one test property here's a fabric about bond as perfect like this is a guy remember that Arizona State he was a heck of a player\nAnd then he wasn't even drafted because he had such a terrible history the Bengals pick him up unwrap the rookie Frasier I think he started from day one he's been in terms of visibility is on the field bond as perfect as they talented\nBut his entire career in any accomplishments that he has had to this point to me they don't even register because what I think of the name ... perfect I think of the most dirty player in sports\nShould investigate\nCould Ben Roethlisberger had made up his claim of your next truly quota but doesn't it behooves the NFL and the neighbor player safety to

think the next time they play\nHe don't think he's going to be going after him of course he is that just as nature he's uncontrollable\nDangerous shown I'll tell you what I Love the violence of

views that they have cameras all over the place\nFirst of all you could ask better off a store you can ask you Smith Schuster you could start right there if both of them back it up\nYou say okay are they both lying about it you as you said there's cameras all over the field you can see if there's a gesture toward Judy Smith Schuster you can kind of frankly at the angles to feed his lips are moving there's plenty you can do to to verify if this happened or not and honestly if it happened you kick him out of the league\nYou know it's drastic but here's what bothers me too about this Marvin Louis to me it's gutless\nMarvin Louis to me is the guy that continuously pencils von test perfect into his lineup\nWhere's the accountability I'm Marvin Lewis this part to ensure that he's not putting out there a guy whose sole intention is to hurt somebody else where is the respect for Marvin Louis to his opponents to not allow a hothead life on tests perfect go out there\nYou got to win games okay as Montana's perfect guy look he's not kill Mac right contest perfect ... back to where you go from you know being a pretty good defense being a great defense the way the bears had been

talking about L T here's what Bill Belichick so what's funny is he probably also said that ... he's the greatest quarterback he's seen Joe Montana that he rivals Tom brain or here's the thing yeah I Want to hear your thoughts with here's a line obviously for Bill ballot check check adored Lawrence Taylor he was just offensive coordinated with the giants\nFor anybody to think there's anything

Mac to compare the two\nCombat back of a player L T revolutionized a position\nAll right so here's my question is LT the best defensive player\nIn the history of the national football league\nThought of that question today actually because I have free time and I was you know I read those calls from Bella check\nIt came down to two names for me\nHim in Reggie White [noise] I agree yeah to me I look I Know finish with things ... well yeah and then you can join leaking Jones and those guys Chuck veterinary these guys I I didn't watch these guys play okay when it comes down to the modern era football the soup\nOr later you're going to comment on I'm going to go from Nineteen eighty yeah and I was born in Nineteen Seventy Ira accurate right right exactly I became a habit of your horse was criticized a matter of fact she was the second year they start to accumulate that the fact is\nReggie White and Lawrence Taylor were the most dominant defensive players I have ever seen\nReggie White was unstoppable you knew was coming he would call the other way literally to strengthen the speed was ridiculous\nHe had twenty Saxon twelve games one season Lawrence Taylor was literally unstoppable mean there wasn't a player as the stop of bullets Lawrence Taylor says had to literally changed\nEverything about standard often is to protect against Lawrence Taylor\nNobel check is a hundred percent correct and he's not saying it to be why he's not saying it to be critical of clue back what he's saying is there was one Lawrence Taylor and there will always be one Lawrence Taylor they have been other great outside linebackers like Garrett Thomas and guess what he wasn't Lawrence Taylor either\nLawrence Taylor is the greatest linebacker at least outside linebacker I'll say linebacker in the history of football and one of the two greatest defensive players alongside Reggie White in my mind from Nineteen eighty on in the NFL\nAnd I think that's the line for ... knows football and he understands the impact of Lawrence Taylor Lawrence Taylor for coach Lawrence tally coach Lawrence Taylor bias but I don't think he's biased because he has won one defensive player of the year or two when it for any\nPlace for five six years okay fifty right climatic yes\nBy the way cool lacks a little bit by the way he's not LT but I mean he's only play five here so I the way of accomplish some more things\nNot only that but if I'm able to go there right now Jay Jay watch the guy talking about right that would rival LTM Reggie White little Mac agree hundred percent yeah let's not let's not go overboard\nYou did not answer my question\nIs it L. T. or is that where you're white\nYou gave me two names I said who is the best he's the best\nRights you know I'm going to charge you you're going to have your Reggie White well it helps that Bill Belichick was the DC for the giants during El Al ... prior to that house scheming and everything [noise]\nGetting him those match ups and I know he's the speed demon undersized kind of outside linebacker three four revolutionize the defense that helped him a lot because it took awhile for NFL often says to you know\nI understand the free for projects to it now just to write and he didn't invent the three four right bell jak but the fact that uh and so I I got to go I got to go rent you what\nI think it was more dominant\nYou're going to with the Memphis show butter to go Bruce Smith but\nChristmas is I think she was better than Christmas I think we look they they play the same position I Would go Reggie White in terms of the ease some picking up the though still I think he was more revolutionary this position even more than Reggie White\nSpot about who's the better player who's the more dominant player I ... I think you're prepared more Lawrence Taylor they differ Reggie White\nTaylor could do more on a field\nReggie White was a great pass Russian I can stop the run as well he has to be for a size but he was a guy go sideline to sideline north south east west he was the most complete defensive player he was and I love Reggie White\nI was working hard but he was nowhere to be found in the super bowl is Buffalo Bills by the way\nAlso what state was in at that point the well then you know what I mean there's where'd you white\nHad sixteen ... thirty seven that matters that's amazing by ... last year the other seven and a half or so I have and a half after my senior year for the Carolina Panthers find them if you hear like forty years older than I ever was ridiculous\nIn the morning is am Thirteen twenty W Abyei jar Wisconsin Rapids weekday mornings at five AM CBS News update when it comes to the disappearance of missing journalist in Saudi regime critics ...

better person to do so that my good friend Bryan Bollinger\nSpent many years and all kinds of tackling the NFL also now yet if I'm network Ninety seven by the the fanatic in Philly Fox Sports to make sure she got all these breakdown\nNothing better than ball these breakdowns and I have to start by telling you this Brian my producer Sean wanted me to tell you he cannot stop watching ball these breakdowns they are past their ears they they're great but that will be let's get right to it because you got right down everything you watch more film that anybody I Know\nHe's he like manning done based on what you see\nWhat are you know you weren't going to have this year than it used to work all day\nUsed about is all those years you can get now he has a back that up with those performers has but I'll say this was early\nIn the games against ours against the eagles and when he just hit early I it really doesn't matter your name is brandy are marrying or whatever I mean these guys get affected by that and they don't trust\nThe protection and so they let the ball go through early they get ... already in the pocket and I've seen that from here on this year Kenny settled down to calm down and make the throws it can but\nYou know there's a lot of things broke with that office right now it does I mean it's the office of the quarterback has been affected by it um there's a lot of issues with that group right now\nIs his skill set still good enough to start in the NFL\nStill growing up but I mean the the bar at the quarterback position has been raised higher and higher you know what I mean there were guys completely or Seventy percent completion now there is is the new sixty percent of the guys are above Seventy percent and\nYou know it's just you know it's it's more but it's just a quarterback sleep right now I mean it is it is a passing they're already great now and so to the point we're Brady is hoping\nThat Kansas City scores or certainly not get the ball back because he knows it's going to go down to win the game as all the all the gate that's kind of work right now\nAll these sick one Barclay has been really as good as advertised maybe even better yet there one in five the New York jets are loving what they see from Sam Donaldson you break down the film you have opinions obviously an Sam Donald as great as Barkley is should the giants have thought about that\nSession passed you line up drafted you know darn all based on what you've seen\nYeah say she would have because\nYou know I gave him Fifteen incredible years two Super Bowls like nobody can sign up and ask for anything from any other fire and they represent the city and organization is probably as he did he was the ultimate pro\nBut nobody I mean you really can't expect greatness beyond Fifteen Years from anybody I don't care if it's breeze or greater anybody else\nYou can expect that much more and you never want to be the position we're picking number two again and if you could bring in a new general manager and you bring in a new head coach maybe you should have just cut the cord and Brian Sandoval and built\nAround a young young quarterback right now the way the jets are in last Sunday for the first time since the early ... the training wheels off let's go play quarterback and it was really good\nNow you know I mean so yes I think they should have done that but that that's\nNot knocking man it's just\nFather time and change at the top and sometimes it's just better the weight Doug Peterson came in with you know Carson went um sometimes just better if you're just you know Sean Payton and Drew Brees I mean you just kind of build new quarterback of the new coach\nChat with their buddy Bryan Bollinger here going deep to enforcement NBC Sports radio makes up all these breakdowns great stuff breaking out all the stuff we talked about you watch a lot of the Packers Aaron Rodgers looks like the old Aaron Rodgers last couple of weeks for sure even though he's playing injured besides what's wrong with the Packers\n[laughter] well it's essentially you know they're not very good right now they can't really stop anybody I mean the Washington Redskins and weak for had three hundred yards of office\nAt half time against [noise] um they're playing a lot of young players there to secondary a habit of doing good against the wrong they weren't going against the run against the forty niners are Monday Night that's part of it\nUm I Would say that you know they're they're playing with the guy's name calling me as St for how to mark has you know ... ...\nJobs because of the injuries are\nSo [noise] you know they they've got to\nOvercome the injury bug your last Mohammed Wilkerson was started defence when it gets the Redskins I mean you know they they need to stay healthy and\nYou know sort of building there sitting with a lot of new faces right now\n[noise] ball disown Watson comes into the season people whispering MVP MVP I even jailing Ramsey was saying he's a future MVP yet here we are six weeks in the Houston Texans obviously have not been very good when you watch the film under shown Watson what's the problem right now\nOr the wind is atrocious to me it's just it's just bad\nUm it's been around blocking game is bad and protection right now they're playing a bunch of young guys they gotta look you right tackle right now they got a young right guard I mean they're just they're just young\nYou know they've got a left tackle that is questionable if he's a left tackle this business right now I now I mean if you watch 'em they can't really function as it is right now and they have the best seat with all the football\nAnd they are very hot 'cause I mean is as good as anybody out there but they struggle to get him to ball what do you do three\nThings happen but to show us and he's coming off an\nACL tear which it's already amazing how athletic he all he looks in how healthy he looks but the beanie he just took last weekend there just you just can't survive those kind of hit I mean he was twelve times ... times\nYou know they had they force three phone calls it gets used it I mean no quarter back to the door to the type of punishment that he you know endured last Sunday\nBall to you know Andy Reid well you obviously reside in the Philadelphia area you've been around a Andy Reid you look at what he's done just your Patrick my homes he did it last year with Alex Smith as well who put up big numbers how much of the six Jasper Holmes he's he's known incredible ability and how much of it is this scheme that eighty reads running for him\nWell it's a it's a lot is there's a lot of both I mean you can't really independently say one versus the other I mean the talent there is a free for me you know when you look at Travis Kelsey uses ... and his business if you look at high risk killers nobody faster you look at ... he did win the rushing title year ago I mean there's a lot of pieces in\nRight there but the one thing about Andy that if you watch these games out there and I know you watch but I mean if you really wild and I think one of their games against Jacksonville couple of weeks ago and he comes over to the bench\nWe're more homes after every series and he sits down with them more country should do this by the way we ... and he goes through the video the pictures the plays what he saw where he thinks he saw what do you miss\nThe Oakland Raiders from the old theories of the game\nAnd to me right now it looks like they're going backwards because the author has really fallen apart or they lost collect your family they lost Donald parents now do cultural somebody will be back or they'll be better after dish but the ... really struggled last week\nAnd he looked like a rookie left tackle that wasn't ready to\nAnd they're counting on him to be really good and he's not right now and so it's it's really uh it's it's a it's a little bit of\nEverything right now but mostly I see a big difference in talent\nIs it fair to criticize green for getting rid of ... Mac based on what we've seen from Mac and of course movie seems in the raiders defense\nWell I don't know I don't know if it's fair or not 'cause I don't know\nIf it was just solely giants decision\nTo not pay him I'm I'm not if it was a question that decision because really\nThat's his job to manage the cap although right now he's got to have some input but you have Richard McKenzie do his job and be the general manager and let arcade is in that group you know handle the finances well why wouldn't you the best player so bearable I'd never heard of a coach not wanting a very ... players I mean clearly Mac\nIs it a league player we all know that we've seen it but I I've never heard of a coach that warning elite player especially one that he really had the chance to coach yet but I understand like business business you know somebody doesn't want a franchise deal\nI don't want to be franchised I mean there are only leverage is to withhold their services\nAnd force you know the teams head well in this business\nYou know what is too expensive for one thing certainly wouldn't want it to expensive for the Chicago Bears and they become you know immediately a playoff contending with him on that the pet so I I I don't want to criticize jokes I don't know all those factors that went into it that\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars coming to the season ball the high expectations eggs don't believe in I thought they'd be a truce Superbowl contender they might be but do you have any faith faulty that blade morals can put together three great postseason games I mean to play off games AMC and the super bowl and leaders team to a Super Bowl can you see\nWhen they played was the last two weeks but I Want to see Blake bored holes with a semi healthy authors wider other third left tackle right now I Wonder what the semi healthy ... in a healthy let her for not because of this team is built around let her for that and if he's not in there to teach\n'em then you're asking for those to throw the ball with your cold duty what's working\nYou know and make you think that but it it's not who he is he's just not consistent enough to do that but if you like they did in the\nPlayoff game against Pittsburgh last year you tip 'em play actually you'll give him a letter from that and you you do pretty good job of really one of the world well they control the the game like that he can make the necessary read he can make some can extend plays and scramble I mean is it different team at politicocom that\nIs the foundation or that football team and that's what they're hoping that for a decade get back to the hamstring injury and become that guy\nChat with Brian ball to make sure the checkout ball the on his Twitter ... ball the with the why NFL last question ball do you watch more film then frankly anybody should watch it and that's a great thing by the way when it comes to the business\nWe've seen all the rookie quarterback so I'm taking Lamar Jackson added is obviously but I'm Talking Rosen Alan ...

athlete not as strong as Carson but you know younger that cars to choose only Twenty one there right now he had the receivers that the chargers at the top of the charts I'm throwing the football ... he has an incredible accuracy and touch on the football\nHe just has a group or receivers right now that you know they can't catch it and they keep drop a ball and so the office does it look nearly as good as it should look right now\nSome Rosen and Alan what did you see most guys\nI mean look Josh town is a or you could see out teams were\nWould wait him because he has a fantastic athletes strongest hell ... can be um he's got he's got terrible armpits wind has got limited talent around them I mean they gotta they gotta I gotta start building around Josh out and I think he's going to be fine and Josh arose in\nThe office I mean these guys are probably be on up is why it is just no protection is\nLimited use I mean I I think Josh Rose it'd be pretty good but I don't think he could be

there were no team was going to sign up and then change their mind\nHere you knew it mainly Machado was\nWhen he was an Oreo people knew who he was\nAnd it was a dirty play when he stepped on what's his face is a a foot ... yeah\nYeah ... and and so that that was a dirty play he talks about being lazy like he's entitled punk I him in ... I could I could I could lose these guys I I Am not a brewer fan by any stretch but man do I want them to this series\nI I never had an opinion on many Machado except when he threw the bat down the third baseline of thought what a little you know Brad he ... he is and he was what Twenty one or twenty at that point\nBut he doesn't run yeah he doesn't run when he doesn't have to have to see Santa [noise] I don't want I don't eat David ... and I just need I mean I mean the guy just takes the game seriously and just showed that the sport a little bit more respect\nCan you believe that like we have guys that low for down the line Brian Bryce Harper loves to down the line\nBut to actually come out and it may not Johnny Holliday and that you can't change the way you played to me if I can see if the Yankees were considering this guy and I remember one of the reasons why you can say they got rid of Robinson could always Robin never hustle down the line\nGary stance has got booted out of Yankee Stadium for a you know a a rehab assignment because he refused to hop on to place\nWith the Yankees knowing that this is a guy that's not probably come out the minute he doesn't hospital would you give a guy like this uh thirty five forty million dollar contract\nOr I wouldn't go away\n[laughter] I I I wouldn't but some teams gonna and if the you know if that's for the Yankees want to do or the San Francisco giants want to do with the Dodgers are okay or you know I I think that you know this is a sport that you know they're they're they're in a transition when it comes to paying guys\nAnd you know we wonder how many years you're going to start to see because you start heavy Martinez almost not get signed up and he he he went up signing for a huge chunk lower now I think bending Machado\nIs going to command top dollar but there are only a few handful guys uh that that will command that kinda money and you know I've said this about Bryce Harper a lot I think that the list of teams that he could go to has been diminishing pretty much all season long\nAnd I I think there is only a couple of opportunities I don't see him going to the cubs I don't see them go to the red Sox I don't see him go to the Yankees in San Francisco giants\nThere was a better players or he stays in Washington\nWho's the better player of if you had if you're the Phillies for instance rights that they have some money they've been rumored to be interested in both the Phillies which player is the better player to go out and spend the money on Harper I agree I I honestly I I think it was good I think he slightly over rated in terms of how people view\nI think he's not a good showing it on a big\nI'm a big price are ... I'm a I'm a fan\nSo I I like Bryce Harper I kind of I feel like I get very sorry for you know I I don't relate to players the way I did you know when I was in my twenties but you know for\nFor a guy that you know I think has a perception that he's a punk I think Bryce Harper just he is he is what's right he Bryce Harper is a good guy he says a lot and he sometimes talk too much but if if that is worse crime\nYou know what I'm saying like his worst crime is that he says what he thinks that he doesn't use decorum okay [laughter] he's a little rough around the edges that Ken griffey junior commercial let the kids by\nNow [laughter] so are they going to go to Greg Greg commercial\nIt's a great commercials because it's ... junior saying that he's acknowledging what we all know the game is not what it was but it was better when he was there\nWhen he was kid dynamite was fantastic I had that post on the water and got a like a cereal box by the wayside\nYou want my ... you want my you're my first ever ... a ... story\nWhy not sure\n[noise] um do you remember in Nineteen Ninety eight Jennifer Lopez debuted her first song she was an actress first\nAnd she had her first song [noise] and\nWe were at the king dome and I had one confrontation with junior but I've never had a social conversation with him and he came over to me and he said this line and this was the first time I ever considered him friend he said this song it was that song if you had my love\nYes Charlotte Sean I Know has this on his iPhone course on hands iPhone and [laughter] and he\nCame over to me and looked me right in the eye and says this song without the video is pointless\n[laughter] on the ice breaker repaired or they didn't know the icebreakers down at that point I was like oh that were those conversations go okay\nJay was the reason why you became buddies\nThis right and and I I couldn't tell you three of her songs but I Know that one\nSo we're like forty years you and him will be old and you'll be sitting there going J. lo song and you can [laughter] that'd be nice to have written a keg within your right here is\nIs that the salt of the earth he's as good as they come when my when my best friend was killed three years ago the first call I got it from anybody was Ken griffey junior\nA class act no question about it our baseball inside are set to ever joining us the enforcement NBC Sports radio a lot of interesting questions asked two aces pitchers that are going to be available in the market\nI Want to get into this little bit here set because ...

joined by attorney and author simply Powell to offer some thoughts about what is now appearing to be a brutal murder or perhaps an interrogation somehow when bad although\nRight off the bat suddenly if that is going to be the official explanation offered by the Saudis there is no form of interrogation in any civilized country which could ever have this as an outcome\nOh you're right about that gym but we both know there's nothing about that country that I wouldn't call civilized\nIt's one of the most brutal and barbaric regimes in the history of the world I think from the way they treat women into the and the way they treat people like this like this journalist and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood as I understand that\nAre released a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood the reporters really does not seem to be the most savory character or a on the planet but again there's little about that peninsula that is a a twenty first century and a and it's verge you\nOne thing that I find that truly remarkable while I Would not for one moment put such a vicious murderous past the Saudi regime\nBut I have in the past thought that they were fairly adept at dealing with the United states that is to say to be aware of what the reaction would be to something like this so they don't like this particular guy\nA learners habits of figure out that every afternoon at three thirty or so he's a certain ... actually builds up the intersection the guy on a motorcycle live alongside\nPops to do his head and the scoots off the guy is gone and a plausible deniability it's the middle east where things are things like this happen but to do it in this manner\nIn NFL official government institution a consulate\nThat is beyond arrogant but to me it's just stupid\nThat's why I think it could very well have been a deliberate message that they sent them they're sufficiently arrogant and just barbaric to to do it that way either that or they thought nobody was going to find out because it was on their property\nAnd other than you know him not being seen walking out I'm probably expected everybody inside to to keep it quiet and I'm not sure exactly how what happened in their late down all of that I've heard that the\nThe minister their tending the consulate has said that you know there's a tape of him saying\nSomebody telling him you better be quiet you better shut up or you know this is going to happen to you back in Saudi Arabia centrally\nAnd there are questions I gather about the uh the technical means used to a a record of various things that are attributed to the possible demise of the of the journalism question again the bottom line I suppose is that we are promised an explanation\nBy the Saudis since this was Saudi Government property and I'm not sure who else would be in a position to really uh offer the information about what was happening on their property the problem is of course\nThat a salary explanation to say the very least a cannot be taken at face value\nIt cannot I mean they're certainly not government oh yeah we send a wet team in there to chop him up while alive but that's exactly what it sounds like happened and say they did it\nWell it it would certainly so appear uh that that is the case now that given the fact that the Saudis have been useful in that part of the world in standing up to Iran be most destabilizing single element in the region\nAgain it's already does not excuse this kind of behavior but if you look at the options that are available in the Saudi peninsula there are no Tom ... a or a John Adams is walking around that peninsula the choice to live if they did\nThey would live if they did the choices are pretty much the Saudi royal\nBrutal but more or less friendly to this country or al ... or ISIS equally brutal and very unfriendly to this country in other words the notion of destabilizing the entire peninsula just because we're upset strikes me as a very counterproductive\nAgree and I

over in beer and by Andy paper I let you I'll give you the floor sir\nThank you and good morning call and good morning to everyone who's listening I think it's done both exciting news we've had in a very long time for region as someone who worked in a paper industry for Thirty years that the someone come in to central Wisconsin and buy one of our meals and\nActually say they're going to make paper with it\nIs amazing it's a long time coming and we should really really be celebrating answer last two weeks I've had the pleasure of meeting with with Sean panic their new vice president and general manager and Brenda their human resources\nA person and Amy their communications director and I come away very very impressed one of the things that Sean wanted me to mention when he found out I was going to be on the radio today is he says our community we're going to be a compassionate company\n... that's interesting that's an interesting way to put it and\nThat's what you think about it is one of the things that we've really missed and having the paper mills being operated for money and\nTo sort out the pieces and resell it and just to use it as as that and and they've kind of gotten away from being a part of our community and the leadership that that I've talked to in the last two weeks is talking about that\nCompany being coming up part of the community again so I look forward to seeing Andy paper on the back of a little league uniform sometime this next summer and\nHe's been there but hardly noticed and and now they're the tension and and the notice a little bit and you know and I spoke to a Adams County county board Tuesday night and give out comic development report in\nIn I had to remark that five years ago you know sand valley was announced and people said who in the world are you going to get to come there and\nGive you two hundred dollars around just to play golf in the sand that will never work and I told him I says you know I can round up about fifty thousand people that did that this summer that would tell you different and they're coming back and they're bringing their friends and there's going to be more next year\nNow and they come here and I said is often and I and continue to repeat they like us\nThey like our economy they like our way of life they light coming here and you never know when your standing in line at a restaurant or this the Wal Mart or at the gas station with someone who came of very long way to visit us\nThat that you should be as friendly outgoing as as they think we all are\nAnd to build on that that I'm a member wink yesterday and\nWe were talking about the airport port right now is a close because on the expansion products the workmen improvements that are being uh going on right now if you drive by Alexander field you'll see a whole lot of workers out there working on that airport\nThe airports going I'd add to the economic base but look at the construction that's going on there look at the construction that's going on that's going to go on and beer and as they built two new recycle a paper a pope lines and that that\nThe where housing in the trucking and the road construction and veterans business park in Rome's business park and Rapids is business park and\nGets attention and\nIt tends to build and and feed on itself and I think we're in for a very exciting uh years ahead here\nI'm Glad you brought that up because I I talked to the mirror about this uh I Know the hotel owners and motel owners are very happy because these guys\nAnd gals they have to have a place a disdain while they're doing working on all these varieties of projects and and also I ask when you you know this uh [noise] your rural and Reggie when you bring somebody\nTo visit the area and they see all this activity going going on that's a great selling point\nThey want to be a part of it instantly and you don't think that the the executives and the decision makers from Andy paper aren't impressed that a little local community like this is doing what we're doing to our airport or they've been in and out almost every week since the the\nPurchase of a male oh that's amazing that's amazing so I uh anything else you wanted to highlight to today on on your monthly town of ...\n[noise] well we don't have any we don't have any farms in any agriculture in the town of Rome I watched and saying we have a couple of fields but uh the south would county group did visit heartland farms and I think we should have a shout out a summer egg folks in in all of that because\nBase it they they put our food on the table for us that these weather conditions here in the past couple of weeks have not been very conducive to getting vegetables and and stuff out of the field corn soybeans potatoes carrots uh ours are talking with some other folks\nHalf of their crop is still in the field and\nThey are always looking for seasonal help and employees due to come out and and work\nOn their behalf and there's a lot of work to do before our ground turns white\nAnd yeah and hopefully it will be awhile report it turns white you know I've heard the same report\nFrom other folks in agriculture that now this weather's been raising a little I have not been our normal normally we have a nice easy for all this time of year and then it kind of gradually gets colder in November this year we've gotten a taste of November in early October\nAnd I get the impression that the guy that gives the weather report is somehow partially in charge of some of that okay blah blah [laughter]\nI'll put the word and I've already said that text having more word your Mother Nature please\n[laughter] so how much how much time do we have left\nLet's see we got a little less than five minutes\nOkay we have one other big project in a I'm going to lead off by just sharing data and why up all of this that we've talked about in the last twenty five minutes is is important that you can go on the Web and you can get download that data\nFrom the last census and it gives per capita income for every municipality in a state of Wisconsin in every county by ...\nAnd one of the projects that that Reggie and it's going on a south of Rome would be a community county driven enterprise incubator center project that could potentially include space or mid state ran out is training lab into bringing additional\nProgramming to Adams County for educational needs and ready to the part of that and that's the old uh terrorists homes property in downtown Adams oh\nStole mid state we are so lucky to have a group like that and why that's important Carl is Ninety percent of the people who graduate adult then an students young students\nMitch date Ninety percent of them stay in the area and we're going to need that kind of economic support to to continue the growth because they're driving factor now is an unemployment it it it it is employment in is getting folks to understand that the benefits and the and the\nReward that come from having a good career in a good job and and for a long time maybe those weren't so easy to find but they are now and so please get out there and and

answers trick here\nWho's in charge of our community development and she brought along as a special guest Melissa Muskie from a small business development center a W Steven's point and we're talking about some upcoming courses in twenty Nineteen and we were talking about hey you're an entrepreneur\nYou throw your ready you're saying okay\nWith the new year I'm gonna take a jump start a business and and here's\nA health absolutely and we get a lot of those phone calls in January you know do as their New Year's resolution I'm finally gonna quit my job [laughter]\nSo I as I mentioned before the break our first that's starting businesses a great place to start on so if you attended one of those classes we really talk about business business feasibility\nOn the other thing you can do is go to our website and request a start up pack it it's a free packet of materials that will be mailed directly to your house and you can fill out on some of those feasibility analysis and also learn more about the SPCA service to\nOkay okay and then is there a fee for attending this nope\nThis one's free so this is no cost and is two and a half hours and I started packages also now cost and if you take that class and really want to continue working with us that's all no cost consulting\nOkay that is why this is such a valuable resource\nAnd because when you're young business\nUm money is tight cavalier watching every penny and then when you can get stuff either low cost or free to help you out take advantage of it yes it does it\nDoes it get too frustrated sometimes as you might hear some business folks going I Wish I could do this and then you're thinking hey why don't you call me talking to help\nWe do run into that and I think some of the confusion is with our name so people self identify identify what the word small business meetings to them on some people might think only mom and pop but we can work with anybody up to five hundred employees\nSo we can work with a large majority of the businesses and the states on and the people that are in my position and that consulting positions are very well educated a lot of them hold masters degrees and additional education um in business management of some sorts on whether it be accounting or legal\nMarketing you know those type of services so very well educated crew and many of them are ... on their own small businesses as well\nSo they walk the walk yet and they know what are the fears and and the anxieties you're going through yes but with all the economic development going on right now now which seemed to be the best time to\nFill a niche there are so many I hear what we really could use this in this community or we could use this in this community and this ... you know if you can feel that niche but starting to make money [noise] [laughter] yes and\nThen we can really help you identify what that niches and make sure the niche isn't too small um 'cause you want to make sure that it can be sustainable soda or something we work at too as we can do some industry analysis and some research to make sure that that niche does make sense\nYou know some of your other courses have coming up and twenty Nineteen that people might want to put on their calendar\nYeah the business education series I mentioned before is also occurring and twenty Nineteen and we are partnering with that um harder Wisconsin chamber for that as well and pick the dates yet but I'll give you the topic so sure these\nAre the topics for next year our business planning for exiting businesses talents attraction and retention tools for businesses financial analysis was quick books and increasing the likelihood of getting your business funded\nUm we basically pick these topics based on feedback from people that attended the series this year as well as the chambers of commerce and the ... economic development people we work with these are topics that people are always looking for more information out\nOf I've heard them on this program when I talked to a chamber officials economic development or social you were to hit the right they're usually the top ones especially recruitment and retention how do I get the workers I Need I have I have jobs but how do I get the employees I Need\nAnd this was a math problem all across central Wisconsin unemployment is so low which is wonderful economically but very difficult for small businesses\nUm so there's a lot of open jobs that just aren't able to be filled sell something I talk about his clients often it's how are you marketing yourself so looking at their website there Facebook and making sure that it's clear that they're good company to work for whether it be video or so\nJust information about what it's like to work there and their culture\nI'm Glad that you just brought that up because in the previous segment with Rick ... you mentioned in talking with the folks from in the paper that the message that they wanted to get out to the ... community we want to be compassionate company that's a bold statement\nThat's a very bold statement but community involvement is really important these days um because there are so many jobs available people have a choice of or they want to work the more you can stand out the more you can tell employees what your competitive advantages as an employer the better off you're going to have in terms of getting applicant\nYeah you hear so much about that I'm with you know young workforce that they look at the overall standard a blue or quality of life\nThey ... they want to quality company that takes care of its employees but they also want a community where they have good recreation opportunities are both ways they can interact and getting involved in the community they take a very holistic approach\nTo where they're going to go and live\nYeah they're not just going to be working there they're going to be living there too and I think central Wisconsin and specifically Wisconsin Rapids of the great location you're really not that far from anywhere so if you're looking for community activities if you're looking for a sports games you know you're really not that far from any of those resources you\nKnow we were talking going into the break how now you're getting all the players in this effort at the table too so we don't duplicate we uh we highlight let everybody do what they do best I guess that would that be fair to say but yes absolutely okay so how do we do that\nWell last week we had a round table with a number of the players I'm up in Marshfield and\nWe do shared the types of things that we were working on and some of the things that we are pursuing in the future and that\nUm that sort of conversation so unfortunately Melissa I wasn't tired of that and folks from the whole chunks nation weren't part of that so I'm\nCompiling um from my knowledge it's while as knowledge of other folks who is\nWorking in central Wisconsin and focusing in would county a little bit\nAnd what sorts of things are they doing so I'm going to be sending a survey out to the folks but I Know of 'em and asking them these sorts of questions and polling map together so that we can have conversations\nUm that are a little bit deeper and the future and how to partner with one another because everybody brings something unique to the table has access to unique information or analyses and than sort of thing so that we can be strategic in ways that we move forward\nYou just brought up something when when you mentioned the whole drunkard ... and the tack to the diversity of our area\nI don't think a lot of people even business folks realize how diverse this area is it has become when will become as people move here to\nCheck out the opportunities that are available\nOr can you talk about that from the university's perspective\nI mean diversity is always a topic up and central Wisconsin um it's something that we've traditionally struggled with so how do we become more open to people um whether that be talking about the great resources that we have here at the great communities that are developing and really kind of you know looking forward what it's going to look like\nIt's home for

employable and so um and uh right now I work for the school district or Wisconsin Rapids with whom bone students mainly their students that struggle with behavior and don't do well in the regular classroom so I meet with them individually\nOkay why did you decide to run for the state of somebody well\nBecause I Can't I Can't stand by while our waters being polluted you know under Scott Walker there's seven new hundred bodies of water that are added to the impaired list\nAnd and that's to me that's not Wisconsin you know also I I'm looking at student loan debt in the state Minnesota allowed for the refinancing a student loan debt I have a friend who has his son's loan that Minnesota three point two five percent what why aren't we doing that why didn't we take the money\nOr to comply with Obamacare\nA Minnesota did that and they also did they set up exchanges they did a review of all their insurance companies and they pay on average thirty percent last for a sea silver plant these are things that would help people in Wisconsin that we didn't do\nAnd I can't stand by and watch while you know we ... we're not fighting for everyday people in Wisconsin in our wages you don't uh in Minnesota their median\nHousehold income is eight thousand dollars a year higher than Wisconsin\nAnd two thousand and ten it was five thousand dollars higher so Minnesota's going one way we're going the other way we're losing so many of our best professors I'm to the Minnesota system and other systems because we've under funded our university system we changed ah the\nAh tenure laws and shared governance\nDid you knew that you WSBIU the people the professors that worked there for a degree and field or paid at the ... percentile that means there's Ninety five percent of all professors in the country make more than they do\nAnd then and then you change their tenure and then you changed their um their shared governance they're they're leaving in droves so I that's not my Wisconsin might Wisconsin believes in public education at all levels\nWisconsin I grew up in was a leader in an environmental conservation we've gone the other way and so that's why I'm running because I I just think we can do so much better I Believe our wages can come up just like Minnesota's did cost of health care can go down\nWe can protect our water for future generations and we can have the greatest public schools in the country\nI'm from Republicans would probably ... power to respond to them by saying well look at Mr Gore's cue the wages are going up and unemployment's at an historic low and then uh and under three percent and and their jobs me in fact the biggest need for Wisconsin right now isn't so much\nA job since ... employees for a job openings what would be respond\nWell my response is it's true the wages are going up but not fast enough so inflation is eating up the games the workers in Wisconsin or maintain were falling farther farther behind Minnesota and and yeah there there's jobs what they should pay better you know we we need good paying jobs you you can have jobs you can have two or three of them\nYou know but we need jobs that are families supporting jobs\nI'm midway point to Andy paper just announcing that they're going to be creating that those jobs get started twenty dollars an hour although what\nWe know the paper industry pay as well and so yeah those are those are good jobs but in general a lot of the jobs are out there are twelve dollar an hour jobs fourteen now are trying to create that\nWell for one thing let's raise the minimum wage that would put enough pressure on wages\nLet's get rid of right to work right to work as a downward pressure on wages so does the repealing of the prevailing wage laws all of these laws work together to push wages down in Wisconsin and we crushed the public employees union that pushes wages down teachers today\nIn two thousand and Eighteen or making two point five percent less on average than they did in two thousand and ten and their benefits are Eighteen percent down\nSo that money we sucked out of our communities\nWondering are they are more than teachers are now being paid based on on merit and performance what's wrong with that\nWell for one thing I mean categorically you're wrong on that they're not being paid for for ... in performance\nAnd and the other thing I I'm an educator right All right so at at the end of the day at three o'clock or wherever you get to go home I didn't go home I I work nine grants I had kids come in after school and and do credit recovery a lot of teachers do extra things I think it's this whole marriage thing\nPay a lot of times it's based on test scores one year you got a great group of kids or I should say Hi testers next year it's low I don't like merit pay for teachers I think we're why don't why don't we have to pay for plumbers why don't we have merit pay for electricians you know if you're a professional you go in and do your best and if you're not good I think you should be fired\nPay because it's it's too it's too nebulous what what do you get what are you going to use to determine merit pay\n'em the the other thing you mentioned right to work and some of the other unions that uh I'm pro business advocates will say that this has made Wisconsin more attractive to business investment that a\nFoxconn would not have happened and and that's a separate issue but that that Wisconsin is now a quote unquote as the government likes to say open for business what do you say\nI say you're exactly right on Foxconn that's where they that's why they came here they're ... they're known for pain low wages we have very little worker protections so they came here to pay lower wages and to use or Lake Michigan water to the two and a seven million gallons a day\nAnd what is in that water when they're done done with it we know about thirty percent is incorporated into the product\nBut what about the rest of it I Know that they wash their screens off with benzene to keep them clean that's one of the most dangerous carcinogens on the planet I Want to know what's going to be in that water when they're done with it I don't think we went to attract businesses here because we have low wages in and week worker protection laws\nOkay so what how would you what if you if you were elected what would you like to see done and how would you get it done\nWell what I Would like to see done this list which go back to where we where we were on natural resource conservation let's replace the scientists let's have our scientists work with agriculture that to come up with the best practices and we know that\nThat cover cropping and no till agriculture and buffer scripts will bring down the number number the nitrate level and the groundwater also will prevent the phosphate run off and I know my opponent will say that but I but I think we need to do is invest in our farmers help them do that not invest in a foreign\nCompany that may pay off or may not pay off I Believe in Wisconsin farmers I Believe in local businesses you know the three billion dollars that is going to Foxconn and now they're saying is four point five but I'm just going to use the three billion dollar figure\nOr listening to Wisconsin [noise] twenty four hour information station am searching the way\nWas a draw Wisconsin Rapids\nCBS News on the

the brewers coming back home is obviously a good thing I think they're going to win I'm kind of no I'm not I'm not going off of anything specific other than the fact that I think they're just do you know what I mean I I don't want a house to yes they don't have momentum I understand that it was a disappointing a road trip\nBut I just think they're due offensively to kind of have a breakout game and to push to sing the game seven and if you go to game seven you certainly give the nod to the Milwaukee Brewers at this point I Would assume\nYeah I I you know you never want to lose and especially a couple of games in a row and you're up to one and you've got a real chance to go up three one and and then that you know may be serious over but\nI always kinda felt like this thing was hadn't for seven games it's almost like the the the fans of Milwaukee in Wisconsin are out of seven game at Miller Park and yeah maybe were alone grip and right now down three toothpaste and elimination part that\nI like are cancers are in game six and then yeah like you said that you get to a game stuff but I mean that that's as good a theater as there is a sports fan of game seven\n[noise] so let me

no great place to eat so we're gonna we're gonna touch base they're coming up later on tonight alright time now for buy or sell radio Joe where you got [noise]\nEven though they trail in the series it feels like the brewers have looked like the better team\nAll except for one game on buying that\nThey didn't look good yesterday but everything else they looked good they've had opportunities to win this thing they've had opportunities to go up and and dominate this thing so\nYes I'm going to say the brewers by that I'm buying a write them now the brewers have looked like the better team it's got to get it done that they just need something to something here at the top of the top of the order they got to get some op eds but just that they need something and the big hope that I have\nIs that not only because I Know the secondary market took a little bit of a hit because brewers fans went on I don't know if they're gonna win this thing you know I you know when they lost\nBut I owe fans do pack Miller Park and Miller Park will be packed morning I mark my words filed fancy pack Miller Park [noise] go out of their freaking mine's tomorrow night and make it a Japanese place\nFor the LA Dodgers just bring that energy tomorrow night I'm really looking forward to that and yes I Believe that they had been the better team buy or sell\nCouncil is a brilliant manager [noise] for everything\nHe had the ... it's hard to use the word brilliant brilliant I think of Albert Einstein when I think of brilliance you know that type of thing as the Albert Einstein of baseball\nI think he is on when it comes to the non traditional ways of thinking he is if not at the forefront he is the leader so to say brilliant brains hearts that's like saying the greatest [noise]\nTo me in in ... it's hard for me to say that but yes\nCraig council has done an incredible managerial job I mean I Know everybody can second guess the manager on Wendy user particular picture when the pinch it when the double switch you know when they'll leave something down and not to leave something out when to send somebody in motion there they okay but overall [noise]\nWhat they have done with the pitching staff and the lineups the manipulation\nHe is from what he's been given the work we're not that he's been given a you know crap baseball team 'cause it's a very very good baseball team is one of the greatest of all times no\nPlease be given a lot of talent and he's he's maximize the talent so to answer your question\nIs the brilliant brilliant hard for me to say no also on that but as he is he out thinking the ... the thinking Dave Roberts yeah that'd be outside other managers or this past season yes he's done a fantastic job of garnering the best record in the national league the best record in baseball for the Milwaukee\nBrewers yet [noise] buy or sell Christian yell at each deserves a pass for his mom [noise] of\nCourse he does I mean people say well you gotta sitting down for a game and loving you know what are you gonna do so now for game six to them and they should get [noise]\nYou're not bringing up you're not bringing in the leagues MVP to pitch it he struggled a little bit in the series he's been your go to guy and I look for him to bust out of that tomorrow night you don't want to sit him no he gets to pass I mean they figure them out they said look we kept saying why are people pitching to this guy [noise]\nAnd now they're not they're not giving them anything that hit they're getting up near the strike zone very rarely does he get a basketball right down the middle and when he does he surprised to see it at this point because I think he's kind of fishing\nShow does he get a pass oh yeah he does because they're not really giving much to hit when they do is is big breaking stuff it's low in a way it's it's a gallon in maybe up and then a little bit but they're not proven anything doing to try to blow up basketball has been continuously because they know that what what he can do with it so yes or he deserves a passing\nBoil the biggest thing is what happens is what you're saying now it was only in the course of the season\nI'll go back to when I was playing let's take Dennis Eckersley one of the greatest of all time right ... though Dennis Eckersley goes to a closer and I'm planning the American league west and I'm facing a ... I saw him maybe\nThree or four times a season you know now you get into a playoff scenario you're seeing guys three or four times within a week span\nAnd so you start to see you guys a little bit better I started seeing ... is a more and more I saw him the better I was able to have an approach it was a throwback dorsal either he's not going to show me a fast ball and you start getting Tennessee's\nAnd when you have bullpen guys continually coming out you start that little ads loses leaves them I think and allow the Hitler to start making some adjustments and see the ball better start housewives\nSo that's that's one side of both and and what happens in the post season and a seven game series you're seeing now is\nStarting to maybe catch up has the better swings are starting to see make adjustments oh this is what this guy's got to do his ball moves this way I'm laying off now instead of tasted it\nSo that the talent the bullpen and that's why a curse or or somebody like that who can go deep in the game it allows you to not see a guy that you that you may not see two or three different times\nAhead or apply not going to get hit he will eat but the other guys you start to figure out and get a little bit more ... for so that to me is is the the bucket blue bull panning and the policies and that's the negative of it the positive is yeah you see different arm every any it's very difficult for hitter hit\nYou see the brewers coming back home they've launched two in a row now something they haven't done in a while really probably since probably just before September a bike or when you come back home you get up a little bit early you get your mojo back because you don't seem to have that momentum coming back home\nIsn't as simple as that to be able to kind of garnering the momentum or is there something else that this team needs to do to win the next two ballgames\nWas head of the scenery all his health and you know I've been I've been there to mellow park it's electric\nAnd they're going to feed on that that's one of the best uh ballparks in ... plus a allows it to run into some balls to become a different Claire the ball's gonna fly it's going to carry you look at some balls that were hitting LA that didn't go out the home runs in Milwaukee\nYou know they change the games ... that was hit the other day of all that that came at the center uh you know this is a ... get out of the ballpark that are home runs in Milwaukee and now you don't know what happens with those games\nIt changes that ballpark changes how everything is played and I I think it's a little bit more of an advantage from Milwaukee because\nThey're pitching doesn't give up a lot of hits you know the bullpen does not give up long balls they they they stay keep doing the game so I think that's a little bit of an advantage that I'd be looking at that as a real positive if I was a brewer fan and\nSaying hey we've still got a shot and\nThey do as well as I got back\nFrom LA knew they were coming back home they were sitting okay you went to night pressure back on the Dodgers simple as that\nAnd I'll be network analyst Harold rentals joining us on the Schneider orange hotline so talk to me about a way ... five pitches yesterday a then coming back again and it's going to start on friday night I talked to joke about this earlier we were talking about the manipulation

batters get back I think there's a lot of giving back you know there's a personal story and and I'm proud of the way that there are guys understand that [noise] you know people do look up to them and then how to handle it and we do a number of different things\nThat you weren't best we do is just kind of a sudden special needs to stay with the badgers and [noise]\nAnd all these you think okay you're giving something to them we all get more than we give you know and it's one of those but I Am a I Love seeing our our players with whoever it is nice even those different environments his uh his the good stuff\nAnd it's fun to be around it what you see over the progression of years since when they come in his restaurant not quite sure what this is all about some of the programs you just mentioned by the time they leave their talent others about it because they're a little bit I'm sure what they're getting themselves into another it opens their eyes and they become more give yeah or

someone because a lot of them don't you don't do yourself any different now than I Am\nHere or something but I didn't get around and that is for once again you know the older players kind of taking the younger players and showing them the ropes and said I Love all the children's hospital at we're going to this we're going to the school we're going to read you know they don't even give them a

football and you guys getting ready for three Illinois right now and we're talking about the defense certainly are often do you play any reading really you can do all the credit students in Michigan that said it deserves and yet\nI'm Talking to your guys this week they felt like it was just\nOff a little bit he's just one of those nights where maybe they just didn't have it so it's back to work\nAnd good teams you know we've been lucky we've [noise]\nWe've been here whether it's often so deep as we get enough where you do for someone to kind of the off and and I think the same can be said when you play against a team\nYou your margin of error is a little bit of summer and and if you know we all make one mistake you that's eleven on the field and and then you go back and you look at it you know if if we do this I mean the\nNumber of places you know if it's a mental mental air there and in a big thing is you got to be you know we've got to be better on third down any more cases they can't we didn't get a lot of place and then to be\nBetter you know you gotta get\nDown to merge engine to make it through Virginia yourself maybe you know more\nThe yard and did this to this you know more manageable whatever that may be but you gotta do play the game you know make place and and that's where I think that you know we didn't do enough of that and that's the way it was and then we'll go and you make a couple of mistakes you good team can take it\nThe game in a short time trying to get away from us and so I learned from that drove from it and that's how I was probably the response of the players you know this week I Love the way they approached it had a good week of preparation and and now we get to go out and\nPlay another game and a lot of things are really talented young but it's a talented Illinois team and so they have a lot of respect for coach loving Smith show it's a our guys do that in the last year again that we played against him was a tough game and so it's been a good weekend preparation looking forward to playing the game\nTo play color when you get into situations with third force\nA it's a dictator more so by what you've gone to that point kind of the game for what you've seen out of the fence of the film study some wonderful feeling is that a tough obviously certain laws of the toughest certain forward because it's sort of in the middle between a running a path right right ... I think in\nGeneral and play calling it your first call are all off of your preparation you you don't know anything more\nFrom the ... the first play the game or the first surgeon short first started me on first CERN long first planned the red zone first time I go and do you have to also the early part of it is okay and\nWhat we've seen on film and and make a call for that and then you start to get a feel for it if you've had to do maybe and then you need the second one sometimes to to verify it or or write or this is what kind of on track on the schedule right there and and um [noise]\nHe's in the question certain forms are better than third intends then in ... there is no real mixed downs I think there's always whenever you can threaten run and pass right any time you made of events to defend the more you know in theory you got a little bit of an advantage right there but\nNowadays in what we're doing a lot of those situations become run down to really shouldn't run out of those formation\n... Mike and I said I'm pretty sure it was with Fred shoulder someone going back several years ago now maybe\nClose to twenty and it it was very generally speaking he said it in the college game\nYou would generally you would scheme against a scheme for in the pro game it's against the St Clair right bill that way I mean they're probably exceptions but in at the college level just generally business versus the scheme more than you I think this scheme\nIs definitely starting point\nAnd then you've got I think the one thing that sounds ... and [noise]\nPeople matter the most right so I think you have to factor in your personnel and there's you know whether it's someone that you can maybe things you can attack and take take advantage of by favorable match up for\nThat you gotta you gotta allocate more attention to surpass Russia and in some guy in al ... guys stay away from this guy so I think that you have to do both [noise]\nUm [noise] and yet his skin marriage because [noise]\nYou know different than the pro game your players it's not as easy for them to adjust you know you want them to know what they're doing a nice place to put a whole new plan that can be ... or a different way to take advantage of that person so I think you've got to do within what you\nHave as an office and the same like you said on the fence you know\nTo a number that you know where do you think your best cash measures\nPut him on what you think might be the door [noise] matchup problems you know attack or guard or how do we get [noise] you know so many times in past protection the line
