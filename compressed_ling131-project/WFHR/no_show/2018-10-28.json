I ...\nKnow that they're going to happen but we make it the great\nMoney away for her own retirement to through her uh yeah and what does she use an IRA or\nTheir sheer individually for a warning some\nUnique four one K. good for you that's great okay so let's start with a house for a second because what you said was you had a house for about five hundred grand um three hundred and twenty thousand dollars out standing on a mortgage which is a five year adjustable rate obviously interest rates are rising\nAnd so now you have to make a decision and that decision is when to actually lock it down\nNow you mentioned a Fifteen year mortgage why Fifteen and why aggressively pay it off not to say that you have to hold the mortgage forever but what's your reasoning you just don't like it\nEr nurse shooter or you should be clear over the world anymore and then for a long lead them preview because we're a little over ...\nOr the older\nI wanted to finish off go home before determined for going to you're going to remember the last ...\nI think that the problem with that strategy is you've still got a lot of expenses ahead of you mean because you said you've got a middle school kid in high school kids so you've got college ahead of you on how much did you say you had in the five twenty nine plan\nFor your speakers okay and is it your intention that the kids are going to go to um public school like hopefully they get in to somewhere in the University of Texas system\nRole in there to say that if we were ... work for you to\nHere's what I think I don't think you should get a Fifteen year I Need to get a thirty year and here's why don't worry about the interest rate so much right this second I'm Talking about your monthly payment I think a thirty year could give you a lot more flexibility meaning that I mean just in case one of these kids\nGets into a school that's more expensive and you need some of your cash flow\nTo pay for school I think it will be a very good idea to give yourself that question that doesn't mean that you have to carry the mortgage and you know you're forty seven years old you don't have to have it until you're Seventy seven you can aggressively pay it down in the future what it does I think it's a kind of let you off the hook\nIt lets you off the hook for basically giving yourself some room and you still can deduct that interest you know you really can so\nI Would first start with instead of a Fifteen year with an idea to aggressively pay it down I Would say yeah I think I Want a thirty year and it would take my time just to see what happens with the kids in the meantime\nOkay now we've got another question once we have that got to make sure your cash flow adjusts right but the ideally the next big issue that I see on the horizon for you is that you just way aggressive\nYou're really aggressive and long term you're probably going to be fine however visible market it's been going on for a while there's no reason why you need to take on that kind of risk\nAnd it doesn't hurt for you to be even you said you're mostly a hundred percent you went you know one account eighty twenty Seventy thirty would be fine you could take the most risk\nIn a Ross that's you know basically in general because I always say Roth asset last asset that you would actually access for me it would take the next\nAmount of risk in a deferred retirement account four one K. or in Iraq\nRight and in that account so if you're going to be eighty twenty in Iraq maybe it'd be Seventy thirty in a account where you basically are not going to hopefully need the money and touched the money until you're in your sixties and seventies and a half definitely okay now\nYou're not qualified accounts those are the accounts where you should be taking a little bit less risk so if you're adding money to those accounts\nOne player instead of you know I don't know if you have gains are losses in those accounts and whether you're going to do some year in tax planning I wouldn't sell and pay a big tax on that but as you add money to those accounts I Would start to add some bonds\nAnd a funny thing happened while you were a super aggressive bond yields went up and bond prices went down\nAnd so I Would think that this is a fantastic time to think about doing this I loved that you're mixing at your retirement account\nI loved that your wife is putting money in her own retirement account I think it's great that you're putting money away for education fantastic and I just think that the allocation part again which is not it's not the worst thing in the world it's been a great ten year bet for you right\nBut it's time to adjust\nPlay just in case we have a nasty downturn just in case that's all I Would think about and you're in with ... and you also by the way have it sounds like you've got very good providers you know basically vanguard and T Rowe price are lost something you've got\nLow cost index funds available to you that's really the world you want to hang out and so I Would keep doing what you're doing I think it sounds great but just trim that risk could feel OK about doing that\nI'll tell you one question cure a majestic my patients will this change socially\nAwkward you weigh in\nOn them yes yes now new and you're going to kill me you are going to kill me when you'd make the adjustment and then the stock market keeps rising and you're going to call me back and say oh you you're killing me ... I I if I stayed and\nYou know like that but it is most prudent I mean I don't know what you do for a living but what I Want you to know is that\nIn many cases it's sort of like sometimes I feel like I'm a doctor I give you this prudent advice like this is what you should do I know you don't want to do it but just what you should do and and and in many cases\nYou just find you'd be okay with having a very aggressive portfolio maybe it'll be just fine\nBut I don't see why you need to take on that risk you're doing what you should be doing right now you and your wife are really smart to be pushing that money into retirement and I wouldn't even over funded by twenty nine I don't know how much is University of Texas for state now\nI don't know let's check that out there because like I wouldn't put that much money and five twenty nine Jeter and if you if you have\nIf you and your wife had decided look we want to put a ton of money away maybe it'll go to grad school you can do that that's fine but I mean it's not it's a it's a great way to save money for college and great for the you know\nLong term tax wise but you know if you want to build up your non retirement assets at the same time and so to say for every dollar that comes in I Would take some money and put into retirement some five twenty nine and some into my non qualified that's a good game plan for me and you're saying and that's what you should be doing\nSo last but not least please do your estate planning I Hope you've got that done I'm sure you have\nAnd I wish you the best of luck what a fun question for us to field because\nYou know markets easier when they're in good shape let's be honest and Ben and his wife they're in good shape you know it's not just that\nI Want to talk to people who have lots of money I'd I'd just like this is a diligent approach to finances\nAnd that's what the family event as doing so thank you so much for calling [noise] if you have a question we'd love to hear from you want to hear your voice says my mother likes to say ask Jill and Jill and money dot com send us your questions [noise]\nAnd uh hey mark you know what I forgot to say we're live from the capital one bank studios here in New York [noise]\nI'll say it again just for the heck of a live from the capital one bank studios in New York All right we'll be right back\n[noise]\n\nCDW we a modern servers need to be flexible scalable unpredictable to use it on [noise] okay well when I\nWas a little more observer security prison for free treaty W ... enterprise German Joe servers that improves return performers will reduce our costs productive parts of your history ... street over\n...

retire at the end of the year I can get seven hundred thirty thousand dollars is a lump sum or forty two hundred dollars a month for life I Will be sixty four I'm In great health notes\nAnd then I said could you give me some more information he says I'm married my wife is working she's younger plan of covering her with insurance for injured on me and he's got some other money in savings no other debt\nIf you look at the math around us I think you're better off with forty two hundred dollars a month for life because I'm presuming well wait a minute maybe I shouldn't present is\nIs there a way here's my question to you you're saying you're going to have 'em there's life insurance on you is that to because your\nPension benefit is only on your life\nI Would be interested in seeing what the pension benefit would be if it were on your life and survivor benefit as well yes you might have life insurance on yourself I don't know how much you have 'em but it would be helpful for me to understand whether you've done something\nTo essentially put that insurance on yourself so that if you were to die than that forty two hundred dollars a month\nWhich would might go away if it's a just on your life then that would replace would be sufficient to replace it I I Know there's so many variables and I keep asking you this so let me give you the big picture the big picture is I think\nThat the pension may be a good deal I'd be interested in finding out if there are other ways to receive that pension I Want to know how much insurance you have and I think that in this situation you may want to get some hourly advice from a financial planner\nBecause there appear to be a bunch of variables here also by the way for cars and a boat\nFor cars what on earth are you thinking\nYou know my

you complain [noise] [laughter] I\nYou know we run a few interviews with people who were around during the the heart and soul of the financial crisis remember ten years since then right and the aftermath\nWas pretty nasty I mean the tarp planned a troubled Asset Relief program a was sort of signed and done deal as of mid October two thousand eight\nA it was also coming into the end of the year where\nThe treasury was authorizing loans to GM and Chrysler from the tarp account and there was a lot going on not the least of which was somebody had to oversee this program\nEnter our guest Neal Brodsky who is the special inspector general to oversee tarp\nAnd Neil joined us today to talk about that period in time so here's our interview with Neil you're prosecutor right yes and so you were trained as a lawyer\nHe graduated from law school what was your first job at a law school\n[noise] ah I was an associate it a big law firm here in New York City I'm basically one of those big giants wrong corporate law firms are right that actually a lot of work to music licensing really yeah but I I realize that what I really wanted to do like why I went to law school was to be a federal prosecutor that was sort of my my goal cops and robbers that type of thing\nAnd uh when I realized that that my career path wasn't really had it in that direction I ended up changing jobs pretty quickly to go to a law firm that did\nA criminal defense and that was a feeder for him into the U.S attorney's office with the southern district of New York in Manhattan with the idea that I Do my time work for for work for those guys are they would support an application and ultimately in two thousand I I started I got my dream job\nAnd so that was more villa that's where you are right previously okay so what happens when you become a prosecutor like you know ... you were in litigation from right so you now know how it tastes works but what happens when you go and work as a federal prosecutor who trains you how do you know what to do\nWell one of the nice things about going to an office like the southern district of New York the ... office is I'm the kind of recognize that when you first come in they're not giving you for example\nThe investigation into Michael Cohen and and you know those things so you start with smaller cases um that are less complex and it's very much on the job training but with a lot of training and so now look these cases are incredibly important to the people who are involved uh obviously the defendant um\nThat is a life thing as well to to the victims but they're they're simpler easier cases have sort of get the the routine for it and you know once you sort of get that confidence and that training then you move on to the more complex case was\nWhat was complicated that you started to work on that that got your brain really moving\nA lot of fun career I always thought of myself as a white collar guy I did a lot of work to sending white collar descendants when I was in associated a law firm uh but I actually fell in love with doing international trafficking cases I'm the office had done was really a a first mover in dealing with\nDrug kingpins and other countries particularly in South America Columbia\nAnd I fell in love with doing those cases they were so much more complex and I thought I'm doing investigations in other countries working with other foreign law enforcement as well as US law enforcement putting them together and are they really became a passion of mine um which culminated ultimately in the indictment of\nFrom the letter elegy let our center I'm a urologist Jennifer cheap ski enter all\nOverseeing talked the tarp as it was originally conceived we're going to buy up toxic assets from these big banks are going to take them off their balance sheets so they don't fail right yes okay what did it morph into\nThink they quickly realize that that wasn't perhaps the most well thought out plan a nor would it be quick enough because\nQuick running a very very quickly in October November and they realize that the real problem was that these banks were going to fail because they didn't have enough equity\nUm they didn't have enough capital so in other words as the losses from the massive exposure they had two houses right new housing and send them the bonds that are made up of these houses and then the derivatives which were bets on how these houses were were you know how these mortgages on these houses were performing\nUm that there's just these massive losses and its complete lack of confidence as to whether the banks had enough capital to avoid bankruptcy\nBecause you know of course when I was one oh one if any company runs out of capital runs out of equity\nThan there are liabilities or more than they are um assets and they go bankrupt and that was the fear that was really gripping Washington and the world was that these banks simply were under capitalize they borrowed too much money they had taken too much losses and these wild bats that they've made on mortgages and housing\nAnd they realize that the United states government needed to take ownership interest put their own money in sort of investing in in a certain type of stock was preferred shares of stock\nIn order to keep these these these financial institutions from failing and so it really turned a lot of it into just buying stock companies to keep them from family\nDo you think in retrospect that tarp part of it was that the smartest way to address the problems\nI think given you know it's sort of one of those those those things that's like when you get to the point where you were\nWhen they made that decision it was the best decision now obviously had they planned out better had they force all this when the first indications that the real problem there may have been better pass but I actually think right now you had an equity problem right you had companies where the market was fearing that they were going bankrupt in and look I mean a lot of it it was\nYou know how do these institutions get so let so much leverage how did they end up borrowing so much money and having so little invest I mean you look at apple I mean how long would apple last if they had if they borrowed\nFifty dollars for every dollar in in in equity that they have and then they wouldn't last a week but one of the reasons why these institutions were there's this huge presumption that they would be bailed out eventually because there are so large and so interconnected and it was so understood that the failure of any one could trigger a cataclysm\nAnd so what happened I think when women was allowed to fail and the decision was made by Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke in Timothy Geithner um we live below and if they were like oh no we couldn't adapt and of course they could of course they could have bailed them out and and\nIt's a very careful language that they use but they were actively considering bailing them out and they decided not to bail them out to let them out to try to send a message to the market of course the message that the market received was oh my God this presumption that we've had that these institutions will be bailed out is no longer valid\nAnd pure panic short panic that that there's this presumption that really\nWas the underpinning of of our financial system might not be true and so of course within you know it wasn't what twenty four hours\nThis was this was recognized a edgy was bailed out um which it had to be and then they had to get this this money into the into the system and so the reason why I think talk with so effective is two parts like first of all it just put the money and right I mean and so\nYou know you don't go bankrupt if you'd have more capital but second it reaffirmed the message and the presumption the United states government is not going to let these financial institutions to fail we recognize that we maybe we screwed up\nA by letting leaving fail and we're not going to do it again and whatever it takes whether it's seven hundred billion dollars a tarp funds were trillions of dollars of guarantees a and loans and quoted he functions like work that we're not going to let this happen and I think that was sort of beginning of of turning around now the way they did it\nI think was really really violated um what they were supposed to do and some of the goals that Congress had put forth ...\nAlone Congress pass this bill and you may recall um it didn't go the first time so they had to get it through Congress and so they made some deals and part of the deals as expressed in the bill itself of what its goals were going to be and so it really two primary goals that were went beyond just saving the banks with saving the banks one was to restore lending\nTo get the economy going again because you know one financial institutions are all starting to collapse\nThey're not lending and if you don't have any lending in an economy economy stops right we saw on the great depression and that's what contributed to the great recession\nAnd so that was one big concern and the second big concern with housing and in order to get votes you know sort of a little bit of history lesson here but particularly the Congressional Black caucus right which was you know Democrats who ultimately are the reason why this bill passed\nYou know they weren't so concerned with saving Wall Street banks they were served with this foreclosure crisis that was just devastated communities and they said look will go along with this\nBut you gotta do something you got to fix housing you've got to help people who are struggling in foreclosure and so the deal was once you buy all these mortgage backed securities and all these mortgages which is getting what they were originally going to do you got to fix them you've got to modify and some people can afford to stay in their homes before you sell them back out into the market\nJudges said sure we'll do that of course then they didn't buy any I'm Alone so they didn't actually have to do that but those were two the two promises that were made but it was not going to just help Wall Street but it's gonna help mainstream by restarting lending and helping people stay in their homes and so when they put the money into the banks\nTreasury Department had a tremendous amount of leverage they could have said okay we're going to give you this money but we're going to condition it on to increase lending or we're going to tie your dividend payment that you have to pay to us we're going to do that based on whether or not your baseline lending increases or decreases the amount you owe us will go up or down they could have had some requirements to deal with for closure\nBut they didn't they were just shoveling the money and to protect the banks that are at all costs and totally ignored what they were supposed to do and required to do by by law in your\nMind was that a purposeful oversight or just the blanks hitting the fan and we just moving forward and were super scare and we're just going to\nPush the money over there I think at first it was the latter right they were just scared\nAnd they didn't really care uh honestly about what the promises were made to Congress and they certainly didn't care about struggling homeowners um you know part of it is again because of the panic at the time\nAnd part of it was just a mindset and ... and look this was consistent across both ministry ... through the member this all started in the Bush administration but very very quickly you know by January we're dealing with the Obama administration and went from Hank Paulson to Tim Geithner is the secretary of treasury\nBut in many ways none of us really change and when it came to struggling homeowners there was the prevailing view within the Treasury Department\nThat means we're a bunch of dead beats a who took out money loans that were irresponsible that they should've taken out these mortgages and they really weren't deserving of a government bailout\nWhich was you know sort of shocking because here early hype that first wave of foreclosures was two thousand seven that wasn't the second order effect of two thousand eight nine it's so upsetting\nTo hear that that was the mindset I mean I think ultimately it's almost the circles you run it right I think the most of the people that we're dealing with the Treasury Department just ran in circles where they didn't know who are foreclosed upon and sort of habits this view that they're just that'd be you know they took the money out because they want to have a pool and a second home and\nAnd yeah some of that happened to us but you know what a lot of people were victims of very predatory practices they took out loans they didn't understand it they could never repay mhm um and they were tricked they were defrauded and others just came on hard times\nAnd you know putting aside whether anyone quote unquote deserved it just the economic effect of helping these people the amount of\nThe the return that you would have gone by helping them versus not helping them and letting them fail but there's just no appetite for that within the Treasury Department and they really abandoned main street when it came to a vet that mandate to help her pushups [noise]\nWe'll get back to our interview

where we for a while we're about two months behind but now we're running about a month behind is that right that's about right yeah our exact moved to New York and uh let's see recently and\nThough he sold his car he rents his net worth is get this a few hundred thousand\nTwenty two yeah mark says he's definitely and finance anyway what kind of insurance do I need based on my circumstances I don't really have any particular possessions in my apartment that I Can't self insure but should I get renters insurance for liability coverage\nWould it be worthwhile to stand alone umbrella liability policy any other insurance you would recommend considering I mean I always think why not it's really cheap to get renters insurance and uh you know what you should do go to our friends over at policy genius okay that\nPolicy genius dot com they've got renters insurance you pop years dip code in there where do you think this guy lives I bet he lives in your ZIP Code what's your ZIP Code mark\n... okay put it and I'm just getting a quote just for the heck of it oh no I don't know I'm not going to be able to do this here to too much but you know it's going to be a few hundred bucks at the most and you can get an umbrella policy as part of that but I just think it is\nBest practice you probably have more stuff in your apartment then you imagine for example if there were a fire in your building and all your clothes and your possessions burned up you'd have to go buy stuff\nSo that would be expensive right yeah I Am surprised mark says he's surprised you're not required to have it but maybe as a rent or you're not but in certain places I don't know anyway\nI Would say that's it from the insurance um you know it's just not a lot of money and it's best practice for you okay [noise] I I Love this is like the twenty something segment mark a carriage twenty seven years old and\nSo she says she's ah I recently decided to educate myself and personal finance something I've

we've got combined gross income of two hundred five thousand dollars a year we both contribute to a traditional four one K.\nI make one hundred thirty grand and I contribute ... percent to a four O. one K. my husband's Seventy five he contributes five percent neither of us are Maxine at our four oh one case we've got a hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars saved and CDs and she's got a Roth IRA about thirty four hundred we bought a house\nWhich is great it's valued at three hundred and Ninety five thousand they've got two hundred two hundred and Ninety grand remaining on their mortgage\nThree point six to ... percent interest rate\nI don't think she'd either a great way to invest our money so I'd like some guidance on how we should be investing moving forward I thought to be a good idea for us to open a raw fire re a but we're over the income limit\nI don't fully understand that adjustable gross income limit we also have the option of a rough four O. one K. at our respective jobs should we be taking advantage of the raw four one K. or leaving her money in the traditional four one K.\nWere planning to have children in the next couple of years my goal would be to work part time so I could be home with the kids I don't know if it's financially feasible but I Would like to save enough money to achieve this goal\nOkay here's the ...\nThe limit for the Roth IRA phase out if you're married\nFor this year it starts phasing out at a hundred eighty nine thousand up to one hundred and Ninety nine thousand\nThe way you look at your adjusted gross income look at

own division what are you doing come on supposed to be smarter than that north of the border but not so as piers delivers\nAnd a steep bears tied the game and then put this one way or the red Sox they win at nine at six\nAnd you talk about a starter I mean the game on friday night when Eighteen eighties and someone's going to witness you liked the home teams chance just a little more because they get the ...\nBoston was using involve the for over Ninety pitches you're like man something's gotta give something's got to crack some way shape or form and it did but how things have soured and la la land in the last twenty four hours not just lost the game and it's a loss be different if he lost his game one nothing\nYou had this game wrapped up you're not some fans actually leaving the game early\nEarly 'cause you're up for nothing for nothing was going to jump on the Saturday Night in LA it's got to be a concert going on somewhere down the no care center somewhere right see we can get a late table at no bow out in Malibu and pound little sushi something has to be going to work for nothing\nAnd then it happened they Roberts goes to his bullpen and as we said and our number one of the program you're damned if you do it if you don't for Roberts because every state in and went completely gave me the only given up around at that point\nIt's what a great job ridge ill nobody says credit day Roberts first sticking their if you don't hear that come on who says that ten percent of the people if that\nBut the seconds that he wasn't able to hold onto that lead and kingly dancing came in and for the second time in as many games gave up a home run\nThen it's we're already doing taking them out\nTo NBC Sports radio is NBC Sports radio dot com and the NBC Sports radio mobile app several ways you can listen to the program first and foremost this dress real radios were on a hundred and Seventy plus affiliates\nIn addition to that the majority on the east coast right now look

Wednesday I I I Would try to wrap it up\nLike I said with those foul balls you do you take the foul ball of the runners going to tag or do you let the thing go foul because you don't want to advance

who are three and four hitter oh for forty one yeah\nUntil Steve Pearce able to do his thing then been attendee managed to get a base hit as well but pierce tied the game up with a home run off camera Jansen\nAnd then peers cleared the bases after Raphael divers who gets the uh the man up award for having the biggest shark that I've seen in a while just stuck right there in his lip [laughter]\nI'm telling you there's kids especially in Boston right now that\nHanging around so seven eleven trying to get some loser guy to go in and buying some deaf so they could be like Rafi divers guaranteed eight five five three two three four NBC\nDoesn't make it right it was that way before I got here it's going to be that way after I leave the kids are impressionable\nCoffee to Evers that was not big league chew that he had and it was what it was that all annulment documented kid out there having fun it's like next month the had fun on friday night I mean this was a moment to a lot of these guys may never get again and it's hard to navigate and maneuver through a hundred and sixty two game season\nWhich impresses me more and more with what the Dodgers have been able to just like they're they're just trying to break through they're trying to get their own well the problem is eventually somebody's going to have to go on that team you can only keep somebody guys there is no salary cap in baseball but what that is going to mean the cheap seats even more and more expensive and some people will say it doesn't matter it's all worth it it's\nAll were those usually the guys on TV right now people actually go into the games eight five five three two three four and be see\nI Would like it or baseball did have a salary cap just because I like the front office to earn it maneuver you're not trying to figure out ways to get around things although a lot of times they differ salaries and give it to you and signing bonus not I would like a true salary cap just to to be able to\nKeep things consistent everywhere I Would anyway personally then again I've also said I'd like to have a double header in the world series I really would let's see how good your pitching really is let's see and and point out those weaknesses bring 'em right to the surface of your managerial staff\nHow would that hold up Alex Cora David Roberts\nThose two gentlemen were asked a question at the end of the game that really had nothing to do with much of the game itself except for kind of did their decisions\nNow we know we have an outspoken president and whether you like him or you don't whether you're Republican whether you're a Democrat I liked the fact\nThat this guy is paying attention All right just like President Obama did when he paid attention to the basketball and he was going to go to the final four courses brother in law was ... Oregon State at the time so he followed it we know that Trump loves Tom Brady\nFollows football I think he follows baseball even a little bit more though the man he was on points listen to a reporter\nQuestion David Roberts and relaying a message from President Trump and then you're going to hear Robert's reaction and then we'll have that same question posed to Red Sox skipper Alex scorer first Sears the Roberts Dodgers that you're getting an earful about what they think for Washington DC of all places\nPresident Trump tweeted about you your moves tonight I don't know if you've heard about that but um he was critical said uh watching the final innings it's amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who was loose and dominating through almost seven innings rich hill and brings in nervous relievers who get she'll act for ... gone managers do it all the time big mistake\nMatthews tuning in watching the game I don't know how many Dodger games he's watched I don't think he was privy to the conversation serves one man's opinion\nI'm a college student and could use a device about my student loan I had to leave school and go to work now I have to pay back student loans fringe agree I don't pass fortunately I found a system back in college I figured they wouldn't let me more than I could easily pay back boy was I wrong thankfully I got the help I needed to pay back my loan and full\nSound familiar the good news is that student loan repayment or they were the NFC the national foundation for credit counseling a non profit organization member offices nationwide that provide comprehensive my natural that was one of these these ... by consumer credit\nScores provide one on one my natural can help you evaluate options were making student loan payments reducing interests\nConsolidation or even one rehabilitation\nFrom seven forums to return to visit us on\n\n[noise]\n\nLike [noise]\nWait\n\n\nIndeed that's the joke is strictly on Red Sox radio W E I with the call was for not being at that juncture enter Ryan ... who's been around a long time or good pitcher certainly earned it ah here's a spot where it may fall in the bullpen\nBut they can reach hill out\nThe second guessing is going to start and it's going to continue for a long long time\nAnd it may cost day Roberts his job at a time when we tell the Dodgers shortstop out we do know that just asked the brewers\nAnd the Dodgers still have to lose one more time it will it be Sunday in LA will be Tuesday or Wednesday or talked to beat the red Sox three times in a row it just doesn't happen very often it's why they want a hundred and eight games eight five five three two three four NBC\nIs the number to chime in here to the Bush leaves or on Twitter at NBC Sports radio so the questions are going to come raining and so a little bit of the post game press conference for Dave Robert's on the decision to put in Ryan master\nHe made a bad pitch and uh the fortunately a myth sugar really gets going on and so in that spot right they're considering who you have left independent you know you have to make a decision and then I felt that rise do at a very good chance to to get them out\nOf course you're gonna you're not going to say oh I I was kind of caution myself I should have not put him in I mean no manager is going to say that they're always going to let you know the eagle getting away and he had a very good she had just as good a chance was anybody else I guess to get them out\nOr you could look at it that way so let's let's mix it up a little bit more bringing can lead Jansen who was it not deja vu to Jansen give up a home run on friday night I'm Still a little bit hazy 'cause of the damn thing was Eighteen innings seven\nHours and twenty minutes of my life that I invested in that game like you all did he gave up a home run I'm looking at here gay that tied the game up gave it up to Jackie Brown the junior you deposit it halfway up the right field seats\nSo Jansen comes in again gives up a home run again to Steve Pearce of all people the guy who's got a couple of years left a in his career I'm you're talking to a guy and his um\nThirties so he's been around well he's been around a while I mean I remember God I call the college World Series a game where Justin Turner played against Steve Pearce parents went to South Carolina\nPlayed with the cats are you may remember name land and Powell was really good never really made it is full potential the towel but Steve Pearce certainly did and is that a great career what teams like the pirates and and the blue jays will finally getting shot and Boston this may be the year\nThat he indeed gets a ring eight five five three two three four NBC so after we're off Ryan Manson it's on Tuesday Robert why the hell would you bring in ... chance of what's going on with this guy these days you just not the same guy was in years past\nComing in to last five years off and he was a freshman any of our relievers mental\nThere aren't too many more mentally tough and generally you look at a three and he was he's he's thrown he's made a lot of quality pitches and the two mistakes that he did make this the cutters didn't cut and um they gave them to Homer so I don't think it's a mental or physical [laughter]\nOkay so that's a mental physical he doesn't think it's either so what is it then I mean I'm Still waiting for Roberts as they look Boston is a good team\nWe can expect this but uh back to back nights\nI'm Sorry I don't believe for a second that that is not a chance and said oh you got to have a short memory when you were closer I get a but this is the world series right this is the red Sox and you gave up at ... home run all about I don't know twenty minutes ago it seems like when the game ended yesterday versus what we saw on Saturday your back out there and you do it again\nAnd we've seen this happen plenty of times earlier in the season ran into some issues in Colorado a with the altitude and that's one of the heart problems I think became more magnified as well as the Dodgers fall by nine six tally when they led the game of four to nothing\nAnd it all came crumbling down in the end the last few friends but we'll see what kind of gumption\nThat the Dodgers have and you don't want to have it come back to your place and have the Dodgers have to win both because they are a team capable of ball but the odd certainly against I mean let's face it LA is using and taken advantage of the warm weather\nAnd it certainly does help the red Sox are used to playing in the cold

Super Bowl trophy\nI think it might have checked him more\nI think he understands it and when he signed this contract is kind of you know what you're going to be a pack or for a license for ever as long as they played football in Green Bay people are going to go to that stadium where number twelve\nI pick them to make it to the super bowl this year now they've they've had a rough time in part because Rogers had that knee injury back in week one they got their work cut out for them this weekend do they face the rams and await Phillips defense that when he was with the Broncos in twenty Fifteen of of the Sunday night game\nThey held Aaron Rodgers the Seventy seven passing yards I don't think I Would take the under on Seventy seven for Sunday's just show you when you when you combine the rams oftentimes with one way to Philips has done against the Mike mccarthy fence in the past but this is going to be a real challenge and if they win this game it's going to be Aaron Rodgers with another virtuoso performance\nIt would it would have to be you know and this ranch team has a little bit of doubts forum chief so may be just as important as bad as what they can do to parents who we might cutting the defense of courted this year after all those years dumped capers and the defense\nCan those guys take another not to step up in what I think he's become a very fascinating division B and C north but\nRanch is look they look like what we get the Breeders' Cup next week I might they look about a wink and a half to two white the front of the length and a half in front of everybody else\nUh with the saints right on their heels a next in the race but I Love watching the rams are what they do and how they're doing it and the defense which was supposed to be great remember had those cornerback injuries going into the Thursday night or Minnesota\nAs they get better back there uh I think they're going to continue to get better so that for some reason my or not\nHaving as you know how long can the rams go undefeated conversation\nBut I Know they've got the Kansas City in Mexico city coming up there and do a month but maybe it's time to start thinking about how how deep can the ranch take this after seven of those start because I mean most folks think they're the ... early ... favorite to win again this week you get halfway through the schedule without a loss\nAnd you mentioned the saints they'll get a chance to\nMove to six in one on Sunday night against the Vikings and then it's playing some brands next week and all the NFC West get together and I think that you can still end up the number one seed because you only get beat the rams ... but I I agree with you the rams have quietly gotten to seven to know and we're not having a conversation about sixteen oh\nBecause it does feel premature but the way the rams have played if they can keep their core players healthy they could they could do well beyond ten oh\nAnd maybe make it you know one of those things where hey we've got everything locked up do we do the bill Paulina pull out all of our starters and and give up a game in a week sixteen or Seventeen or do we do for that and they may be in that dilemma when the end of the season rolls around\nWhy go we're a long way would matter I don't think Trump McVeigh and that group would do that uh I I did watch a little bit of them on the NFL

stomach with what they saw in this game and\nI mean how about these games back to back just a I mean do you not feel like you've aged five years and just watching these two games Dodger fans had a historic game that they will never forgets the Eighteen ending a fair where you literally play do games for seven\nHours in twenty minutes literally on the clock and on the scoreboard two games and the Dodgers wind up coming away with the when they were back in the series and things look great for them up through six innings till the seventh inning can lead Jansen who gave up a bomb which had tied the game and\nHe did so on friday does it again on Saturday and by chance in doing so the red Sox got new life they were able to go ahead and then I didn't just kicked the door down\nAnd they go all the wind up by nine six tally take up three games to one lead into Sunday or they can wrap it up in Los Angeles\nA or the Dodgers with their backs against the wall not only have to win this game

Tuesday or even if you can force\nAnd it on Halloween Night but you still need free to be able to win and the Dodgers have proven that there are talented enough team to be able to hang with the red

do it at him updates because of the game was still going I thoroughly enjoyed what we saw there tonight but this this kind of gives you a glimpse\nA an idea of just how good this Red Sox team can be I mean who who let the match it will let the fire underneath the maybe they Roberts that intensely I don't remember he played for the red Sox at a really big stolen base back in the day\nHe knows a huge in their history right he\nWasn't he actually got a standing ovation from a lot of people there are ... park when the series started as well but\nThe ... for them to pick themselves up off the deck and get nine runs in the last three innings I mean no body at all saw that coming and this is really going to be a true test them grits\nFor the Dodgers tomorrow able to bounce back and ... how do you have such a short memory in the fact that the red Sox after that painful last last night were able to have such a short memory I mean you have to do it's either sink or swim\n[noise] yeah I think the tactic at this point is you have to go in thinking we don't have to win three in a row we just have to win today that's only have to do is winter day to day and then and then Tuesday Wednesday right and I got ... sale and Kirsch a on Sunday so yeah we're back to a game want to get\nBack to the game on yeah where we saw now what would be interesting though is if we have another lengthy game everybody comes out of the ball into pitch then what are you going to do on Tuesday and I was\nI think we've all these basically spent\nAn order Rodriguez now is spent maybe a poor settled David Price they kept tinkering with getting him up even in the ninth inning to be able to come in because of the karate kid ... uh gave up a a bomb or two key get Hernandez to make the game even a little bit closer and they were just shy of getting the tying run aboard\nA ... already went yard but\nAgain with twists and turns I mean you can enjoy friday all you want because what it what brought you some of the best baseball that we've seen in the postseason and chill extra innings then the teams just kicked it around like you were playing to the YMCA league a for a few innings and scoring on throwing chairs and it was just ugly\nAnd then it goes back to a monthly winning it and walk off fashion\nAs well so an exciting for Dodger fans but the looks on their faces did you see on Saturday when like

to report being victims info traction genius to disco talks with the studies author Gina\nThanks Chris a new study shows teenage boys not and girls are more likely to report being the victim of violence from the person they date and the study indicates that overall fewer teenagers say they've suffered physical abuse from their dates as compared to ten years prior\nJoining us now to explain what this all means is senior study author Elizabeth say WIC professor and director of the University of British Columbia school of nursing\nProfessor does this mean boys actually receive more physical violence than girls are just that they report it more\nThat's always hard to say essentially this study would say that more boys were the violin at least in terms of reporting that they have been hit slapped\nOr physically hurt on purpose by their girlfriend in the past year compared to girls it's not a huge number of thankfully we see about five almost six percent of boys compared to just four percent of girl button that\nDifference has been persistent that is slightly more boys than girls have been reporting over the past ten years that they had been hit laughter physically hurt on purpose by their romantic partner\nAnd this is a surprise on a number of fronts for one thing how many boys want to admit that their girlfriend is beating them up\n[noise] that is one of the things that we see\nBecause this is an anonymous survey in school and this was in grade seven to twelve so you're basically twelve to Eighteen year old\nBecause this is the survey that is anonymous and kids are not looking over each other's shoulders there may be more willing to be on it on this kind of a survey than they might if you were asking them in front of all their classmate\nBut this is one of the interesting question\nWe also can't tell how frequently the violence happens or how severe it might be so in this case you know this is one of the limitations it could be that\nBoys are more likely to experience being hit slapped or physically hurt but girls when they are physically hurt by their boyfriend my experience more severe injury we don't know this is the school based survey that tries to get the number of kids and not necessarily able to ask\nAll the details about the context of that violence\nDo we conclude than that in some quarters it still socially acceptable for girls to hit boys\nIt certainly is possible I heard from a number of high school teachers than this study came out\nThat talk about how they've clearly gotten the message that it's not okay for boys to hit girl but that they even when they're in the hallway is perfectly OK for girls to slap or hit or punch their friend and people aren't actually making any comments about it or trying to intervene\nThis does suggest that we have to do more to actually provide better training about healthy relationships were boys and girls and to really help change those norms about what's okay when it comes to relationships\nOther than the immediate physical effects such as perhaps the bruising what long term effects can result for teen who's been the victim of violence from a date\nWell these patterns in

healthy cells clean themselves up and if they don't do this officially all those bad proteins that are dysfunctional accumulate and it is so accelerate the aging process and the cells\nSo we're looking at ways to slow down the aging process at an intra inside the cell level now and so by using pharmacological would sure yet to be developed et cetera we may be able to prevent and improve the cleansing of so so that they live longer so so unique methods\nI'm excited to come up with such good things and we've got Kevin Murphy on with us now can Murphy is a former Wall Street managing director city group high school and collegiate wrestling champion community activists speaker coach and author of a new book called the three rooms\nNow his experiences have given him a unique an eclectic mix them understand human nature which he used to put into this book which is quite fascinating\nA little different than some of the books and authors we've had on I Love the he stepped away from his corporate world to really focus on death the three rooms itself the book invites you to start the process of better monitoring your thought because we all know that are thought had so much to do\nWith our health our wealth into our relationships welcome to the show Kevin\nThank you very much for being here\nSo we are due to write this book the three rooms because this is is a kind of book that you know someone has put a lot of thought into\nYou know having spent thirty three years with one from John Wall street um a lot of people didn't expect that a conscious mind it took to come out of me and and I didn't consciously think about doing it\nBut I had been on you know people want to call it a spiritual journey let's say for the last\nTwenty years or so and I kept devouring all different types of books and literature at one time I just started getting a premonition that I was going to write a book and I didn't really know what it was going to be about I mean the idea three doors came to me and one was labeled the pad and moments label to present on the future\nAnd so I kept writing down stock and eventually the three ... became the green room because I just kept writing the play behind the doors where our thoughts go\nYou know I I think it's really neat in the front of the book actually has this this visual of us three doorways and the middle one is lit up so what does that representing for unless I Know but I Want to hear from you why is the middle door let 'em\nRoam in it and the middle of a private room and where are you a divine consciousness that we all share because the premise of the book is pretty simple fact of life is not based on what we do for a living or what we have our possession\nBut we thank her thoughts can only be one of three place they can be in the past drum that can be a depression for the president wrote\nA or they can be the future for the future room and whichever one room your thoughts are in the German short period of like in that moment because of course have thoughts can go back and forth\nAnd in a linear time if you will do we can point to know where are your thoughts are and in order to know where you are you need to hear your thoughts\nAnd it is that active observation that separates your awareness from you thought you know I like to find consciousness that we all showed that the cautious because like I should be all share that's why you have to like coming out of the president\nYou know I read something recently and I and then I it really kind of opened up my own consciousness\nAnd it was how many hours a day we generally are thinking about the day before and I thought wow that is so true that they're paying attention you know okay how how many times by reflected back to yesterday\nAnd the more I thought about that the more I could be present because I can realize I'm I'm actually thinking about something yesterday or maybe I'm worried about something\nTomorrow um but just the act of knowing that and then taking steps to to be in the press and be in that middle room I made a a really big difference to me\nWhat United Right on the head is actively being knowing or being aware that you're thinking of something from yesterday\nSimilar thing I mean we we have something like seven eight thousand dollars a day and they say something along the lines of Ninety percent of thoughts are parts from yesterday as you were mentioning show we're constantly looking back and then we we keep projecting into the future to worry about the future\nBut not not going back into the past room or not going into the future room about being aware that showed that\nMen have the same thought every six seconds [laughter]\nSo that's only on six seconds to say the same as the restrict second yesterday minimize those thought I thought you were out ten percent of those laws it'd be much more efficient\nTo trick [laughter] there's some truth to you that you're speaking most\nPeople realize what room there and I mean do do most people realize they have to read a book like the three rooms or listen to a show like this to to actually say oh wow maybe I'm In the other room [noise]\nBut it's actually really hip ... based on how you feel like I had if we have that many thousand today I'm trying to monitor all of those thought all the time\nEspecially like every second that same thought that keeps popping up you know we get we wouldn't be able to monitor all those dog number one it makes it a lot easier to kind of put it into three different buckets are three different room\nYou know that the past the president or the future\nBut how do which room you're in a play based on how you feel\nBecause when I talk about the Castro I'm not talking about recalling positive past experiences that make you feel good I'm Talking about\nTaking about things that happen in the past that are causing negative emotion in you and you're reliving those negative emotions it could be something that I co worker said you're still mad at them or\nSomething you do and you know when you feel guilty about it or something you do you feel guilty about it and you know negative emotions are eating you up\nHere you're constantly going back and stealing those negative emotions or in the future room it's constantly looking ahead to the future and thinking about what you don't have and and worrying about how you got to get something and and worrying about a Joni stressing Heidi\nThose thoughts that are causing negative emotion you know people get up there and they don't realize that the whole key is what you said you need to be aware of unique actively monitor how you feel and that let you know what room you're in\nOne there's been so many studies we were talking about this before you came on so many studies that show\nThat attitude is a direct reflection of your house in your health is a direct reflection of your attitude\nAnd I think it was Henry Ford that said you you can think you can or think you can't but either way you're right\nAnd this is the same concept when it comes to a gene and help you you can if you're thinking you're old you will be if you're signed into the idea that you're young and you still have life and you you will be but we got to go to a break I Want to make sure you tell us on Twitter at\nThe media that day and media we'll be right back and we're going to talk to a

answer your question\nDr ... consumer lab dot com duty but deep dive recently a an expiration date if you will on the beach to answer your question there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of companies and that's why\nOur presentation last friday was such a big deal at the council for responsible nutrition\nBecause it was called for adults only what you need to know about CBD so what I'm about to say will be provocative and I'm doing it on purpose of this stuff works what do I mean this stuff works hemp extracts can nab annoyed they work in twenty Fifteen\nAn estimated one hundred and eighty three point three million people age Fifteen to sixty four years of age used cannabis that three point eight percent of global population did you know was that much to undergo\nNo I Do now to this\nUses the most prevalent among young people age Fifteen to thirty for about Thirteen point nine percent using it in the past and among Fifteen to sixteen year old\nSchool students in Europe in the United states last month cannabis use with eight percent and Fifteen Percent respectively so there are so many people\n... on the planet earth hardwired to be curious about this plant what the hemp extracts offer or the benefits potentially without the risks and side effects\nSo consumer lab dot com did a deep dive on all the CBD companies and found them\nWanting wanting in a couple of areas number one number one have you noticed that very few of these companies tell you how many milligrams of CBD you're getting per soft gel or per serving have you noticed that\nYeah that that does does the consumer labs say that their their report\nOr their investigation ... the doses range from two points ... milligrams to twenty two points re milligrams\nA big range but it also you might notice in their report it says when seeking CBD products look for products that list the amount of CBD per serving it says it directly on the front of their report they also look at other ... noise out there and what does what are the ...\nThe ... you know that you as a consumer are buying a full plan full spectrum can extract and not an isolated crystal CBD cannabis dial one molecule not what you want\nSo you want to look at the consumer lab report to see with your own eyeballs\nThat the product that you're consuming\nOr ... you also want to make sure that it meets the label claims that you pay pretend milligrams you get ten milligrams these are all important things you can find it all at consumer lab dot com some of our biggest competitors who I won't mention by name\nCome up looking really ugly and the consumer lab dot com report and sort of like an investigative rip the band aid off and look at that nasty warned that you're trying to cover over for consumers\nBecause here's the biggest challenge with this ingredient\nDoctor it almost always works even if it's poorly made in a dirty place with an inaccurate label the actual molecule itself CBD and these hemp extracts are so powerful and so effective that even if they're poor quality you might still get some benefit doesn't that make it different\nThan the things we've dealt with in the past for quality products just didn't work in the past that's my point\nWhich is a it's a CBD and him supplements review a consumer lab dot com um find out how much CBD is really in CBD and how boils and see our top picks well guess what the science is among the top picks right\nThat is correct and on the Dr oz show just the other day on the doctor show with Dr Sanjay Gupta and Dr ... they showed our product in a few others that they could not yet in Dorset the doctors could not yet endorsed although Dr oz\nTold the audience that he's hearing incredible things\nSo where are we are starting to cross that

eight Sunday in the NFL already underway legal scoring again just a few minutes ago\nTheir third touched down to the game three touchdown pass through the game for Carson once and right now the eagles were on top of the jags twenty four Fifteen so like ... and that Jacksonville often struggling again\nThey're going to try to come back here in the fourth with uh nine minutes left to go in that one to keep you posted on that we've got seven other early games coming up here at the top of the hour we'll keep you posted on all those games while we're doing the show we got some great gas coming up including\nOur quarter back more Malone who's going to join us at the top of our number to love to get more insights on all the action and just to the big story lines in the NFL you can hear of course mark Malone under center during the week here on NBC Sports radio is we're looking forward to that are also [laughter] we just\nI I Love it I said every week uh this is the final Sunday of October but this is without a doubt I mean the the the best time of the year if you're a sports fan\nEverything that's going on and we've got game five of the world series here in LA tonight we'll talk more about that in a moment and a lot of lot of great story lines already right out of the gate in the NBA including the breaking news today if you heard the update\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers fired head coach tie Lou after the Owens six stored\nAnd clearly look you knew that the cabs we're going to fall off the cliff without liberal on but\nI think too that I mean immediately what pops into my mind when I when I see the story and I I covered tight Lu I traveled with the Lakers when he was a part of the Lakers repeat team or you know ties especially if you guys I think he's he's a good coach but clearly\nFor the cabs in their front office what would this tells me is that they believe that when they made the switch and they they let a tie Lou take over and become the head coach they looked at him as more of a la Braun manager then a a coach\nAnd so they're promoting Larry Drew who's going to take over as the interim head coach but I mean this is ...\nAnd and I haven't heard what what they've said or what the reasoning is but clearly even without the brawn\nFrom what they've seen in these six games all losses for the cabs they don't like the way the cabs are playing or how they're progressing or what they're doing or or how they're competing or how they're how they're adjusting to this adversity\nAnd I am just saying on the surface to me it sounds like they felt like well you know what time it was great he was great I'm managing the team with LeBron you know even with LeBron you still need to head coach\nBut did they feel like Larry ... would be a better ... and those guys that can find a way to\nExtract something from the players that they have on that cabs roster minus LeBron James so that just just my my gut reaction when the news came down to about twenty minutes ago\nI feel for tie Lou and and I'm sure he'll he'll get back into it or gives organization somewhere at some point I I'd be surprised if he jumped right in as a head coach again\nBut he'll he'll get a shot to be an assistant and you know hopefully down the road who give it another shot but it's a good run and you know he did get a ring out of it or when the warriors\nAre lost that ... blue that three one leading the cabs came back which was incredible\nSo but again that's what's going on in the NBA the warriors or have a a late afternoon game today later on in Brooklyn is there on the road Kevin rant after playing the Knicks on friday night of the words will go for that tonight and ah\nNo the brunt of the Lakers inaction tonight but the clippers are home to my take on the wiz and your piece Fox and drawn stash our talking about just what a monster day sports day\nIt is here in LA you know with the rams and the Packers the clippers are home the LA kings or the kings have a a matinee with the New York rangers today the galaxy your home you know the world series so it it's a busy busy busy busy day and a fun time before I go any further before we get into the big three\nReally quickly I I just want to start the show\nBy offering our thoughts and prayers and condolences with all of those families and everyone affected after the the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre yesterday or or just our thoughts and prayers are with those people and with those families and they just wanted to\nTo let them know and just let everybody know that we're thinking of them were praying for them and we just\nWe need we need got right now in this country we need God in this nation we we need we need healing we need restoration and when he got to heal people's hearts and I just pray for that price for that situation there and pray that um\nThat they would just that would be able to to heal and that there would just be love and support around them in that community to help them through this rough time so I just wanted to start a show off with that and\nSo with that said again we've got an absolutely busy days the final Sunday of the month and as always let's get things started with the big three part\nOf the top three\nThree [noise]\nAll right well it's a busy I mean I Can't believe this week eight in the NFL is already here right and the action is already underway today the eagles and the jags inland and this is a big game for both teams I mean the eagles\nOr had that tough last last week when they they gave a Twenty one points to Caroline in the fourth quarter then they had to make this trip as I say Carson winds started off rough I mean he had\nFumble and then an interception but has since ah\nFound his stride three touchdowns on the day or two of them choose to different tied in Dallas got hurt and then Zach or it's also a window small would took a little short pass and turned it into a thirty six or a touchdown [noise] ah the Jackson just kicked another field goal

retreat camp for officers that are just need a place to go and and reconnect with their family what we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability [noise]\nCamp will be a the the\nCamp will be done by the nonprofit the land that had his own own own will be rented or on we currently own that property currently on that property and living living on at a\nTime and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of a\nYou know you need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of a insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I'd be concerned about uh that if somebody fail and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the tenant they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\n'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit or how I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do some ... let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands of the land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah so you keep that separates a and so treat that you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying and it's a treat these things separately and your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of insurance people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to state farming in an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it\nI might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you you said you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that right airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you what how that how the liability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would\nMake a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that righteous policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs so much and this kind of a company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it costs as much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the farm plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that\nYou know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes as but the main thing you want is liability do do hold harmless agreements carry any weight anything of this um\nNo I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from you cannot contract away liability\nOkay so let's say that a floor was right and then one of the cabins\nOkay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless I think you you are liable for that or you're standing in my building\nIf you slip and fall and uh and because we didn't you know properly and stole the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a Harley Varmus before he walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called ... those moves or risk management moved you're you're managing your risk but I hold harmless is it what that does is it it's like a lot of costs\nHonest right it's like do you know you you were you were walking across the floor he fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not have to write him a check\nBut you need the backup in case you were to lose that uh and it'd be proven that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I I Would have um signed them and those cases\nFor sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and I have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents they're all fine print of about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable there's still a lot more\nThey'll still loose so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you hey thanks for the call I appreciate your joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five at two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump
