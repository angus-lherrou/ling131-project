baby steps and my concern is that I have a pen hate us select soccer and that costs money it's not too expensive but I don't feel like pulling the rug out from under him just because I've made mistakes and how would you suggest they handle that [noise]\nUm what do you select soccer crash\nIt only seven hundred and fifty dollars a year and not print all it has um the uniform and everything\nIn your household income is what\nI'm just under a hundred thousand\nOkay and you um uh you have how much debt\nSeventy five thousand [noise] okay\nUm I mean it's not a deal breaker it's seven hundred and fifty dollars for the thing that sharing and I did when we were looking at things like that was we would if we found one thing like that that we were going to not cut to hit our debt free go we had to find something else where we're going to cut deeper\nOkay show like that means that if you are going to cheat and go out to eat once a month now you're not\nOr the if you thought you were going to do X now you're not manage that jak instead we're doing select soccer [noise] um and how many kids do you have three okay and is he the oldest or the youngest or he sold the oldest okay\nAll right and um well I mean you get yourself out of debt than the other kids as they come up can you can do whatever you want to do with them in terms of ah\nYou know activities in sports and stuff you can afford to do all of that the thing that we decided was that all of this just for fun because\nUm I mean Daniel my son played ice hockey all the way up through high school we knew at six years old he was not going to play in the journal right we we're pretty sure at that point you know and uh so we made decisions to invest in ice hockey to have fun right\nNot because we were trying to create a future career for him rain and\nNot play we ... the ... there are a couple of different options and when we put Atlanta's left half the cost of the others you\nKnow and you know so parents go bananas on this stuff is my point\nAnd uh some of them you know they spend ten thousand bucks on whatever and you know in a sport that the kid is never going to go pro probably not even going to get a scholarship and all your does burn up the kid and a half your budget but seven or fifty bucks is not the case that you're fine you know you just\nGot to be but you do need to look at it what it does is it makes you stop and pause enough you called me that's pretty cool yeah he paused and he went crap I got to think about this and so you know just try to find you a trade off to innocence pay for it or we're gonna you know in a sense we're going to knock this out\nWe're like forty seven dollars I'm not over budget as things stand now\nUm we had back in January we had an identity theft going on in our town and that is almost twelve to Fifteen hundred dollars and\nThat the bank to far\nSo that\nI mean why why did the bank charge you anything if there was identity theft\nAnd be it well it was Keynes was charged to our account\nI Know but if it's identity theft or bank shouldn't be charging you anything\nWell they did and they said there was nothing they can do about it\nA lot can change banks\nYeah we did okay wait we actually closed banking and we just have a debit card that um if one of those little Walmart orange you know we don't even go through the banks anymore it's just a debit card [noise] but um they charge us\nLike six nearby six hundred dollars in overdraft mhm and they wouldn't take them back to\nBack down here in that time because that was going on we got a hand on our house payment\nAnd um got the more things in a smaller next and we had well we got the smaller and I still have a hand on our house I've talked to the housing alone people and they're working with is that we're having to pay extra online on our mortgage payment\nSure how old are you guys\nPicking on so I'm fifty nine and a thick the mom Seventy nine or\nAre you guys on some kind of a fixed income for some reason\nThis is the middle of the three other than none of you were able to work\nYou know I Do a little sad business with crafts and things like that what is the nature of your disability um is a hip displacement what's wrong with him um he\nHad um a as a and broke his back uh-huh and he has a um\nBase of the bone it's getting close to his nerves sack mhm and he also had a trip a bypass surgery a few years ago when he had the defending later and he's got like twenty five percent of his heart beating so\nMhm okay [noise] um [noise] well\nWhat what you guys have more than anything else is an income crisis right due to the fixed income and that's why I was exploring the question that does sound like you've got some pretty serious limitations\nUm but what I'm going to do if I'm In your shoes is what you kind of started doing there with the crafts\nAnd even in his shoes are obviously none of you all are going to be involved in physical labor of any kind right on crime but if there was something that you could\nDo like I talked to a lady the other day who was just going to garage sales and she was buying clothing for a quarter Anna Nicole showing it on ... for a dollar and two dollars and she had done that like ten thousand times are made like ten thousand dollars\nMhm okay\nAnd that doesn't involve any heavy lifting obviously it involves the keystrokes on the computer to set up an account and sell some stuff on me but I'm not saying that's what you do I'm just saying that something like that that is\nThat that that is in the line with the limitations that you guys have because if we can add a thousand dollars a month only\nYour world it would change your life wouldn't it it ... I guess or will be dramatic and how old is mom mom Seventy nine\nAnd how much of this thirty four forty two comes from her\nEleven forty seven yeah she passes away you don't get a real problem correct\nSo we've got to solve some of the income issue one way or another here um and how much is your house primary\n[noise] um [noise] do they work for Seventy eight and they've increased it five [noise]\nAnd it was that kind of non you're not just through the taxes and insurance going up\n... you know China and what's the home worth it for a ride at a hundred and ... we only twelve five only doing this you know without a doubt sure would be good when [noise] mhm yeah\nSo I think more than anything the the magic wand here is some kind of an idea\nFor you to create some income and I don't know what that is what I Want the three of you to sit around and talk about what you could do a you're obviously not going to do anything this physical I get that you got some serious limitations I understand that\nAnd I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help you are but it\nMan I found some dollars a month would change your whole life\nSo I was ... a month for a year and you pay the house off\nAnd that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem and right now you being a serious problem two thousand dollars a month income change\nYou feel like you were rich like you were multi millionaires or something it would change your life that much and so in is that possible yes that is possible\nIt's very possible but you need some income id\nYou can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or whatever and again it doesn't I don't want to put a bunch of strain on you physically but um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation where the over the phone so you can have an intelligent conversation with somebody we don't sell them something\nRight and that that's possible thing you can do um the you know and it doesn't cause you to\nWork forty hours a week necessarily but if you could do anything that creates a thousand dollars a month that would change your world and that's that's really what I Would work on rather than try to solve the forty seven dollar problem\nThat you've got what that is just symptomatic of the fact that you're struggling with income and legitimately ... you're struggling it's my pleasure lazy or something like that but it just hand\nIf you could come up with any kind of a small business idea that your husband and you can do together um and just get the get the needle to move a little bit here\nMan it would change everything for you and thank you for the call open phones interpolate eight to five five two to five Benjamin is in Oklahoma City Hi Benjamin how are you\nToday and how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nMy wife and I graduated college about a little over a year ago and we got a good job good and bought a house good and I'm Wondering in your eye on what are we paid it off about ...\n... in your eyes or you're paying\nFor any kind of financial perspective is a good time to start thinking about having kids because she is getting kind of pushy and there are that it I'm sure mhm ah so I just want to get your thoughts on it\nNow I was actually the one that want to kids fresh with insurance ... she won but um [noise] uh I\nI don't think that there's a financial manager other than just being completely crazy like if you don't have sixteen kids or if you're broke that stupid okay that was crazy but you guys are in great shape your sharp young couple whenever you're ... whenever you're emotionally in relation to ready to have kids and God says it's okay to have kids\nDon't have kids I I don't I don't tell people that need to be out of debt and have the emergency room there's not a baby step for kids\nUm you know you don't have to be a certain place you're going to be fine a child is not going to destroy your life financially or as a matter of fact you probably won't even hardly notice\nEverybody talks about oh children ... five hundred and sixty two thousand dollars to raise you out really not really they eat the same broccoli you eat after a certain point\nThere in the in the same warm house you're already in after a certain point and so the actual cost of a kid is just not\nThat is not devastating\nBut again you don't want to just load up a whole house full of them if you're broke and that that will cause a problem\nBut to decide to have your first couple of children I mean it's that's not something that's between you and God and your wife\nAnd you guys are in good shape\nYour financially smart you're already moving in the right direction\nYou want to start now it doesn't bother me at all of this\nDid you know that if you combine that data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every American has had their personal info compromised her act\nOver fifty percent of our listeners and viewers tell us that they or someone in their family has been a victim and Seventy percent of those folks have had it happen more than once she this is unbelievable wants the you get your info the risk never goes away and they can use it when I ever and however they choose it truly has become an issue of not enough\nBut when that's why the only plant I've ever recommended is through Zander insurance I actually sat down with them and we put together a plan\nThat I felt provided the best protection but didn't waste dollars on things you could easily do yourself or we're just gimmicks the key is getting protected before you're a victim managed to like go to Sandra dot com recall eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two we're all at risk\nAnd

rate\nAnd where the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay now my guess is that is going to be pretty limiting on the house that you buy your income\nYeah it's a ...

three seconds left in the first quarter\nA it is Thursday um\nBy the way all three of us Brett Abbott and Alex already my producer and I will pick Houston to win this game and the reason I say that is because on Thursday we make our entire\nNFL picks for the entire week so it's we gave this week uh we go back to last week I went to one of the Web and a three that's pretty good way for me uh I by the way to lead the crew right now by three games I had a Brett Alex is for back as I Am sixty is thirty eight on the season [noise]\nAround haven't got all that crap out of the way let's go ahead and get to these pick sprawl music Brett\nAs we begin with a week ... and the national football league and force the early game will feature the Philadelphia Eagles have three and four [noise]\nTake it on the home team the Jacksonville Jaguars their home will be in London no this is that early game played overseas either team right now is playing well but I'll take Carson when's over voice portals who will start again for Jacksonville is kind of a I'm\nA I don't want to say in a must win but it's a huge game for both of these teams and um [noise] because it's a new profile takes over the ... in Philadelphia and that's when I was about you\nClearly the quarterback advantage going into the Philadelphia Eagles in terms of the defense the [noise]\nYou know the bread and butter from Jacksonville Jaguars they're searching they will continue to do so I think I like the eagles easily in this one already Brett [noise] I think the only certainty in this game is that the jaguars will play Tony ... let me give me the eagles to\nWall eagles but this one meanwhile we have a great AFC West match up the Broncos are three and four are struggling to arrow to arrowhead and take on the red hot Kansas City chiefs at six and one [noise] listen it's been nothing but distraction after distraction or the Broncos I finally got to win column last week but I I don't think they're even in the same\nClass as the Kansas City chiefs who I think go ahead and run the record to seven in one of the Kansas City Alex\nYet there's no faith in the Denver Broncos slowing down the chief's voice Freeman named Phillip ... who's going to carry the rock twenty five times none about how she seasonally Deborah yes she's real\nAll right we all take Kansas City meanwhile you moved to the sea north now rematch a week one the browser to foreign one take on the Pittsburgh Steelers had Heinz Field there are three to one one yeah that's right they bowl is high\nTide each other in week one\nDifferent kind of Brown's team no bigger Mayfield at quarterback and we've got Nick Chubb starting that running back that was different from week one nonetheless I think the Steelers when this one going away so I'll take Pittsburgh Alex ... to\nBring in mark you're falling off the ground trained how to one in three in a row but now\nPittsburgh you know hey it happened I was\nI was I was in Jacksonville was wrong and the seeds these things happen but I I went through with Pittsburgh I Do like to shoot out I think they are looking up at least then\nPittsburgh's enough swing Cleveland's gonna down swing there should be an easy one purpose\nAnd so on the first three games for all and agreements dealers she said eagles we move on now for the NFC Easter Redskins sitting on top of the vision of born to head to the Meadowlands take on the one in six giants there in the midst of a fire sale no matter how you spend it\nI don't think New York a given the distractions of what's going on over the past week can stay with the red skins who all they have to do is take care of the football say Washington Alex\nYeah this one's going to be Washington\nSee how many times the giants aren't there drives the landing and shotguns clearly trying to pass that's not going to work from high tech giants are meant to me that's\nAll right how about that first four games were all in agreement here's an interesting one to three and three Seattle Seahawks on a plane headed to the motor city to take on a three and three lions who make a deal to bring over snack terrorists to bolster that thirtieth rank rushing attack\nThis one could go either way because it's in Detroit and I think the lions are bolstered by the the recent trade I'm going to take Detroit in this one Alex\n... there were opposite Pete Carroll Damon snack there will be driving through Cleveland right now on his way to the motor city but I think he gets there in time for Sunday\nI'm kind of stuck here I think I'll take the same lines All right how 'bout you brought down the line last week I'm not going to do it again I think\nThey went home All right first fiber all it agreement moving on down the buccaneers uh three and three in that horrible the parents\nTo Cincinnati to take on the poor and three bingo so all of a sudden last back to back games of ferrets last week after only scoring ten points it gets a Kansas City defense\nI think they get healthy this week against that buccaneers defense I'll take the Bengals Alex [noise]\nIt's hard to root against the uh the bangles when they're playing down to their competition the buccaneers are certainly no Kansas City chiefs now that the magic is out of the bottle or I like Cincinnati at home\nAnd bread with another one wow\nAll right we're all agreement that's incredible that's ever happened before\nLet's move on now we've got a really interesting match up to three and four New York jets head to the\nCity of big shoulders to Chicago Bears will host the jets had three and three Michel ... from time to time it was like a really good quarterback I think a little Mac will be a little bit more healthy this week that he was a week ago although I think

Williams in the end zone for touched down\nTo Jackson said at the polls came afterward yet missed it yeah I was told I missed it was very honest on my side it sure wasn't uh the guy on the other side it was definitely a guy my side that was a false start I agree I look back wasn't taking any went wow okay that's great\nI I think one has to ask the question what's gone on would you go cruising the past\nI mean you don't get fired in the middle of the season\nFor missing you know a an illegal procedure a motion penalty on the officer tackle something else is going on\nNow the NFL put the NFL referees having association they vowed to fight this thing which is a again I don't know enough of the the the facts and the specifics about this but this is why I'm not a union guy because if in fact the NFL felt that there was enough of that this guy wasn't doing or wasn't being\nUm wasn't officiating standard set over a period of time\nOr the has the right they made the right to ... I don't want the guy and they are either but what uh what what unions do is they generally protect the lowest common denominator which is unfortunate\nOn nonetheless I said this before and we talk a little bit about it with our friend Francois from Yahoo Sports earlier in the show um I I Wonder to be honest with you\nWhether or not the a rep reason the national football league the officials\nAre actually on the same page with the NFL we keep having these um points of emphasis and rule changes and the competition gets together every year and they tweak rules and they do kind of ... they do stuff it's just asinine in my opinion they're offering the quarterback thing a point of emphasis asinine\nAlright leading with a crowd of your head I get it and we thought that was going to change the outcome of games that really hasn't been much of a factor in fact I see it three or four times on every game I watch every Sunday and I rarely see a call instead we're you know concerned about whether or not we brush up against the quarterback\nBut a shot hockey league the son of a ... give me the former ah NFL official down with a big biceps or the other day and a game between the bucks in the Cleveland\nBrowns bigger Mayfield scrambled as he is going to the ground the slide and he's protected in that point ah one of the bucks defenders launches himself like Superman through the air and makes held to helmet contact\nWith Baker Mayfield out flags were thrown they picked it up and shot hockey league open up his mind to announce to the crowd\nThat the quarterback now that he's left the pocket was a runner and thereby did not have the protection of quarterback normally gets and therefore is allowed to be hit in the head and I'm thinking to myself they just say that for the entire nation to here and the fans to here because the NFL just put together this rule about\nNot initiating contact with your health on this is a helmet to helmet hits I Know he's not in the pocket anymore but my God you're telling me that the NFL officials in the ...\nAge these guys have a tough job but I mean my God if you didn't write so we'll see what happens when you go cruise I but I find is really interesting by the way\nAnd I don't know I I can only hope that and it's just like this that it's going to make appreciating in general better than the national football they write the Houston Rockets are proposed for first round draft picks over the next seven years to the Minnesota timber wolves for Jimmy Butler yeah\nWe'll talk the curriculum and pro basketball talk about that next ...

I'm Sorry he's on the town's weakens timeline really quality three in the wings will hospitals and does a lot of good things he's these\nPlay he's number down a little bit in Miami 'cause we're just asking to do too much this year but if you put him in an all be fantastic there's just a lot of things that would work for them but it's not a win now move and that's where two but does mentality is this is the problem sometimes I think with having\nCoach GM in the same role the gyms job is to think long term to think hey\nKevin Durant may leave this summer and and you know in three years there may not be two or three years they may not be a Golden State as we know it right now we should be planning to push them then rather than try to win this year\nBut people do in particular and coaches in general that's not the mentality it makes you an MBA coach professional coach at any level you're ultra competitive you're going to win now you're gonna push all your chip you know\nAnd I get it for Houston more they aren't with critical and James Harden they are they are fully in when now mode and they should do whatever it takes and they can't send him as a free agent so there's got to go on and on the trait but for Minnesota\nThinking long term would make more sense doing this deal to get the poor picks or or doing something with Miami that just makes more sense than to me than losing butler for nothing\nYeah ... you're going to walk away you're not going to get anything for and we're talking with a new one on M. B. C. sports pro basketball talk you're under center\nBy five three two three four NBC or it was more the Lakers nobody finally get a win of course the key because the sun so I don't know how much were what that means\nUh in the midst of all this ... gets fined Fifteen thousand dollars for going out for the officials and I'm thinking to myself in the midst of a slow start as this much about is this as much about the wall and see and I got your back LeBron James I'm gonna stick up for this team type of a thing or my thinking too much into this\nI Know I think that that does play into it but does it built up for a couple of gauge everybody gets frustrated when they remember they lost the rockets before the not\nThe staples home opener everybody gets frustrated playing the rockets are because James Harden draws a ton of thousand as qualities do you call it flopping which you know Bolton dead color or whatever you want\nThere also masters at drawing the contact and getting us out they're very very good at it and they they stick push you know we can get into it they really skirt the rules push the rules to the edge\nBut they're very good at it everybody gets frustrated so they they feel like they didn't get justice that night\nAnd then they felt like they really didn't get justice in next night against San Antonio and they just bought snapped I was in the press game presser and he just walked in and basically said before the game you guys tried to go\nRight here we go I'm willing to pay the fine I've got to get this off my just got to see if I can move that needle a little bit and I think there is some blonde and they're like you said the wrong on in the same way that this has happened to Shaq and other players in the past\nIs so strong so athletic\nThat he gets settled in ... you know other guys get fouled and you see it granted power through those vowels just muscles his way fouls and still makes plays and she'll get calls that he doesn't get because he's so strong you know [noise]\nUh alright are your thoughts about the way the Toronto Raptors have gotten off to start in more than Hawaii winters grown up there\nOr they look really good they don't do drugs that they\nDo look really good and it's especially a contrast with Boston's off and it's kind of stumbling and bubbling start the season it's kind of you know Boston will get it together but it's kind of a contrast to see them come out in ... look\n... you know the first couple of games in ... in the pre season there was some hostage people that watch them last night there's not much less left author he's starting to really come into his own um and then there was a you know we talked about before that's a fifty nine when team last year and the knock\nOn them was always have it in the playoffs they're predictable they got a different coach I think they're gonna be less predictable and more than that\nQuite Leonard's wanted the playoffs each got rings you would like to show you his final didn't eat the trophy and he's going to show up in the playoffs so I I they look I mean again we're five games in you know where\nI was trying to do the math makes the other day I take a one point three to one point six miles into the marathon the NBA season\nIts own way to go\nBut that said I mean that's a really impressive start for them and if they're playing like this at the end they're they're the one team in the east to kind of ... really push Boston\nFor and I want to set the safest way former commissioner stern took a shot at Bell Labs and the public and the other day ah this was going back to the whole deal that was going to say Chris called the Lakers that he mixed but beyond that uh you look at Anthony Davis was off to an incredible start and you ask yourself\nBoy are they getting closer and closer to the fact that they're just going to end up losing this guy and what do they do I mean he's a fantastic basketball player but I Can't imagine him when he becomes for you can stand down in New Orleans\n[noise] he hits possible I I think more I think he is trying to get out the door and less than some free agents with a lot of money coming their way um that\nAnd here's here's the plan out but it's not a secret here's the plan in in in New Orleans play out this season with the west it really well by the way I could use a wing they've got to that but they they look like really good to start to season they're playing really fast they finally got a roster probably best roster they've had around it as much as you can\nHave him go nuts maybe when does the MVP was my ... he's going to be in the mix you know all that you have him happens monster season then after the season you say about it and say hey here's our designated veteran two hundred and forty million dollar contract extension office and beer him to walk away\nBecause he walks away even if they trade him somewhere else and that he resigns him it's fifty million dollars guaranteed less um do you get him to walk away if he says no to that next summer and I don't\nI just don't think you switch agents to rich Paul if you're going to sign was put in front of you right if he says no to that next summer then things get interesting but up until that they're just they're all in to try to keep him and even if he says no\nThey might this might be like Kevin Durant and okay see where they're like we don't get players like this very often we just we got to hang onto the last minute\nFair enough to my friend there is lots of orange slices and water longest marathon to her one point three miles into it so I'm looking forward to our discussions throughout the NBC's a base for a couple of it it's going to have a great weekend\nI I Am by the way I Would not walk away from two hundred and forty million oh who's he wants to pay me that I Will take it\nI Would walk away for two hundred and forty bucks my friend that's currently on NBC Sports pro basketball talk and joined us on weekly to break

[laughter]\nBecause no one's play defense I don't think it's only because it's Carmelo though no I'm just kidding but what does it mean for Carmelo I mean his his role will get even less be bringing a Jimmy Butler\nIt's incredible do you think about this team and you think about the Houston Rockets why not go for it all here right Chris pause not getting any younger and James Orange twenty nine years old at this point he's starting to get some miles on it I hate I hate to break into your no one's getting any younger we're all getting older\nOr speak for yourself I actually am like Benjamin mommy the curious case of dance wants names are not getting any younger he's not he's not your right to beer is getting a little rare\nI'm telling ya it's it's a bold move if Darryl Maury can pull it off\nBut I'm all for it and here's why it makes it more competitive\nThe Houston Rockets versus the Golden State warriors and that to me is the only match up that's going to be fun to watch in the NBA playoffs whatever Boston in Toronto might be a fun match up in the eastern conference finals maybe Philadelphia against one of those two teams in a you know a second or third round matchup refund as well\nBut if you add Jimmy Butler into the mix and you put up a team of Judy butler James Harden Chris Paul\nAgainst Iran's\nSteph Curry clay Thompson I mean I don't put dream on and I dream on the anger on but the markets cousins will be back at that point\nThat's fun that's the fun aspect of basketball that we all want so in terms of being a selfish viewer I Hope that the Houston Rockets can land Jimmy Butler because I think it makes for a better basketball in a top heavy league anyway Shawn so selfish news tells the apps are frequently go out and get Jimmy bomb and make a deal\nUn ... yeah I I'm into yeah I think it's a great trade for the Houston Rockets because without Jimmy ball or as you just said\nWhere are they going I don't they can't be Golden State they might not be able to say with Jimmy Butler but it's worth a chance don't you think\nAbsolutely you make that move that's a no brainer move you make but they don't go to it's not like should we Butler's a rental they're going to sign up to an extension\nSo you have a a little bit of a window it's not just about this year could be about next two years as well\nHow much though are they willing\nWhatever you call it and you know the penalty I guess\nI mean you at Jimmy Butler you sign them and I guess Larry Bird writes wherever the heck it is I mean as you know so where do you get free for a guy you get signed them and it doesn't affect your cap or you can find him go over your cab NBA makes no sense to me when it comes to the cap you need a PHD to figure this out but\nIf they sign Jimmy boatload of the five year hundred Ninety million dollar deal I mean that's thirty eight million dollars per year\nAren't they can be paying a boatload of taxes when he thing horns making forty two million forty two and a half million of course Paul signed a max deal to write us three guys that we make like a hundred and ten a hundred and twenty million bucks\nThat's crazy three guys so what do you do I mean I don't understand the economics\nOf basketball where you have yourself a soft cabins obviously a soft cap if you have three players enough about a hundred and twenty million bucks and then he still to fill out a roster of nine other guys\nDoesn't make it out to me but whatever I don't care it's not my money it's not my tax dollars that go to the NBA but in reality as a viewer that's what I Want to see and for the Minnesota tables I just don't think they get a better deal\nYou think there's Richardson kitten from Miami in a couple of scraps is a better deal look the Houston Rockets the first two of these draft picks they're not going to be great picks because they're going to win a lot of games it's about the last two draft picks when James Horton thirty four\nGod God\nI Am sick and tired of people who aren't good at their job continuing to work because the union backing him I'm sick and tired of that if you didn't get your job you don't belong there I don't care if it's a powerful union that keeps you employed you shouldn't work so the NFL\nPlayers association which is just like any other union out there the referees association Scott Greene defected director came out and said quote the NFL's are troubling history of knee jerk reactions with an eye on public relations and clearly does not learned from past mistakes\nThe NFL All right we'll protect the collectively bargaining rights of all officials in will challenge this reckless decision does a grievance process and you wonder why most Americans are sick and tired of unions\nYou're telling me all of your members are good you're telling me there's no problems in officiating and the NFL or\nYou blind Scott Greene like half of the people that pay dues to your union here officials are horrendous NFL officiating terrible confidence and NFL officials must be at an all time low and this guy's got his head up his rear end thinking they're doing a great job in don't deserve to be fired\nThis is the problem with the audience and there's just no different than unions in New York City which is a powerful union town where you can fire workers and teachers who are accused of molesting kids are stuck in these rooms crossing their salary for years 'cause you can't fire him I'm Glad if this guy's as bad as the show to be\nHe deserves to be fired you cruise doesn't deserve to have a job\nThat is covered by how many high school and college officials out there and pop Warner officials who want nothing to have a fulltime job making six figures officiating NFL games stink at your job you don't belong in\nThe way he's not a concept that plays a role in every single job\nIf you're not good as a plumber you don't work if you're not good as it all at first and you don't work if you're an investment banker and he continues to lose money for your clients you don't work if you're an official and you make terrible calls you don't work\nOh that's right but you have this powerful union that claims older guys are great at their job what Scott Greene the executive director of the NFL referees association needs to realize is people don't trust his constituents\nWe don't believe they do a good job I don't care what collectively bargain you don't deserve to have every one of your employees\nEmployed if they can't do the job correct now I Do think officiating was a tough job I Do think the rules every single year they continue to attack on more and more I think it's come to a point where these guys have too many rules to try to figure out as they watch a game in real time from their positions I think it's gotten out of hand I Do\nBut don't sit there and tell me that their officiating is good not now do they do the best they can I'm sure they do and it's never going to be perfect\nBut this is why I don't like unions and this is exactly the answer for that\nThe NFL graves officials on their performance every play of every game okay sometimes they'll suspend or their ... reassign officials for games that you know mistakes that have occurred\nAnd they get a evaluated every year they get placed in tears tier one tier two tier three to one of the top performer to your to mid level grades two or three so lowest performing official at a given year\nNow if you have been a cheer three official two consecutive years that makes you vulnerable determination\nAnd I think that's the way it should be so now for these officials who thought that they can't be fired and their Supreme Court justices would lifetime appointments\nSo powerful union that protects them even in poor performance\nWell maybe they'll shape up maybe these guys who feel that they can just go about their business 'cause they're not afraid of getting fired maybe they'll look at their good buddy Hugo crews and realize crap I could be the next few go grows you know what it's good to put a little fear and these guys\nIt's not good when people don't feel that their job performance will determine if they have a job or not if you don't you know if you don't fear that you could get fired for poor performance why going to work hard right why are you going to work hard if you don't worry about getting fired\nThat's the problem here in this country and by the way to pick up anti union I Am I live in New York City for crying out loud\nAre you in the New York city you look at the uh you know the subway systems and the the you know the the falling apart of things like that basic necessities teachers and things like that I guess what you become anti union I hate to say it\nAnd I want to see this guy go after the NFL wants the Scott Greene go after the NFL and prove that his guys good official first of all the other folks have never taken the step 'til now in the super bowl era tells you that they've been placed on what the union and this guy must have been really bad\nFor you will cruise to get fired and the super bowl era in season for performance again a first in the NFL and were fifty two Super Bowls in\n... it's been probably a little too lenient over the years maybe Scott Greene needs to be counting is lucky stars that this is the first time to fifty two years has ever happened Sean due to the series leaves and you're right in season officials have been fired will let go before\nFor poor performance but it's usually done after the season\nThere's plenty of guys out there who killed for an NFL job\nHow many guys in college football kill to be an NFL official right that's what these guys work for\nIf you go cruise can't cut it and he apparently couldn't cut it bring up somebody that can cut it if they can't cut it and others can't cut it bring up bothers the bottom line is the NFL deserves that officials but the NFL does do that they do fire officials they usually wait until the season ends though right\nBut this guy to come in protecting say that it's a troubling history of knee jerk reactions by the NFL give me a break\nI experience I mean he said it's drawing or fired in season what officials get fired and Jesus layers can get caught in season right right so shouldn't be any diver officials said that I I find it hilarious I really do I find it yeah yeah is this guy scapegoat though I mean I I Know that's kind of what\nPeople are alluding to that are defending you know\nHim you go\nYou know what how many how many games can we think of off the top or head\nWhere you scratch your head with the officiating a guy using a note card remember that to see about or was it a first down on the gene was territory wherever there are ... and now he's the he's the works for like CBS or something yeah how would the guy couldn't get the a coin toss right\nRemember that one Super Bowl coin toss the ones that we get to Rockaway was a Noah's Ark away his son official now right talking about that because I Know who wants to show\nFor the drug that is one yeah the drone best one yeah\nMaybe it sure wasn't genes territory there either no it wasn't it wasn't for an index card was hilarious you had that\nBruce Lee officials who the other ... rounds I\nRemember that one yeah\nSo these guys get fired somebody who messed up the coin flip the I ... I don't think it's a knee jerk reaction this time by the NFL considering they've allowed those things to occur I lock it by the way it was there you go for all right uh robbed ...\nFormer all star closer world champions the reds does radio in Hartford, Connecticut we talk World Series with him back and forth and NBC Sports radio [noise]\n[noise] the coverage of high school for two\nTo be able to use that face are you were NBC\nSports radio with the\nEight minutes fifty seconds remaining\nThird quarter Thursday Night Football in Houston Texans are now taking a twenty wants to do with the Miami Dolphins showed Watson eighty eight yards passing\nBut to touchdown passes for both of them to Jordan Thomas Lamar Miller while carries a hundred and twenty four yard and one touchdown meanwhile broadcast why there are a hundred and thirty are passing an interception for Miami Houston Rockets supporter of wars have offered the Minnesota Tim was a package includes\nFor first round draft pick in a deal for Jimmy bottlers James Hard will miss at least two games he's been diagnosed with a great one plus sprained his left and Frank could miss more as you went on to win an MRI Thursday\nDetermined the severity of that injury flight schedule in the NBA for fourteen to go on the fourth quarter Oklahoma City at all is now taking a Ninety four eighty five lead over Boston final Cleveland we were still own five and twenty four known after one tent and one of the three when at home\n\nIf you suffer from E.

all year you know it's it's with all baseball baseball doesn't believe their eyes anymore\nAnd you know ... was not throwing a bad name he was actually winning two to one uh he gave that he gives up to out hit the basket that another throughout the ... watt spin and Sandy his first walk at the game and with his speech stuff and\nIt's cold as it was you know ... standing up there I let you face

are you giving up of grassland appears\nYou bring them in and the the one thing you want to have a little bit of wiggle room with any receiver is maybe an extra base open and there's no bases open there's nowhere to ... put on the worse thing you can never do as a relievers walk a guy and\nThen he walks in peers then he gives up to the to RPI single the GED Martina is um you know so to me\nLook at your guys even in game one by is throwing Ninety nine miles an hour and nobody can catch up to it and you're going to go buy the book and bring in would and I and I understand David I'm not trying to a second guess him but he goes\nWell I still felt good about Alex would and I would do what I'm looking at by as watching the sky roll it right by the hitters sometimes you've got to throw your your analytics in your percentages out the window and go this guy's got some nasty stuff tonight I'm not taking them out of the game\nYou know Rob that bothers me when I look at the box score after I've watched the game and I see that a a relievers thrown wanting you thrown twelve pitches seven strikes he's dominant and then they take him out I was twelve pitches I'm like you let him go another any why not but you're right it's just stupid book it's the analytics baseball and I think to a point where they've gone too far\nWell and it could cost you a championship two years in a row I mean ... last year they took rich shell out because they had a book on him and he's all in through the line up uh the Astros and you're like all the third time through the line up he has a hundred or\nDoesn't matter if the world series you know I I heard and I'm not going to go into who said it but they said uh the red Sox a pitcher's arms\nAre tired and I was like that's the craziest thing I've ever October it didn't matter what I felt like in September or August then when it when it was you know pirates and and the AIDS for me Twenty years ago my arm was never better\nI I was actually in a zone so you you you know unless you've pitched in the post season I don't want to hear people talk about how tired somebody is and why the Dodgers are ... a joke Kelly is throwing\nYou know a hundred miles an hour evolved these soda hundred miles an hour a Kimberly strolling lights out prices last throughout a fantastic guys step it up a notch because this is what they've been waiting their entire lives to do with the super bowl to to guys like us in the major leagues so nobody's tired right now\nSo you've got a book with your eyes and not let that book uh especially when it comes to the postseason\nRob people joining us going deep the enforcement NBC Sports radio and the guy that just throwing bullets right now David Price you know these guys on the worst seasons starters in history but the last two storage\nHe's been different now Rob you pitched in a high level obviously you've got a hundred and twenty miles an hour what are you seeing from David Price the last couple of stars compared to really his entire postseason career before that\nHe's he's just letting it fly now and he's in he's always had amazing mechanics he's got a little bit more hip turn but you know he's he's attacking the hitters\nAnd he's done that in the last couple of outings where I mean this guy was six and one after the all star break with a two to rewrite and before that and the first half he had an almost two two runs for\nFor for a ... you know nine so for for my money maybe something was wrong with his ... a little bit from last year and it was kind of hung over in the first three months\nAfter the all star break David Price has been as good as they get the major leagues and now you know what you got to forget what people are going to judge you are in your past and all that other nonsense this job is just do the job for Eighteen or Twenty one else\nJust you know it's like Bill Belichick just do your job\nBasically three words and he has done that the last couple of outings he's attacked the strike zone you you can't you gotta do it David Price goes well\nYou can't have a book out all these guys I mean my God I'm looking at catchers Dan they've they've got things on their wrists like a dam quarterback in the NFL no joke\nAnd and you should already know that information and the fact that you know you got guys playing like deep\nOutfield positions for the Dodgers at at Fenway guys are misjudged balls because they didn't take batting practice started late by the way you know go back to basics keep it simple stupid stuff you know play some baseball and stop playing by the number so much\nTake us to the mentality of being a pitcher when you're captured is having a rough time and he has money granted out he's having a rough time I mean do you lose faith in the guy like that when you get to the mound\nNo but I Do and what I mean I had exceptional catchers and angel all are Jeffrey a boat de as some of the catches that I had you know throughout my career\nI'm ... their job one was to get the most out of the pitcher and you know ... and and I get to see every every game that Gary Sanchez catches I get the ah some of these other guys and the American league east and the national league Easter Connecticut\nA lot of these guys are not going you know to get the most out of their pitcher first\nWhere they're not they're not in position to flock balls they're reaching across their body to try to catch balls they're not moving their feet well uh they're not moving across you know I used to watch the catches a spring training dad do these drills like all day uh and and after practice and they would shoot\nFalls out of a out of a machine basically the iron Mike machine and make these guys walk hundred mile an hour pitches in the dirt\nAnd that's what catches up to do to prepare themselves so if you can't move your feet and you can walk all the major leagues first of all you shouldn't be behind the plate\nYou know maybe they should movie to a different position but uh you know when the guys have a a bad day like it for all this Chapman is out of them out or chemicals about or a chance in his out in the balance and crunch time it's over\nYou know past ball or to be the difference between winning a world championship but not so for me it's more it's more of a focus saying and it's more of a a lock in yourself in an every pitch because that was necessary to be a champion\nRabbi predicted the red Sox within five after watching the first two I may be wrong you may not even go to find as you look at a talent differential between the two teams and I got into yesterday's my producer Sean and I'm like All right the Dodgers have a deeper bench but who cares at this point who cares we look at every other aspect of baseball\nDoes this go back to Boston for a game six or does this even make it to a Sunday game five\n... the Dodgers game three areas and again if they lose gates creates all over it only goes ... games but from the Dodgers they they need to you know stop ... to ... inches and play the bad guys on the bench\nYou know balance your needs to be in that month TV's these guys I don't care a less about writing about butterfly\nLike like the new slogan is let the kids play and let these guys go out there and win or lose a guy that ah you know against the percentage all the time is not only the correct who\nDo you gotta use your your your Roberts you want to get back and the thing if you don't win games where you get over that time about the two of the other thing I think it's because in game three\nOr the other teams already being emotionally as well as physically Red Sox have to be these in their in their line up they've got to the bullpen but you can do when the series you just need to play a little bit of small ball make contact with two out into strikes all you need to beat the red Sox game in eighth grade\nAnd only day Roberts overuse that book for the bullpen has not worked in the first two games to say at least pleased Ryan ... don't be the first guy out of that pending that for the fifth inning because\nWe know the history of that every runner does score robbed

when he does that I buy like listening to Mike wage well\nMike Leach has Washington state home again you know we talk about the pact twelve Sean we talk about well Washington right by then it was Stanford right and then it was Oregon right Washington state's like that last team that potentially would be the one that maybe would have a shot to go to the\nThey need a lot of help like a Notre Dame law and probably a big twelve team would have to have to losses bought that amazing that here's Washington state heading into week nine and they're the last hope of the conference to go to the conference place to go to the college football playoffs insane\nWhose son fat yeah\nIt's it's sad really because we need a pack twelve team in the mix it just makes college football a little more interesting [noise] it does and here's what worries me every single year [noise]\nWashington state has a loss to where the only on the site then that are a whole day you write them for their at Stanford Stadium road no way you know the USC last may already be the one killing the chances that the play off any way when you're on the go into the form and then I went in there\nAnd they're not you right now but you know what like even if they win out losing a U.S these now bad last write us these terrible and to have that on the resume is not good but I just can't see them walking into Stanford Stadium and winning this game I I just can't see it because this is the type of game\nThat is really haunted Mike Leach throughout his career right this is the type of game where it's like oh my goodness\nThey had it by the way it's going to be close and they're going to have a lead like they did against us see in the defense is going to come up and next thing you know bracelet we've been banged up and has been very good this year\nOr ... white side of the wide receiver is going to come up with a big play and there's going to be a defensive collapse the next thing you know Washington state loses by less than a touchdown like you can read the last chapter of this book is it's it's as if it's been written already I hate to say because I Love my college and I think he's good for football but I don't see them winning the game\nSo that's you're upset of the week stand sees it really and others had ... favorite anyway right but there are higher ranked\n[noise]\nYeah but honestly it's a higher ranked team but yeah you're right there for my story isn't it weird like Sandra Stafford ten slots lower on the top twenty five yeah but yet there's a three point home favorite that is amazing yeah makes those up and look at Missouri their favorite by seven over Kentucky\nThat's crazy you know what that says he's twelve of the nation and Missouri's on ranked how is it possible places are such a great place to play like so biggest aspect Kentucky obviously I Would have to keep doing though like what is Kentucky has to do to gain some respect\nLike they're the only team in Florida that's big win right is this the only last was Texas saying that moves that rank sixteenth and the country but I Know in Florida being able to shoo I get it I got to say and I I you know anybody was at Florida they lost\nYou know they they won over Mississippi State to dominate the Mississippi State has been very good since I hit the SEC schedule but there was like no respect for the you're right there's no respect to be seven point dog on the road at Missouri that's ridiculous\nAnd you don't want our buddies got Saddam or go say who I'm going to defeat next week again in the

[noise]\n\nTwenty one fast yard is our number to dance wars when NBC Sports radio amazing to me that after Ohio State loses to Purdue and hits and ugly last they looked terrible in the last don't get me wrong I'm not going to stick up for urban Meyer after that one\nBut it it's unbelievable\nThe reaction people in Columbus ohio have Ohio is a football rich state right they love the sport of football\nHall of fame for crying out is in the state of Ohio and can't\nWe have two football teams the browns and the ... and the bangles in both of them aren't great now the bangles or playing better than the browns and brands have been terrible in Ohio state's the biggest football team in that state everybody loves her buck eyes and it's the biggest stadium and you know in the state and they feel it for games against anybody at the horseshoe they call it\nBut there's a lot to lose the game here and there there's going to be bad losses here and they're right next to have been lost the game and I know it was early in his tenure at Alabama before he brought it all the towel be lost a homecoming game for Louisiana Tech\nThat requires been there long enough that these are all his players and you know he should be winning games against Purdue and if he's going to lose the game or two she'll be against like Michigan or a Penn State or Wisconsin it shouldn't be to a team like you know I Will last year in Perdue this year\nIs it something to be concerned about where you say to yourself man what's wrong with our ... no I don't think so\nIt happens you can't win a national championship every year\nThen when it happens we're a guy's winning when every couple of years away the Nick Saban seems to do then that's why he's considered the greatest coach potentially in the history of college football urban Meyer is not the greatest coach in the history of college football you not next David ... his own class urban Meyer is number two\nBut it's hilarious like on social media when I read all of my friends right another Ohio State buckeyes fans right and they're jumping off the urban Meyer ship because of one last Hubbard do and this and that and what's he doing in his play calling in his defense and yada yada yada and like All right yeah it's a crappy last that I can understand why you're mad\nBut it's one loss ... doesn't lose a lot of games at Ohio State his record at Ohio State is unbelievable he's won a national championship there I mean he's he's accomplished a lot\nAnd I just you know it's a Seventy seven and nine state since he got there in two thousand and twelve think about that Seventy seven and nine he's fifty and four in conference\nYou know it's amazing showing if you think about the fact that he's fifty and foreign conference this isn't it's like it's the sun belt conference dominated by one team right it's not like this was a mid major conference where you have one really good team and everybody else is a bunch of cupcakes\nHe has dominated the Big Ten ... he has literally never finished in second place in the conference since he's gotten there in two thousand twelve\nSadly you write sadly you are right\nI hate to admit it but you're anybody\nGoes fifty four in the Big Ten since two thousand twelve is doing something right it's a bad last Purdue it was a bad last Iowa I get it the baby it costs that an opportunity to go to a national championship game but lost is like that happen and produce better than we thought they were\nBut there was no way or an Ohio State football team should get blown out by Purdue I'm Sorry yes they shouldn't be deported but but there are some people have a right to be upset and in the fashion they were pulling out it was just they couldn't stop Purdue\nAt all it was it was embarrassing and I was listening to the curb street talk about it\nAbout Ohio State and he's concerned do you think this is an Iowa from a year ago this is more concerning because ... there has been played well the wind backing coral he really called out where the the vulnerable to the our appeal that that Purdue was running old game\nAnd he he's he's concerned about the lack of leadership on the team is the you know GTE beret there's no Billy price you know they lost a lot of good leaders from last year a squad Nick Boles if you want to include him too as well\nAnd the office of wind\nThere not opening up holes right now for the running game so that does concern there that wasn't there last year\nYou know what it is Sean ... it's it's Alabama panic is that's why the panic right but here's the problem it's like Alabama when you're a program like Ohio State or Alabama\nYou lose so much talent every year right to the NFL use a ton\nAnd sometimes the guys that you have it their all four and five star players sometimes these guys don't pan out\nAnd that's secondary by the way it Ohio State has been absolutely decimate a look at all the top draft picks they've had coming out of there you're gonna have a lean year or two because the fact you have\nThree guys a year getting trapped in the first run out of your secondary it's understandable and by the way their foreign one three in one in coverage and they're still potentially the best team in the conference so\nIt's yeah it's a bad last I get it and defensively that's what surprised me and maybe the fact that well Twain Haskins has pro potential maybe it's not a leader out there the way that a quarterback should be a leader right a vocal type of leader maybe that is lack in it and that's a problem I get it but the reality is you can't be perfect every year\nYou're gonna have it down here to dictate that has won a national championship every single year because when you lose all that telling you mentioned Billie price high draft pick right it happens the understandable\nI think most people feel Mike Webber and J.K ... our NFL running back I I don't think that I don't I don't know what they are I don't think they're that good I don't\nSo that's another thing to like well why don't why not run the ball\n... more effectively with those two two dogs ... but I think that's the problem I don't think they have the horses that have\nWork at ... foot but we get you know what the people get to a point where they're ease the comfort level of knowing or are you got Murray's Colorado KFC kill Eliot okay if Carlos Hyde right

can run the football\nAnywhere similar and I'm not even compared George or to Vanderbilt but if they can run this football effectively\nGators have a real chance to win\nOn the other side of it we

I I I didn't buy into that but whatever you know by I mean on ... in the bowl game one on one\nDid clowning he he didn't he missed an assignment he didn't bother to block clown in front of him\nHe blocked down and that's when clowning made that a hit on Vincent Smith the running back from Michigan did rhyme righty deep you know he made highlight film with that popped off and everything but we want dominated county that game and so I I you know I I pump the brakes a little bit on on his college career\nBecause people are saying that he took plays off\nAnd not only that but if you look at the breakdown of his games I mean he would have stacks against the really bad competition and\nAs you mentioned against a you know a mission to tailor won against a really good team to wasn't as if he dominated those games but he's still came as a very hyped kid obviously as a number one overall ... overall picking the draft but the problem with with Judy beyond ... he's a very good he's a very good end but\nHe's not a big fat guy and I think in today's NFL people want sex\nFully has four and a half or this year but I you know for around ... ends up at nine to ...\nBut there was the expectation that when he came in he would be a guy that would get to the quarterback on a consistent basis and how many years already now into a ... down ... career and look gets ten sacks okay it might happen here and there I don't believe that when his career though he's had a very well to\nThat saying he's quarterback seasonal right he's an all around type of guy but you know after what this is your number five for him\nAnd he's got twenty four and a half sex or his career that's a lot less I think people are kind of anticipating to be fair he missed a bunch of games his rookie year dude injury but last year he had nine and a half to kind of came into his own a bit and this year he's playing a at a higher level he's going to get paid a ton of money 'cause he potentially is going to be a free agent so JV and cloudy\nHe's going to get paid for the taxes are going to pay him\nNo I don't know not with junior ... making the money he's making well and you also have what's his name uh you know ... coming up the up well ... what what's happened to Whitney mercilessly as he recorded a second year he has been he has disappeared as one sack this year\nI don't I don't know what happened in there now no idea\nTwelve Saxon two thousand Fifteen seven and a half in two thousand sixteen last year you can chalk it up we only play five games had one sack this year it's got one sack\nAnd what has gone on here crazy\nUnbelievable doesn't make a lot of sense former first round pick I mean the first round picks they spent on that defensive front I mean Whitney merciless first round pick J. J. watt first round pick today beyond cloudy first round pick it's unbelievable how many have invested\nOh amazingly and then but I Want them to have a question for you are you more surprised by the player Watson tonight or tomorrow Miller considering the Texans offers of on his one of the worst than football yeah\nI I'm more surprised by Lamar Miller because of the fact that survives terrible as bad as it is for just showing Watson and he's under a lot of pressure and he's been sacked twenty six times this year which is unbelievable the fact is he has\nOne of the top three to four she was in football I mean the Andre Hopkins isn't that conversation with Antonio Brown owed outback him junior Julio Jones\nYou know we'll followers are very competent receiver\nYou know they have the young kids Kikuyu joined the show before the draft skin Jordan Thomas play a couple a touchdown catch is there's a lot of weapons on the that often in terms of research receivers\nSo I'm not that surprising Shaun what's much more surprised Lamar Miller would go out for a hundred and thirty three are considering as you said that often the wind is really terrible and the worst in the NFL and they continuously don't open up polls and for a night they did but how about the dolphins I mean let's look at it from that perspective you're showing the Miami Dolphins\nAre you talking about an

practice that nobody knows about and nobody has ever seen\nOr maybe you've turned it over a couple of times I made some medical errors that when you get into big ball game you don't know I was going to respond\nBut I think the best way to learn what this guy's about is let him go out there and some live action in a big time game and see how\nHe performs and he needs to be out there and having the whole gamut of play book being able to throw it being able to run it uses athleticism to an advantage but I think Justin feels needs to be a bigger part of it not I think it\nCan be a big part of and this ball game I think you've got two weeks to iron out what things he does well you're not getting the whole play but what maybe you get home a package of plays where it's Ron it's passed but he knows exactly where to go to football in those particular place\nSo he needs to be a big part of this game angling for\nYou know what he only out the rest of what I think is happening here we always forget that Kirby Smart is a new ad coach it's not like he's been there for ten years psyche is more rational championships in\nHow many guys can pull a a Nick Saban in in the middle of a national championship game polish quarterback and put it in a guy like two or you know a freshman so couldn't be that there is a little bit of being gun shy in the sense of\nWell currently smart knows what he's got Jake Romney's written with Jake from here\nAnd maybe it's kind of difficult to uh go to the unknown a bit more than he has I mean he again is a young coach plays a role in that\nYeah he's a young coach but knowing Kirby Smart knowing his personality type of guy he is\nHe's not gunshot he will do whatever he needs to do to win the ball and if he thinks that he needs to make a change or he thinks he needs to stick with this guy he will do that and I don't think yeah he's going to have some of those moments where he's a young coach and he's still trying to figure is way through it but personally personality wise\nThis guy's competitive anybody I Know and he will do whatever it takes to win a ball game regardless\nOf if a guy's been around over a guy in the new freshmen or I mean maybe he will find a way to win the ball game that is a tough decision to make those especially from the quarterback position but just knowing Kirby I don't think he would have a tough time pulling the trigger on that situation as many people may think would be a different a third year\nYou know George is going to put up points DJ I mean the sixteen they put up against tell us he was not the norm obviously they have this is a total collapse of every asset facet of football but what are your concerns in terms of the run defense after given up two hundred and Seventy five yards against LSU they got gashed fact is Florida's got cable running backs\nYeah they do a doors crowd is probably one of the better back to the ocean and the league and uh they're using the police and the running game as well a little bit more to keep teams on his butt Georgia was completely dominated by other shoe and what you're talking about dominated talking about\nTheir lime and changed in the ... and getting up on the line backers when every year we had a chance\nTo get to that second level and force still run to get to the third level there and you're having issues stop in the run and that's kind of what happened in the LSU game and I'm sure a mother is going to look back at that film and\nTrying to figure out where the way they can do that a voter had the moms for office the line and we know over the years you order has recruited those athletic kind of\nA maybe in the middle type of past roses whether or not really big but they're fast athletic and that's ... that his his mould but\nThis has to be a gay war that cause some line takes over the ball game and that's not the\nKind of run through that good day last week it's going to be a difficult game could do that but you gotta have a mind set of I got to use credit Tracey and I got to get into back you know I have to do certain things to help our team wins\nAnd alive and happy to take up two guys up front and they don't do that in

last thing DJ but think about how long has been since we've had a real important potential playoffs implication FCC's match up it's been a while right\nYeah I mean that big I mean that it's a it's a big talk because you talk about how close to the east coast of what everybody knows how good the west has been over the past five to ten years whatever it is\nBut now the ISI feel like it's starting to come around I think everybody looked at that national championship game and said well\nGeorge or maybe a little bit closer to Alabama negative thing and then you look at Alabama nation now they're still Alabama are still more dominant but this is a game that can put in as he sees the on the map and say okay here's some legitimate threat to the west and if you have more teams\nLike Florida starting to come along and play big Georgia we know what they're about ... and maybe somebody the other thing that needs may tendency will continue to get better but right now Georgia or Florida\nA M Kentucky has played a really good football too so the east is starting to close the gap on the west and this'll be a good game going forward to show that he says just as competitive and we have a team over here they can compete with multiple teams in the west\nYeah maybe a Jimmy ... gets Tennessee on track as well before you know a decent a powerhouse and former yeah no doubt form all SEC

and it's really interesting because\nInvestigation into pay for play and ah whether in permissible bam benefits were given to certain students and the student athletes it's been going on for a long time\nIt doesn't just involve Rick Pitino in ... it doesn't just involved at the this this stuff has been going on for years I remember when the story first broke whether it was about Rick Pitino or whether there was another investigation we had played that\nFamous clip from the movie blue chips\nWhere Nick Nolte these giving his speech and he's talking about the past flyers money can buy\nPain that movie came out in Nineteen Ninety four\nAnd every scene from that movie\nInvolving paying players and the pressures to wean and whatnot it\nAll holds true today\nFrom Nineteen Ninety four\nTwenty somewhat ears leader twenty four years later\nAnd it still holds up\nThe latest in this saga was that the wiretaps remember the FBI gotten to the federal the in the wiretaps right the two year investigation by the FBI well\nESPN's outside the lines got the wiretaps and the tax message just\nAs well as the\nFraudulent invoices\nAnd the hidden camera stuff\nNow the public is getting getting is getting a chance to see the evidence that the FBI found\nThere was one wiretapped phone call in which former Adidas consultants moral code and Adidas executive James ghetto discussed\nThe University of Arizona's alleged offer\nTo ... little\nAnd the offer who unless you're a little was playing for North Carolina or he will be playing North Carolina\nThe offer was a hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nAnd in this phone conversation\nThe two gentlemen were discussing whether or not\nBut did it would match that hundred and fifty thousand dollar offer\nSo that and this year a little would go play basketball at Miami which isn't it the the sponsored school\nThere's a lot of dirty ness\nYou get that you feel when reading these transcripts\nTalks about\nIn the University of ... the little bowl and their involvement in just\nA deed is was\nContributing money paying families paying players families that their kids would go to certain schools\nHelping out loans\nThis is not an isolated incident this stuff goes on all the time and I think we all can agree the college basketball is a broken system\nIt's completely broke\nThe players and it's not just college basketball but it's all college sports but college basketball's a dirty business because that's where the shoe companies get involved [noise] what's the story that we talked about the other day where new

and done\nEliminate the rules saying that you have to be one year removed from high school\nIf you're a Seventeen year old kid you want to go to the NBA you are more than welcome to\nThe second thing the second step\nIs to expand the NBA draft\nTwo rounds\nAnd I know what you're saying well a lot of the guys get drafted they don't even wind the plane and that's true but if you eliminate the one and done you're going to start seeing an influx of high school kids\nApply for the NBA draft and a lot of them are not good enough to play in the NBA\nExpand the NBA draft\nMaking three rounds for around five rounds\nAllow teams\nTo draft one of these kids coming out of high school\nAnd this goes into step three if they're not ready to play in the NBA\nYou offer them a G ... contract\nAnd it's

time towards\nWe have a situation where we are ill prepared\nAnd we need a quarterback this week well let me\nLet me to add something here mhm\nBecause last season ... I was more involved myself yeah you were\nThis season you didn't involve me with anything\nWell because I haven't even involve myself [laughter] glad we won the damn thing when we won the whole thing\nBut you know something like our team is so much better than our record\nIt's just embarrassing\nTerrible record but our team is like not you know like our roster is not bad\nBut our record is just very bad\nUm I wouldn't blame it all on you yeah it's fun\nI mean I just I honestly I have not been paying attention to the theme you know what you know where we lost last week\nWe lost last week because\nUm I\n... I made a mistake on a player that was\nBy and I missed that like Austin heckler was distorting running back for the chargers because Melvin Gordon did not play\nAnd had I started Austin at color as one of our running backs we would have won\nEven though he got only nine point three points we only lost by like six points so\nThat's the difference we we would have won because he out scored the other running back then I Would have started him over by eight points\nNot sure it would it matter though we're so far behind\nWhat does it matter we got to do is make the playoffs\nWe don't care about what a record as we just don't want to finish in ... I don't even know where to fourteen team leagues how many teams make the playoffs or\nThe six make the playoffs do make the playoffs I have no idea what the playoffs are one two three four or five only six teams make the playoffs will that's brutal\nThere's no chance we're going to get up to six place\nThat weren't twelfth right now we have a lot of ground to make up\nBut I also don't like our league because we don't have a lot of roster spots so I have to drop a really good player this week to pick up a quarterback\nWhich is it thinks\nBut sometimes you got to do which go\nFree free a free person I offered a keep the lenient trade to give us a quarterback and declined which is like I don't I Can't I couldn't believe should declined that because I ... I was over paying for a quarterback eye opener to starting players for backup quarterback but\nWhatever it is what it is in my other week you want to talk about bad luck I have the most points in the league\nBy seven points\nMy team has out scored every team in the league is the next closest seemed to me I have Seventy more fantasy points that's like a full week points birthright and my record is three and four\nIn addition to having the most points scored in the league\nI have the most points against in the lead so\nJust just think about that how unlucky that is a good thing is that in that league you we award a prize whoever has the most points at the end of the season so\nI'm Still a in good shape there\nDoes them or the brakes as they say speaking of being in good shape\nThe shore and watch it in the Houston Texans\nThe shuttle watching through for as Obama say not one not to not three not for five touchdowns on Thursday Night Football five\nThe dolphins Nick I told you they were bad and you didn't want to believe me\nYou didn't want to believe me we picked the Texans last night\nYou told me the dolphins were going to win I told you that this was a game that the Texans for going to get right because the Texans despite winning four straight games\nOK despite winning those sports games after starting the season in three\nDead and really look good\nUp until tonight but I'm saying coming into this game they had the win against the Colts because Frank Reich decided to go for it in overtime remember and they didn't get it they turned the ball over and they got the short field and squirt\nThey beat the cowboys because jak Prescott turned the ball over a bunch pains\nThe Texans winning over time\nAgain second week in a row then they beat the bills\nBecause Nathan Pete Herman\nThrough the game away literally\nAnd then the last week against the jaguars well that's just Blake ... having a terrible game\nThe jaguars being you know\nJust just hapless\nSo the Texans won four straight games but they haven't looked good\nBut against the Miami Dolphins on Thursday Night Football\nIt was a recipe for success\nBrock ...\nAt the quarterback position because Ryan ... still

Kimble how was ... going to address what was a major weakness for this team down the stretch of the season and he has addressed it which starting pitching\nSees addressed it with reports so early in the postseason and now Nathan you've all be late in the post season and you can argue and you can make the argument then he has been the best most dominant dealings with a Red Sox his postseason\nRight it's it's it's the same similar you know it's a very similar strategies are what credit counselors doing in the in the U.S and that as\nLook they don't have an answer when Steven Reich on her they did not know what to do and they figured they had these guys on throw days let's have them ... or two on throw days and still keep them in the rotation\nIt works in a sprint it would not be sustainable over a marathon\nAnd so this is another situation where it is coming up roses and that's why a lot of people are attributed to lift to luck because this is not Alex Cora trying to reinvent the wheel is he's not trying to reinvent the use of the starting pitcher it was out of necessity\nAnd when you have to do something you have to do something to survive\nIt'd be panic time per day Robert snow like when do you think she tries to adjust everything they asked him after dean too if he was going to change his line up and and change things around and all he said was you know we'll do the right he left the thing but when do you think it gets to the point where he just has to throw something against the wall and see if it sticks\n[noise] ah I don't think you're you know I I just really hard to say but I don't think the Dodgers are panicking because I think they're playing with has money\nUm this is a team that had to struggle to win their division\nThe team that had to fight to you know prove that they were worth it is a team that you know a quieter rent a player or to be their big bopper\nUm I I I just think there's going to try to play their game and you know they say it's too right handed or you know council or you know expose that in the in the ass and they've Roberts didn't flinch\nLike this is the way we do with how we how we play and I just think whenever I've heard a criticism of the way they Robert attack this World Series has not watch the Dodgers game all through them all\nIn the south and our baseball insiders got that number here's overtime and NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com you have to managers in this series set in our corn de robbers both of them former players in recent former players\nI saw a great thing on Reddit earlier here on a Thursday where someone posted and look I like to give credit where credit's due so I'll shout out the Reddit users that put this on there\nAn edge in what you can make possible by leaving behind the gift of life learn\nMore and sign up as an organized to shoot down there you go to organ donor DACA message from the U.S department of health and Human Services and how we started that in service at the minister ... ...\n...

possible possible turmoil in Houston where now it's desperation vying for the rockets as we find out they made a serious offer for the services of one and only ...\nHow about the terms of a deal that we're starting to learn the parameters of\nInsane if you're really break this down but we are hearing that the Houston Rockets making a new bid have presented a Minnesota timber wolves with an offer of a trade that includes for future first round draft picks how 'bout that\nThat's the most draft picks first round picks you can offer in a deal\nThere are a league rules involved that do not allow first round has to be given away and successive years didn't remember the New York Knicks used to give away all their first round pegs it didn't matter how many years in a row they would never ever stop takes the lead put in these new rules and no Pitt can be traded farther out than seven years so for is the maximum number\nThat you can given the lottery protections on those picks would be limited as well\nIf you're the Minnesota timber wolves then you have not been happy with any of the offers that have come in and you know Miami is really the only team that's made serious offers\nTold you have to seriously look at this deal and say\nWe have to consider it\nJulie ... out the door at the end of the year right he's out the door and he's going to leave and probably you're not going to get any compensation maybe it'll have to be assigning traits with a team could fit him under their salary cap and if that's the case what are you getting back to that point\nMinnesota is looking to win games and speaking of the playoffs and I get that but Minnesota is not going to win an MBA championship it's not happening there aren't good enough\nIt's a pipe dream to think Minnesota's in the same class\nAs the Golden State warriors as the Houston Rockets throwing the Boston Celtics to Toronto Raptors teams like that they're not\nTheir team in turmoil well Jim you know Julie bowler puts a big numbers in Jimmy Butler is looking like his old self the fact is there's a lot of problems with that team is dysfunctional\nSo I think you have to be pretty much getting to the conclusion that Jimmy Butler is going to be out the door at some point the question is what's the best deal you can get how many pennies on the dollar can you bring back if you're a Minnesota\nTen to Fifteen players and the NBA sort of the best to wait players the entire league\nAnd that brings up this for the Houston Rockets this is all or nothing right\nI mean with the Houston Rockets are saying right now is\nWe are going all in like this is that we're putting all our eggs in the journey butler ... you know basket\nJerry Butler's the guy that's going to take us the promised land this is a deal that we look at and it's going to get us over the hump this has got to get us to beating the Golden State warriors that's what they're looking at\nYou look at a team if they add Jimmy Butler that already as James Harden and Chris\nPaul is pretty good and that is really good butler Horton and poll on the same team\nI guess Carmel was not working out the way they thought right I thought Carmelo was going to be the guy that made the difference there I what am I missing here Sean I mean wasn't Carmel the missing link that they brought in and he was going to make the big difference in our ready what were less than five game six games into the season they're already looking to make another move\nOut of ... [laughter]\nBecause no one's quite the fence I don't think it's only because of Carmelo though no I'm just kidding but what does it mean for Carmelo I mean his his role will get even less be bringing a Jimmy Butler\nIt's incredible do you think about this team and you think about the Houston Rockets why not go for it all here right Chris Paul not getting any younger\nAnd James Orange twenty nine years old at this point he's starting to get some mild here and I hate I hate to break into your no one's getting any younger we're all getting older or speak for yourself I actually like Benjamin mommy the curious case of dance wants names are getting an economy that he's not he's not you're right the beer is getting a little rare\nI'm telling you it's it's a bold move if Darryl Maury can pull it off\nBut I'm all for it and here's why it makes it more competitive\nThe Houston Rockets versus the Golden State warriors and that to me is the only match up that's going to be fun to watch in the NBA playoffs whatever Boston in Toronto might be a fun mastered in the eastern conference finals maybe Philadelphia against one of those two teams in a you know a second or third round match will be fun as well\nBut if you add Jimmy Butler into the mix and you put up a team of Judy butler James Harden Chris Paul\nAgainst Iran's\nSteph Curry clay Thompson I mean I don't put dream on and I dream minds anger on but the markets cousins will be back at that point\nThat's fun that's the fun aspect of basketball that we all want so in terms of being a selfish viewer I Hope that the Houston Rockets can land Jimmy Butler because I think it makes for a better basketball in a top heavy league anyway Shawn so selfish this tells me apps are frequently go out and get Jimmy Boehner make a deal\nAnd un ... yeah I I'm into yeah I think it's a great trade for the Houston Rockets because without Jimmy ball or as you just said where are they going I don't they can't be Golden State they might not be able to say with Jimmy Butler but it's worth of chance don't you think absolutely you make that move that's a no brainer move you make\nBut they don't go to it's not like should we Butler's a rental they're gonna sign up to an extension\nSo you have a little bit of a window it's not just about this year could be about next two years as well\nHow much though are they willing to go over the luxury tax whatever you call in and they you know the penalty I guess\nI mean you at Jimmy Butler you sign them now yes Larry Bird writes wherever the heck it is I mean you know so where do you get trade for a guy and you get signed them and it doesn't affect your cab or you can find them over your cab NBA makes no sense to me when it comes to the cap needed ... to figure this out but\nIf they sign Jimmy boatload of the five year hundred Ninety million dollar deal I mean that's\nThirty eight million dollars per year\nAren't they can be paying a boatload of taxes when he thing horns making forty two million forty two and a half million Chris Paul signed the max deal to write us three guys that we make like a hundred and ten a hundred and twenty million bucks\nThat's crazy three guys so what do you do I mean I don't understand the economics\nOf basketball where you have yourself a soft cabins obviously a soft cap if you have three players up about a hundred and twenty million bucks and then he still thought Iraq was nine other guys\nDoesn't make it out to me but whatever I don't care it's not my money it's not my tax dollars that go to the MBA but in reality as a viewer that's what I Want to see and for the Minnesota Tim most I just don't think they get a better deal\nYou think this Richardson kid from Miami in a couple of scrapped is a better deal look the Houston Rockets the first two of these draft picks they're not going to be great picks 'cause they're going to win a lot of games it's about the last two draft picks when James Horton thirty four\nGod God\nAm sick and tired of people who aren't good at their job continuing to work because the union you know I'm sick and tired of that if you didn't get your job you don't belong there I don't care if you know powerful union that keeps you employed you\nShouldn't work so the other players association which is just like uh\nThey're the referees association Scott Greene these that your director came out and said quote the NFL's are troubling history of knee jerk reactions with an eye on public relations and clearly does not learned from past mistakes\nThe NFL All right we'll protect the collectively bargaining rights of all officials in will challenge this reckless decision to the grievance process and you wonder why most Americans are sick and tired of unions you're\nTelling me all of your members are good you're telling me there's no problems in officiating and the NFL or you blind Scott Greene like half of the people that pay dues to your union\nHere officials are horrendous NFL officiating terrible confidence and NFL officials must be at an all time low and this guy's got his head up his rear end thinking they're doing a great job and don't deserve to be fired\nThis is a problem with the audience and there's there's no different than unions in New York City which is a powerful union town where you can fire workers and teachers who are accused of molesting kids are stuck in these rooms collecting their salary for years 'cause you can't fire him\nI'm Glad if this guy is as bad as the show to be he deserves to be fired you know cruise doesn't deserve to have a job\nBetter is covered by how many high school and college officials out there and pop Warner officials who are nothing I have a fulltime job making six figures officiating NFL games stink at your job you don't belong in by the way\nHe's not a concept that plays a role in every single job if you're not good as a plumber\nYou don't work if you're not good as it all at first and you don't work if you're an investment banker and you continue to lose money for your clients you don't work if you're an official and you make terrible calls you don't work\nOh that's right but you have this powerful union that claims older guys are great at their job what Scott Greene the executive director of the NFL referees association needs to realize is people don't trust his constituents\nWe don't believe they do a good job I don't care what's collectively bargained you don't deserve to have every one of your employees\nEmployed if they can't do the job correct now I Do think officiating is a tough job I Do think the rules every single year they continue to tack on more and more and I think it's come to a point where these guys have too many rules to try to figure out as they watch a game in real time from their positions I think it's gotten out of hand I Do\nBut don't sit there and tell me that their officiating is good not now do they do the best they can I'm sure they do and it's never going to be perfect\nBut this is why I don't like unions and this is exactly the answer for that\nThe NFL grades officials on their performance every play of every game okay sometimes they'll suspend or their ... reassign officials for games out of a you know mistakes that have occurred\nAnd they get a evaluated every year they get placed in tears tier one tier two tier three to one of the top performer to your to mid level grades to your three so lowest performing official at a given year\nNow if you have been a tier three official two consecutive years that makes you vulnerable determination\nAnd I think that's the way it should be so now for these officials who thought that they can't be fired and their Supreme Court justices would lifetime appointments because of this so powerful union that protects them even in poor performance\nWell maybe they'll shape up maybe these guys you feel that they can just go about their business 'cause they're not afraid of getting fired maybe they'll look at their good buddy Hugo crews and realize crap I could be the next few boat cruise you know what it's good to put a little fear and these guys\nIt's not good when people don't feel that their job performance will determine if they have a job or not if you don't you know if you don't fear that you can get fired for poor performance why going to work hard\nRight why are you going to work hard if you don't worry about getting fired\nThat's the problem here in this country\nAnd by the way if you think I'm anti union I Am I live in New York City for crying out loud\nAre you in the New York city you look at the uh you know to subway systems and the the you know the the falling apart of things like that basic necessities teachers and things like that I guess what you become anti union I hate to say it\nAnd I want to see this guy go after the NFL wants these Scott Greene go after the NFL and prove that his guys good official first of all so yes I have never taken the step 'til now in the super bowl era tells you that they've been complacent with the union and this guy must\nHave been really bad for you will cruise to get fired in the super bowl era in season for performance again a first in the NFL and were fifty two Super Bowls in\nVienna fills been probably a little too lenient over the years maybe Scott Greene needs to be counting is lucky stars but this is the first time that fifty two years it's ever happened Sean due to the series leaves and you're right in season officials have been fired a let go before\nFor poor performance but it's usually done after the season\nOut there who would kill for an NFL job\nHow many guys in college football kill to be an NFL official right that's what these guys work for\nIf you go crews can cut it and he apparently couldn't cut it bring up somebody that can cut it if they can't cut it and others can cut it bring up bothers the bottom line is the NFL is there a fictional but the NFL does do that they do fire officials they usually wait until the season ends up\nBut this guy to come and protect didn't say that it's a troubling history of knee jerk reactions by the NFL gave me a break\nI mean he said it's drawing or fired in season what officials get fired and seizes layers can get caught in season right right so shouldn't be any diver officials said that I I find it hilarious I really do I find it yeah yeah is this guy scapegoat though I mean I I I Know that's kind of what\nPeople are looting two that are defending you know\nHim Hugo\nYou know what how many how many games can we think of off the top or head\nWhere you scratch your head with the officiating a guy using a note card to remember that to see about or was it a first down on the gene was territory wherever there are ... and now he's the or the works like CBS or something yeah how did the guy ... couldn't get the a coin toss right\nRemember that one Super Bowl coin toss the wars that we get a rapidly was a no was it hot sun fish on our I talk about that because I don't know who wants to have you on TALK show\nBut the drugs that is one yeah the drawback is one yeah\nMaybe it sure wasn't genes territory there either no it wasn't it wasn't for that to an index card was hilarious that\nWho's on the other ... rounds I [noise]\nSome of that one yeah so these guys get hired somebody messed up the coin flip the I ... I don't think it's a knee jerk reaction this time by the NFL considering they've allowed those things to occur I Walk it by the way with there you go All right uh robbed ...\nFormer all star closer

Kennedy on my show today and he works for the Dodgers saw them all year you know it's it's with all of baseball baseball doesn't believe their eyes anymore\nAnd you know ... was not throwing a bad name he was actually winning two to one uh he gave that he gives up to hit the basket that another two out at the pet walked spin and Sandy is first walk at the game and with his speech stuff\nAnd it's cold as it was you know ... standing up there I let you face appears if I'm going to bring in ... okay Matt and faces shady Martinez but that's after the fact that if something bad happens in three to to uh or God Forbid it's a grand slam which I yeah I don't see are you giving up of grassland appears\nYou bring them in and the the one thing you want to have a little bit of wiggle room with any receiver is maybe an extra base open and there's no bases open there's nowhere to\nThe worst thing you could ever do as a relievers walk a guy and then he walks in peers then he gives up the the two RBI single the GED Martinez um you know so to me\nLook at your guys even in game one by is throwing Ninety nine miles an hour and nobody can catch up to it and you're going to go buy the book and bring in would and I and I understand David I'm not trying to a second guess them but he goes\nWell I still felt good about Alex would and I would too but I'm looking at by as watching the sky roll it right by the hitters sometimes you got to throw your your analytic send your percentages out the window and go this guy's got some nasty stuff tonight I'm not taking them out of the game\nYou know Rob it bothers me when I look in a box score after I've watched the game and I see that a a relievers thrown wanting a throne twelve pitches seven strikes he's dominant and then they take him out I was twelve pitches and like many London going down the reigning why not but you're right it's just stupid book it's the analytics baseball and I think to a point Rob they'd gone too far\nWell and it could cost you a championship two years in a row I mean ... last year they took rich shell out because they had a book on 'em and he was all went through the light up a the Astros and you're like all the third time through the light up\nThe betting on it doesn't matter if the world series you know I I heard and I'm not going to go into who said it but they said uh the red Sox a\nPitcher's arms are tired and I was like that's the craziest thing I've ever October it didn't matter what I felt like in September or August\nThen when it when it was you know pirates and and the AIDS for me Twenty years ago my arm was never better\nI I was actually in a zone so you you you know unless you've pitched in the postseason I don't want to hear people talk about how tired somebody is and why the Dodgers are ... a joke Kelly is throwing\nYou know a hundred miles an hour evolve these throwing a hundred miles an hour a Kimball is throwing lights out prices last throughout a fantastic guys step it up a notch because this is what they've been waiting their entire lives to do with the super bowl to the guys like us in the major leagues so nobody's tired right now\nSo you've got ... with your eyes and not looking for that book uh especially when it comes to the postseason\nRob people joining us going deep to enforce that NBC Sports radio and the guy that just throwing bullets flying out David Price you know this guy on the worst seasons starters in history but the last two stars\nHe's been different now Rob you picture the high level obviously you could have gone a hundred and twenty miles an hour what are you seeing from David Price the last couple of starts compared to really his entire postseason career before that\nWell he's he's just letting it fly now and he's in he's always had amazing mechanics he's got a little bit more hit turned but ... you know he's he's attacking the hitters\nAnd he's done that in the last couple of outings where I mean this guy was sixty one after the all star break with a two to rewrite and before that in the first half he had almost two two runs for\nFor for a ... you know nine so for for my money maybe something was wrong with these ... little bit from last year and it was kind of hung over in the first three months\nAfter the all star break David Price has been as good as they get the major leagues and now you know he got to forget what people are going to judge you on in your past and all that other nonsense whose job is just do the job for Eighteen or Twenty one else\nJust you know it's like Bill Belichick just do your job and it's basically three words and he has done that the last couple of outings he's attacked the strike zone you you can't you gotta do it David Price goes well\nYou can't have a book on all these guys I mean my God I'm looking at catchers Dan they've they've got things on the wrist like a dam quarterback in the NFL is no joke and and you should already know that information and the fact that you know you got guys playing like deep\nOutfield positions for the Dodgers at at Fenway guys are misjudged balls because they didn't take batting practice under the lights and white you know go back to basics keep it simple stupid stuff you know play some baseball and stop playing by the number so much\nTake us to the mentality of being a pitcher when you're captured is having a rough time in his ... keeps having a rough time I mean do you lose faith in the guy like that when you get to the mound\nNo but I Do and what I mean I had exceptional catchers and and Joe Oliver Jeff read a boat de as some of the catches that I had you know throughout my career\nI'm ... their job one was to get the most out of the pitcher and you know and and I get to see every every game that Gary Sanchez catches I get the ah some of these other guys and the American league east and the national league east here in Connecticut\n[noise] a lot of these guys are not going to get the most out of their pitcher first\nWhere they're not they're not in the position to block balls they're reaching across the body to try to catch balls they're not moving their feet well uh they're not moving across the you know I used to watch the catcher's this spring training Dan do these drills like all day uh and and after practice and they would shoot\nFalls out of a out of a machine basically the iron Mike machine and make these guys walk hundred mile an hour\nAnd that's what catches up due to prepare themselves so if you can't move your feet and you could walk balls and the major leagues first of all you shouldn't be behind the plate\nYou know maybe they should movie to a different position but uh you know what a guy's habit of a bad day like it for all this Chapman is out of them out or chemicals out without or a chance and his out about it in a crunch time over\nYou know past ball or it could be the difference between winning a world championship but not so for me it's more it's more of a focus thing and it's more of a a walk in yourself in an every it's because that's what that is there to be a champion\nRabbi predicted the red Sox would win in five after watching the first two I may be wrong you may not even go to five as you look at a talent differential between the two teams and I got into yes if my producer Sean and I'm like All right the Dodgers they have a deeper bench but who cares at this point who cares we look at every other aspect of baseball\nDoes this go back to Boston for a game six or does this even make it to a Sunday game five\nTo die there's one in three areas you can lose gates creates all it only goes games but from the other day they need to you know stop ... to ... inches at play the bad\nGuys on the bench you know balance your needs to be in Muncie nice you know these guys I don't care a less about right yet about what a blight\nLike like the new slogan is let the kids play and let these guys go out there and winter lose a guy that uh you know again the percentage all the time is not only the correct who\nYou you gotta use your your your day Robert you want to get and the thing if you don't mind games where you get over that time about the two of the other thing I think it's because of the game three or the other teams already being emotionally as well as physically\nRed Sox have to be the use in their in their line up they've got to the bullpen but you can do in this series you play a little bit of small make contact with two out into strikes or you you need to beat the red Sox game in great\nAnd only day Roberts over used that book for the bullpen has not worked in the first two games to say Italy's please Ryan ... don't be the first guy out of that pen in that for the fifth inning because\nWe know the history of that every runner does

has I mean they knocked off LSU this year I mean they're pretty good\nThere is some power back in the eastern portion of the FCC with Georgia Florida\nKentucky amazing maybe Jeremy ... turns around Tennessee in the east will actually start to balance itself whipped out west which is so dominant in the U.S these people are going to break down that game a bit later on here's the one that worries me the most\nYou know I Am partial to a Mike Leach Washington state love the guy\nHe comes on he's fun to talk about anything ... pirates the guy goes on for ten minutes about pirates and all the nice with a lot gadgets people send them in the mail\nYou also some of the funniest ... you're gonna find online where reporters asking questions have nothing to do with football and he'll spend a good deal of time answering you know get get his thoughts on marriage you will gladly give you a thoughts on marriage it's funny stuff when he does that I like listening to Mike wage\nWell Mike Leach has Washington state home again you know we talk about that pack twelve Shawna we talk about well Washington right by then it was Stanford right and then it was Oregon right\nWashington state's like that last teamed up potentially\nWould be the one that maybe would have a shock to go to the college football playoff they need a lot of help like a Notre Dame law and probably a big twelve\nLosses but not amazing that here's Washington state heading into week nine and they're the last hope of the conference to go to the conference applied to go to the college football playoffs that insane\nWhose son that\nYeah it's it's sad really because we need a pack twelve team in the mix it just makes college football a little more interesting [noise] it does and here's what worries me every single year\n[noise] Washington\nState has lost search to where the only on the site then that are a whole day you write them for\nTheir at Stanford Stadium road no way you know the USC last may already be the one killing the chances that the play off any way when you're on the go into a form that when I went in there they're not you right now but you know what like even if they win out losing the U.S sees now bad last write us these terrible\nAnd to have that on the resume is not good but I just can't see them walking into Stanford Stadium and winning this game I I just can't see it because this is the type of game\nThat is really haunted Mike Leach throughout his career right this is the type of game where it's like oh my goodness\nThey had it by the way it's going to be close and they're going to have a lead like they did against us seeing the defense is going to come up and next thing you know bracelet who've been banged up and has been very good this year\nOr ... white side of the wide receiver is going to come up with a big play and there's going to be a defensive collapse the next thing you know Washington state loses by less than a touchdown like you can read the last chapter this book is it's it's as if it's been written already I hate to say because I Love Mike Leach and I think he's good for football but I don't see them winning the game\nSo that's you're upset of the week stand ... and others that don't get ... favorite anyway right but there are higher ranked\n[noise]\nYeah but it's the higher ranked team but yeah you're right Stafford minus three there's been a weird dynamic staffers ten slots Lauren AP top twenty five yeah but yet there's a three point home favorites that is amazing yeah makes those up and look at Missouri their favorite by seven over Kentucky\nThat's crazy you know what that says he's twelve of the nation and Missouri's on ranked\nHow is it possible but he's er he's such a great place to play like soap it gets to respect Kentucky obviously I Would have to keep doing though like what is Kentucky has to do to gain some respect\nLike they're the only team in Florida that's big win right is this the only last was Texas saying that moves that rank sixteenth and the country by the Florida beat LSU I get it I got to say and I I you know anybody who was at Florida they lost\nYou know they they won't over Mississippi State to dominate the Mississippi State has been very good since they hit the SBC schedule but there's no respect for the you're right there's no respect to be seven point dog\nOn the road at Missouri that's ridiculous and you don't want our buddies got Saddam or go say who I'm going to defeat next week again in uh the dirty dozen picks through spreads telling me something belongs telling me something here and you know just as long as I said I've been telling me something it's talking to me you know somebody who said um are\nYou know yeah Scott impression I like it was pretty close right

think the big twelve as a whole stinks you believe and I do yeah I Believe in that little\nYou know his own eighty came out before the seasons that I Wish you recruited a little bit better remember that I I'm just sick of you know I think my gun did Maxwell he can do there and he had a cute little uh you know I'm forty I'm a man speeches cute and you know that's like going to be the legacy there but\nLike are they getting any better under my gun do you like to have another run probably the ten wins eleven wanes and then all of a crappy loss but I I just you know what maybe it's time to bring in somebody bigger than my gundy to take you over the hump\nBargain Lewis the bangles it's like All right you've done what you can now bringing a real coach when you're a playoff game and it's like the only state bans Oklahoma State\nYou know what how much you're going to do that might gundy what's so great about Texas saying that\nNo but I ...

ugly last they looked terrible in the last do get me wrong I mean I'm not going to stick up for urban Meyer after that one\nBut it it's unbelievable the reaction people in Columbus\nOhio happened like Ohio is a football rich state right they love the sport of football\nHall of fame for crying out is in the state of Ohio when can\nWe have two football teams the browns and the ... and the bangles in both of them aren't great now the bangles or playing better than the browns and brands have been terrible in Ohio state's the biggest football team in that state everybody loves their buck eyes and it's the biggest stadium and you know in the state and they fill it for games against anybody at the horseshoe they call it\nBut there's a lot to lose the game here and there there's going to be bad losses here and they're right next to have been lost the game and I know it was early in his tenure at Alabama before he brought it all the towel be lost a homecoming game for Louisiana Tech\nThat requires been there long enough that these are all his players and you know he should be winning games against Purdue and if he's going to lose the game or two she'll be against the likes of Michigan or a Penn State or Wisconsin it shouldn't be to a team like you know I Will last year in Perdue this year\nIs it something to be concerned about what you said yourself man what's wrong with our ... no I don't think so\nIt happens you can't win a national championship every year\nAnd when it happens we're a guy's winning when every couple of years the way the Nick Saban seems to do then that's why he's considered the greatest coach potentially in the history of college football urban Meyer is not the greatest coach in the history of college football not next ... famous for his own class or to Mars number too\nBut it's hilarious like on social media when I read all my friends right another Ohio State buckeyes fans right now they're jumping off the urban Meyer ship because of one last to do and this and that and what's he doing in his play calling in his defense and yada yada yada and like All right\nYeah it's a crappy last that I could understand why you're mad\nBut it's one loss ... doesn't lose a lot of games at Ohio State his record at Ohio State is unbelievable he's won a national championship there I mean he's he's accomplished a lot\nAnd I just you know it's a nice Seventy seven and nine state since he got there two thousand twelve think about that Seventy seven and nine he's fifty and for a conference\nYou know it's amazing showing if you think about the fact that he's fifty and foreign conference decision it's like it's the sun belt conference dominated by one team right it's not like this was a mid major conference where you have one really good team and everybody else is a bunch of cupcakes\nHe has dominated the Big Ten to where he is literally never finished in second place in the conference since he's gotten their two thousand twelve\nSadly you write sadly you are I\nI hate to admit it but you're anybody goes fifty four in the Big Ten since two thousand twelve is doing something right it's a bad last for do it was a bad last Iowa I get it and maybe it cost them an opportunity to go to a national championship game but lost his like that happen and produce better than we thought they were\nRight but there was no way ... ... in Ohio State football team should get blown out by Purdue I'm Sorry yes they shouldn't be pulling up up and do some people have a right to be upset and in the fashion they were pulling out it was just they couldn't stop Purdue at all it was it was embarrassing\nAnd I was listening to curb street talk about it about Ohio State and he's concerned do you think this is an odd or from a year ago this was more concerning because ... there has been played well the wind backing coral he really called out where the the vulnerable to the R. P. O. that that Purdue was running all game\nAnd he he's he's concerned about the lack of leadership on the team this JT beret there's no\nPrice you know they lost a lot of good leaders from last year a squad Nick Boles if you want to include him too as well\nAnd the offensive line\nThey're not opening up holes right now for the running game so did this concern there that wasn't there last year\nYou know what it is Sean ... it's it's Alexander panic is that's why the panic right but here's the problem it's like Alabama when your program like Ohio State or Alabama\nYou lose so much talent every year right to the NFL use the time\nAnd sometimes the guys that you have all four and five star players sometimes these guys don't pan out\nAnd that secondary by the way it Ohio State has been absolutely decimate a look at all the top draft picks they've had coming out of there you're gonna have a lean year or two because the fact you have\nThree guys a year getting trapped in the first run out of your secondary it's understandable but by the way their foreign one three in wanting coverage and they're still potentially the best team in the conference so\nIt's yeah it's a bad last I get it and defensively that's what surprised me and maybe the fact that well Twain Haskins has pro potential maybe it's not a leader out there the way that a quarterback should be a leader right a vocal type of leader maybe that is lacking it and that's a problem I get it\nBut the reality is you can't be perfect every year\nYou're gonna have it down here to dictate that has won a national

Prescott then Fitzgerald after that guys who had the ability to run sleepy Frank's isn't the same type of quarterback he's really more of the drop back conventional type a quarterback how impressed with the adjustments that have been willing to make room coaching them one style a quarter back\nTo what he's been able to do to get the most out if we do find\nYeah he said a great job with Philippe and I actually felt bad for Philippe uh last year because ah fans doubted his his ability to understand it offsets\nLearn and he just wasn't getting coach very well that's just the truth of the matter [noise] so he he he is being taught well and given things that he has a chance to execute although they thought it was fake\nTimes during the game he ... he asked ... to make make some lunch and it is at trickle to this office is just no just pro style dropped back off is that that's not what they're doing [noise]\nBut they don't ask him to run the ball to win the game\nAnd candidly Philippe has not done a great job of running the ball and if he gets a little better at doing that it's going to make a tremendous difference [noise] show Philippe still kind of feeling this way around on that but most of all to your point\nHe is he coach mall and this coaching staff has taught Philippe how not to be himself and his team and then they give him an opportunity to make some place that he that he

going to sound like coach big so I don't mean to do that but it would be very helpful if the gators could ruin the ball um they've gotten better\nThey've got some good tax\nAnd they're blocking better

football\nAnywhere similar and I'm not even compared George or to Vanderbilt but if they can run this football effectively\nGators have a real chance to win\nOn the other side of it we defensively the gators have been very good only twice that they've given up twenty seven points no more points and bad and that was a win against Vanderbilt the lost against Kentucky defensively against Jake from

way a hundred percent comfortable using those big situations to throw the ball\nWill be some things have happened in practice that nobody knows about\nAnd nobody has ever seen or maybe turn it over a couple of times I made some medical errors that when you get into big ball game you don't know I'd go respond\nBut I think the best way to learn what this guy's about is\nLet them go out there and some live action in a big time game and see how he performs and he needs to be out there and having the whole gamut of play book being able to throw it been able to run it uses athleticism to an advantage but I think Justin feels needs to be a bigger part of it not I expect it\nTo be a big part of it and this ball game I think you've got two weeks to iron out what things he does we'll have to give them a whole play but what maybe you give them a package of plays where is Ron it's passed but he knows exactly where to go to football and those particular place\nThen he's comfortable with so he needs to be a big part of this game ain't going forth\nYou know what he only outdoor as to what I think it's happening here we always forget that currently smart is a new ad coach and it's not like he's been there for ten years psych he's won rational championships in\nHow many guys can pull a Nick Saban in the middle of a national championship game pulled his quarterback and put it in a guy like two or you know a freshman so couldn't be that there is a little bit of being gun shy in the sense of\nWell currently smart knows what he's got Jake Romney's written with Jake from here and maybe it's kind of difficult to uh go to the unknown a bit more than he has a mean heat again is a young coach plays a role in that\nYeah he's a young coach but knowing Kirby Smart knowing his personality type of guy he is\nHe's not gunshot he will do whatever he needs to do to win the ball and if he thinks that he needs to make a change or he thinks he needs to stick with this guy he will do that and I don't think yeah he's going to have some of those moments where he's a young coach and he's still trying to figure is way through it but person their personality wise\nThis guy's just competitive anybody I Know and he will do whatever it takes to win a ball game regardless of if a guy's been around all the guys they new freshmen or I mean maybe\nHe will find a way to win the ball game that is a tough decision to make those especially from the quarterback position but just knowing Kirby I don't think he would have a tough time pulling the trigger on that situation as many people may think for the NBA and just in the third year\nYou know George is going to put up points DJ I mean the sixteen they put up against LSU was not the norm obviously they have is is a total collapse of every asset facet of football but what are your concerns in terms of the run defense\nSeventy five yards against LSU they got gashed factors part has got some cable running backs\nYeah they do a George Carlin is probably one of the better back to the ocean in the league and\nUh they're using the police and the game as well a little bit more to keep teams on his butt Georgia was completely dominated up from by other issue and what you're talking about dominated talking about their lime and changing the ... and getting up on the line backers when every year we got a chance to get to that second level\nAnd forced they'll run to get to the third level that you're having issues stopping to run and that's kind of what happened in the LSU game and I'm sure mother is going to look back at that

well\nGeorge and maybe a little bit closer to Alabama they think and then you look at Alabama an issue now they're still Alabama are still more dominant but this is a game that can put in as he sees team on the map and say okay here's some legitimate\nThreat to the west and you have more teams like Florida starting to come along and played big Georgia we know what they're about ... and maybe

F. HR it's time now for the morning magazine brought to you by comfort air heating cooling plumbing\nNow with the morning magazine here is Carl hill ... thank you Jerry\nAnd good morning every once in a congratulations you've made it to the end of another workweek welcome to the friday edition of the morning magazine on a um Thirteen twenty and streaming live at W. F. HR dot com\nIt's time for another update from our friends at the aging and disability resource center or central Wisconsin Aaron wells joins\nThen of course they're located here almost guys Rapids in was trailing a center and\nWe're going to be talking about a number of different topics so but I think one of those things were going to be talking about is meals a lot today and you've probably\nHeard the ... national PSA um campaign whereas America let's do lunch and I guess that's going to be our theme I'm error or central Wisconsin let's do run do lunch with that we welcome Erin well through the morning magazine good morning\nGood morning thank you for having\nMe and I really have to give her kudos because she drove all the way down from Tomahawk\nDid I did are are they eating disability Research Center central Wisconsin we have four counties so we cover um Lincoln county ... county marathon and of course what county\nOkay well welcome to the south [laughter]\nOkay so uh where did you want to begin I Know meals on wheels and and the laws of the delivery of meals my sister is getting that uh that um that service right there right now it's important it's important things I Want to do better basically I guess begin with the basics\nSounds good sounds good so I\nYou know you you know the value of meals on wheels I'm One of the things that you know people are looking to volunteer on whether it's for meals on wheels are ... maybe whatever they're passionate about something that\nUm maybe they don't put a lot of thought into the benefits to the volunteer themselves so I thought what I could do is just highlight\nThe benefit of volunteering to the volunteer themselves excellent idea that is it's a big area of research and more and more information is coming out and one thing that is fascinating is\nThat the health benefits to volunteers it's even more significant for older adults and even more significant for rural adults which I was very interesting um [noise]\nYou know some of the things that are showing tickets at a impact um the health of the volunteer\nIt's not anything that you automatically what associate um you know I'll give you an example one of the research shows that older adults who volunteer at least four hours per week\nYou know nurses teachers or anybody who's passionate about education and working with older adults and and wellness\nAnd we have different classes I'm living with chronic conditions stepping on powerful tools for caregivers and healthy living with diabetes so we're always looking for people to help us\nOne of those classes to the community and we've highlighted those classes they're very popular and you are if you have a ... for instance say you are a person who is trained in diabetes your that's your profession you help treat diabetes or you help folks dealing with different diabetic issues\nThere is a class where your expertise would be wonderful\nAbsolutely or you know the um the struggles that as a caregiver you know whether your you watch your mom helping your dad or you or you yourself helped her spouse threatened and you've seen how um it's a very rewarding experience but yet it can be very\n... there can be there's stress points ... to be able to share that um experience and help other people\nYou know because what we known as the caregivers also need support absolutely and especially in those kinds of situations yes because it can get the motion on can get stressful they need someone to have their back and say hey it's okay\nTo take walk away for a little bit [laughter] ... do you want to cry that's OK whatever you know it's OK\nI'm living with chronic conditions maybe you'd been dealing with a chronic condition your whole life and people go wow you got arthritis but man I never know about your play golf your fish you walk in you know how you how to do that well\nThere you go you have an opportunity to share your experience in so many that chronic conditions\nUm have similar side effects you know there's there can be pain there can be fatigue there can be um a variety of side effects but lots of different chronic conditions that caused so so how can people come together and kind of learn from each other and learn from this class\nAnd it's someone who maybe as passionate about that and say hey I have something to share something to give I've gone through that I I go through that every day I'd like to leave the class\nI Do this or take this supplement or I found this works for me maybe can help you out and yeah and a lot of times when you're sufferings to something or you're about to go through something\nOr I Know a few years back I had a hernia surgery on ... or I'm a high anxiety Aaron high anxiety baby but uh but uh I ended up talking to somebody that had the same surgery oh okay and then an advance of the surgery\nAnd it was really nice to talk to someone who was very open and very honest follow the rules you gotta watch your ice pack your aunt that pillow and you're a pray to God you don't sneeze or cough okay don't sugarcoat it let me know this is what's going to be happening\nYet I Want to go to and it with your eyes open\nOr right right and to have someone that I could uh that I could could\nThat went through had already gone through and I what I was going to go through or ... that helps us out and not someone that goes to where you will be just fine and I hate that\nI don't I don't say that if you don't know what you expect to tell me what to expect I can prepare for it and so we all have bottom line Aaron and if you're just joining us on the morning magazines we we've been visiting with her and wells from Beijing and disability resource center\nWe all have gifts but the lord gave us the gifts we all have gifts and yours is desperately needed\nYours is needed exactly and it and it might be in smaller increments and I think people should\nRather you don't have to take on that you don't have to take a huge chunk right you can try it\nYes exactly we have people who ride along see what meals on wheels is like see if that would be a good fit for them\nWe even have folks that um help out our dining sites ... you know we have sent trail yeah that's open five days a week and we have Huntington house that's also open five days a week and we use volunteers to help with set up serving\nEven entertainment's maybe their passion is you know I I Love to make things fun I Love to um bring different games and I can play the piano playing instruments and I want to be able to share that with people we would love to have an opportunity to bring people into the meal site to make it\nWas a fun experience that we're we're working\nTwice or maybe you see in Europe that we're getting their meals certain you see someone by themselves and remember much say hey hey\nHow are you how how's your day do you mind if I sit with you for a little bit that you know or um or some give them a chance to have some social interaction overlook orange because we interact or over meals\nAbsolutely and so I mean there's different ways of doing things and you can interact with the other volunteers\nIt's and it's fun it's a fun site both those states are very fun um and we even have folks that you know they want more of a routine hand want to come in I Wanna I Wanna do a specific thing and you know for that I Would say we've got meal packaging so meal packaging for their meals\nAlso happens at Central yeah it's a pretty fast paced got to get a lot of meals package to keep all the food hot that needs ... hot cold that needs to state called so it come in I'm In the morning and get everything ready to go and then um you know can be kind of a a ... if there's like a time limit it I I just want to come in\nAnd do my volunteering for two hours and then had out so we have those opportunities for people also\nKnow for someone that wants to learn about all the different uh opportunities is there a place to their website or someplace where they can go to get more information and how to contact numbers in the lake\nSo they can give 'em off at the cost of the aging disability Research Center at seven one five\nFour three two one zero zero one for\nUm we have our white hundred number if if you're if anybody's listening that maybe doesn't live in the ... the area but it's still wants to help out some way I are one eight hundred number is\nEight eight eight for eight six nine five for five and our website\nIs also a great resource for people to see what's out there and that's WWW dot\nH. T. R. C. dash cw dot org and we also have a bunch of opportunities listed on the United way website so people are on there exploring their different interests they'll see our um opportunities lifted that\nYeah I Know because of this talked about some of the opportunities are involving like the meal sites are delivering meals on wheels and and the like Sowards there\nThere's plenty of opportunities bottom line if you are looking for a way to get involved and especially if you ah been retired or you're just returned going and you're looking for something different\nAbsolutely no this is a great way you don't want a donor isolate yourself that won't help you\nAnd because we just told you about the oh what volunteering does the good it does and what a what a decrease in what it increases so you don't want to isolate yourself get involved with your friends and neighbors a lot of times you find out of heard from folks\nI didn't know you volunteer here as a friend that they've worked lord they've done stuff before you for your volunteering your to all of a sudden you get re acquainted with friends that maybe you haven't seen in a while\nWe we see that allow you see that you know I'd our dining states than in people when they come to pick up the meals on wheels of the um or grab a friends grab a friend take your spouse with you you know it's a it's a good opportunity to do some good together and have a chance to catch up you know\nAnd believe me it's deeply appreciated\nBy those that receive service and the help after a\nWhile I'll just give you an example a day of carrying you'll hear from the volunteers where they go to a yard or from an elderly or disabled person and we'll have cookies waiting for the wall and tears after or or or ... poor some lemonade or something like that then 'cause they're grateful\nThey are and then and it gives a sense of community all around you right that that this is a caring community and we're going to do what we can\nLearn to as our community and I think we all want to ... community that takes care of one another just like we do and our families and I mean so that's ...\nThat's what makes life worth living [laughter] okay well air and I want to thank you so much for taking that drive [laughter]\nDrive an opportunity to to to get down\nHere and again the local number to call and for for ... for more information several won five for two one zero zero one for for two one zero zero one for and you can give that eight hundred line again\nSo then the eight hundred number is eight eight eight for eight six nine five for five\nAnd a um [noise] eighty our city here is located in the ... building easy to find and a ... vote and believe me do put you at work [laughter] so you'll have you'll ... you'll feel good about it and you'll be doing some very important work and good work for your community and your\nIn the the common misconception too with the whole program is that the players are always going to be there to do all this stuff for them but um it's it's really based on what you want to do you know they are on the road for half the summers you don't see them for half the summer itself and then the other half throughout home playing games\nOr they're working out to other pieces so a lot of the time\nIt I'm just ... you know breakfast room in the morning or have something of elbow for them um and then\nYou know have the place for him to sleep and then on off days you know you have an opportunity to get to know them a little bit better and and kind of go from there but I'm always a common misconception that they're there every day and all that they don't\nThey're busy a lot of times when when they are at your place they just want to rest\nSchedule where it's not a lot\nThings they talk about as especially for someone who has never been in the north woods the lead before the wall down the first time I had some guys this year on meet your rafters and was about the time when they were starting to feel that wall and\nThey talked about they were very open\nAbout it and it was very enlightening for fans to hear that you know their college baseball traditional college baseball they may play two games a week they'll that said or the weekend you know all of a sudden they're playing every night air travel [laughter]\nAnd that's a great opportunity about these players coming here to play is it gets them ready for that parole style schedule Franco if they are having issues with some part of their um\nLife dealing with the schedule and they're able to go back to school and kind of analyze it a little bit more and kind of work through you know hey this is what I have to do to prepare myself for the next up\nReal you know and we should mention here and I and I apologize I should have had to let off with this but you got a new member of the team we do we do and what did you introduce or\nYeah or ... or she was an intern at this past summer for us um she was on the marketing crew so a lot of people have probably seen her face if they don't recognize the name but she's taken over for emily's Stein's who previously was doing the marketing and and a ticket package type ... and\n... and then Williams getting married\nEmily is getting married yeah so she uh she got engaged in a\nMoved on we wish her all the best I could have some wonderful they'll\nBut a Emily or I should say a ... she has been here for almost two months now and uh she's definitely been making some strides and has a lot of people and is definitely excited anymore\nYou know so she'll be your contact like if you want to pay um our company wants to schedule a night at the ballpark and the party and you know that's the person the packages\nGroup outings and you know she's the type a she's a person to contact 'em and we're hoping nine to five\nAnd you know what what the tenth anniversary season I Would think if you have some ideas for some group outings might want to jump on it earlier this year\n... our our schedule actually comes out around the Thanksgiving is so uncertain right around the corner ill ill within the month\nAndy will we usually see is a lot of groups try to jump on board right away to get that\nOne day that they had in mind as we definitely recommend if there's anything that you're looking at from a scheduling standpoint that it has to be on a certain date 'em get out of it sooner rather than later\nOkay we're going to take a quick break and then we'll be back with more as we're talking rafters baseball with Andy for instance the new general manager and it's going to be their tenth anniversary season and you want to be a part of it and we'll tell you how you can win in the morning magazine continues right after this [noise]\nMichael beard on what we do want to live on God am Thirteen twenty W jar [noise]\nYou Halloween free ten friends\nLike to tell you about Halloween event that's going to take place this year it's the\nAnnual Halloween aid frightened for

morning magazine we're visiting with Andy for instance the gym for your Wisconsin Rapids rafters and of course\nWe're we've been previewing the tenth anniversary season but guess what gang they've been doing something over the past few years on Halloween\nThat's what the rafters and I guess we're going to do a little trick or\nAgain this year Yelp a trick or treat at the ballpark our bringing that back ah it will be from four to six so it captures the time before it starts locally and um and then also in our into its um\nFrom their ... will be given a candy at the ballpark ah we have twenty five percent off merchandising the raft house I'm so tired of the day you're Chris Rock yeah actually yeah\nUm and then there's also be hot chocolate provided and then I'm a bobble heads will be given out to anyone that comes to the gates\nWill be a random one from previous years and then we also will have cost some contest for children that are dressed up but then also adults to sort of trying to capture the interest of\nBoth [laughter] so if you want to dress up like rascals [laughter]\nWell one thing and uh and and and I were talking about ... and there's a misconception that once the season's over with all your your guys don't have to do anything and folks you know when you go to the stadium ballpark and you enjoy a good evening\nThe groundwork for bad evening started now I mean does a lot of the planning and everything else this is your this is a busy time of the year and I I wanted to do a little little baseball tutorial take people behind the scenes of what happens in the offseason\nYeah yeah that it's always interesting because what you just said it there's always the the common misconception that wants to season ends we kind of closed down the ballpark and we're

Johnson Morgan were that was the guy that was the brains and unless you have another guy who's the brains of the organization sitting back or you should have gotten rid of the brains to begin with\nSo he takes too much criticism yeah so I Will agree with that but at times his criticism is warranted but too much criticism I Will be buying that buy or sell\nThe Packers sold Todd girl lead to less than a hundred and twenty five yards and two touchdowns touchdowns part I can buy a hundred and twenty five yards no I think he's going to run for about that maybe a little bit more um [noise]\nGreat I'm thinking of that yeah I'm I'm so I'm driving wears them soon it up by his house he works for entertainment tonight there is a big Emmy inside their you talk about the monitors you've got your put into the new house he's got something going on for his job he's also a collector and part of this collection is\nThe actual bad phone use from the Adam West Batman series\nYou told me she told me about this\nI'm going to post a picture of it in this one room he's got that\nAnd I dream of Jeannie bottle so William Shakespeare had where they would live less back they had to go to the bad calls Adam Adam West and Burt Ward and he's also got a Gilligan's Island radio and it's all because he knows the people that had this stuff with properties and all that\nAnd that's part of his collection it's it's just really cool so are we go out to a lovely dinner be at least some old radio guys from LA get back part work on the you know on the show and get up this morning and now I'm headed to the rams\nFacility there still has a temporary facility out and solves notes way west northwest of the city or get to cow Lutheran and their media since or rather the corporate offices are few miles away from that and I'll Wait until that new stadium he gets built\nAnd I get out to the car and I've already got a parking ticket because it's street cleaning day so you have to have to cut did know that\nAnd as I pulled the ticket off the cars that smells like cigarette smoke or something I pick up a strong whipping his ticket it snows just like pot so he really go important\nWho your officers who up\nWell it's legal after all bill\nWow there's nothing like a like an officer you know walking over doing do you use your legal you know that's all\nI saw whatever the case so you heard Mike mccarthy there\nWhere you said I bet you're ten point under dogs to go on to this when's the last time of year that big of an underdog and\nYou know there was once upon a time when he was going into a New England to face a patriots primetime game Rogers couldn't play I think he has a concussion against alliance was it whatever ... plays quarterback and they almost beat the patriots going into that gay and Michael ... says hey where nobody's underdog\nWell that was the super bowl season\nSo this week he's like yeah what's the spread\n[laughter] meanwhile meanwhile you\nTalked to Sean to say on a teleconference from Green Bay the other day and this guy's got the hottest team is the hottest coach in the NFL right now thirty two years old he coached for a while with Cal Shanahan in the son of Mike\nUh Shaun dad was a John McCain who is a GM during the bill Walsh forty niners are out Joe Montana Jerry Rice that group so now he's football pedigree\nAnd he's also very honest he was asked everyone is astounding to drop into play and he said yeah we still from everybody including Green Bay\nYou know I'm certainly not afraid to play the around at least in your ... I'm not afraid of you know and I\nI Know some of the things that you guys do know is it pretty clear you know there's a lot of really smart coaches and players around it's a way that he would be trying to use some of their ideas when you've got to see or don't want a weekly basis\nHe's young he's a young inspirational version of what Mike mccarthy was when Mike mccarthy first became head coach of the packages that yes yeah\nYeah that shit there's that energy there's that passion it's fresh less need who looks like he's brought out of central casting out here in Hollywood is his GM last was there when a a jet Fishell is still there\nBut uh uh he hired Sean McVeigh and these guys are a dual and Sean they talked about how they have put together this team to go from Jeff Fisher to seven at all in the NFC\nYou know there were some in the right direction line here um you know you wouldn't want to focus on can groom in and then trying to strive to again every single day and then my middle to some of those clear to me based on whether we were losing breeding instead of working with not\nHaving any demonstrations are willing to do what we can and it wasn't gonna agree owner who\nYou know right now I'm Experian environment that's conducive for trying to be smart you know these you know I didn't want people on the short term like we were able to get some key players on when you look at being able to get early in areas outside guys that were drafted here\nBeing able to acquire ranting cursing him on a contract going in it last year we had our first year and a lot of the players like a dominant issue and a keen to leave and mark is here's Sam here to me it's really dark but not as much of it probably shouldn't be unwound by\nJanuary you got the glare you make sure you do a good amount of the way they would fit in and all these guys were born in creating an atmosphere where the mutual respect that is where I'm you know we try and you know make sure that we're doing a great clarity for players in terms of the ...\nBut in on it or not being afraid of what went wrong there are ways that we can certainly learn as well\nSo Mike you brought it up the other day I mean you know you can post game speeches and speeches between head coaches and enthusiasm and recognition and and guys buying and you you you know ... he's the guy that are like you said it's a hot commodities considered one of the best coaches league right now because of the way not only his team's performance was the way they guys respond to him\nAnd I'm looking for tangible I'm looking for reasons why I Know Aaron Rodgers is I'm looking for more fourth quarter efforts like the Packers had led by iron Rogers against fares to come back and get that when\nHer more of these games and they can't put it together four corners and and these rams they come up and get a lead and they keep pounding and they're seven I Know\nThey they beat the forty niners the way everybody thought the Packers were going to beat the forty niners thirty eight to ten or something like that so listen Ishaan stay after he got that went on a Thursday night game and the and the feel inside that rams winning locker room\nWhere you don't know how can we go hey guys\nGreat job today we talked about playing a complete game on a short weak you guys got yourself mentally physically ready to go and he delivered there's we've got a bunch of guys who I Want to be able to recognize right now\nTo your average punt returned give it up for [noise]\n\nThat we talk about nobody wants nobody Blake when we had a little bird the grey goes down pre game and what he's joining you had to do come in there and just not true\n[noise]\nIf you don't score you can't lose but the fact that [noise]\n\nYou know I don't know that's [noise]\n\nThat's the way to fill away village yeah\nCoordinator yeah who way when he went into Denver Broncos that's how Peyton Manning second try him around\nFinally got his second rank because of that great defensive bad up against the Panthers she got the weight so let's run on the defense Sam shelters in there as one of the corners that they've got and you just hear this court cannot gamble now before they went in there by\nAnd I don't know Kevin ... that can come up with some game changing plays and nice and crowds they can kick a winning feel go out here in the sun forty fifty Seventy five\nEighty degrees on Sunday at the coliseum you're talking about they Adams that the packets got a great record coming out of the pie under my car the last ten games they won seven out of ten when they're arrested up and devout was asked how come\nI mean just having a ... didn't get a little bit of time away from it I can I can do a lot for your team and and just for your mental so I think coming off of this was like I say I have some of the interest we did a you know especially in the wider room getting those guys that I'm getting a little extra time to rest as as going to be key\nEspecially because they obviously what do you think of is just two guys that we definitely need move for the women's game so we get our legs back refresh our mind and kind of hit the reset button\n[noise] I Know that they you know again they need to resettle all that kinda stuff makes sense to me I look at it this way that the officers needs to score inside the thirty they need to put the ball and even if they get a couple of fuel goes okay but they need to hit the ... more Jimmy Graham has to be more a part of it and when it comes to the defense\nThey got a slowdown not stop but slow down ... as much as you want to say put it in the hands of ... Gulf who's been fantastic they got to get to him I mean\nEven even if you're going to win without any pressure in his face you're going to kill you\nSo Jared ... struggled so much during his working season and ... they came in one of the things that he did for him was a more effective a motion and pre snap formations\nThat kept the defense guessing and golf now he has settled I mean he knows where his receivers are weren't checked downs are\nAnd you can see if he's comfortable back there he can be an extremely accurate ... really got a really nice touch past he doesn't have the fastball necessarily you know like airing ads for Brett Farr that at one time\nBut he's really got a nice touch pass some times and he finds these guys deep down the field so claim that he was asked All right so do you what's the quarterback\nDefinitely there's gonna be times where were you know mobile as well have our our packages I'm\nA you know they've got some good receiver so we have to be smart about that so I think it'll be it'll be a\nFun game in regards to the match ups and what we're trying to accomplish with less than a Forman rush or three men or whatever it is because um you know it's kind of risk reward ratio allowing them in the pocket from organizing a razor thin after him and\nYou know we're not working so um uh we'll see you know I I could you know like I say is listen a little bit but you know at the same time it puts are\nMore pressure on on TV so um\nYou know probably be a CEO wants the game starts as far as what direction we want to go\nI'm Mike when you uh look at the run given I mentioned tied girlie he's been fantastic for them and I I don't know you and I talked about this when you came out of the forty niners\nDuring the last year a Packers home game before they went into by saying the forty niners basically said run away from Mike Daniels and Kenny court everything was fair game you assume that girlie company you're kind of going to be doing the same thing\nWhy not and that was made the number one the hottest off in the NFL is a period of nearly two thousands or Brett Farr is getting to the playoffs every year and you're coming close to you know you got for us and twenty six against single\nAnd then things got to be a little rocky and then in two thousand five when Ted Thompson took over and he started retooling the authentic blind rebuilding the whole team really buttoned guys like Mike wall going market will bear and all that\nThey go foreign twelve in the middle of a miserable season and so I that's Super Bowl that was in Detroit that year we got a chance to talk to al Michaels John Madden and we all know what a big fan job man what somebody says well what do you think there's a problem with far twenty nine interceptions knows what he's doing too much he goes you know as far as that is best\nWhen he had him on green one had him on Greenland back there for a thousand yards Brett Farr as had his best\nWhy aren't they still can't find a running back for Aaron Rodgers to take that pressure off any quarterback has got to have a go to running back they\nJust don't seem to get around to using them in Green Bay you talk to claim Matthews about what a beast Todd girlie is\nJust a big explosive back you know obviously I'm you know he's got a great vision he does it all real well you know they use them in the past in game are you going to be get to the outside and obviously visions between tackle though I'm a you know he's he's back he's been like that since a year one when we saw him or you know out here um\nWhenever that was a buddy you know he's just he's one of those guys you know probably probably the best back in the game right now and um\nYou know they're playing really well so\nIt just was a good player overall really yeah\nWhat do you say ... Gurley thinks are facing these Green Bay Packers even my\nHe's an old package that bigger deal than you know what he bears on when you're watching film or even on TV is almost more like a linebacker and he's area where you had an interesting cue and I hear what Iran's media very aware of what the Packers of got for weapons on their defense\nI mean obviously you know with clay Mathis so it's been a threat\nTo pro bowler and my values you know great guys on the back here\nIn Ohio and make period for so long to get good defense and you know the winning team winning program so you know those those guys know how to compete in the play are much pride and taking the fact that you guys are number one in league in Russian right now by a significant margin\nI just found out just to\nDo anything to do that and understand\nThat's why we were you know a lot of students or whatever it is to be the number one\nWhatever often defense special teams are\nMocking does a great job he came into a great job last game later Russia and then we got guys you know ask the wild game all of us can you know take jets we've turned\nMe off last week and taken to the house or get twenty thirty hours and get a first down to just tell you about the balance of all things and you know you don't you don't know who's going to get the ball is not just a one man show I hit the ball hit the ball\nScuba cook cook Josh\nWould take the euro\nI mean I don't want them all the time 'cause I mean obviously they're going another coming to me so that's a good thing about this team and we are so many good players suddenly um weapons and caused a great job of describing the ball out that\nI mean obviously I'm going to get my touching but\nYou you never know who's going to get the ball with his office is not just lined up for a second down to target the ball this play action run the ball just me you know just making everything looked the same as you know if we can do such a great job\nSo distributing the ball in a sense you get Randall ... back likely even though they're coming up hamstrings you hope they're close to a hundred percent you hope that this is the week that may be McCarthy how much is some sort of a package\nYou know with Aaron Jones in the running back as a running back and you know that somebody besides Kenny car coups and he's in there for so many snaps\nAnd I'm like you were talking earlier showed about tributes Adams he's only got like twenty five staffs ... you know he's six games into the season that these are the guys that need to step up and and and be an start making some place or at least followers Simon's\nIf they even have special teams the rams have already bought three parts of the season with their line backers winds up the Packers special teams corner said\nThree block he says that's a whole season right there there they've got five in the last two years the way ahead of the rest of the week and just blocks pond so that's what a winning football team looks like\nA you know what Mike [noise]\nThe Packers you have to do everything right if you didn't win this game independents winters game I think they go anywhere and when any game at any time but this is a monumental task I just I don't know I I\nI pick Green Bay every every game this week or this year including Vikings are they kind of like\nWas stunned but Washington put a

count a four O. one K. contributions\nRelocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp for officers that are just need a place to go and and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability [noise]\nThe camp will be a the the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is on um\nRented or own we currently own that property currently on that property and living living on it\nTime and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry ... general liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be or nonprofit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of a you know\nYou need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of a insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I'd be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the tenant they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or you in a company separate from the non profit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure 'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interests and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit or how to keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do some ... let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands of the land is owned by the nonprofit you see what I'm saying yeah so you keep that separates a and so treat that you know the landlord had can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying and it's a treat these things separately and your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of insurance people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay\nAnd so you don't go to the state farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you you said you would go to insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you how that ... ability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash wrote what happened in the same thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means in insurance where they find somebody that I write you a policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs this much and this cover company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it costs as much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or our insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that\nCan you know the window that low a little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in his years as but the main thing you want is liability do do hold harmless agreements carry any weight in any of this um\nNo I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from ... you cannot contract away liability\nOkay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless you are liable for that or you're standing in my building\nIf you slip and fall and uh because we didn't properly and stole the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had to sign a Harley Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called ... those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk but a whole harmless is\nIt what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts keeps honest people honest right it's like do you know you you are you are walking across that employee\nTrip you know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not after writing a check\nBut you need the backup in case you were to lose that uh and it'd be proven that you are liable regardless of the hold harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases you know for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and having attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are often Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still wobble [laughter]\nThey'll sell legs so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you and thanks for the call and you're ... you're joining U.S Open phones at AAA eight to five\nFive at two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll talk AAA eight to five five two to five All right Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a Christian and I'm a new nurse so I Apologize if this is something that you've touched on what\nUm find new to the baby and I know that number one is saying the thousand dollar and mark and the fun my question is do you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing happened mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm find just wondering how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an unstable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off\nHow much notice do they usually give him if he's laid off\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years and never happened we really lucky we've never been laid off and he goes in and they get home pretty quick I mean within a\nCouple of weeks she don't couple of weeks to do something ... going to work on something when he comes home if they did get laid off so\nYou know he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed pause also want to make a little baby step thing and this pile of cash\nBut just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of that [noise]\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners checkout one
