doubt about that they're ... it was a a real big factor in the game but what would it did was carried momentum over and that's probably about five play and you know I thought that they played a a great road game\nUm but I thought we were standing still a lot and when there were chances for us to get back you know we go to Kelly problems are pretty much throughout the game and then you lose you know you as fake so early in the game\nTo go on your branch out in the middle and uh we just didn't have enough legs you energy to the fight away back into I thought that started the third was good to

the answer is if you look for I think our players\nThat are jump at our our support away from the park a way for we don't do that we're we're just an ordinary team or if you look at when we did it

because well you know we want to win games nothing special he's a dime a dozen coach\nTime to move on already you want to talk to\nThose eyes crossed those tease I get it but there's a level of

look bad a player died on your watch\nYou want us to for the money that you you feel is oh do you find those to see how that plays out in the court of public opinion\nFrom Maryland and a quarter public opinion it looks worse and worse every single day this goes by where there is yet a resolution as to whether the coach days or not but we all know DJ ... going to get fired right there is no

that's off that program right now yeah and he was brought in as DJ ... first hire he's his right hand man\nSo in essence he's responsible because he put this guy in place who may have been responsible

Minnesota Vikings\nDidn't we see this last year in the postseason that turned out to be one heck of a crazy finish or are they\nIt was I mean I watched it a couple of times this week I'm referring to the game last year and a while I mean Drew Brees came out he was slow um he started slow within the put up any numbers in the first half came back in the second half\nYou know a lot of different action I think I'm the saints if I remember correctly they blocked upon a markets Williams had a a really nice interception obviously he gave up that big play and to me you know and I'm just saying is if if I had to fight for him I Would just tell them look man\nJust be you you know focused on the positive of what you know what you did last year I think yeah what five interception last year for you have very good out here yeah yeah rate rookie year focus on a positive and go out there and play and don't be shy and don't be surprised they're going to attack you if if you know they're going to attack you made the path of the field\nBut um you know I I just thought that\nYou know we look at it that you like wow the one thing that you could never do against the saints you can never relaxed because Drew Brees who's going to put pressure on you um the opens up the fans they put pressure on you then hire field because they have so many different weapons and he doesn't even care like last year it was fourth down at ten and\nHe passed it too will lose me\nAnd it wasn't Michael Thomas it was really neat and and to me that was huge because first down second and third now like an completion and things like that\nBut on fourth down and tend to most critical moment this their season he passes so to me that show that he trusts all his guys his weapons and you've got to defend the entire field if you want to stop Drew Brees\nThis same team because it's always been they've had a great offense and defense has been a question mark you mention of course Williams and others they make the move for ... they haven't been grading the secondary if you look at you like apple and there's a statistics this year in terms of the pro football focused type of statistics he's an improvement or the saints defensively\nGood enough to win a Super Bowl Rodney in part to is\nTurn of ever seen Griffin what does it mean from Minnesota\nTo start with um ever since ...

I went\nDown how 'bout that gets out of that jam up to the bottom of the head for the game first and third one out to the gym fell into the big throw gets the base runners how fat games like this you don't\nGames like this are palpable and they go four innings right because first of all it's actually say four hours right he said he ran\nFor themselves [laughter] so it will because they're like exciting you know because it's a tie game it's an extra innings with like eight to four and it takes four hours forget it you know what did we never mention is and and we should the national league\nGame is such a better baseball game it moves better\nAt the th just I I Can't stand at the age you know the game to to to long too much off its strategy involved\nCan we get rid of the HBO series the baseball kids not baseball what can I think what is baseball losing\nBut they're losing the interest of the millennials you know why because it's not popular on social media part of the reason why it's popular on social media no one talks about baseball right in the cause of the controversies there's nothing to talk about the more strategy involved in baseball the more\nSecond guessing that goes in into\nThe managers are you you know that the decisions that they make and that's all National League baseball you kind of take that away with the da da to more pitching but way way way but\nPeople don't want to sit there to strategize the pitcher it'll be a quicker end I don't know for hours there'll be here's the problems that we often\nBut here's the problem even a nationally style of baseball's going away you know the hit and run and sacrificing and things like that\nThat stuff's going away from the no no no no no no no no because of that they're taking pictures out there at the ...\nSo you're going to have more double switching you you're going to the bench so would you actually you will that will be more strategy involved in it but then of course\nIn a move that that spot right and if you want to bring it in a ... hater someone who's who's going to go three innings you have to move that spot because you don't want to take them out after anything half or you know the two innings\nH is to me look first of all I'd have to like it's never going to happen a do you think baseball's ever going to take less money from one of these TV networks no and that's what I mean they shouldn't just hear the state's going to last league in time but they should they should do these games should be on ESPN they would do a better job ... baseball\nThere's no question about it I mean yes yeah PBS or you and Fox yeah no question about agree a hundred percent with you on that you have to be on the four letter networking with the girl than ours on ABC right yeah you're right exactly World Series on ABC that ... that that's where it needs to be\nBut the whole problem for me when it comes down to it is look I mean [noise]\nPeople like to see home runs for people like people like power people don't want to sit there and I have to do the math in their head of All right he's coming up that okay okay so ... out okay Dan if that's the case then the ... baseball losing fans because guess what\nAs each year goes by more and more often you see more and more often in baseball and you see less and less fans so he doesn't make any sense\n[noise] near the fatal back it up and they keep losing fans and does your pets keeps going up up up more home runs here Mormons they're less fans so that doesn't make any sense\nYeah but that's because baseball's the tired old sport to people\nBeing you know because you don't you know what the problem is with with with like soccer in this country like Fifteen Twenty years ago not now it's changed a lot no one no one knew who any of the players are here that they held them right so that there was no storylines there was no like emotional attachment to any of these players so you don't watch\nBaseball is the same way there's no national stars there's no story lines right for the ride for the average fan right of course the diehards who gonna watch you got to get the on the periphery you got to get the fans on the periphery\nAnd they've got ... ball player when you have to rely on is when you have you know us make a star in the world series who hasn't won the world series in his career or if you have the cubs you haven't won in a hundred years you know people tune in\nOkay here's what you're saying storylines well here's a man by talking about all the money\nThey don't you don't you're wrong where you want with the da you don't have the ph or the most popular players the last Twenty years they're still getting a lot of accolades 'cause he's part of the broadcast there wouldn't be David Ortiz if it wasn't for the ...\n... ... ... you know what I mean and what does that matter did that increase ratings because David hitting home runs left and right and bombing away\nNo I don't want to see Walker beautiful go over to uh to strike out swelling of white people do want to see that\nIt's too bad it's miniscule when you you you you factor in all the other bats and the game no because then they pinch it twice for him so Kemp brilliant ones going so then you get me wrong fence so it's only to get to\nGo to the age then don't worry about it or not but if you don't you're not comprehending it it did yeah OK leads to more often write and okay there's no one wants to see the you rather see the designated hitter professional hitter than than a than a ... a ... his name as a show have townie\nRight but writer or Madison Bumgarner but even then you'd rather rather somebody else right so what I'm saying is yeah you may look at it and on the surface you might be like oh okay and somebody I think got hit with a baseball in the stands scary stuff from\nHopefully that fan is All right um\nI I think on the surface you might be saying oh you know more offensive it was more fans but at the facts don't just do the numbers just don't back that up because the ratings have been tanking in office has been going up you could just you could see the\n... if he did like a ... you know the stock market and I have like um they do or do you think that my parents hey you're not having pictures it's going to bring the ratings up no but talking about baseball the strategy bringing more strategy in baseball more second guessing by the fans water cooler stuff\nYou get more storylines and you get more interest in baseball day in day out you know as long as you're willing to storylines they but yeah but if if if the ... Smith and max Kelvin are debating it or skip pay less than ... baseball on their on their talk shows which they don't do now\nMore people are really interested more people that I couldn't yeah because you know ... more people that would be interested in baseball\nAnd and more people will tune into baseball\nThat's Robin gained a lot of media would pay attention to baseball that's not and that would that would help out their popularity with them lung young ...\nWouldn't happen here's why it's not look\nEvery single game okay shooting of taking a veteran they're not going to talk about it on those types of shows because they don't think the audience wants to hear it to me baseball's past that point here you know the arrogance of baseball all those years ago\nThinking that they ruled sports they did for a while I mean if you're in the world series ratings back in the early eighties I think we're Dickey lists numbers right I mean that the percentage that shares that they were pulling were ... and baseball thought at that point they could do no wrong and what happened was other sports were cool baseball Scott less and less cool I mean baseball start to you know didn't promote the big stars\nThe easiest way to avoid a scam don't pay for a loan modification get free help promote approved counseling agency now to learn more reporters scam or find out have you been a victim call one eight eight eight nine nine five hope or visit loan scam alert dot org\nThat's one eight eight eight nine nine five for six seven three and loan scam alert dot org no the sides get the facts\nAt temple idea can be developed into something big back and change the world\nGrade my music teacher helped me make a vision board it was a collage heavy all my whole operation\nMade you didn't have the time when you need to make our collages\nWhat if I never gotten a chance to\nUnfortunately that's the reality our teacher said everyday therefore than their own money sometimes just to keep the cost him running [noise]\nTeaming up again with the book for getting to donate one million dollar donors choose our\nCharity that help teachers get what they need to bring learning to live\nOn for more than seven hundred thousand talkin project thing more than ...

C.\nIs the number here let's go ahead and talk a little uh college football we got started off on Thursday with the west Virginia\nPounding Baylor fifty fourteen remember one banner used to be good yeah I Do not so much anymore here's an email ... coach of a West Virginia saying yeah that was easy\n[noise]\n\nYeah coach or you don't need or the numbers when you win fifty eight fourteen okay I'll tell you the numbers they were heavily in your favor we'll just go ahead and leave it at that so Baylor thanks for playing a West Virginia they continue to\nMarch on as well and uh you know be impressive demean West Virginians I wasn't one of those kind of you know different ... and ... teams to you know be able to do watch and and who they've they've had from the major Harris is remember when he played in a coach down even way back in the Des Moines Bobby ... got his start at West Virginia\nA back in the seventies before he went on and I went on to great in this era Florida State your game of the day\nThe uh Georgia hosting Florida again slate in Jacksonville every year it is a course of Florida's home is Gainesville, Florida came in Jacksonville they call it the largest\nOutdoor cocktail party I mean really what that is that's playing for the fact that people from Georgia\nAnd people from Florida to drink a lot and just get completely wrecked OK Florida is five and a one Georgia is a in this game at six and one nine versus seven respectively George a one point favorite Florida coach Dan mall and it's not a nice job turning it around he previews the game you see why\nMost people you know if you damage one of the top two teams in the country or the season [noise]\nAnd um you know 'cause the depth they have and that is from top to bottom that type of roster they have so many a great challenge for our guys coming in and but you know these are this is why you want to come to Florida and be a part of this game and be a part of these robberies and um and and play on the on the biggest if they just\nYou know we could have three of the four teams of Clemson keeps winning there'll be one Notre Dame may get squeezed out of your least going to have to from the SEC when they unveil who are the ah you know final\nFour teams which we're getting close to that it's always around Halloween anyway so we're going to see that a sooner than later I like this match up in the big ... conference I mean I was snuck up on people I was six and a while and we just haven't really thought of Iowa as being the team because we're so wrapped up in the Ohio State university right in Michigan and\nA Penn State maybe even Michigan State as well the Penn State hosts I was Eighteen versus Seventeen respectively Penn State a five and a half point favorite\nKurt fair and so does not like the fact has got to go up against many lions QB trace mix early I wouldn't either\nFight against some twice is a tremendous player is not six five tell you what you can throw the football throws a very effectively their outstanding runner makes great decisions but I think the biggest thing you know after playing them towards shows a tremendous competitor and to speak for them but my sense is\nEverybody model and they're all there are other sideline when he's on the game and I think they got a chance to win the true\nHow they usually do and you really got a credit James Frank let me think of what Penn State's dead I mean I Know they brought it on themselves with\nA you know the sexual molestation or that they had there were Jerry Sandusky and and you know just to the tremendous whole left in that program and with the community as well but Franklin has really just on a nice job of stopping to believe and not only that but to have to rebuild the damaged completely turning around\nAnd get you where you need to go I mean that is you know pretty a pretty impressive pretty damn right and Brezhnev what he's done and and look at the names that have come out of there\nAs well stay calm Barclay and now we're getting tracing throwing some guys are going to do some great things or when it comes to playing on Sunday\nTaking a quick peak at the pack twelve really the game you're going to want to watch comes your wife seven o'clock eastern four o'clock Pacific if you saw last week you saw Washington state beat Oregon and they beat Oregon\nOh Oregon do nice job to come back on the second half of that game was twenty eight nothing had happened and now it is a game of two as are still the fact Oregon last by fourteen when it was all said and done which to me being a a husky I mean that's the perfect Saturday for me is the huskies win in Oregon loses I don't care who they are planning it can be playing a foreign country I could care less\nAll right uh that's how I feel about the rocks\nAnd the fact that cougars beat them I was like man it's that's impressive now\nNow can they follow it up more importantly go to Stanford and win that game\nTo Stanford the three point favorite just because they're playing and all ... six and on Stanford of five into\nMind you out because the apple cup gonna be which is the day after Thanksgiving and that's going to be in a moment\n... ... there for the first time by the way he talked to a couple of friends at work over there and like easily have been doing this for twenty twenty five years easily the most insane crowd not the biggest the most is saying it was nuts altogether and might three co he's not nuts he's really good he comes up next\n[noise] for the best coverage of high school sports either right here I Am Thirteen twenty WFAN jar from Wisconsin twenty four hour news and information station you were NBC\nSports radio update now\nOn the red Sox had a chance came away empty handed out we're going to the bottom of the fifteenth ending from Dodger Stadium with the Dodgers and Red Sox tied at two as Jacques Peterson hit a home run and that was followed by Jackie Bradley junior touching them all that tied the game up\nAnd then what you had a was a throwing air for both the Dodgers and the twelve answered by throwing air from Red Sox and the twelve insults you wrote tired of it to each team has had numerous chances those long it's been pretty darn right sloppy or in the second half\nOf this game but there are tied into going down to the sixteenth any way you need to know and the association Kevin ... forty one is the warriors beat the next one twenty eight to one hundred raptors are now six and on the season the Greek fleet grows offer the box\nThey beat the timber

imbedded breaching Ninety nine a portion goes to being trumpeted fallen hero squadron\nYou know we we have a we were solid building's foundation here we continue to contend we haven't really dropped off for most of the last twenty five years of course the quarterbacks part of that but they drafted both of those guys and develop both those guys\nAnd systemically McCarthy came in and took them to another level but to the Rogers point yeah I'm sure there are times he says boy I Wish I was somewhere where\nWe go get this toy that toy and and go do more but\nI think when you listen to the pod cast too if you a chance to download it he talks great Great Lakes about fish are significant sort of be a player who plays for the most unique franchise approach sport there were so\nDown in the weeds on this week to week in which inside life heck who's going to be out and has impact this game and all that stuff\nYou know putting yourself back this franchise is ridiculous in this day and age it's owned by the by their shareholders and all that stuff that you all know about what\nWe forget that an error and takes an appreciation that when he goes out on the field it's shark is the legacy of all the Packers lumbar twelve sixty five and body avenues with street address to the stadium\nUm it's following him that legacy of great quarterbacks and great players that play for the people at a unique situation without a Super Bowl trophy I think it might have cut him more\nI think he understands it and when he signed his contract this kind of you know what you're going to be a Packer for life and for ever as long as they play football in Green Bay people are going to go to that stadium where number twelve\nI pick them to make it to the super bowl this year now they've they've had a rough time in part because Rogers had that knee injury back in week one they got their work cut out for them this weekend do they face the rams and the ... defense that when he was with the Broncos in twenty Fifteen of of the Sunday night game\nThey held Aaron Rodgers the Seventy seven passing yards I don't think I Would take me under on Seventy seven for Sunday it was just show you when you when you combine the rams are fence with one way to Philips has done against the Mike mccarthy ... in the past but this is going to be a real challenge and if they win this game it's going to be Aaron Rodgers with another virtuoso performance\nIt would it would have to be you know and this rams team has a little bit of doubts for them to show maybe just as important as bad as what they can do defense away might cutting the defense of courted this year after all those years dumb capers and the defense\nCan most guys take another not to step up in what I think he's become a very fascinating division the NFC North but\nRanch is look they look like a ... or get the Breeders' Cup next week I might they look about a wink and a half to two white the front of their life and a half in front of everybody else\nUh with the same right on their heels a next in the race but I Love watching the rams are what they do and how they're doing it and the defense which was supposed to be great remember had those cornerback injuries going into the Thursday night or Minnesota as they get better back there\nUh I think they're going to continue to get better so that for some reason my or not\nHaving this you know how long can the rams go undefeated conversation\nBut I Know they've got the Kansas it again in Mexico city coming up there and do a month but maybe it's time to start thinking about how how deep can arrange take this after several of those start because I mean most folks think they're the ... early ... favorite to win again this week you get halfway through the schedule that loss\nAnd you mentioned the saints they'll get a chance to move to six in one on Sunday night against the Vikings and then it's saints rams next week and all the NFC West to get together and I think that you look at the same could still end up the number one seed because the only I can beat the rams I\nI but I I agree with you the rams have quietly gotten to seven to know and we're not having a conversation about sixteen oh because it does feel premature\nBut the way the rams have played if they can keep their core players healthy they could they could do\nWell beyond ten oh and maybe make it you know one of those things where hey we've got everything locked up do we do the bill Paulina pulled out all of our starters and and give up a game in week sixteen or Seventeen or do we do for a day they may be in that dilemma when the end of the season rolls around\n... or ... and we're a long way away from that I don't think Sean McVeigh and that group would do that uh I I did watch a little bit of them on the NFL game pass it just really is as you know when those four o'clock games get played weren't scramble mode were a kid already finished show\nGames with one eye and then turning away that coming back a balancing to play and Donald obviously for sex last week most guys are playing on that side and you know for for all the talk of all the office of weapons around the league and rightfully ship so to Sean Watson\nA last night and the Andrea ... last night in the full or injuries can be a killer for those guys I think is anybody talking about tiger early I mean\nYou mentioned with your parents the oh by the way it three touchdowns or maybe the guys one shy of Jim Brown is all time record for the most touchdowns total touchdowns\nIn for seven games because he's and he's having a phenomenal year\nAnd I'm just not getting the pub with the headlines perhaps or conversation nationally like Patrick my homes are certainly folks just putting them on there and be ... tribute week to week uh and just do a poll on that almost every week but I just think he's been terrific in a day's work with conversation a bigger conversation going forward here but extremely\nHigh agree with you might we were talking about this early in the week I think it comes down to pack their homes and talk girlie one's going to be the MVP and the other one's going to be offensive player of the year that anybody can never understand how that works but that's like [laughter]\nHey I've taken out and do that on my ballot more than a couple of [laughter] you know what\nThey they both it's like the best supporting actress are supporting actor you got to get more support for what they've done\nFine I got another ballot for you and this is a question that's posed to me and the first down we're talking about the Texans into ... Watson looking a lot like the guy he was last year staff asked me this and we put it out on Twitter and we can find it the next five years who do you want between patrimony judicial watch [noise]\nI I'll start by saying I'll take the one you don't take it'd be very happy with it because I Love them both of them both as a player as soon as individuals being around the Sean last year and\nI'm listening to Patrick but listen to what everyone said our Sunday night boat with a great kid and you got to come through that when he talked to his parents you hear all that stuff\nYou know the the homes rocket arm is is really really intriguing and he doesn't seem to do nearly as much of it on the move\nI'm I'm Still torn about this Mike ... the the quarterbacks who are the mobile quarterback and and the same uh homes is not but the shots and all that\nSo much more of his game right now a this was the early part of last year before the seal close quarterbacks always worry me about them getting hit in hurt 'em [noise]\nI'm having a hard because I don't have a great answer I probably lean towards my homes because that natural huge arm is such a difference maker actually on the podcast Rogers has great comments on watching my homes and what he thinks about which is\nPretty cool to hear and are you are in the meeting with us last week you know we didn't get it on the air but when we had our conversation about Patrick my homes I wanted to show the end of the Sunday night game with Kansas City in New England 'cause I thought as soon as that game and the forty three forty wild game when Tom Brady sprinted\nSprinted over to shake Patrick ... homes hand\nThat was that was almost like McCain night in somebody and say you know what you're part of the club to me that was the ultimate sign of respect that I think everyone who's played against him has come away with a while so I I all we mow homes over what to but I'm happy to take your leftover\nOh and let me tell you I went instantly Patrick moms and then the more I felt like wait a minute wait a minute you ... you know you got the better weapons in Kansas City all due respect to the Andre hobbies you have a better smattering of weapons you've got the Andy Reid effect and and and then I resolved it by saying this\nIf you flip ... Watson and remember remind her mom's he traded up and I could have taken off and he took my own if you flip Watson for moms\nMaybe it's a no brainer for Watson because maybe eighty read and and the tire retail and Travis jealousy and Sammy Watson's in Kareem Hunt maybe that maybe that helps I still I still lean moms but it you know it's an interesting out in the universe theory on what Watson would be in Kansas City and what the homes would be in Houston\nIt is but but think about this thing about what we're seeing as we watch\nOffice has expanded okay ah the touch that made them to start the fourth quarter I wasn't really logging play by play both pretty darn close to it when uh the under ... catches crossing route on the far side like when the TV camera a behind the go along so then goes up the far side life with a touchdown\nThey play for a second\nThat play starlet so to speak to the back or I Believe was Miller of the of some end around action to freeze the line backers it looks so much like the Kansas City chiefs play\nThat you're probably doing All right well I think he's a very good coach or said he did it obviously in college he moved back to Georgia Tech there there's a lot of support either we're going to marry the guy who really had a good sense for creative op eds\nThat think you're starting to see some of that now that's why I mentioned just in passing I think that injury to vote for if that is an ACL is being recorded I think it would be such a big interview because he he on that plane\nBy going deep and his speed and getting down the field is something that show up as\nThe creativity getting there and he's getting people being around I challenge much better at city top to bottom but I I think bill Brian's got to do things with strong and and continue to grow that we were to heck with time the league incidents talk about this all the time\nYou're listening to a um Thirteen twenty W.

of all they did in fact\nA get out of it and now it will be brought cold water on New Year's and Jackie Bradley junior coming to the plate for the red Sox and the top half of the third thing on the game is at Dodger Stadium\nSo therefore the Dodgers will get the final batch regardless and they're doing three straight games there like they are they were the NBA Finals I mean\nDo you like the two two and then one on one or do you like the two three and two I mean what are you trying to save a couple of bucks on travel expenses really\nAt this point in time what trying to trying to save on the travel these guys fly first class trip from Boston out to LA you know five six hours give them an extra day off in between uh if you need if you want to do it that way but the two three two I don't know or the pendulum can shift\nIf indeed it's the home team that when you get built from the Dodgers who are down to oh\nTo or possibly if they'd played well our own won all three games here's the thing the Dodgers are going to have to wait at least one game\nA at Fenway Park and the red socks this year we're a hundred and AIDS and fifty four you double fifty four that gives you a hundred made what that means is two out of every three games\nBoston a win win win loss when when loss when when last you get the idea\nSo like writing standards on the blackboard as the repetition of over and over and over again and that's exactly what this team has done\nThroughout the course of the year I was watching the game I was saying to a friend I said when the red Sox beat the Dodgers you they rallied a little bit but aid to force not close sorry\nWhen they won on Wednesday really wasn't as close as you may think\nReally wants to take this was a close game this is what makes the red Sox such a good team the Dodgers are going well Walker dealer pitched a the game of his life and he's got such a bright future\nBut he's not factored into this decision all you could conjure him up and I know Dodger fans going to say we really got the guy one run will look who you're facing the red Sox are the Alabama\nOf major league baseball there the patriots of major league baseball\nI'm not talking in terms of all they won four or five national championships or World Series says no I'm Talking this year when you play Alabama you have to play nearly flawless football you can't be you know not protecting the quarterbacks Blind Side you can't just be shocking it up and the double coverage\nYou can't you\nGet one mistake to tops out of Boston and the game\nWas it a mistake the Peterson I think it was the better hit or is it a mistake the Jackie Bradley junior I Believe more so great hit by Bradley junior he planted I think that just came down twenty five seconds ago buddy absolutely tattooed that ball was warm precedent Peterson's\nRegardless on Ron is on his own run but more of a mistake if you will than what we're seeing\nMeanwhile you have to against Boston having three four

talks great great way to about this dark significant to be a player who plays for the most unique franchise approach sport there were so\nDown in the weeds on this week to week in which inside life hacker is going to be out and has its impact this game and all that stuff\nYou know police self pack this franchise is ridiculous in this day and age it's owned by the by the shareholders and all that stuff that you all know about but\nWe forget that an errand takes an appreciation that when he goes out on the field with shark is the legacy of all the Packers lumbar twelve sixty five of the body avenues street address to the stadium\nUm it's following him that legacy of great quarterbacks great players that play for the people at a unique situation without a Super Bowl trophy\nCheck it more I think he understands it and when he signed his contract this kind of you know what you're going to be a Packer for life and for ever as long as they play football in Green Bay people are going to go to that stadium where number twelve\nI pick them to make it to the super bowl this year now they've they've had a rough time in part because Rogers had that knee injury back in week one they got their work cut out for them this weekend do they face the rams and the ... defense that when he was with the Broncos in twenty Fifteen of Sunday night's game\nThey held Aaron Rodgers the Seventy seven passing yards I don't think I Would take the under on Seventy seven for Sunday just show you when you when you combine the rams off fence with one way to Philips has done against the Mike mccarthy is in the past ... this is going to be a real challenge and if they win this game it's going to be Aaron Rodgers with another virtuoso performance\nIt would it would have to be you know and Fisher rams team has a little bit of doubts forum chief so may be just as important as bad as what they can do to parents who we might cutting the defense of courted this year after all those years dumb Cape resort and the defense\nCan most guys take another not to step up in what I think he's become a very fascinating division the NFC North but\nRanch is look they look like a ... where you're at the Breeders' Cup next week I might they look about a wink and a half to two white the front of the length and a half in front of everybody else\nAh with the same right on their heels a next in the race but I Love watching the rams are what they do and how they're doing it\nAnd then the parents which was supposed to be great remember those cornerback injuries going into the Thursday night or Minnesota as they get better back there uh I think they're going to continue to get better so that for some reason my or not\nHaving as to how long can the rams go undefeated conversation\nBut I Know they've got the Kansas it again in Mexico city coming up there and do a month but maybe it's time to start thinking about how how people can arrange take this after seven of those start because I mean most folks think they're the ... early ... favorite to win again this week do you get halfway through the schedule that loss\nAnd you mentioned the saints they'll get a chance to\nMove to six in one on Sunday night against the Vikings and then it's saints rams next week and all the NFC West to get together and I think that book I just ask is still end up the number one seed because the only I can beat the rams ...\nBut I I agree with you the rams have quietly gotten to seven to know and we're not having a conversation about sixteen oh because it does feel premature\nBut the way the rams have played if they can keep their core players healthy they could they could go\nWell beyond ten oh and maybe make it you know one of those things where hey we've got everything locked up do we do to build polling and pulled out all of our starters and and give up a game in a week sixteen or Seventeen or do we do for days they may be in that dilemma when the end of the season rolls around\nWhy we're a long way would not I don't think Trump McVeigh and that group would do that or I did watch a little bit of them on the NFL game pass it just really is as you know\nWhen those four o'clock games get played weren't scramble mode were a kid ready for the show and you kind of watching the league games with one eye and then turning away and they're coming back a dominant in to play and Donald obviously for sex last week\nAnd those guys are playing on that side and you know for for all the talk of all the office of weapons around the league and rightfully ship so to Sean Watson\nA last night and the Andrea hop to last night and the fuller injury is going to be a killer for those guys I think is anybody talking about tiger early I mean you you mentioned with your parents the oh by the way it three touchdowns all they've been guys one shy of Jim Brown is all time record for the most touch goes\nTotal touch downs in the first seven games because he's he's having a phenomenal year\nAnd just not getting the pub with the headlines perhaps conversation nationally like Patrick my homes are certainly folks just putting them on their it'd be ... to be a week to week uh and just do a poll on that almost every week but I just think he's been terrific in a day's work with conversation a bigger conversation going forward here that extreme which\nI agree with you might we were talking about this early in the week I think it comes down to ... and Todd girlie one's going to be the MVP and the other one's going to be offensive player of the year and anybody can never understand how that works but that's why [laughter]\nHey I'm picking out and do that on my ballot more than a couple of [laughter] you know what they they both it's like the best supporting actress are supporting actor you got to get more support they're doing\nFine I've got another ballot for you and this is a question that's posed to me and the first down we're talking about the Texans in to show 'em Watson looking a lot like the guy he was last year stats asked me this and we put it out on Twitter and we can find it to the next five years who do you want between patrimony judicial watch\n\nI'll start by saying\nI'll take the one you don't take it'd be very happy with it because I Love 'em both of them both as a player as soon as individuals being around\nThe Sean last year and I'm listening to Patrick but listen to what everyone's set or Sunday night boat with a great kid and you gotta come through that when he talked to his parents and hear all that stuff you know that\nRocket arm is is really really intriguing and he doesn't seem to do nearly as much of it on the move\nI'm I'm Still torn about this Mike\n... the the quarterbacks who are the mobile quarterback and and the same homes is not but the shots and all that so much more of his game right now\nAh this was the early part of last year before the seal close quarterbacks always worry me about them getting hurt 'em [noise]\nI'm having a hard 'cause I don't have a great answer I probably lean towards my homes because that natural huge arm is such a difference maker actually on the podcast Rogers has great comments on watching my homes and what do you think the one which is\nPretty cool to hear and you were in the meeting with us last week you know we didn't get it on the air but when we had our conversation about Patrick my homes I wanted to show\nThe end of the Sunday night game with Kansas City anyway 'cause I thought as soon as that game and the forty three forty wild game when Tom Brady sprinted sprinted over to shake Patrick homes hand\nThat was that was almost like McCain meeting somebody and say you know what you're part of the club to me that was the ultimate sign of respect that I think everybody who's played against him has come away with a while so I I all we mow homes over what to but I'm happy to take your left over\nOh and let me tell you I went instantly Patrick moms and then the more it's like wait a minute wait a minute you ... you know you got the better weapons in Kansas City all due respect to the Andre hobbies you have a better smattering of weapons you got the Andy Reid effect and and and then I resolved it by saying this\nIf you flip my homes and Watson memory I took my harms he traded up and I could have taken off and he took on if you flip Austin from Homs\nMaybe it's a no brainer for Watson because maybe Andy Reid and the and the pie retail and Travis ... maybe that maybe that helps I still I still lean more homes but it you know it's an interesting out in the universe theory on what Watson would be in Kansas City and what my homes would be in Houston\nIt is but but thinking about this thinking about what we're seeing as we watch\nAll fences expand Medicaid or the touch that maybe the start the fourth quarter I wasn't really logging play by play be pretty darn close to it when uh the under ... catches crossing route on the far side like in a TV camera a behind the go along so then goes up the far side like touchdown point for second\nPlace started richer the fake to the back or I Believe was Miller of the of some end around action to freeze the line backers it looks so much like the Kansas City chiefs play\nThat you're probably ... well I think is a very good coach a grade he did it obviously in college he moved back to Georgia Tech that lots of coordinator George O'Leary even the guy who really had a good sense for creative office I think you're starting to see some of that\nNow that's why I mentioned just in passing I think that injury to vote for if that is an ACL as as being reported it would be such a big injury because he he on that plate cleared everybody out by going deep and his speed and getting\nDown the field is something that's so important to that office\nBut the creativity is getting there in Houston with the people being around I talents much better in Kansas City top to bottom but er I I think bill Brian's got to do some things with Sean but and and continue to grow that we were at a ... a heck of a time the league you and soon to talk about this all the time\nWhat what a good time with all these young quarterbacks three years ago I felt like oh my gosh ... what are we going to do and Brady is Don breeze Brady and Rogers and rock was virtually slight lesser

[noise]\n\nWhat makes like floor you'll be worried about [noise]\nSports where\nWe have had the gun and as soon as for the Texans bad news for the Miami Dolphins [noise] sections when their fifth game in twenty six days pulling off the forty two twenty three when over the dolphins self is a really now they've started three you know [noise]\nAnd now for and for [noise]\nThe Texans after starting photo and three are looking good\nThe AFC South into Sean Watson the at one of his twenty Seventeen nights\nFive touchdown passes dies a career I ... I Know you have earned dear nickname and managed to retain it even though from time to time Ive questioned your statistical prowess you've got one in here that really raised my eyebrows\nShown Watson has thirty four touchdown passes in his first Fifteen games second of all time ahead of Dan Marino surely that's a misprint like ... it is not a ... situation that is the fact\nThat's pretty impressive and see we haven't really\nPraised is shown Watson this year like we should because it was all Patrick my homes out of the gates andme homes became the twenty Eighteen version of the show Watson and ... and it looked like himself early on and the Texans look bad early on and now that they have\nFound that gas pedal and it started sluggish like that over time when the late in overtime over the colds to get their first victory of the season and then the\nOvertime win over the cowboys fueled by a bad decision by Jason Garrett and then a sluggish went over the Buffalo Bills you know the first truly impressive game came five days ago in Jacksonville and then last night and prime time they showed up\nThe only bad news for the Texans it looks like receiver will fall or as a torn ACL this was a good night for the Texans now they get their mini by and they get to keep building on the things that they did and remember they re told the off chance after last season\nTo make it better suited to the Sean walks and so a little bit of work in progress early in the year and you know he hadn't done much\nSince tearing his ACL\nAnd\nNext up trip to Denver and nine days remains to be seen whether or not the shah watts will be able to take that trip by plane or by bus\nSo long bus ride to Denver from Houston longer than the twelve hours from Houston to Jacksonville remember he's got this chest rib\nLong an injury that kept him from flying five days ago by week after the trip to Denver then they go to Washington all of a sudden that's a heck of a game of Washington keeps winning Monday Night or against Tennessee\nBrowns and colds come to town go to the jets go to the eagles and finish the seasonal hurricane the Jacksonville Jaguars they can be on their way\nWith the titans and the jaguars both under five hundred the Texans could be on their way\nHow good is this often to Sean wants an answer that question after the game steps for the answer that question every day\nHe was often assume the various both of a sudden we can do a lot of good things but a lot of points on the war so I was you know we're all on the same page and everyone's quick and then you know we don't have any turnovers in November these or it can be very responsive and that's what we're shows and I\nFinally now here's what's weird Watson was sixteen of twenty for two hundred and thirty nine yards\nAnd more than half of the artist came on two of his five touchdown passes a forty nine year old and a Seventy three are made it sound like he was throwing the ball over the place and let's see two thirty nine about about twenty he's averaging eleven point nine five per attempt they just didn't throw the ball very much\nBut he completed sixteen twenty that's eighty percent the dolphins defenses\nKind of in shambles\nI was listening to some of Adam gay says press conference before the show and he was asked about defense coordinator Matt Burke whether his job is in any sort of jeopardy\nShould I haven't even thought about that yet I don't see that happening that's not the strongest endorsement I don't see that happening I mean is it going to happen or it's not and you're the one who's going to make the decision I don't see that happening\nHe and and he's got the extra days now ... does to\nFigure out what he needs to change but he mentioned that they are giving up massive amounts of yard urging their own game\nSo\nLook I it it looked like this was going to be a different dolphins team based upon the first three weeks based on the last five\nThis feels a lot like last year's team and and I don't know how they beat the bears I mean they could be three and five they pulled off that whenever the bears that in hindsight maybe that was the aberration\n... while I was Twenty one for thirty seven two hundred and forty yards and one interception there was a touchdown pass last night for the dolphins but it came from ... to Kenyan Drake\nDon't tape Parker one of the few healthy receivers he woke up for six catches a hundred and thirty four yards if they're thinking about trading him now's the time to sell sell high\n... high just like frozen concentrated orange juice Drake had to get to thirty seven yards drinking Gore Frank Gore future hall of famer I Believe split the carries on the ground both over fifty yards but how about\nGore trying to get a pass interference call on a ball behind a line of scrimmage come on Frank\nHey when when you're when you've lost four out of five you do whatever you can't the mark Miller had a hundred and thirty three rushing yards for the Houston Texans on Eighteen Gary Seven point for me it's just like whatever they were doing last night work does everything worked\nWhen you're averaging seven point for yards per carrier for your starting running back and eleven point nine five per pass attempt everything's working\nStats get a question if the Sean Watson continued to play like this and like he did last year and I gave you the option\nWho would you rather have the Sean Watson or Patrick all bombs so I'd stop whoa valid fast yeah mom's\nReally yeah why so quick I don't know I'm a prisoner of the moment [laughter]\nWell that's just showing it through five touchdowns last night\nOkay maybe I'm not a prisoner of the moment no I I just I'd\nWant ... I still I bought them both right [laughter]\nYou may want us to start or and one of the backup but yeah I Am right now\nLook when he says I don't see any more trade but then again I didn't see the one we made that means the doors open for someone\nTo make an offer that would cause them to say well you're going to get into this for Derrick car really you can have given his district will adjust Emily really you can have him be given at this for Bruce serving really you can have it and I think that's the message any under scored it in a roundabout way\nThe store is open and anything you want if you make an offer we like you got\nYeah I I mean I don't disagree it's kind of cryptic language their right to just leave the leave the door cracked a little like\nI don't think we're making any trades but this could happen in\nA correct It's not even ... you're on your it is a make us an offer yes and the same thing you know again it's you know I I I don't mean to say this but I'm saying it's just I don't know what to believe outta there right now especially with\nYou know just some of the things Jon has said over the last few weeks and months so uh it is a very weird situation with the Derek car thing um you know ... what is his status in the locker room other thing I'll say to Mike that's just kind of a you know this report that came from the athletic right I Can't remember the writer's name that\nReported on the Derek car situation is Thompson I can write Marcus Thompson a second I'm I'm interested to know that this come from a player\nDid this come from the coaches 'cause that's that's the main would be a lot different if it came from the coaches\nThen and they kind of painted on the locker room that wagon that phrase\nAnd then that's a totally different story though that that would tell me that man there is definitely some questions within that organization about Derek car his future and that maybe the coaches don't agree with his leadership and the way he goes about things so I I'm just the ... to see where it goes\nWell the locker room was open on Wednesday three players spoke that means there's forty nine others not named Derek car who have yet to address this publicly but up to three who spoke and they may have been hand picked for this purpose all three defended Derek car or Sean Melvin\nNot over the top and his defense Jody Nelson a little bit ...\nStrongest voiced by far was veteran tight and leave Smith here he is taking up for Derrick car on Wednesday\nAll these reports about this locker room being a fractured would their car is the most obnoxious and ridiculous thing I've heard\nIt or to the point to where it's comical laughable that I'm even sitting here talking about it the regardless of what face he makes after attack hole or or or what everybody wants to dive into it and then we're him out about attacking his character attacking him as a leader on his football teams that joke\nSmith also addressed the specific question of whether or not Derek car is affected by the reports that have emerged here's what Smith had to say\nBush human beings we're not robots okay he's he's and he's got a wonderful record as a starting quarterback for the open writers that's hard enough on him much less you know him warned about his two sons you know happening to see an article that he's not tough I mean it's it's just it's it's ridiculous [noise] so um [noise]\nOf course has bothered him he's human I'm human um I I don't want people bashing me all over the Internet for my friends and family to see you know so um\n[noise] one last thing on his Chris car addressed reporters yesterday he had already engaged this issue on Twitter\nClaiming that he didn't cry when he injured his arm against the sea hawks in London and he said yesterday I broke my back I broke my ankle I didn't cry then my trainer texted me some pictures of me making the same face so I guess I cry when I trained to and that's what this all comes from the video that shows him\nMaking that pain face that that you see kids make when they're like crying and sobbing and it just was kind of odd but that's been the thing that\nThat was locked onto by Marcus Thompson the second of the athletic as evidence of the raiders players losing faith in their car\nAnd up here we go we've got three guys defending him forty nine of yet to be heard from I have a feeling we'll be hearing from from more of them as time goes by but unless this report was completely and totally fabricated you got to believe there's something there from someone who was willing to speak without putting their name\nTo yeah I I definitely there's gotta be something there yes I Would agree with that I'm not going to question Derrick cars toughness again I mean he was my up for the game two years ago right when they lost the or they were playing the Indianapolis Colts\nAnd he broke his leg during that game and we got to hear it and live action and I mean he handled it like a man for lack of a better phrase okay he was tough football player he literally was like oh it's broke it's broke my leg it's broke I mean that's what he did he didn't cry for that\nOkay yeah he makes his face when he went through the gather oh I I don't know what to say\nYeah OK it looks a little crybaby issue but he's not crying and I'll second this just in the defense of Derek car I've been out there for training camp a few times in Oakland over the last few years and the Derek ... era\nAnd I just I have a hard time believing that the players don't like Derek car or don't trust in him I mean he's really got a great way about him he loves football you know watching them through practice like I did\nUh the team as a as a whole seems to respect him and like his energy and what he brings to the table so again I think that's where I question that this come from the players\nOr did this come from the coaches who are not happy with something that I think that's the big thing I Would like to know at the end of the day just what faction of the organization that came from because I feel like if it was from the players Marcus Thompson would've quoted as\nA player on the team who wanted to go and not um is what does that not sat here and just you know reading the tea leaves it makes me believe that it came from somebody else and uh I came from somebody else then that's going to be a big issue\nWhy why is it a big issue became in somebody else in there you suggesting it came from John Gurdon\nWell I'm just suggesting that maybe it came from any coach or maybe somebody in the front office or something like that and it just goes into sometimes of what perception ... can become reality in a real hurry in the NFL I Know that I've experienced that and yes when\nIt's different from when the players might be saying something and questioning it when the coaches are saying something like that usually\nTheir minds are already made up then they've already put them in that box of all he's not tough and he ... he doesn't lead the way and you really can't even get out of that box what'd you get put there so that's where I Would say\nIt's just interesting conversation and I wish Marcus Thompson the second would let us know at least that part of it did it come real player or did it come from\nAnother anonymous source within the organization\nAnd here's the quote that I think raised the most eyebrows from the article written by Marcus Thompson the second of the athletic they saw his face they heard his whimper they witness Tim explain on the sidelines they assuredly watched it again in film session it's hard to see how Derek car can lead this team again\nSo strong stuff and they get an opportunity on Sunday when the ...\nTo lead to follow to galvanize the team around and behind it Derrick car and I don't see a middle ground here Chris they come out and and score already five against the colds or it's going to be like it was in London where they could be

know getting a couple of kids who are still wet behind the years\nGo ahead so unbelievable there's no doubt and talked to\nA fair amount about that does wake my you know the the the big caper us out you know today is a\nIs a major major practice day for the Vikings because we're Rosen happening bar and I've been practicing this way when ball ... has been limited but I Do believe he will play it's um it's good the Vikings got Riley ... back\nTo ah to most likely play tackle I'm helping cooks not practice saying you know and they get back and we're we're banged up at a time really key spots

going to start and you're like the first fence a vendor run out of the titles but but I Do believe he will be sprinkled in serendipitous nature of this is the third guy replacing them to do than whether early it's gotten really good and\nYou know we we have a sense of wind coach and Andre Paterson I I'm just flabbergasted not received an opportunity to become a defensive or Nader and they got a bell so good\nWith so many players like ... step into one adult or some of these young for draft guide is assistant Robert Rodriguez just get the most out of them and they've\nDone it recently it was a good weather away\nYou know in the office assigned the ball Christians off of the opinion yesterday that the Vikings aren't as good as they were last year but with her cousins there's a greater capability to make great plays when needed is that a fair assessment\nIt's an a plus tank\nNow twenty Seventeen Mike the Vikings were Lebanon one when they ran for one hundred yards are more and obviously they did that three quarters of the city's been without the Alvin ... off so they run in game has been more potent of weight but it's not like it was last year conversely cut out the way\nThe way cousins is able to sprinkle it can ... down the field compared to what we had last year I mean well big deal and one from time magazine ... consecutive out what the one hundred yards a game and step on\nGet get attention getting every week from corners and said it open things for Adam that the tide and Rudolph is underrated they're getting a call from ... tried well the guy they picked up all work Robinson as for catches and three ...\nGod has been worth every penny\nAnd then he had the kids from Canada who's starting to show up on the field\nWhat you get with that big a deal struck the CFL guy oh yeah that one reception that one kid in front of Alexander for say\nLet me tell you he's he's show when we're up there trying to cap a that was the bus but they really liked this guy and you know behind gigs and feel and there's a real question the best quality and I'm I'm waiting to see if someone emerges as a reliable target Robinson's been doing trend while when he's able to actually catch the ball is good there's still strict can add to it but\nYou know if if they would if you're talking about injuries I don't want to jinx anybody but if the owner digs would go down there would be a major problem one that biking fence\nYou can say that for a lot of teams around the NFL Michael I mean if Antonio Brown or Judy Smith goes down that path in my piece grows so out of the Vikings are very fortunate to have a couple of high end to require a lot of attention and walk came back the\nJets game to look first time and maybe ten years I've been doubled king two guys on a bunch of ways and\nBecause of that Robinson was able to or we were able to run okay so I'll be curious to see what Mr Dennis Allen does this weekend [noise]\nYou know I Know you're in capable of being objective and I'm going to get a Homer ish response here view true purple colored glasses but for to unwind couple of games coming up here said science I think we're going to learn a lot about this Vikings team over the next two weeks\n[laughter] well I think we learned a lot about this came when they went to Philadelphia because after\nAbout a half or that awful\nI'm inexplicable bills last you know then they go to LA and they lose the shootout eye off the off as look really good at LA\nThe whole thing was at a crossroads so you're going to fill it out yeah I Know both Arnie successful right now as they were last year it's still incredibly difficult to when they're on the team out there you go to three points that after I found a way to win the game so that that was the turning point moment\nNow the fact that the Vikings ... the crowd on their side Sunday night will help injuries quite honestly are stuck in right now and out of the week after that we get Detroit and ... and\nThis is not Detroit man is undefeated\nWhen we got on a new way to Hawaii and who have\nPets right the the the lions are to us banks stadium and that will not be an easy win then comes to buy and it sounds

great to um\nTo get to make up for lost time were bred because uh you know he meant a lot for me and my development as fire\nThe voice of Aaron Rodgers talking about his relationship with Brett Farr from the ... to recover part cat episode three my kid you not the bar a little bit higher with your gas for your pod cast\nPoint regarding shelter sketched one because I did start\nRogers pretty good guess three end up on this one too so we're golf\nShe supports golf at all it's too so the guess three and a little sleepy al Michaels next week\nWhat was your big take away from the conversation with Aaron Rodgers\nHe is so comfortable being who he is and I mean that in every way as a football player a as a star athlete I I don't know my how much you've been around there and talk to him\nHe always struck me as one of the smartest athletes in sports or he's got a great perspective\nYou're really good context answers questions when he can er and answers from as fully as he can but also as comfortable as spot as one of the great players in the league considering it's\nA position that was very difficult to attain because of the stuff he was putting soundbite where it's so it's hard to be\nA superstar athlete in Green Bay a such a small town a hundred and Seventy a hundred thousand and to me he does it matter because uh they really as it all figured out so full comfortable with who he is what he's doing\nHe's got a complicated legacy though based upon what he's done so far in his career because he's been such a great player one of the best quarterbacks of all time one Super Bowl appearance one Super Bowl when Sims\nIs a very very strong Aaron Rodgers that Iraq does that get to the point where he's critical of coach Mike mccarthy critical of the fence critical the Packers for not putting it up around him\nTo allow writing fast when when you when you talk about how smart guy Aaron Rodgers is and I believe you he is I don't know how at some level he's just not tormented by the fact that hey if I was in New England\nHow many rings when I had if I was playing with Andy Reid how many rings when I have\nHow much am I being held back here by the quality of the the defense the quality of the fence the plays that we run the theories and the philosophy that we employ how much does that keeping me from being what I could be by way of a guy who is viewed as one of the all time greats\nYeah Mike you know a Mike mccarthy ... when I used to go in there on the Monday nights and talk to my he'd be pretty clear about what the actors were or will be very draft and develop organization which means\nWe'll translate into more simple terms they don't fit into the free agent pool nearly as often it can start to see you know this year was a little bit more than they have the test\nAnd that's a that's a problem I think we've seen that with Aaron Rodgers has gone down you know in terms of how much he is a one person it's just not sure on the on\nThe Green Bay side those guys would tell you you know we we were we were solid building's foundation here we continue to contend we have a really dropped off for most of the last twenty five years of course the quarterbacks part of that or they drafted both of those guys and develop both those guys\nAnd systemically McCarthy came and it took me to another level but to the Rogers point yeah I'm sure there are times he says and boy I Wish I was somewhere where\nWe can get this toy that toy and go do more but\nI think when you listen to the podcast too if you a chance downloaded he talks great great length about this dark significant to be a player who plays for the most unique franchises pro sport there were so\nDown in the weeds on this week to week in which the inside live heck who's going to be out and has its impact this game and all that stuff\nYou know police self Pak Mrs franchises ridiculous in this day and age it's owned by the by their shareholders shit and all that stuff that you all know about but\nWe forget that an error and takes an appreciation that when he goes out on the field with shark is the legacy of all the Packers lumbar twelve sixty five and body avenues street address to the stadium\nUm it's following and that legacy of great quarterbacks great players that play for the people in a unique situation without a Super Bowl trophy I think it might have checked it more\nI think he understands it and when he signed a contract that's kind of you know what you're going to be a Packer for license for ever as long as they play football in Green Bay people are going to go to that stadium where number twelve\nI pick them to make it to the super bowl this year now they've they've had a rough time in part because Rogers had that knee injury back in week one they got their work cut out for them this weekend do they face the rams and Wade Phillips defense\nThat when he was with the Broncos then twenty Fifteen of us on Sunday night game they held Aaron Rodgers the Seventy seven passing yards I don't think I Would take the under on Seventy seven\nFor Sunday it was just show when when you combine the rams often with one way to Philips has done against the Mike mccarthy is in the past ... this is going to be a real challenge and if they win this game it's going to be Aaron Rodgers with another virtuoso performance\nThat it would have to be you know and visual rams team has a little bit of doubts forum chief so may be just as important as bad as what they can do to my cutting the defense of court in this year after all those years bumped capers or the parents\nCan those guys take another not to step up in what I think has become a very fascinating\nAnd see north but ranch is look it looks like a what we get the Breeders' Cup next week I might say look about white the half the to the front of their life and a half in front of everybody else\nOr with the saints right on their heels a next in the race but I Love watching the rams are what they do and how they're doing it and the defense which was supposed to be great remember had those cornerback injuries going into the Thursday night or Minnesota\nAs they get better back there uh I think they're going to continue to get better so that for some reason my or not\nHaving this you know how long can the rams go undefeated conversation\nBut I Know they've got the Kansas and again in Mexico city coming up there and do a month but maybe it's time to start thinking about how how deep can the rams take this after seven of those start because I mean most folks think they're the only good favorite to win again this week to get halfway through the scheduled at a loss\nAnd you mentioned the saints they'll get a chance to\nMove to six in one on Sunday night against the Vikings and then it's saints rand's next week and all the NFC West to get together and I think that you look at the same can still end up the number one scene because only hey could beat the rams ... but I I agree with you\nThe rams of quietly gotten to seven and out and we're not having a conversation about sixteen oh because it does feel premature but the way the rams have played if they can keep their core players healthy\nWhen you\nHear the familiar wild horses you love and remember your voice is a one that can speak for wildlife and so the land they call home ensuring that it stays forever wild

for\nJerry Jones was uncharacteristically silent after the loss of Washington and then he canceled his local radio appearance he does Tuesdays and Fridays on one five three the fan I assume in hindsight that was simply I'm Ari Cooper related is there any other reason why he would have fallen so quiet\nAfter that game and stayed quiet into the middle of the week\n[noise] well I wouldn't think anything of it it it he had talked after the game because they are by week and it usually goes in Missouri to his house he has there some bigger and he's in Missouri and and probably just wants to be on vacation and doesn't want to be fathers this week uh for an football\nRelated talk after the game on Sunday so then that makes it very curious because he he doesn't do that\nAnd so the whole thing now you're like OK why the talk which obviously be the next question I guess the next people to talk to them will be\nOne of five three next week on on Tuesday presuming he's back during his regular show a and talks I'm sure they will ask him why he didn't talk this week and it could be something as simple as a vacation but it is curious that he didn't talk after Sunday's game on top of not being on his radio show\nMe wants to Cooper trade went down I thought okay he just didn't want to be asked a bunch of questions that accidentally say something to screw it all up or maybe get accused of tampering but that snap infraction saying you know part of me thought maybe he's just trying not to give himself in a position where he gets fined by the league again for saying something you shouldn't have said because of that ridiculous penalty\nThey kept the cowboys for potentially forcing overtime\n[laughter] yeah it could absolutely be staff infraction you're right it could be the mark Cooper tray just not wanting to give that away or if he doesn't want to answer questions inevitable questions\nAbout Jason Garrett Jaycee Garrett's future that he's tired of talking about that does it again probably want to say something stupid because maybe is considering getting rid of it if they don't turn this thing around and and have some consistency the rest of the season maybe that is on his mind and maybe he didn't want to say anything or in haste and emotion\nAfter that game that bad to he would regret later and and uh after having second thoughts\nEspecially when the cowboys have the ball at Washington's thirty seven was fifty two seconds left him one time out and they don't go for the when they settle for field goal position and ultimately they weren't in feel both position the coup or trade you know\nOne of my initial reaction after I'd I said you know first picks too much to give up regardless of what you give up to now he's on the team and the fact that you gave up the first round pick creates a greater\nUrgency to get production out of them I think it puts so much pressure on Jason Garrett on tech Prescott I I think this could blow up on them because now the constant questions going to be why aren't you using a mark Cooper more how are you incorporate them into the office why isn't this happening why is it that\nHappening I mean that could end up being the thing that forces Jason Garrett's ten year with the cowboys to ahead\nYeah no question and you're having jak Prescott forced passes into\nA mark Cooper when maybe he's not open and that's the other thing because he's going to feel so much crush or get the ball to mark Cooper so all of those things are going to play into this and how quickly say is doing a great job after a week learn in the office but how much the opposite skinny learn now\nHe's obviously staying around this week to work with with dad Prescott over the weekend\nBut how much can he get timing down and only a few days how much can you learn to play book and only a few days and and and they are pressed they get an answer on how good is he is he a feature receiver moving forward or is he Roy Williams\nDo we want to give it a big deal or are not\nAnd and so they're going to have to have some answers by the end here on that and they may not get them on the fifth season trades as we know frequently don't work out and so they're hoping this all works out and they know something by the end of the year but there there's probably a pretty good chance they're not going to know very much about a mark Cooper by the end of the year\nYou know Jerry Jones has said multiple times a day Prescott his his guy but I I think if you apply the sodium pentothal or maybe copious amounts of Johnny Walker black he\nWould admit that he would take Patrick ... homes or just showing Watson over deck Prescott straight up right now and I say that because after Watson's performance last night with five touchdown passes and given the way my homes is played\nToday to everyone who would you rather have for the next five years to Sean Watson or Patrick my home Shereen how would you resolve that one\nOh my goodness what question\nI think they would matter though what came I was on what our weapons were but\nHow do you go against Patrick houses with what he's done this year I just think you've seen enough from him to think that he's going to be a ... is the better quarterback but having said better I think we could have a Tom Brady Peyton Manning thing moving forward you know where we have to really great quarterbacks\nGoing at it for for years in trade mandate pie and everything else that those two guys it could be really fun between these two quarterbacks away they're both playing and and I know what Shon ... has done and and caring that ACL he's only got to get better\nAs he goes along as that need and prove it takes a year to year yet and yet he's playing like he is so I think he's only going to get better back stay with colleagues do at home just this point\nOne stats pose that question to me last hour knee jerk reaction was my homes but I I went through the same thing you did like wait a minute the weapons are better in Kansas City in automatically a few swap Watson from homes\nThat if it walks into a no brainer and homes the guy that you kind of have to talk to herself into it so I I think both guys are going to be great I liked the Peyton Manning Tom Brady thing the NFL is looking for another rivalry like that\nThey're in the same conference not the same division so they will come across each other plenty of times but not twice a year so it's not over done I like where this rivalry can go and uh I I think ... gonna win for now but I think over time the pendulum swing back\nTo watch it All right trained great stuff as always thanks for your time we'll talk to you again soon\nThanks night\nRight there ... Williams debate insight on what's going on with the cowboys and I really do think that this is that\nThat Cooper trade is that thing that is going to secure Jason Garrett's future or bring his career in Dallas to win and I really could see that I don't I'm not rooting for it I like to be right so I like\nI like to be justified when I think something's gonna happen I think this is going to fall apart in Dallas with Cooper I think the fence is going to get worse not better but we'll see what plays out time for a break where more to come here on the best or pro football talk live on NBC Sports radio\nPlay coaches the USC Trojans and you're listening to NBC Sports radio [noise]\nOnly one radio station in Wisconsin and with the job\nIf you suffer from E.

today three could pose he played just beautifully\nWith only four strings and afterward during a little speech he said you know it's really amazing how much music you can make with what you have left and that's how we get past the market goes down it doesn't matter we look at it as being a long term thing\nWe context recast we have a ... a lot of ... we\nContext recast but we look at everything as part of a mosaic and which we just have to stay the course and keep doing what we're doing and not make really stupid decisions for example what if the people totally got market where they tried to time the market well you would have missed march night two thousand Nineteen and which are ... up by Jim you\nProbably know more than I Do about this but a two hundred and twenty percent since ... two thousand Nineteen what if we went all in during the wrong time\nSaying we are just nine of two thousand nine two thousand I by mistake yes you're right ...\nYeah All right so the key is staying the course and you know I Know on as a\nFinancial advisor I feel like I'm a psychologist cause I'm constantly dealing with the emotions of my clients and\nThe thing is it's really easy for me to be on emotional will money that is not mine but even as a financial advisor knowing all the right things I find my mind pulling me to maybe do things that I wouldn't advise my clients to do what do you call that\nThat's just the emotional part of the day we talked about last time why smart people make mistakes of the money where they react to weather vagaries are happening in the market that's why people can't invest on the road\nThat flight every advisor out there really has to be as much psychologist as they do have to be advisor because you're the one that told me many times to this is a long term process or which we're trying to hit a goal of the future and if we can just keep ourselves calm and not\nBe emotional about things that were built it the much better one of my favorite boxers is about ... ... oh yeah well what you don't know about Mohammed Ali as he was facing Sunday list another ring or the very early part of his career at what she was known as\nCassius Clay well Sunday list it was four inches taller had a three inch longer outreach and cash was getting polarized by a stronger faster bigger guy or the bell rang they went down the his end of the rain ... grew up in the ... financial is it\nA set of cash to get out there ... you're going to be to\nJust do one more around these I quit I'm not going to go out there is over I mean actually started taking the gloves off where the bell rang and as soon as that happened is see grow up and and who are daddy took his chair out which by the could sit down game in the end up\nBack which they had to take one step forward this illicit side spread all white town which meant they threw defied caches one later became Mohammed Ali or the rest is history so a lot of this is just going around is taking that motions out at the Pentagon your financial advisor to do what's right for you because you're so emotional and here so\nPassionate about things that you need to have the mindset\nOf results focussed school the future\nAnd set of what's happening right now which is the ...\nSo how do people change their mind set from six to be more of that results orientated and keeping their eye on the prize\nYeah a couple of really good technique step for one is set one three five your investment goals and or to focus on the outcomes\nAnd about three and this is a big one this is the most important one this is called media rewards immediate reward so every time something\nHappens that basically major discipline so for example one of the hardest thing for people to do is either for like a a despot so you put six thousand dollars in or maybe you're older you could put Eighteen thousand dollars at at every month you do that the reward yourself or do I get you treat yourself to a weekend you're with your wife you go on a retreat you go to a to a play a movie but\nYou have to do what's called an immediate reward for every investment decision you make the next thing is we have to focus on outcomes or what things are going to feel like so on the one had oh when you're putting money away for invest about ... dollar cost averaging into things on the one he had this painful it doesn't feel good but we have to not think about\nGee I Want to have ten thousand dollars a month coming at one retired including Social Security but I Am actually experiencing living among every quarter and Portugal I'm experiencing can be with my grandkids I'm experiencing being able to take a cruise so it's one thing having the goal and not have the emotions behind it but\nThe other thing having the emotions behind the outcome so experience of what life is going to be like instead of just a number or a concept out there will make a huge difference of two things immediate rewards and experience of the outcome\nAnd that's where really working with the professional you know because it's it's really like working with the colds I mean a lot of us that are in the financial services world you know that's really what most of our role is we're not in the back room making the day to day trades that's what money managers do but your typical\nFinancial professional is going to help you write down those goals\nYou on the path give you some examples like what you're talking about and help them keep their eye on the\nPrize and keep going study also\nI find myself a lot of times I live in the Midwest and we're\nPretty conservative when it comes to spending and there I say cheap you know one thing I find myself doing too with clients is they get this mindset of saving for the future and the future never gets there and they don't treat themselves to the rewards of being a successful saver and making it to retirement what do you say to those folks\nSuccessful people that are successful savers have a fix mindset they're thinking about what they're losing right now instead of what they were working in the future so they're looking at immediate punishment instead of deferred rewards and that's why I said we have to reward ourselves consistently for making any\nContributions to our four one K. qualify plant or buddy that we're putting it and then we have to reward ourselves for staying on that plan as well so that reward thing as a really big deal\nNow I don't think he got my questions so what about for folks that are saving for that rainy day and have a real hard time because they get to retirement they've been saving saving saving saving they've done a good job they've been successful at it but now they're at the promised land there in retirement\nThey want to start drawing money out but they can't they're afraid to draw they're still in that savings mindset what do you say to folks like that to help them enjoy retirement if they safely can't\nThat's a very good point because they have a mind set of save it constantly for they have to change their mind set to something else so fortunate the government helpless without right they call it are these\nHorses take that money off but if they obviously you know this that they need the money they're going to use that they tell you that they can use it for Iraq has other things but that takes a different mindset also so that takes another form of outcomes that we have to look at what\nThey what life to be like they have to set new goals and that's really difficult too high of a our coach is what sets it's when you retire here that retired enough that you're retired ... so they have to kind of ... volunteering maybe a new company do topics at Exeter here that takes a closer to what they want to be passionate about as well\nLike that's a that's a big thing I talk to everybody they're so excited about getting to that retirement telling the boss to take this job and shove it that they haven't thought about what they're going to do next and I see a lot of people retire without having that plan of what they're retiring to end in six to eight months they're bored they're depressed\nYou need to know what the next phase of life is and that's where that planning is so important from a psychological standpoint just as much as it is from a financial standpoint so thanks again carry for
