OK\nOkay the rule on I an asset is that has um\nThat has a lien against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt and keep the asset\nOkay so you could you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt double it's not going away you've got your student loan back that's done okay the cars then you cannot keep the car unless you keep the debt\nYou can ... from the debt\nOkay you've found on me but that's the only way you keep the car and so sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of the debt and that and the color of the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they would lean on the car\nOkay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is or was a I'm\nA ... or in the event of a bankruptcy you resign for the whole debt and you keep the guard show which of the cars is yours the Fifteen of the ten\nFifteen okay and what does that car worse do you have an idea [noise] I'd say about ten okay\nAnd so you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan debt you're going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card debt you understand if he files and you don't you've got that and then you got the other car now in the event of a divorce what I Would demand is\nThat if he's going to keep a car that he refinance I didn't get your name off of it\nOr if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car that he's driving is it worth at least once a vote on it\nSay about that okay so you could just sell that car and break even but I'm a you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess is what it is and you already knew that okay so the scenarios are\nThat um you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll land into\nUm I'm In veterinary medicine and I would say about\nThirteen an hour and working fulltime are you a D. V. M no oh no I'm a ...\nYear attack okay\nAll right and so I'm In that's in the Los Angeles area or you're going to be somewhere else okay All right so you're going to land on that and then you're going to clean up your student loan debt and the credit card debt and the car debt if he walks on all of it\nAt okay now if he chooses not to file and fight through it then the two of you got to work through this together and you're going to be [noise] what does he make\n[noise] last year he made about a twenty five okay be coming out of the military no scale and he's here in the military [laughter]\nYou don't have no security clearance you understand that he understands that I'm sure there you file bankruptcy or security clearance has gone\nSo amazed chances are moving up in the military are are are harmed pretty dramatically if he finds a bankruptcy but he doesn't make any money should be in and you just came home\nLost his mind and I was like oh my goodness yeah [laughter] I'm so sorry\nI didn't care you know just trying to start over and it's not going to be as easy for him as he wants it to be how old is he\nGoing to heaven yeah yeah okay well um I I think you shut down all your pastor and if you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine um\nI I think if he files and you don't you've got to force him\nTo sell the car that is in his name and probably we're going to say oh yours too okay I'm In and get you get your five thousand dollar loans for the difference and then you work your way out of the credit card debt the little bit of a car loan driving a beat her and the student loan debt is going to take you a little while with your income\nBut you can do that it doesn't mean you have to file just because he files mathematically or to legally\nOkay this is just making sense to you here so I'm Sorry your face and all this what a mess listen if you get in the middle of and you're going to the question you call me back I'll help you okay thank you very much great thank you Chris is with us in Minneapolis Hi Chris how are you\n[noise] good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nWith a

doctor already told you that you knew that right oh yeah I'm working on a good good for you charge struggle um\nSo what I might do is make sure my family's ... left with nothing and buy a smaller policy until we can do those two things and let let's get the weight off and get the diabetes more under control at that point and see if we can get a better rate two years from now or something\nAnd

I'm certain of that\nUm what's the what's interesting about this match up of course is\nA Cleveland has a completely different quarterback and weak one time or what they were poor started week one right yeah\nNow it's bigger may feel who is taking over\nAnd I think that's a good thing I've always thought that listen I I Know you're trying to bring the kid along and you went out and you\nYou spend some money entourage Taylor\nOr to make that deal to bring a man and you give up some assets for him and I like to Iran or any that I think he's a decent quarterback in the NFL\nBut you can spend the first overall pick on Becker Mayfield guys got a plane that's the only way you're gonna get better it's got to play so\n... Taylor put Baker may feel in there and my guess is unless he gets hurt or do something really stupid for multiple weeks\nTo be the starting quarterback in Cleveland [noise]\nUh not that it's been\nEasy sledding right I I just I I don't think that that's been the case at all they played in a lot of games you could argue that this football team to be six you know five and ... one of my successful probably five and won easily right but after their most recent loss\nAgainst the Tampa Bay buccaneers\nHuge actually got to the podium and said you know I don't know what we we've got to play better on defense in I'm going to get more involved in the office and people men\nThat as to Jackson saying here's the deal I'm going to be involved in the design of the office I'm going to take back to play calling duties of course I'm sure did not sit well with my good friend Tom Haley the former offered some coordinator and play calling for the Steelers who has taken over the job but the insurance by the way that he would have complete autonomy over the office right [noise]\nAnd ah anyway Ben Roethlisberger\nWho has a radio show in Pittsburgh or every week on Ninety seven three the fan who was asked about this because it was a ... it's it's it's well known that ban and taught Haley had their differences over their period of time together in Pittsburgh as they did a lot of good things but they're both too hardheaded individuals\nSo bet on his radio show today was asked about\nHow he thinks it's going down there between ... Jackson\nAnd Todd Haley given what you said after the Tampa Bay loss in his been robbed whisper well I Can't\nImagine that with all that that often I don't I don't know what he's going to say that it was like that\nObviously thought as a as a little of both um you know he was a productive for for years in the air so\nUm you know because that's all he has a lot about eight years old so I'm you know that's that's up to them to work it out\nI'll show or those who have had a little bit of both\nBut if that was Don Rickles jak thought you know the level though that'll fill up\n[laughter] sure we would have all of their see I I Know ban has got a big grin on his face what he's doing this interview because\nOf the conversations that took place between ... Jackson and taught Haley a and we've got a glimpse of it by the way the hard knocks were not discussions taught Haley was like what the EPA would you do what are you crazy I'm gonna you know that they were screaming that just like you want the opposite you take the opposite it's like when I'm Out of here\nThat that's probably not too far from what happened in that conversation and I think you finally realized listen\nI Can't do this all myself I heard this guy to do it it's fine All right we've we've got some young players including a rookie quarterback there's going to be some bumps in a row I get it All right and so I think [laughter] I think Ben is probably privately Lapid has bought off about what it is he knows is going on behind closed doors between two Jackson\nAnd Baker Mayfield a one of the issues by the way a bad uh this Cleveland oftentimes hat and we'll see how this young quarterback is going to make some mistakes et cetera that they'd gotten off to some slow

the fourth [noise]\nHe loves the basis and ...\nAnd it scores and run into one one runners at first and second with one out in the top of the fourth inning welcome back everybody or under center a five five three two three four NBC I'm\nAaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers football team is\nActually I thought it was a bit of it in ...\nAs a team despite my pet becoming the defensive coordinator and apparently Mike mccarthy or going back to some things he thought were more successful early in his tenure in Green Bay\nAnd it just hasn't look very good to me um defensively it hasn't look good to me especially in the back half\nAnd of course Aaron Rodgers than\nHertz is me and we want right and that went over the Chicago Bears\nHe's been playing with this this breaks right and\nHe has said bad back in the price gets bigger then it goes back to a smaller brace well he's hoping\nTo shed that brace\nIt's out this week I Would say the week after all right\nAnd then of course being a good healthy which is a good thing for the Green Bay Packers\nBut when you look at the gauntlet the rest of the way\nAre you realize how important it is I'm over the next five weeks there at the LA Rams\nThan there at New England to take on the patriots the Sunday Night Football game in their home against the dolphins in there at the sea hawks and it back on Sunday Night Football at the Vikings I mean that is murderers role as a matter of fact that's ridiculous [noise]\nTears Aaron Rodgers on facing um some of the better teams and better quarterbacks beautiful\nWere absolutely better to play a lot better than we have two winners games this is a foreign stretching our seasons not going to say it's going to define our state and local stuff is going to say things out when we get our news as and you're back home and a six week somewhere around the race and were lower flammable\nListen I I don't know if it's a well it might to find their season\nI mean they're not they're they're not sitting atop the NFC North right now if you lose the rams the patriots maybe get away with the dolphins and maybe the Seahawks so you used three and the next five\nDo you really think that you're going to come back\nYou know with four or five weeks to play in the national football league's regular season and and take over the division I don't think so I think the next five games may defined as football team\nRogers having to say this on his knees is I'm if I'm completely healed\nI don't need to wear a brace I feel more comfortable about it obviously having dealt with Amy injury for much my football wife obviously you're more protected so\nIf it's not all that means I'm feeling great and if it is I'm not quite all the way back in ... so I I guess we'd have to wait right we've got to wait to see whether or not he's here's the issue and I told you the defenses against this rams team\nI don't think they could stop Todd early in the way they run their passenger\nThey're as good as anybody in the league and we don't talk much about that off into line for the rams really damn good but they were on ... and then run the ... pass and they're not hitting little crossing Ross they're throwing the football down the field big place I don't think that defense can stand up\nThe patriots I dunno they'll pick them apart my guess is run and throw it do whatever they need to do that it'll be a pretty good game I guess is they beat the dolphins uh they play the Seahawks but it's in Seattle\nUm if if everybody's healthy and played well they could probably beat Seattle\nAnd then of course I've got a division gave me a against the Vikings\nSo we're going to see where they go here what what's interesting about this and it all starts on Sunday by the way\nAnd he realized that the Packers right now are eight and a half point underdogs\nEight and a half point underdogs\nThat is the largest margin they have ever seen\nSince Aaron Rodgers has been the Packers starting quarterback\nThat wasn't football's a funny thing I get it but I'm not I'm not particularly\nHappy about the way they protect him\nSometimes a receiver show up at the ball comes out on time all the time he's running all over the place\nOr they they really haven't sustainable great running game\nAnd you know we can talk all we want to about Kansas City in that office\nUm I don't know that there's a better off it's in the

Los Angeles are tied one on top of the fourth one out so David prices in some trouble and he will try to pitch out of here or let's say quick right when we come back speaking of the Green Bay

pioneer press corps the biking city in the top the NFC North take on them and is not the Minnesota the New Orleans saints this week they're coming off the buy up\nSpeaking of the saints looking with Drew Brees is doing I mean he looks like he's twenty five years old my forte uh and uh they they've got some weapons now with ... healthy and marketing growing back into it and of course Michael Thomas I'm it looks like the Vikings are going to have their hands full on that side of the football Chris\nYeah definitely my Semmelweis joking this week that a breach crowd is should retire but\n[laughter] he's far from that\nYou know interestingly when they met in the Minnesota miracles game last year last season when addicts cut the big TD pass to win on the final play the Vikings led Seventeen to nothing at halftime and we're pushing the saints all over the place\nAnd then all of a sudden the saints woke up and we're moving up and down the field and the second half\nAnd then the next week or in the NFC championship game the eagles exploited the Vikings defense so are the same found some holes in the defense there that night the Vikings defenses playing well off late but some other teams have found a hole\nIn their vaunted defense at times namely the rams earlier this season so it'll be interesting to see if uh the rams can now move the ball effectively for much of the game on Sunday\nYeah let me ask you a question of when I when I look at this defense from a year ago the Vikings ... one of the best if not the best and the national football league one of the things that was ... it was their third down deep into their ability to get off the football um that slipped a little bit why is that Chris didn't have any answers for that question\nActually strangely now their third down percentages actually better than it was last season\nLast season was twenty five point to the highest in the NFL in more than forty years this year now\nTwenty three point too but they would be seen it up against some out man follows\nThe last couple of weeks with a Arizona and the jets I think the Vikings now need to try to put a put up a consistent defensive game again a top fall when she'll obviously try to do\nSome day they played pretty well a few weeks ago at Philadelphia they were totally shut down defense and the first half but then that they really slipped in the second half and almost blue twenty three late so I think this is gonna be a huge tests for the Vikings and I don't think they'll shut down the same but I think they've\nGot to a show some better consist\nDefense against a top rated false\nOne of the other stories we've been following here over the last several weeks I'm understanding risk group and a return to ah to the to the team after dealing with some mental health issues a little bit\nI saw and read a statement I think he took some questions today as well uh how long before they integrated back into some on field stuff can we expect to see him play against the saints this weekend [noise]\nYou know that's the big question Griffin return to practice today for the first time in a mock since having a mental health issues and yet he took questions today and he seemed to be\nIn a good mood he didn't want to give any details of some of the ads that are that are\nSurrounded and last month he apologized for them he said he's been working out he's in good shape but you got to get your timing back and that sort of thing and get them out stuff so right now it's uh up in the air as to whether he can apply Sunday against the St\nMike Zimmer said well we'll address that at the end of the weight so he certainly could play but at the dialogue with respect he would be thrown in there with a whole ton of snaps in his first game\nBetter probably of situational pass Russia or some sort or before it gets you out of here Chris uh at the gym address at all the fact that he like apple obviously was sent over to the same from the giants in that trade whether or not they expect to see like apple are they going to be able to prepare for him because obviously there are ... at least Orleans is hoping that it makes a difference a little bit better\nNow he didn't actually address it but it certainly\nIs interesting that ah they've picked up somebody today her or the other day that may have ended up layer of that caliber and then you look at Detroit getting snacks terrorists then yeah mom Diane than Detroit as the Viking the next week so teams are are\nCertainly beefing up knowing how tough\nThe NFC is I mean obviously the rams are still on the fate it but the Vikings are there in the mix there's a lot of good teams that seems like in the NFC and uh teams are beef up and it's interesting that the Vikings are right up against the salary cap so\nThey might not have the ability to make those kind of moves so it's going to be interesting to see how it moves other teams making the NFC shake out yeah [noise]\nWell Chris has always my friend a thank you for joining me uh it's always a pleasure for you to come on and we appreciate a little preview of or this or this weekend against the Vikings and the same thing

field for being a cold spell out now has to feel that he's got to speak highly of the other side of the factions\nOf course they've broken in half as if they hit an iceberg Malcolm Jenkins talking to the media it is Wednesday obviously the day that players talk to the media and my Malcolm Jenkins now just wants to talk good positive things he does want to go into the dumps the way that are agreed seemed to do\nHe was a coward according to read he sold us out according to read some very very strong words coming off of obviously\n... but Malcolm Jenkins talking and I guess trying to smooth things over right\nHe obviously wants to get back in the good graces in show that that may be this this rift can be fixed the tear can be sold back together\nAnd the message that Capra Nick started and others like Malcolm Jenkins Michael Bennett both of them on the eagles and Eric greed and others and I think one bowl and all these guys can kind of combat together as one and fight the powers together rather than to separate factions in this\nSo of course Jenkins has come out and today he spoke\nPositively about Colin Kaepernick and he said quote\nWhile our main focus is always on the community and no systematic\nOppression how we can leverage relationships are access and resources to help people in everyday communities there's still a responsibility to speak out on calling ... who started this moving and still doesn't have a job I wholeheartedly believe he's being black balled so to speak out ... agree to put his job on the line to fight for those who didn't have a voice I have always maintained\nEvery chance I get to say calling capital started this era agree deserves the job telling Catholic deserves a job I can turn on the tape is weak and her opponent do the calling capital deserves the job the opponent of course there's the Jacksonville Jaguars ensure their quarterback situation\nIs an absolute mess right now Blake boils just isn't good and on top of that\nCody Kessler is the backup quarterback right now and he'd be next in line to get to start\nHere's the thing about it let's stop looking like Colin Kaepernick as if he's the savior that calling cap and it gives the difference between the Jacksonville Jaguars being a Superbowl caliber team\nOr then being a middle road team of the terrible quarterback and Blake portals yes play for all this bad I'm not going to sit here and denied that plate boils it's bad I have spoken the truth about Blake poodles at every single turn he's not good\nAnd for Jacksonville the thing that they could go into this season based on the fact they made it to the AFC Championship game in bottles that played well in the uh divisional round against Pittsburgh down the road does not mean he's capable of winning games in a role in the postseason and voicing a lumbar ... trophy he's not capable of that\nBut let's stop looking at ... capital every day goes by from one of his career ended on the field as of now and over rate what he really is yes Colin Kaepernick took a team to a Super Bowl and played well not going to take that away from calling cabinet but he is not the savior\nIf Colin Kaepernick was the savior the San Francisco forty niners one of one more than one game when Capra nix took over back as a starting quarterback a couple of years ago\nAnd all of their supporters of calling cap when they sit there and bring up their statistics and while Colin\nKaepernick played at a high level and yet he can't get a job he played in a high level and what does that team when nothing Jimmy grow up all comes into a team that looked like they were going to get the first overall pick and he wins what five straight games at the end of last year capital couldn't do that\nYou know what if you really that much ... better than Blaine guy ever stepped in this year what a game for the Tennessee Titans didn't they yes\nColin Kaepernick statistically did have a decent year not gonna sit here and tell you he didn't have a decent here but it's amazing how people want to take Colin Kaepernick statistic\nThrowing for twenty two hundred and forty one yards and eleven starts six two touchdowns in only four interceptions but yet when one and ten as the starter that year\nLet me give you some statistics that bothers look up everyone of Toronto Taylor's years\nHe was about sixteen to twenty touchdowns in four to six interceptions right and that guy's hanging by a thread for an NFL starting job and probably is done starting in this late once Baker may feel took over in Cleveland there's only option was to Cleveland\nSo let's not look at Toronto Taylor and saying okay well he's great because he doesn't throw a lot of picks because that's the excuse the colon capital backers use how does the guy that through for sixteen touchdowns and foreigners sections not get another opportunity in this week\nTell you the question I have is how bad is Eli Manning this year how bad is the New York giants the bad right there one in six they're one of the most awful awful officers in the NFL today right right no one's going to deny that they are a terrible off fence\nWith all the weapons the giants have steak loan Barclay has lived up to the hype no question you lived up to like\nI was a little bit a gun shy and said well I'm Barkley\nBecause when you hyper guy that much coming out of college sometimes guys can't handle it you know what he's legit ... back in junior sterling sharp suggest shepherds good number two ... good pass catching tie that there's weapons for you I write statistically speaking\nHe's having one of the best seasons he's had an east corner of the hall of fame\nHe like manning through seven games okay now this is crazy he lie manning through seven games of the year where where many believe he's done at thirty seven years old\nAnd the giants believe it 'cause guess what they're sell sell sell right now you lie apple yesterday David Harrison thank God tomorrow's engine orders Jenkins Olivier Vernon by the way are both\nHe like manning as a quarterback rating this year of Ninety four point one\nThat is a little over ten more than his hall of fame career rating of eighty three point nine\nNinety four point one quarterback rating for Ely manning if it stands would actually be the highest quarterback rating he has ever gotten in his career\nHighest was two thousand and Fifteen when I was at Ninety three point six\nHe like manning is on pace for another four thousand yard season Heathrow for two thousand sixty one in seven games do the math you guys on pace for about forty four hundred yards passing which would in fact be the second highest total of his career second or third pretty impressive\nHe lies completing sixty nine percent of his passes by the way he lies career sixty point one great honors seven touchdown for interceptions for phone calls he turned it over eight times in seven games not terrible like atrocious right boils just turn it over twelve times\nBlessed that come together to create it forget it will ensure\nIs just over the forest or just wonderful wonderful\nTo you at the council and the U.S Forest Service so\nWell I'm Glad you enjoyed it whether these that had back in\nTime the killing I'm sure they'd be careful getting us a\nI'm getting a return the tire\nLaugh how about a black T\nNature had to find that hard to find a neighborhood park or Green Bay the capital in the U.S Forest Service\n[noise]\n\nAnd I wonder if that we are going to be unfortunately the force radio and it be before it's radio dot com buyers fell continuing in New York\nGiants ship it off pieces left and right they traded Damon snacks terrorists in a two thousand and fix the first ... best runs ... can't get to the quarterback who's a great run stopper\nForty fifth round pick to Detroit line let me tell you it's a great deal by the lions [noise]\nI mean he is one of the top corner pro football focus on the top run stopping defensive lineman an entire NFL the last three to four years here's the problem do you take him out on passing down because you can't get to the quarterback so he's not an every down defensive tackle\nBut here giants brought him in for a lot of money member from New York Jets after two thousand fifteenth either just couldn't afford to keep 'em\nLook like a coup for the giants play great that first year but when you're making a good deal of money and the team's not winning and they're looking obviously do and get draft picks and get younger guys like him are going to get dumped off that's why the question in New York is who's next\nEither going to be a next yes of course there is you want to keep paying journalist Jenkins on a five year sixty two and a half million dollar contract the giants have already freedom thirty three million dollars of cap room next off these are the ones he likes jettison there'll be another Seventeen or so\nSo I figure if you made an offer for journalists Jenkins you can have them if you make an offer for Olivier burning you can have a here's the problem though shouldn't Dave Gettleman but the first year GM be on a hot seat considering he misjudged his roster maybe more than anybody else in the NFL bit\nDave Gettleman believed that the New York giants were a couple of pieces away from truly competing how\nHe invested in Eli Manning by not drafting a quarterback with a number two overall picks up the giants don't usually up\nAnd he's going to go to the grave and most New York giants fans going to go to the grave saying that made the right choice wrapping said well I'm Barkley\nBut if you start to still because you weren't now officially in a massive rebuild who cares if you have a great running back you need that quarterback know rebuilt know rebuild is complete until you have a real quarterback in place\nRight you can build pieces around but at the quarterback is not good you're not going to win enough games after the Jacksonville Jaguars\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars that rebuilt the juggernaut right a defense well they've been getting a lot of points lately but the names are great players are great maybe they're not putting it all together in winter for decades\nConcerned 'cause he can stay healthy it'd be great\nBut the quarterbacks the big problem they misjudged the blade portals and now they regret given that contract and probably not offering a higher traffic to Kansas City to get themselves Alex Smith you but Alex Smith on the Jacksonville Jaguars you don't want that probably six and six probably five into right now\nNot three and four\nHe make a two game difference because he's not going to make stupid plays and throw foreigners sections of the games are going to happen it's not Alex Smith yes you're on your each day like\nA two year old what happened but but then you would have to give Alex Smith a contract extension like the rest can fit right but would you rather give out the middle of eventually then Blake boy wouldn't trade for our Smith because we know what Al Smith is a lot better than by morals though and they gave him a two year deal lessons to your budget cut\nPlayboy was after the season and terrorists Al Smith you would have been\nAn advocate accent him out and you you would have been stuck with him for what three more years I mean we know what else is you can't what a civil Al Smith swollen quarterback and saw that she's got rid of them but if you have enough pieces around like a defense in a running game\nYou know what you can come pretty close\nYou a better shot the when\nI played ... is there to stay one more year is dead cap number next year sixteen and a half million is kept hits Twenty one million\nA year after that you can get out\nSo that since he signed Blake morals to a two year deal for you know about thirty million bucks\nMaybe a little bit more and look at our expense to four year Ninety four million dollar extension ain't got\nNo what is the breakdown in terms of\nYou know money and when you can get out as they are the ... you're a key point four million cap it in twenty Nineteen twenty points for a million dead money fifty five million in twenty Eighteen forty million between Nineteen twenty million and twenty twenty\nSo you can get it right but you have to hold onto them one more year longer than Blake boils\nIt's worth it it's worth it\nIs worth one more year the ...\nBut that's the problem so for the New York giants who were floundering as one of the worst teams in the NFL right now fighting now it seems like Arizona

you more as younger as\nThese as a higher ceilings and then tailor does his point you know same scale or very sickly Al Smith the similar quarterbacks Smith a better pass or the okay but tell it

here's here's the bottom line\nTell us on a championship quarterback I'm not so but here's the problem but here's the problem for the New York giants they're rebuilding without the key component who's replacing Eli Manning\nKyla letter for propaganda Richmond very raw to the giants really believe they drafted a starter when they put them in the fourth round of playing some games this year to see what they have\nI'll tell you what's that going to stop them from having a top two or three pick next year and dropping a quarterback be adjusted Herbert or Ryan's family or the get out to do or I'd Wayne Haskins or somebody like\nThat so the New York giants in essence aren't many they drafted\nThe wrong player by the moves they're making tearing apart this team\nThey generally guessed wrong and he lost the roll the dice and he went bankrupt and said well bart Lisa nice toy\nBut he's not the guy that's going to get you to rebuild their quarterback would have been the guy that gave you some

he you know maintain to face and he was trying to give us a marketing guy and he and I I'm a little surprised he said that but I think he got tired and gets tired of being told how he you know stopped Chris Paul from going to the Lakers and and that\nWhole saga the Laker fans have not forgotten about that I'm In the middle east and it's still piss them off I think he got tired of hearing about it he's he was like to argue that's not a good trade um\nI Would like to argue that I Am positive because it had member this happened right after the lockout\nPositive to what happened is a bunch of owners called him up because you cannot like Chris ... go to the Lakers why did we just have a walkout why did we tried to flatten look you know flattened out the talent pool and now this happens I think there is no way you will ever convince me that's not what happened\nWhile you mentioned Chris Paul and Ron do and you know Glenn big baby Davis and others have now come out in calling out Chris Paul is being a bad team made why is it that for so many years of his career\nI talk on the show Sean talked about it to hurt the fact is we always thought of him is this really good dude and you know Chris Paul is just as great teammate why we now finding out that are more than one person believes that he's actually a lousy teammate\nChris Paul is I don't think he's a bad team made I think what he he pushes everybody hard all the time now he does this to himself but he is ... list and criticism and calling guys out and saying you're on the wrong spot and pointing out for those and by the way\nLike if not the highest IQ player in the league he is in that top five or ten like him abroad and if you're out there that are just ... Dickie loosely smart players\nHe's capable of this like he's bringing the gym poll is like who would make the best coach there like Chris Paul would make the best coach you'd never do it but he's got that kind of mind and he just is so competitive the on leashes on these guys have that that is part of what the problem was and then when you say\nThe clippers never melted Blake Griffin or the under Jordan's opposite he never really came together that wasn't the core of it but it was part of it like those guys got tired of constant criticism of the of of of course opposed leadership style um and I think it just turned that you know turn that team into a\nLink to use the baseball analogy at twelve players twelve cabs kind of team um\nI it seems to be better in Houston but not everybody loves playing with him because of that\nAll right current ah we're much five or four games through the season depending on the team the Toronto Raptors for no quiet Leonard of course there are they legit right now is a five minute team atop eastern conference\nAnd they say they just want again tonight I think so I look at what they first up they want or just on paper\nThan they one fifty nine games last year they got rid of the Marta rose in and acquiring Leonard and he looks healthy I Believe there's moments he's still shaken rushed off but he looks healthy looks like his old so it's quite Leonard is back to being vintage Kwai letter\nWith all due respect to the Marta Rosen who's an all star all NBA player flushes better at everything he says that he's a vastly superior defender um it can get to the wind better can hit mid range is the three better\nThey should be I mean on paper you're like I could be the kind of move that makes them way better and it looks good early returns earlier really impressive I Will see how that shakes out I was a walk into a marathon of season so ever since\nFor a marathon were like just starting the second mile early early\nBut that said I really liked him and I think that we're quite Leonard in full form that the team with the switch guys like past go see him and Oceana doping all these role players they can threaten Boston like Boston is going to get together officers slumped early there'll be fine but\nThat's the one team with the players that could push them in the east\nTo Europe pronunciation there are those two guys was just top knock you do it again\n[laughter] I was at Pascal Seattle oh Janet okay yeah I I could put a link to attend the coupon too but that one took a lot of practice\nYeah oh my God card I mean my goodness what do you usually have like Nobel Peace prize doing right now the basketball incredible um each morning he went with that\nYou know why why would I Want the Nobel Peace prize and try to help the world when I can make so much more money writing about basketball\nThat's a good point I mean who wants to buy a million dollar prize money right I mean that just ...

everybody's cool about it and they they don't ask you for loans of course real record so far we've started the NBA season and there are literally two teams right now the defense of we are holding teams under a hundred points if like Doug most come back and he's morphed into every MBA coach surprised that the incredible amounts of points being scored this early on\nA little bit I mean I think it will come back to earth but a lot of that you know we ran the numbers guys are shooting was freezing efficiencies up a little um but really the big differences everybody's playing faster as of Monday when I did a podcast and I actually ran the numbers the average team was running five more possessions a game per team so like ten you know Ken time's up and down the court\nThat's\nThat's a lot of more chance to a lot more chances to score and that that's what's kind of driving this right now everybody's trying to play fast because the scouting is so good\nThe teams kind of know you know they're trying to switch everything everybody kinda knows what they're trying to do and a half or a little bit how you can break out of that is just getting mismatch is and and do things in transition

just seven games into the John ... ten year experiment [noise] ten million a year a hundred million dollar deal for Mark Davis John Green\nAnd maybe you have to realize right now that when you don't coach for nine years the game kinda passes you by the players are just different you talked to veteran players guys who play this game who\nLook at today's players compared to when they play guys or a softer yelling and screaming at players just doesn't work\nWhen John grew last coach didn't mislead with Tampa Bay some of the guys that his team were like fourteen or Thirteen Years old or barely in high school they weren't even play varsity football that time\nThese guys have been coddled you know Web sites like rivals in scouting ESPN's college recruiting all these sites make these guys at the stars they Google or name when they read all the write ups about them being five stars and how great they are they're going to be NFL players\nThat guy wants to be all that by some jerk college football coach I go up on the NFL\nYou're staying right here among the check you out listening to you know yell at me I'm transferring screw you happens so John Bruno shockey routine people want to know how that work I don't think it works\nAnd now the reports coming out are just starting that the reader players are just unhappy with the way things are transpiring the way that they dealt them already Cooper because\nThey didn't hear about this deal from John grew in themselves they learn that their teammate I've been dealt from media reports I think that's petty and day and age the Twitter by the time drawing group goes from his office the locker room to go do players it's already been out on Twitter for ten minutes\nYou know you get the result will actually before the major networks have it because the Twitter at this point so unless you are you know\nYou're wearing a you know or the the ... what does it back to the future skateboard and you can fly over there to tell the players are going to learn but I don't think back to make anybody mad it as a player I didn't learn from John brunette Mari grouper was treated I again that's what that's about the nature of today's athlete right that's what you have to deal with\nBut what apparently made people mad is that\nJohn brooding themselves that they weren't gonna trainer mark Cooper again look it's a business maybe that's a little petty on the players' part\nBut if you're John groom and you are back at a coaching after a nine year hiatus sitting in the booth making a lot of money he the one that has to adapt to today's player\nFifty three players aren't going to adapt to you you're not they'll check for crying out loud and by the way that will check when someone else I don't know if it'll work works in a women because at that point you know what you get into right those guys have been a part of that team for a while\nLike Bill there'll be okay with the Malcolm Butler situation which I still don't understand him being bench for the super bowl\nBecause they're like God spell check and he's got five rings so there's a decent reason not as dumb as it is there must be a decent leads right keep running through a wall for Bill Belichick John groove and can't get away with that because you got one Super Bowl from back in the day when Tony ... people to steam so that's an issue\nSo players talking to the athletic and we're talking multiple players just one of them apparently he was willing to actually have his name use just one player that was tied at least Smith\nEverybody else really kind of ah going after how this quote the\nMac traders are real stiff jab at the Cooper was like a knockout punch especially because we had just walked back in the door from the by we didn't want to believe it was coming and coach said we weren't going to trade him\nYou see John grooming doesn't care about his players because to him most of those guys would be gone anyway\nIf they don't have the luxury of ten years John ... who is not going anywhere Mark Davis is not going to buy him out and pay maybe a million bucks to go somewhere right he can be the biggest failure he might end up being a huge failure in Oakland and then slash Vegas\n... doesn't care in the long term project he's got time to build that team it's like a Lynch\nAnd share their hand in the ... in San Francisco they all got six year deals in the customary four or five six year deals which means they are in it for the long haul management understands that or else you know ownership doesn't give you a six year deal Mark Davis isn't giving John ... tenure deal to turn it around in one day\nThey have five first round picture something in the next two years something ridiculous like that so that three first round picks a bunch of other ... whatever it is now they have five first round pegs actually they have three and the year after that they have to\nBear the cowboys bears and their own pick next year and then the bears pick the year after that\nBut I just think this is not a match made in heaven and when you have a coach that feels comfortable because you can't get rid of him he's going to take his time of players don't have that time\nPlayers their careers are short players want to win players don't want want to be a part of a team that's on a long range rebuild why one day\nThey don't want to sign up for that they're always two three four years of their career on a team that's not going anywhere just cause that coach at six more years passed before\nSo ugly situation\nBut here's the problem on top of it Mark Davis can't tell nor can Reggie McKenzie the GM tell John crude and what to do\nHe's not going to listen guys like ... I think they have all the answers guys like Bruton believe that their way is the only way and if it's not their weight the highway\nThey also especially regimen cans he doesn't have the luxury of having a deal that keeps you there nine more years passed this year that's why I was so stupid and Mark Davis to give John good at ten year contract dumb\nYou see the difference with that in college because you look at the jumbo Fisher deal with that ten years eighty million or something like that but you know fish or ten years Seventy five or something look players come and go in college right recordings half the job of being a college football coach we know jumbo Fisher can recruit\nJohn grew doesn't have to recruit it's not as ... I mean John ... just has to access to those and I don't even think he's strong at that people forget John grew in his trajectory as a coach went down down down he won his first year in Tampa Bay when he inherited dodgy team\nNow bill Callahan inherited grooms team and went to a Super Bowl last ironically the group but after that grew in the quarterback ...

billion dollars unbelievable it's incredible you look at it\nThe moves that have worked for the red Sox a shaky bullpen has been nothing but solid the series\nAnd a shaky Craig kimbrell who looked terrible against the Yankees\nGiving Red Sox fans you know I mean heart aches\nAnd solid\nAnd for the Dodgers were you know no one's getting a big it's for them you're not going to win the world series games like that over team like the red Sox their job or not the last team to win one hundred and eight or more and not when the world series Seattle of course one sixty tides go out to Oakland the bay area buddy ray righto NBC Sports bay area joining us\nRaid talking about the John ... situation you read the stories that are out there nationally you are right there in the bay area re\nHe's it as bad as we're hearing here in New York the anger from players they felt kind of lie to about the moral Cooper trade they're mad they heard it in ... you know from social media and the media itself and not John ... is this being overblown or is there a lot to it\n[noise] or there there's a fair amount to it I had a lot of a lot of people who are in that room every day\nUh they get the sense that the play its dawned on the players that this is a team\nUndergoing a hold on to rebuild and that most of them\nAre not going to be working in Oakland uh much beyond the raiders existence themselves so they all sort of view themselves a short time are sort of out of the loop\nAnd so yeah I I think it's I think it's a real thing and I think Bruton as probably missed calculated ah that level of what the rebuild past the main because he's still got to get these guys to play pretend more weeks\nRaised it also an issue that he's been out of coaching for nine years in in that timeframe the players get a young girl the millennial generation seems to be a lot softer and I'm from the generation maybe grew remembers where you can yell at players do you play that Chuck E. routine and get results is he a guy that maybe hasn't adapted to the new player today\n[noise] um maybe a little bit I mean I think the bigger problem is that he's he's really guilty of impatience\nWhen you're going to do a rebuild and you're the coach and the general manager you have to figure out a way to\nTo temper what you do and the way you do it and what he's done basically is is blow everything up and worry about the shrapnel later so as a result\nThe players feel like they're not part of the process\nHard enough playing football\nWhen ... when you're when you're fully engaged I mean it's you know there one in five they're not they're not happy they think the coaching staff and the organization\nDoesn't have their backs a and you know maybe this is just temporary because of that that will be open wound if the repeal but I just don't feel like they get and they're getting told the truth about anything and they're having to ferret it out on their own which means that\nYou know they're going to fill in the blanks the way they want to and when that happens you got a real problem\nNBC Sports bay area's re Ronald joining us going deep enforcement NBC Sports radio the whole dairy car situation did he shed a tear did he not his leadership something that is questioning that lock them because my whole point earlier talking about a raise\nIf they like him and respect him as a leader and maybe she had to tear because he's been very banged up there are a lot of interest when it comes to Derrick car they've all accumulated [noise] so what if you did share to shed a tear is this kind of an indictment on his leadership\n[noise] I I think I think this part is sort of overblown because look if you ever tried to hammer in jail and you get your thumb your eyes water a little bit\nNot ...\nOkay today [laughter] and you know hats off your urine whether or not\nI don't think he he I don't think it was all on cry but you know it's a it's a picture that you know looks bad [noise] and I think when you're one in five\nAny excuse school do when you want to explain why things are going well I don't do that it's so much with leadership as much that is part of the whole information vacuum [noise] um if\nIf they feel in full core fully engaged in and everything I don't think they'd be you know\nThat this would have been much of an issue at all I I think you know everybody knows how tough car is probably tougher than he ought to be but you know when when emotions are wrong like this everything looks bad everybody feels that everything's towns bad so I think\nThat part probably a little overblown do they believe in him as an elite quarterback probably not but then that's different than saying he he cries on the side [noise]\nHe's he's a guy that truly uncomfortable I mean if you buy John grew in saying that or do you think that if the right offer came along they would literally consider shipping up there a cartoon this quote unquote rebuild\nI think the only thing they won't consider is the feeling him before June first because\nHim a job and are are pretty clear um if courting doesn't believe in them and it's certainly possible that he doesn't listen I'm going to be the time to do anything about that\nBecause they don't have anything else cars are going to get so while I think he even money would be gone on June second I think it's really unlikely that they move them now that said\nI thought it was really unlikely that they were going to call you on that I think we know how that or do\nYou think cars that good ray what's your assessment of the dark car at this point in his career\n[noise] um I think he's a radical I think he's a little gun shy I think he doesn't have great talent around them\nUh I think you know they really only got one sort of you know go to player on the op ed that marks on what\nAnd that's it he's not he's not he's not on a on a twenty five barrier a theme eight so hard to do more than he's doing now and he doesn't really have weapons to do that with so everything about you know quarterback plays intertwined with the wind or what the bird\nRight in there I think he puts up you know\nNice looking numbers but they don't really help them win so I think that's where he is he's clearly not elite he's okay he's about middle of the fact because don't forget there are some bad quarterback\nRe real quick with the knowledge this team will be gone in a couple of years then this is gonna be a lengthy rebuild obviously being rude and probably use you know proving that with the moves once the fan base like are they still going to show up to these games next year and a half\nUm [noise] I think it's going to be interesting to see what kind of crowd they get Sunday against Indianapolis or the culture not a great team I think you could see a lot of people who will either come to the game tailgate and go home or maybe just not come at all but\nIf they build a building Sunday then you sort of have to think that it's bad it's we've been that this is this is their bedrock rampage sixty thousand people a Sunday will be a real litmus test about how much longer people are going to tolerate what they're looking at how\nIt's a bad situation as say the least of the Oakland Raiders but everybody running around and let me see sports fairy always fun time but they re appreciate the time my friend\nOkay keep your hat

doing what we know David prices capable up so I was really surprised at the previous this very impressive\nIt certainly was very impressive and uh the bats getting it done again you look at these two teams the Dodgers and the red Sox the big Achilles' heel seemingly coming into the series of both teams has been the bullpen Red Sox bullpen getting it done surprise right match it was the first call in for Dave Roberts for the second straight game he doesn't get it done\nYou know and and Robert says he he manages differently when he doesn't have a lead and you know he has a plan when he has a lead the thing was a you know the red Sox have so many weapons\nOr they're just they're just a better team I'm Sorry I ... I I Want you know I Want a classic or want to I Want to feel the the the electricity in the building I haven't felt that it said the red Sox are a better team than the Dodgers I Do think the Dodgers take two or three in Los Angeles and\nThen the red Sox are up three to coming home and there I mean I'm Sorry but you know you cannot get the red Sox the the thing about the red socks off season we talked about it yesterday their numbers\nA lot of bad teams they had all these things but they are good team and what Roberts is trying to do is he's trying to play matchups he's done it all season long he doesn't use as a relievers when he's trailing 'cause he tries to protect queens and that's always been his demo\nSays it's a Red Sox don't allow this series to come back and they take it in four or five they get to that hundred Nineteen when mark and as you said it was kind of a softer regular season plane teams like Baltimore is just an all time great team\nNo no I don't I don't compare him you know I don't think they look like that you know there are a good team um I think that what they are the red Sox season and what this World Series might just exemplifies the disparity in the American league and I thought they were so many God awful teams\nAnd the red Sox just never let up and you know what they don't have you know when Steven Wright got hurt there was a bullpen deficiency Alice core pushed a button he tried these starters on their throat day it works\nHe has just come up bases and everything he's done so you know my attitude for for for ... they've been in the right place they've been the recipient of it but they deserve all the credit in the world they are not an all time great team I'm there's nothing they can do to to find that\nA to change that that that my it's just a product of what they are\nWhat can the Dodgers do at this point it was like in terms of pure talent the red Sox are just a better team you said it I said it when it comes out of what happens if you ask your we've got to step up what exactly has to happen for the Dodgers to have a chance here if they even have one\nWell it's obviously a game three you know if they win game three then they you know ... they they they try to win game for if they win games for the next thing you know it's tied\nYou know the fact of the matter is is that you know they always say a series is on the series until someone wins on the road so the Dodgers will try to hold serve if they do they're up three to going back to Boston it will see\nMy attitude is they take two or three of the question will be is whether or not they tie the series too too 'cause then all of a sudden there'll be intrigued\nVersus do they fall behind three one encourage shot in his last potential that start as a Dodger ah you know pictures them to victory forces the game five forces everybody to fly across country just for a coronation\nBoston or baseball inside of set the average joining us going deep dance wars and NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com gimme what's ... believes to be the pitching strategies in game three when it comes to the starters now with Boston up two games on the Dodgers down two games to none\n\nI well you know at this point we're going to go to the kid you know they're going to go to a viewer\nAnd you know he's ... he's been great off season you know he has been superb ... I don't think he was suburban Milwaukee series\nBut uh you know they're going to go with them and uh you know as far as the red Sox are concerned whether it's for solo or have all the they're they're going to be just fine I I think that these rotations are what the ...

tickets to games but on the series late in the world series afford to victory over the Dodgers in game two at Fenway David Price solid for the second consecutive outing\nHe wanted his second career postseason game [noise]\nMemory was coming off his first career postseason victory and he was again like I said solid six innings three hit ball give up\nA couple of runs but it didn't matter the fence was handled by the red Sox they rallied scored three runs in the bottom of the fifth inning and then the bullpen continued to shine for the red Sox in this World Series and then this postseason as a whole\nThree pitchers out of the ... for the red Sox pitching the Seventy eight and then I joke Kelly Nathan you've all the ... general retired nine up nine down\nAnd you look at the movies that manager our score has made throughout this post season and I can send you to be impressed going into the playoffs\nThe number one concern for the red Sox was the bridge to Craig Kimball\nHow would they go from guys like joke Kelly and Matt Barnes Ryan brave ... how would they go from them\nTo Craig chemical because as good as those guys have been in their outings in the fifth sixth seventh innings for some reason the eighth inning has been a disaster or was a disaster for the red Sox the latter part of the year\nThey just could not figure out how to handle ball to their clothes are correct chemical\nBut on this very show I said\nThat there would be a solution in the post season and it's going to be a starting pitcher coming out of the bullpen\nNow Steven Wright was going to be that guy the knuckleball or but he got hurt and the plans were adjusted and it was your baldy who became that guy and I actually thought that it was gonna be needs and you've all the from the get go but our quarter flip the script\nFlip the script on all of us by going to Rick poor cello\nIn the early part of the post season in the eighth inning even want the court cell in the eighth inning at one point\nNow he's in the world series and he did it before yeah obviously in in the challenges but later on in the postseason he goes to Nathan Giovanni who is throwing harder than he's ever throwing his career now post Tommy John surgery once again\nIt's own believable the moves that he continues to make\nContinued to just work out for them\nYou have all the look dominant data the bullpen and you know what he's going to get money this off season\nSomebody is going to pay him and he's going to be a starter next year when there for the red Sox for somebody else he's young he's got a live arm he has proven that he can be a successful starting pitcher\nBut coming out of the bullpen Nathan you have all the stuff is down right on hit a ball\nHe would have a very successful when the career as a closer who is touching this guy out of the bullpen and now you look at the back into the bullpen for the Boston Red Sox and what was once the weakness has now turned into a strength\nAnd I treated out before the ninth inning started because I just had a feeling where it was going to go you know Chris Kimball is converted all of his save attempts in this postseason but he's been shaky\nIt's why I kinda liked Craig kimbro bringing him in in a non saved situation in game one knowing that you have the off day coming up on Thursday so you can throw him again on Wednesday and then a lot of time to rest before friday's game end\nWith a non pressurized situation\nOut there and throw it to regain some confidence that he might have lost giving up these runs at knees hips and putting guys on base earlier in the postseason\nBut I just had a feeling\nGoing into that ninth inning tonight and I put this out on Twitter before that I think so people wouldn't say that I was second guessing\nI said if for some reason Craig timbre of blows this safe\nDon't shoot and you just know you knew that the conversation would be why didn't Cora take out you have all the\nWho is lights out in the eighth and\n[noise] and my response at that point was you've all they do this job his job was to get through the ace and hand the ball the trend Kimball ... the closer he is not going anywhere\nHe will get the ball in the ninth inning with a lead\nEvery time unless it's the ... victory that's his job if he blows it that's on him you know blame Alex Cora for going to his closer that's what you do\nBut it didn't happen ... can roller stellar and the ninth\nContinued the trends for the Boston bullpen throughout this entire World Series and now the red Sox are up two games to none and I see a lot of people on Twitter talking about the idea of the series being over and maybe this could be a sweep or a five game series that it's not going to come back to Boston\nSlow down I think we absolutely come back to Boston for a game six now I think the red Sox win this series\nTeams that go up to oak huge percentage they when the series\n\nI picked the red Sox and seven I've seen other people picked the red Sox in six I don't know how many games it's going to be six or seven but I can tell you in my heart of hearts I Believe there will be a game six in Boston next Tuesday\n\nMe old cliche a series doesn't begin until it team loses a home game\nThe series now shift to LA for three games at Dodger Stadium\nI don't know Syria I'm not talking to you\nEvery time I say series series and some talking to her not talking to you I think the Dodgers will play better at home [noise] there'll be warmer\nYou could tell the temperature here in game two was much colder than in game one and you could tell watching these players looking at them when they showed the live shots into the dug out\nThey were called and they were not comfortable and I'm not saying it had an\nImpact on the way that they played but it definitely affected them a little\nBit right\nSo I just firmly believe that they will play better at Dodger Stadium they'll get the boost by the crowd plus\nLights out here so the first two games of the world series\nIs this series over do the Dodgers send it back to Boston for a game six I think they do eight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six to to Alex Cora on his starting pitcher David ...\n\nKind of stuff was good so am I to just a matter of a no hitter slim movies seems like they make some adjustments the second time through line up early enough inches inside he wasn't getting back call people can go on to to see more into writings and speeches but no the recall balls and\nThings like this are looking for off the deep down the song the change of um [noise] but um maybe the mouse and the job\nThat I mentioned before in the the big problem the problem but the big question mark going into the post season for the red Sox was the eighth inning who was going to be that bridge to ... Kimble because as good as some of the relievers have been throughout the season whether it's born Kelly Braves you're a you know Rodriguez\nThe eighth inning has been a point of contention for Red Sox fans it has been a problem they have not been able to successfully get the ball to Craig Kimball in the latter part of the season but they solved it by using starters Rick pour so early on in the postseason\nAnd now Nathan you've all the Koran Nate you've already\nLike I've been saying all along we're all in every day and I really feel that there's a chance to [noise] to close the door with them\nWill use them um and other ways mapped out his his reconvene three and may be may be poor but they might come in and again and we have a chance to to be of the Rio with him on the mound grand will do it and then we'll see you again for\nSo this appears to be his plan now moving forward we suggested this after watching game one unfold when when you've all the came in the eighth I said it looks like it's going to be poor cello in game three as the starter this is interesting that he says you have all the is the ...\nFor starter unless they have to use them in the eighth inning in game three I kinda liked that because you have to wait to see how the game plays out if you don't need him then yes used ... game for especially if you're a thrill\nBut if you ... if you have a chance\nTo close down the game similar situations tonight to run ball game in the eighth inning there's no one I trust more out of that Red Sox bullpen and right now than Nathan you've all the\nLights out stuff he has shown in relief appearances this postseason eight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six do to David Roberts on being down to well\nWe're to find a way to win a baseball game I I think coming in here I thought we'd play these guys pretty straight up obviously we we come out of here going home down to nothing but they may pitch is when they needed to and um\nWhen they can we trust them they made the pitch and then when they fled and they were\nAnd we didn't and that's kind of a different\nAll right so what about changing your line up you know you only score to runs hearing game to Fort runs in game one and now you're going to be facing the right to use as opposed to the left to use in sale and price\n\nGame three is going to be a different line of\n'em I assume we're going to see for so and so it'll be different right there but as far as the top just in terms of the ... second or third all year long and um\nThere's no reason to move him than I think Brian does your against the left the ah the first two games I thought it was a bad quality was pretty good but we're going to shovel it up for game three but it's not because of necessarily performance is kind of a who the starting pitcher for those guys is\nAll right Nick so let's try to projectors Dodger lined up here now in game three of the series do you think\nWhat David Freese lead off\nA ... now what would that Dodger lined up look like you're the Dodger fan Nick what would it look like in ... three righty on the hill so it's going to be left the heavy\nYou know what I I guess what we're gonna probably see now this is uh I'm just making the lineup your myself okay\nI guess [noise] um\n[noise] I don't know you could lead off jock Peterson\nAlright\nYou lead off jock Peterson then Turner will probably bat second like he's been doing Muncie you got to get in there he'll bat third ... guy so he'll be fourth Ballenger is in their fifth then\nMan where do you go where do you go after that ...\n...

I don't I don't know that like you you know I don't do those rankings top twenty twenty five player in the NBA easily um\nAnd you replace him with quite literally bits of MVP level quite Leonard and he started to get back to that for me starting to shake off the rest of Russia you just got a guy who's literally better at everything about a three point shooter a much better defender to get to the ... can do all these things\nBetter than the Rosen and it shows early he's he's starting to put up once they're starting to play really well I'm ... they have a weight bench with Fred vent fleeting everybody there or they have long switch guys OJ in a new baby and I'm ... and they just they match up really well if they're playing this well they're the one team in the east\nAnd on paper can match up to Boston and it's easy to dismiss Toronto going into the playoffs and we're a long long way from that obviously but quite a lot of changes that dynamic to me like quite letter just like the by the way here's my rang here's my finals MVP trophy we're not messing with that\nYeah [laughter] speaking of the Celtics you mentioned them a Brad Stevens says we're not as good as everybody thinks we are do you think he's just\nMay be bothered by how much hype there is surrounding this team you know the Celtics historically and I'm Talking just over the past couple of years they've done well in that I'll start under dog role but now everyone is picking them to go to the NBA Finals and represent the eastern conference maybe Brad Stevens not comfortable with this team beam in that position\nI think there's a little of that he always and there is at a coach out there well I shouldn't say that the generally coaches will be happy to downplay expectations\nI'm for their team that said I think he's also right it just hasn't been plug and play with with Gordon Hayward and and Kyrie Irving in the sense of hey this was a team that went to the conference finals and was doing all this stuff right\nNow we just put these two guys in and everything will take off acts financially it's been a lot more work than that it's been a lot harder for them but not to kind of just make it fit and I don't think anybody doubts that they will\nIt's just not been as smooth a process um what's that all the way back um their defense isn't quite there yet\nIt'll get there the rotations will settle they'll figure it out but it's still kind of work in progress and with that they've you know lost a couple of games I didn't I I think people didn't think they would lose\nMore let's go ...

like that then then ... to me he should be able to do that you know or get a ... minute I Know that that message with amateur ism in some people's minds but I I kind of think amateurs and in that

just working out for a year in a gym even with great trainers and don't like against other guys or what have you um I I still think even with that new system they set up through the ... league in the hundred and twenty five thousand dollars\nThose guys are still going to take\nGoing to college going to Kentucky or do or North Carolina or UCLA or what have you wearing a flight charter flights and the big man\nI you know like it's a it's it's a much more comfortable life than being in the ... league or sweating it out and I n G academy or some of that stuff so I'm I still think most guys would go that way and I'm not sure this is going to become a trend but\nI'm curious to see how it shakes out they've got to find a way to get these younger guy some money or you're going to see a lot of solutions like this [noise] yeah\nWell look the they got to find a solution and yes the kids would be better off going to school not just for their lives but also you know the learning experience that

Fenway David Bryce solid for the second consecutive outing\nHe wanted his second career post season\nRemember he was coming off his first career postseason victory and he was again like I said solid six innings of three hits ball give up a couple of ones but it didn't matter\nThe op eds was handled by the red Sox\nThey rallied scored three runs the bottom of the fifth inning and then the bullpen continued to shine for the red Sox in this World Series and in this postseason as a whole three pictures out of the pay for the red Sox pitching the Seventy eight and then I joke Kelly Nathan evolving and Craig gamble retired nine up nine down\nYou look at the moves that manager our score has made throughout this post season and I can\nSend you to be impressed going into the playoffs the number one concern for the red Sox was the bridge to Craig Kimball how would they go\nFrom guys like Joe Kelly\nAnd Matt Barnes Ryan ... how would they go from them to quit and chemical because as good as those guys have been in their outings and the fifth sixth seventh innings for some reason the eighth inning has been a disaster or was a disaster for the red Sox the latter part of the year\nThey just could not figure out how to handle the ball to their clothes are Craig chemical\nBut on this very show I said that there\nWould be a solution in the post season and it's going to be a starting pitcher coming out of the bullpen\nNow Steven Wright was going to be that guy the knuckleball or but he got hurt and the plans were adjusted and it was your ... who became that guy\nAnd I actually thought that it was going to be Nathan evolved from the get go but our quarter flip the script flipped the script on all of us by going to Rick poor cello\nIn the early part of the post season in the eighth inning even went to court cell in the eighth inning at one point\nNow he's in the world series and he did it before yeah obviously in in the championship but later on in the postseason he goes to Nathan Giovanni who is throwing harder than he's ever throwing his career now post Tommy John surgery once again\nIt's own believable the moves that he continues to make\nContinued to just work out for them\nYou have all the look dominant data the bullpen and ... you know what he's going to get money this off season somebody is going to pay him and he's going to be a starter next year wasn't for the red Sox are for somebody else he's young he's got a live arm he has proven\nThat he can be a successful starting pitcher but coming out of the bullpen Nathan you have all the stuff is down right on hit all\nHe would have a very successful grueling the career as a closer who is touching this guy out of the bullpen and now you look at the back into the open for the Boston Red Sox and what was once a week this has now turned into a strength\nAnd I treated out before the ninth inning started because I just had a feeling where it was going to go you know Chris Kimball he converted all of his save attempts in this postseason but he's been shaky\nIt's why I kinda liked ... bringing him in in a non saved situation in game one knowing that you have the off day coming up on Thursday so you can throw him again on Wednesday and then a lot of time to rest before friday's game\nEnd with a\nNon pressurized situation you can let them go out there and throws regain some confidence that he might have lost giving up these runs at knees hips and putting guys on base\nEarlier in the postseason but I just had a feeling going into that line than in tonight and I put this out on Twitter before that I think so people wouldn't say that I was second guessing\nI said if for some reason Craig timbre of blows to the states don't shooting you know you knew that the conversation would be why didn't Cora take out of all the who is lights out in the eighth and\n[noise] and my response at that point was you've all they did his job his job was to get through the eighth and handle the Baltic trend kimbrell\n... what was the closure he is not going anywhere he will get the ball in the ninth inning with a weed every time unless it's a blog victory\nThat's his job if he blows it that's on him you know blame Alex Cora for going to his closer that's what you do\nBut it didn't happen ... general was stolen the ninth\nContinue the trends for the Boston bullpen throughout this entire World Series and now the red Sox are up two games to none and I see a lot of people on Twitter talking about the idea of the series being over and maybe this could be a sweep or a five game series and it's not going to come back to Boston\nSlow down I think we absolutely comeback to Boston for a game ... now I think the red Sox win this ... teams that go up to oh huge percentage they when the series I picked the rides\nI've seen other people picked the red Sox in six I don't know how many games it's going to be six or seven but I can tell you in my heart of hearts I Believe there will be a game six in Boston next Tuesday\nThe old cliche a series doesn't begin until it team loses a home game the series now shift to LA for three games at Dodger Stadium\nI don't know Syria I'm not talking to you every time I say serious or he thinks I'm Talking to her not talking to you\nI think the Dodgers will play better at home\nThere'll be warmer you could tell the temperature here in game two was much colder than in game one and you could tell watching these players looking at them when they showed the live shots into the dug out they were called and they were not comfortable\nAnd I'm not saying it had an impact on the way that they played but it definitely affected them a little bit right\nSo I I just firmly believe that they will play better at Dodger Stadium they'll get the boost by the crowd\nPlus it's Walker buell or against Rick pour sellouts not exactly for sale or the way that David prices pitching the last two starts three starts even he's pitching like an ace again\nMm taking out taking up by as and putting you know what was the wrong move putting in writing beds in ... in the right lessons right was the wrong well\nHere is so the da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da ... maneuver Z in this chess game by day Robards has cost the Dodgers\nAnd the right move is by Alex Cora have come you know no not really the right moves in advance of yes that they want but he's just playing ball he's just playing these he's playing the game mhm it's not necessarily Riley right playing the game\nAnd they Robert to do in thinking that went over that's what they ... they might be a problem is is over think\nMaybe I Do think that doctors the Dodgers will get a boost by being home they'll get a boost by the whether it will be warmer there'll be more comfortable course and I ... I think they will win true of the three games or maybe they do all three\nI just think that they will definitely with at least two in the series to head back to Boston for at least a game six you know how a manager David Roberts that I was gonna say you know and I will begin in Milwaukee that the Dodgers had that had to score early and often in order to keep pace with Milwaukee\nThey don't have to do that with yeah because you knew that once they went to Josh hater die bullpen was on on ... ... they don't have to do that with Boston and and we thought we see that with the with the with the ... by ... by ...\nI don't know because the way that the Boston bullpen is pitch through these ... game they're terrible no they've been pretty on ... that's not true\n'cause that's not true oh really their bullpen is ... Thirteen batters made it out in this game Nick well Beverly you guys out of the ... nine up nine down their guard their their bullpen will be a ...\nWe'll show it was shows weakness game three ... is the light will come out you'll see well\nLet's hear from a Dodgers manager day Robert on being down to\n\nWhere to find a way to win a baseball game I think coming in here I thought we play these guys pretty straight up obviously we we come out of here going home down to nothing but they made pictures when they needed to and um\nWhen they can we trust them they made the pitch and then when they fled and they were\nAnd then we didn't end up kind of a different\nMore specifically on the game to loss\nTo compete was there during you got to give credit to a price may consuming needed to\nWe had um we had them on the ropes that early on we stress some we have some situation like that it's got some British runners took our walks and the differences they got the ... when they need to do\nWhat about pitching Ryan meds and\nThe masses are that are guy or for quite some time with him he's pitched a big spots there of usage right there I'm not worried about that as he sees fresh pitch yesterday didn't throw to any pictures had a couple of days off coming into the series having off there tomorrow so\nPart of it was was was pretty easy and I just felt um I really liked him against peers and and that's what he's done it time and time again for the last couple of nights it hasn't worked out\nThe\n... man you don't have and he left right about hunger high tech yeah but he has though he has no we haven't so far this postseason he's he's come a big in the postseason just hasn't come up\n\nBut he has for them he has come in the pitch dwell for them in the postseason just\nDidn't happen here what kind of ... that you make them put in a guy that you know uh that the opposing team is gonna rock\n\nWell look you gave up the hit and he walked the guy but you guys are you know I'm the same thing happened in game one\nHe what this book aid I Know I Know I Know but here's the deal though with the exception of an okay you're gonna look at the bad performance what was that game a game five maybe I think it was against Milwaukee where he he he got hit got hit but\nBesides that the guys were pretty good he was good in the Atlanta series and he was good in in the first couple of Atlanta against ... Atlanta is not why understand and certainly not read I get that\nA man with a young team that had no experience in the polls he's been the guy med students been the guy that you go to imagine spoke after the game or here's what he had to say\n\nYou know kind of a good ad for a long time and then you walk a\nThon automatic destroyed\nAnd learn a little bit of you know\n... ... you needed one out inherited runners yeah you need it one out but the only place you walked dude\n[laughter] why wouldn't play and that's all you needed the debt you know\nUm yeah you are willing to one and you'll walk them\nI\nSpeaking of inherited runners this is something that I actually wanted to bring up with you let me pull it up here because our our very own Rob stats are actually retweeted this and I want to find out who the original person a tweeted out so just give me one second here and I find that\nUm man where was it it had to do with inherited runners and Clayton Kirsch I'll tell you would appreciate this as as a Dodger fan right that\nIf you take away the wrongs that were scored that were credited to him but\nThat he didn't\nAllow that hits or the walks to Dr ... is that right there yeah it makes sense I get to like ... 'cause you know um because you know that happens\nIn a you know right in match in getting get charged with the uh\nWith the runs you should ask it was ...

don't know who it's going to be for the raiders though if they get the first or second overall pick\nAnd keep in mind they have three first Tom picks you know they're going to spend one of them on either Nick both uh or at all over\nBecause they traded away at college Mac because now they didn't want to pay him so you're gonna draft one of the elite pass Russia's that are the projected top to fixing\nThe draft and now you're getting a lead pass Rauscher that's under contract under a rookie deal the best case scenario for them that's what they want to do so I absolutely see that happening\nBut other teams that are going to be competing for who knows what the browns are going to be this season the Colts the giants ... let me talk about the giants here for a second\nAnd then yeah cardinals forty niners also bad a lot of bad football teams this year but you know let's talk about this for a second here the New York giants have to be the most disappointing\nNFL team in recent memory\nCan you think of a team that actually felt before the season but they were going to be a playoff team and it turned out to be so bad\nI think the newer tries to make the playoffs I fell into the trap I did I fell into it a lot of people fell into it they still into it they thought\nThey were going to be a playoff team this year compete for the division shake one Barclay Odessa Beck and junior new contract revamp the offensive line Eli Manning one more go at it this team stinks\nAnd they're not getting any better the trading away everybody right here I Apple CEO later snacks hours and see you later who's going to be next to fire sale now in New York\nIs a complete different situation than what you have across town with the New York jets where they're not going to be a playoff team this year but by drafting Sam Donald at least you know the future's bright and we had Trent\nDon't run earlier this week and Trent Dover said well it's not going to be a mistake passing up on a quarterback if the giants have the number one or a top three pick next year and they end up with let's say a guy like Justin Herbert or whoever you view is the number one quarterback is it drew lock\nOr is it will grow your lot of people believe it's just in Herbert and I think so right now at least that's what I think\nSo but just in Herbert as your quarterback next year with fake one Barclay now all of a sudden the future looks a little better\nBut if they don't end up with a top tier quarterback you know say Columbus and can be five years into his career before the giants\nAre even sniffing a chance at the post season and this can be the berries Sanders winds all over again\nIt's incredible ... the turnaround from expectation to reality than what you've seen with the New York football giants in ...\nThe raiders as well but I just think for the raiders at least it's not the same as the giants because the giants expectations were both\nFrom the outside and also in that room I think the raiders expectations were from the outside but in that room clearly John Gurdon and and and McKenzie had a plan here which was to dump salary\nTo not be good and to rebuild this

way he lies career sixty point one great honors seven touchdown for interceptions forefathers he turned it over eight times in seven games not terrible sound like atrocious right morals is turn it over twelve times\nBut it's time for social change\nA whole new kind of invent better future we went back to help somebody like me\nTo college which ended up making the future better for everybody I

in\nInvesting better futures and when you went\nTo the un dot org slash invest [noise] a mind the terrible thing to waste a wonderful thing to invest\nPublic service announcement came by here\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThat we are going to be enforced and NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com fire still continuing in New York\nGiants a ship it off pieces left and right they traded Damon snacks terrorist in a two thousand and fix the first team all pro one of the best runs ... can't get to the quarterback who's a great run stopper\nForty fifth round pick to Detroit Lions let me tell you a great deal by the lions [noise]\nI mean he is one of the top according to pro football focus on the top run stopping defensive lineman an entire NFL the last three to four years here's the problem do you take him out on passing downs because you can't get to the quarterback so he's not an every down defensive tackle\nBut the New York giants brought him in for a lot of money member from New York Jets after the supervisor fifteenth either just couldn't afford to keep him look like a coup for the giants play great that first year but when you're making a good deal of money and the team's not winning and they're looking obviously cell and get draft picks and get younger guys like him are going to get dumped off\nThat's why the question in New York is who's next\nEither going to be a next yes of course there is you want to keep paying generous Jenkins on a five year sixty two and a half million dollar contract\nThe giants have already freedom thirty three million dollars of cap room next off these are the ones he likes jettison there'll be another Seventeen or so\nSo I figure if you made an offer for generous Jenkins you can have them if you make an offer for Olivier burning you can have and here's the problem though shouldn't Dave Gettleman the first year GM be on a hot seat considering he misjudged his roster maybe more than anybody else in the NFL did\nDave Gettleman believed that the New York giants were a couple of pieces away from truly competing how he invested in Eli Manning by not drafting a quarterback with a number two overall picks up the giants don't usually up\nAnd he's going to go to the grave and most New York giants fans are going to go to the grave saying they made the right choice drafting said well I'm Barkley\nBut if you start to sell because you weren't now officially in a massive rebuild who cares if you have a great running back you need that quarterback know rebuild know rebuild is complete until you have a real quarterback in place\nRight you can build pieces around but at the quarterback is not good you're not going to win enough games\nAsk the Jacksonville Jaguars the Jacksonville Jaguars that rebuilt the juggernaut right that defense well they've been getting a lot of points lately but the names are great\nPlayers are great maybe they're not putting it altogether if winter for that can stay healthy and that's a big concern 'cause he can stay healthy it'd be great\nBut the quarterbacks the big problem they misjudged the blade board also now they regret given given that contract and probably not offering a higher traffic to Kansas City to get themselves Alex Smith you put Alex Smith on the Jacksonville Jaguars you don't want that probably six and six probably five into right now\nNot three and four\nHe make a two game difference because he's not going to make stupid plays and throw foreigners sections of the games are going to happen it's not Alex Smith yes you're on your age and like\nA two year old would happen but but then you would have to give Alex Smith a contract extension like the Redskins fit right but would you rather give out she didn't want to do that in Chile than Blake boy wouldn't trade for our swift 'cause we know what Al Smith is a lot better than by bottles though and they gave him a two year deal lessons to your budget cut playboy left the season\nAnd parents out Smith you would have been\nOut to get sent him out new you would have been stuck with him for what three more years I mean we know what else is you can't what a civil Al Smith\nThe super bowl winning quarterback I saw that you've got rid of them but if you have enough pieces around like a defense in a running game\nYou know what you can pretty close\nYou are better shocked when\nI bleed morals is there to stay one more year his dad cap number next year sixteen and a half million this cap it's Twenty one million\nA year after that you can get out so that since she signed Blake morals to a two year deal for you know about thirty million bucks\nMaybe a little bit more I look at Al Smith still four year Ninety four million dollar expansion ain't got\nNo what is the breakdown in terms of\nYou know money and when you can get\nYou're Eighteen point four million cap it in twenty Nineteen twenty points for a million dead money fifty five million in twenty Eighteen forty million between Nineteen twenty million in twenty twenty\nSo you can get right so you'd have to hold onto them one more year longer than Blake morals\nThat's worth it it's worth it\nIs worth one more year the ...\nBut that's the problem so for the New York giants who were floundering as one of the worst teams in the NFL right now fighting now it seems like Arizona for the number one pick a better option would be true to train for Toronto Taylor\nYeah Dr Taylor or that now petty Bridgewater somebody like that we're made more data and well I think it would cost you more as younger yes\nThese has a higher ceilings and then tailor does his point you know said Gail around very quickly Al Smith yes similar quarterbacks Smith a better pass or the okay but tell it doesn't cost to his mother I drive from I mean listen I agree a hundred percent right now you have to figure out what to do\nTailor make the most sense you're Jacksonville more than ... here's here's the bottom line tell us not a championship quarterback I'm now so but here's the problem but here's the problem for the New York giants\nThey're rebuilding without the key component who's replacing Eli Manning\nTylenol letter forthright they've got to Richmond very raw did the giants really believe they drafted a starter when they took him in the fourth round they're going to play some games this year the what they have\nI'll tell you what's that going to stop them from having a top two or three big next year and trapping a quarterback be adjusted Herbert or Ryan's family or the get out to do or I Dwayne Haskins or somebody like that\nSo the New York giants in essence aren't\nMending be drafted the wrong player\nBy the moves they're making tearing apart this team\nThey generally get wrong and he lost the roll the dice and he went bankrupt\nAnd said well bart Lisa nice toys but he's not the guy that's going to get you to rebuild their quarterback would have been the guy that gave you some home All right

of being told how he you know\nStops Chris Paul from going to the Lakers and and that whole saga Laker fans have not forgotten about that I'm In the middle east and it's still kisses them off I think he got tired of hearing about it he he was like to argue that's not a good trade um\nI Would like to argue that I Am positive because it had member this happened\nRight after the lockout positive\nTo what happened is a bunch of owners called him up because you cannot like Chris ... go to the Lakers why did we just have a walkout why did we tried to flatten the you know flatten out the talent pool and now this happens I there was no way you will ever convince me that's not what happened\nWhile you mentioned Chris Paul in Iran do and you know Glenn big baby Davis and others have now come out in calling out Chris Paul is being a bad team made why is it that for so many years of his career\nI talk on the show Sean talked about it to hurt the fact is we always thought of him is this really good dude and you know Chris Paul is just as great teammate why we now finding out that are more than one person believes that he's actually a lousy teammate\n... Chris Paul is I don't think he's a bad team made I think what he pushes everybody hard all the time now he does this to himself but he is ... less and criticism and calling guys out and saying you're on the wrong spot and pointing out for those and by the way\nLife is not the highest IQ player in the league he's in that top\nFive or ten like him abroad and a few other ... that are just ...

Cooper was traded I again that's but that's a petty nature of today's athlete right that's\nWhat you have to deal with but what apparently made people mad is that they were under the impression from John grooming themselves that they were going to try to mark Cooper\nIt's a business maybe that's a little petty on the players' part\nBut if you're John grown and you are back into coaching after a nine year hiatus sitting in the booth make a lot of money he the one that has to adapt to today's player\nFifty three players aren't gonna adapt to you you're not bill that will check for crying out loud by the way that will check when someone else I don't know if in and work works in a women because at that point what you're getting into right those guys have been a part of that team for a while\nLike they'll they'll be okay with the Malcolm bowler situation which I still don't understand him being bench for the super bowl\nBecause they're like God spell check and he's got five rings so there's a decent reason not as dumb as it is there must be a decent lease right keep running through a wall for Bill Belichick John groove and can't get away with that 'cause you got one Super Bowl from back in the day when Tony ... steam so that's an issue\nSo players talking to the athletic and we're talking multiple players just one of them apparently he was willing to actually have is named use just one player that was tight and least Smith\nEverybody else really kind of ah going after how this quote the\nMac traders are real stiff jab at the Cooper almost like a knockout punch especially because we had just walked back in the door from the by we didn't want to believe it was coming and coach said we weren't going to trade him\nYou see John grooming doesn't care about his players because to him most of those guys got any way\nYou see they don't have the luxury of ten years John ... who is not going anywhere Mark Davis is not going to buy him out and pay me the million bucks to go somewhere right he can be the biggest failure he might end up being a huge failure in Oakland and then slash Vegas\nBut current doesn't care in the long term project he's got time to build that team he's like Lynch\nAnd Shanahan in the San Francisco they all got six year deals instead of the customary four or five six year deals which means they are in it for the long haul management understands that or else you know ownership doesn't give you a six year deal Mark Davis isn't giving John ... tenure deal to turn it around in one day\nThey have five first round picture something in the next two years something ridiculous like that so that three first round picks a bunch of other ... whatever it is I Know they have five first round pegs actually they have three and the year after that they have to\nBear the cowboys bears and their own pick next year and then the bears pick the year after that\nBut I just think this is not a match made in heaven and when you have a coach that feels comfortable because you can't get rid of him he's going to take his time of players don't have that time\nPlayers their careers are short players want to win players don't want want to be a part of a team that's on a long range rebuild why one day they don't want to sign up for that they're always two three four years of their career on a team that's not going anywhere just because that coach at six more years passed before\nSuddenly situation\nBut here's the problem on top of it Mark Davis can't tell nor can Reggie McKenzie the GM tell John crude and what to do\nHe's not going to listen guys I grew I think they have all the answers guys like grooming believe that their way is the only way and if it's not their awaits the highway\nBut he also especially regimen kids he doesn't have the luxury\nOf having a deal that keeps you there nine more years passed this year that's why I was so stupid and Mark Davis to give John Ghouta ten year contract it's dumb\nYou see the difference with that in college because you look at the jumbo Fisher deal with that ten years eighty million or something like that but you know fish or ten years Seventy five or something look players come and go in college right recordings half the job of being a college football coach we know jumbo Fisher can recruit\nJohn grew doesn't have to recruit not as ...

work\nI mean it's just they're better team but the reason why that's the team that won sixteen more games the red socks look ... sixteen games it's significant when the Dodgers would've been sixteen games behind the red Sox and the standings it's ridiculous\nThey don't play the same schedule dude no Boston as ours are scheduled hundred wins also includes Toronto in the oral and and the old who

no one's getting the begets for them you're not gonna win World Series games like that over team like the red Sox their juggernaut do last team to win one hundred and eight or more and not when the world series Seattle of course one sixty tides go out to Oakland the bay area buddy ray right away in BC sports bay area joining us\nRaid talking about the John grew in situation you read the stories that are out there nationally you are right there in the bay area re\nHe's it as bad as we're hearing here in New York the anger from players they felt kind of lie to about the Maori Cooper trade they're mad they heard it in ... you know from social media and the media itself and not John ... is this being overblown or is there a lot to it\n[noise] or there there's a fair amount to it I a lot of a lot of people who are in that room every day a quake get the sense that the play its dawned on the players that this team\nUndergoing a full on rebuilding that most of them are not going to be working in Oakland uh much beyond the raiders exist in itself so they all sort of view themselves a short time er and sort of out of the loop\nAnd so yeah I I think I think it's a real thing and I think rudeness probably missed calculated that level of what the rebuild has the main because he's still got to get these guys to play pretend Mormon weeks\nRaise it often issue that he's been out of coaching for nine years in in that timeframe the players get younger the millennial generation seems to be a lot softer and I'm from the generation maybe grew and remembers where you can yell at players play that Chuck E. routine and get results is he a guy that maybe hasn't adapted to the new player today\n[noise] um maybe a little bit I mean I I think the bigger problem is that he's he's really guilty of impatience\nWhen you're going to to rebuild and you're the coaches and the general manager you have to figure out a way to\nTo temper what you do and the way you do it and what he's done basically is is blow everything up and worry about the shrapnel later so as a result\nThe players feel like\nThey're not part of the process\nAnd hard enough playing football when they're when you're\nWhen you're fully engaged I mean it's you know there one in five they're not they're not happy\nThey pick the coaching staff and the organization doesn't have their backs are and you know maybe this you just temporary because of the the the open road the coup for a while but I just don't feel like bacon and they're getting told the truth about anything and they're having to spirited out on their own which means that\nYou know they're going to fill in the blanks the way they want to it when that happens you've got a real problem\nNBC Sports bay area's re route of joining us going deep enforcement NBC Sports radio the whole Derek car situation did he shed a tear did he not his leadership\nSomething that his questioning that lock them because my whole point earlier talking about a raise if they like him and respect him as a leader and maybe she had to tear because he's been very banged up there are a lot of injuries when it comes to Derrick car they've all accumulated [noise] so what did he did share to shed a tear is this kind of an indictment on his leadership [noise] I\nI think I think this part is sort of overflowing because look if you ever tried to hammer in jail and you get your thumb your eyes water a little\nBit not me right on the sidewalk\nOkay today [laughter] then you know hats off your urine whether or not I don't\nThink he he I don't think it was a poll on cry but you know it's a it's a picture that you know looks bad [noise] and I think when you're one in five\nAny useful do when you want to explain why things are going well I don't do that it's so much about his leadership as much that is part of the whole information vacuum [noise] um if\nIf they still in full core fully engaged in and everything I don't think they'd be you know\nThat this would have been much of an issue at all I think you know everybody knows how tough car is probably sufferer then he ought to be but you know when when emotions are wrong like this everything looks bad everybody feels that everything's towns bad so I think\nThat part probably a little overblown do they believe in him as an elite quarterback probably not but that that's different than saying he he cries on the side [noise]\nHe's he's gotten a truly untouchable I mean if you buy John ... saying that or do you think that if the right offer came along they would literally consider shipping up there a cartoon this quote unquote rebuild\nI think the only thing they won't consider is dealing him before June first because\nThey kept benefits of holding on to him a job and are are pretty clear um if\nAnd it's certainly possible that he doesn't listen I'm going to be the time to do anything about that\nBecause they don't have anything else cars are going to get so well I think he even money would be gone you know on June second I think it's really unlikely that they move them now now that\nI thought it was really unlikely that they were going to look back and I think we know how that turned out\nYou've got cars that good ray what's your assessment of the car at this point in his career\n[noise] um I think he's a radical I think he's a little gun shy I think he doesn't have great talent around them uh I think you know they really only got one sort of you know go to player on the fence and that marks on what\nAnd that's it and he's not he's not he's not on a on a twenty five area game aids so ours got to do more than he's doing now and he doesn't really have weapons to do that with so everything about you know quarterback plays intertwined with the opposite wine or what the bird\nRight in there I think he puts up you know\nNice looking numbers but they don't really help them win so I think that's where he is he's clearly not elite eve okay he's about middle of the fact because don't forget there are some bad quarterback\nRe real quick with the knowledge this team will be gone in a couple of years and this is going to be a lengthy rebuild obviously rude and probably use you know proving that with the moves what's the fan base like are they still going to show up to these games next year and a half\nUm [noise] I think it's going to be interesting to see what kind of crowd they get Sunday against Indianapolis Colts are not a great team I think you could see a lot of people who will either come to the game tailgate and go home or maybe just not come at all but\nIf they build a building Sunday then you sort of have to think that as bad as as quick spin that this is this is their bedrock fan base he's fifty thousand people a Sunday will be a real litmus test about how much longer people are going to tolerate what they're looking at now\nIt's a bad situation and say the least of the Oakland Raiders but our buddy ray rattle NBC Sports fairy

I I Want you know I Want to classic I Want to I Want to feel the the the electricity in the building I haven't felt that it said the red Sox are a better team than the Dodgers I Do think the Dodgers take two or three in Los Angeles\nAnd then the red Sox are up three to coming home and bats are there I mean I'm Sorry but\nYou know you cannot get the red Sox the the thing about the red socks off season we talked about yesterday their numbers are inflated they played a lot of bad teams they had all these things but they are good team\nAnd what Roberts is trying to do is just trying to play matchups he's done it all season long he doesn't uses a relievers when he's trailing 'cause he tries to protect weeds and that's always been his ...\nSaid that the red Sox don't allow the series to come back and they take it in four or five they get to that hundred Nineteen when market as you said it was kind of a softer regular season playing teams like Baltimore is this an all time great team\nNo I Know I I don't I don't compare him you know I don't think they look like that you know there are a good team um I think that what they're Red Sox season and what this World Series might just example fires the disparity in the American league and I thought that they were so many God awful teams\nAnd the red Sox just never let up and you know what they don't have you know when Steven Wright got hurt there was a bullpen deficiency out score push the button he tried these starters on there for all day at work\nHe has just come up bases and everything he's done so you know my attitude for for for ... they've been in the right place they've been the recipient of it but they deserve all the credit in the world they are not at all time great team I'm there's nothing they can do to to find that\nA to change that that that my it's just a product of what they are\nWhat can the Dodgers do at this point in terms of pure town the red Sox have just a better team you said it I said when it comes out of what happens is you know we've got to step up what exactly has to happen for the Dodgers to have a chance here if they even have one\nIt's obviously a game three you know if they win\nYou know ... they they they try to win game for if they win games for the next thing you know it's tied you know the fact of the matter is is that you know they always say a series is in a series and so someone wins on the road so the Dodgers will try to hold serve if they do they're up three to going back to Boston it will see\nMy attitude is they take two or three of the question will be is whether or not the tightest series too too 'cause then all of a sudden there'll be intrigued\nVersus do they fall behind three one encourage shot in his last potential that start as a Dodger ah you know pictures them to victory forces the game five forces everybody to fly across country just for a coronation\nBoston or baseball inside of set the average joining us going deep dance wars and NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com give me what separate believes to be the pitching strategies in game three when it comes to the starters now with Boston up two games on the Dodgers down two games to none\nI well you know at this point you going to go to the kid you know they're going to go to a viewer\nAnd you know he's been he's been great all season you know he has been superb ...

very inept bomb maker who stood out seven bombs none of which would off including in the case of the bombs into CNN address to John Brennan the banning of white powder that was nothing there was not a

what the motive was a but either way you slice it gets an act of terrorism [noise]\nExactly and you know this individual or group of individuals feel disenfranchised so much and they feel like there is such an injustice that they're willing to risk not only their lives in in making these bombs but the the recipients and everybody who delivers packages in this country why\nSo uh it's pretty disturbing in general I think they have to go to the extreme\nThat's an important point to emphasize the the mere making of a bomb the handling of a bomb certainly the opening of a package containing

intercepted prior to their ability to explode may say that they were never capable of exploding even though they may have had black powder end up\nRight now investigators are working under the assumption that whoever bill fans suspicious devices tried to keep the weight down so that they could just drop them in a mailbox rather than going to a post office and risking getting caught on surveillance cameras\nThey believe these devices war functional but because they did not explode investigators will be able to deconstruct the devices and then try to trace the components\nCBS News senior national security analyst Fran Townsend joins us from what are your sources telling you about this sophistication of these devices they're using words like crude and low ordinance really what that means is it's not that they wouldn't have hurt or maimed someone if it had gone off and detonated\nBut what it says is more about the bomber himself this is not a standard recipe the sort of thing we've talked about before seeing off the Internet\nThis is an individual it it looks as though they're all constructed in a similar or the same way all the outside packaging is identical the FBI and the NYPD or looking for it [noise] they believe is single bomber homegrown\n... there's no indication so far that this has got anything to do with an overseas threat and I think the operating assumption of the investigators is that it is home grown how how long do you think it will take to get to this person or people you know this is not the Unabomber was a single bomb a long time in between bombs\nUh and quite meticulous\nThis individual has made some real mistakes right envelopes are handled\nMailing labels which were typed were then put on with tape tape has fingerprints on it

F. HR it's time now for the morning magazine brought to you by comfort air heating and cooling plumbing\nNow with the morning magazine here is Carl he'll keep\nSaying Jerry in good morning everyone and welcome to the Thursday edition of the morning magazine on AM Thirteen twenty and streaming live that W F HR dot com it's time for another visit to our friends and family natural foods which you can find at nine ten west grand avenue\nHere in Wisconsin Rapids on a beautiful less side Stephen and Katrina are here and they brought a lot of stuff for me this morning so\nI Know there will be a period that like we always like to call it experiment with ... what the outcome Stephen and Katrina hit dirt from family natural foods good morning\nYeah good morning everyone\nMy colleague of mine in every line okay\nSo where did you want to begin to I guess we always like to start off with what's happening in family natural foods it seems like there's always a lot of things happening\nYeah it's it's you know the change in season you know brings a lot of changes in tourist store and um one thing that we we decided to continue we had such a great response from the community on her or outdoor farmers' markets um we were doing the the ones the third Thursday the month which is the same\nAnd we were doing that kind of outdoor farmer an artist and market and it was an evening marketed was different than other markets there's only once a month\nBut we we realize that there was with them all you know closed and not being transformed into this great YMCA and boys and Girls Club cetera\nThat there's a need and the community for an indoor farmers' market and we weren't ready to take on the every week thing but we wanted to continue our market are evening farmers' market\nAnd and bring it inside so we we did a lot of clean water housecleaning um thank you to a tailor and Joel who are ... with us here in all the time that they they were the ones that like let's do it [noise]\nUm and they they're like you know ... the guy um you know he owns on the farms and he he goes to farmers' markets all the time he's the one he was headed up a lot of this stuff so this is something could turn and I are behind them we liked the idea we thought about in the past but he's the one who kinda got the fire started and um [noise]\nBrought it inside now so we just finished our first um indoor farmers' market it was the last\nThursday last Thursday yup hum and we'll have another one you know in in November on the third Thursday them on\nTheir back and we'll have a little different flare we might be defenders are there different artists because we are really helping to um have artist there and going into the holiday season as\nYou know November's approaching slowly\nUm hopefully solidly glad you said that she I sell 'em we really want to still have an art emphasis they're you know I'm so you can start thinking about buying things locally for people for Christmas or\nThanksgiving whatever it might create idea and the cool thing about the next market it's going to be like even that the third Thursday at each month\nOlder than I guess we should mention too if you want to keep up with everything that's happening have family natural foods a check on your Facebook page\nYes yeah the Facebook page Stephen I'm going to give Stephen the credit I I Do a little bit on it but I'm Steven update that quite a bit and give you a post on\nYou know in the process of making the event for the next you know the next presentation on stress and stuff so\nThe up you know um people can look it up right now on their computers you know by the time\nBut we get all this stuff is basically done so we're going to have the the ... or the start of the stress them an event on Facebook page and then we already have the market's up there so if you want\nYou can kind of you know say that you're going to the the markets among you'll continue to update you and if there's any changes or for improvements or whatever on that event then you'll get those are like how\nCan you know one of those things right now because we're into cold and flu season is immune health and I know folks come to family natural foods for help on doing that in a pro active way so\nI'll give you the floor how can you help folks\nYou know this is going to be kind of like a recap from what we were we had that are presentation just recently [noise]\nUm and it's it kinda goes into you know how do you think about your immune system and and how do you stay ahead of it you know the worst thing\nIs when you get caught off guard and he gets sick and then you just get you know it takes it takes a toll and it takes time you know we're all disease so we don't have time for that and a lot of times I think that's why we do get sick because our body's telling us hey you've been stressed you've been busy\nYou've been exposed to these time for you to relax your side for you to relax and whenever ready for it when that comes but I'm In that I think does get into the stress component which I think being you know come to the next presentation 'cause you know our bodies are holistic system it's not just a single thing so\nThe stress you know plays a big role in people getting sick so if we can reduce stress we probably won't get sick as much but um [noise]\nSex trade whatever kind of some of the take away from the president\nStill yeah according to the great presentation on it and I'm like Steven stay in of course stressed plays a role and then you know sleeping and poor eating habits can be hired lecture sugar is a big one that can make our body is a little weaker when we're eating a lot of extra sugar so be mindful of\nLike how you're eating is important especially for him around the\nTime to eat a lot of times people don't take especially when we get into the holiday season and people are busy\nYeah like take time to sit down and eat a meal and you know maybe you're cooking a little bit more garlic this time of year because that's so good for your immune system um but absolutely that's a great point like we don't take time to eat were always well here quicker or I only have five minutes to prepare something and so it's it's going to be quick and maybe not as healthy\nAnd and also appreciate the people you're sitting there with you and Pam for you know like you turn off the television and you know sit across the table and you know appreciate your company\nThroughout your buddies rather than a man or a share a laugh or to or yup yup\nYeah because you know that's the that's the other part of you know food is it's a social thing and it's always been a point yeah um so I think you're you're on the right track girls just take that time so you have\nSomething else that I think we forget about to um is\nMovement so our lymphatic system it's all of our body and it helps with detoxify in our system and whether it's just going for a simple walk to\nBeing at the gym extraordinary that you're there every day you know for three hours I'm not saying you have to do that any of 'em but just getting that movement is important because it helps you were lymphatic system detoxify\nThose bugs in that stuff that just sitting in your system so that's important thing to do um to get that right movement and even if it's a ten minute walk just moving your body\nThey say it's ... minutes a day will do or the numeral I mean is this amazing what ten minutes a day just for a walk he'll do for you yeah so simple and if you can do three of those now impression and how that would be good for stress relieving do absolutely\nYet see and now you're you're is it all coming altogether all get him a good student not free to do that yet I'm Still a few other things of course that people can come in and we can talk to you more about immune health because they know where we're limited on time but\nProbe addicts are really good for keeping your body is strong and and preventing things as well as if you get something out and getting over the sickness faster\nThan something people don't realize is a lot of your immune system's in your guts yet I forget what the numbers like Seventy percent or something it's outrageous she's a larger sense so you know like\nMaintaining you know good general got health and you know probiotics and and good fibers in ... all these things are are part of that um that is does the big part in you know again keeping you healthy you know reducing stress getting sleep exercising all these kind of things can help with it was keeping healthy\nOkay we got a number of things here so\nYeah we should start with a sample for yeah Carl Carl time experiment with Carl time outcomes to cast are on the on\n... school I visited L. they're very they're very people may be heard a little bit more well All right Carl liquid right there we just had a tiny little\nI ... and the color of\nA void Richard Engel like yeah it's nice it's\nSweet but there is no added sugar to it so it it's clean\nUm it's um it's got so many good prevention immune immunity prevention to it as well as if you get sick it will help you get over that cold faster but ...\nSays elder berries sir I just took a syrup and it's actually by our brand family natural foods um Oh yes you have your own brand that's cool you know it's like ... are brand that one that happened to me the oregano there but um that's cool if I get to lend lease so I Want to make sure that she's getting a very clean and product\nUm and this is something I give to her on a actually a daily basis for as long as you're an athlete something an adult to take yeah every day or adults it's great for immunity now whether you take it if you're just starting to feel like typical in the back of your throat or you do it more preventive typically\nI'm just so it's a powerhouse it's it's so good for you to benefit\nOf antioxidants which was good for you overall like day to day so a lot of times I'll do this time of year I just started taking a small spoonful each day [noise]\nUm but I always want to have it in my cabinet because as soon as you feel like a train and stuff like that tickle you start to feel like you're getting sick or maybe you're just around a bunch of sick people and you don't want to get sick that you want to have that stuff available so you can take it\nRight then like you know not you know it's seven ten o'clock at night or something you really do I need to go get this and then you got to go outside and it's cold out near you know like that's not good you want to have these things ready for\nYou know and I think that's a lot of a lot of staying healthy as this kind of being organized unprepared on this\nThing and that's why you stop and visit family natural foods that time nine ten grand avenue and you're saying listen I Want to stock up the last guest guest I had my phone interview with I had her go go through what would be a good\nMedicine cabinet yeah or basically kind of an anti medicine get good healthy for us to stay healthy and I'm One item we should be in it writes smart so okay that yeah that would be pleasant enough to take\nYeah and kids love it lonely she like students had before she the year and a half she takes it on a regular basis and there's always like she likes to she looks forward to to the morning when she takes oh an editor so yeah it's a good one um\nOkay then you have other things if you do get to like say a little tickle or something you have natural ways of dealing with here\nYeah we have laws injured that have silver which has a really good for in a um senior immunity and kind of viral viruses and such and then and then you can honey is is um a certain kind of honey that is got a lot of anti back viral properties to it and it is and really good [noise]\nUm we have things for the flu I'm Still selling them is it a homeopathic and like the lady Marge that you ...\n... this is similar different company but this helps and this works really got this is one like the one hand before you got to have it stacked up in your medicine cabinet because when you when you get the flu you take this right away and it it will your symptoms like half the amount of time that you'd be sick if you take this regularly you won't take as long\nAs it and like I remember in college I had a roommate\nUm and there was a couple of other people next door also they're only everybody started getting sick at the same time and I started to have the same symptoms and I took it and like a day or two later I was pretty much back to normal and these guys are dragging on like two or three or four days like attorney said almost twice as long\nAs ... big like you know I remember that a couple of symptoms down and you know basically and a half and it was\nYou know again that was that was you know one example but I've I've had it you know even like growing up like and we've had it at home and it's always been something we've had at our house you know kind of in the medicine Kevin these things also I don't know if Marge talked about when she was on air but don't actually like expire I mean there's\nStill know that she did talk about that\nYeah it's really fascinating I mean this does have an expiration date on it\nUm which is quite a ways out there two thousand twenty three or something like the future but um\nBut you know like really they they don't even know where you're at that point on and so that that's something that's kind of nice about you know if you're going to keep something your medicine Kevin you also don't want to get old so a lot of these things would be good for a couple of years you know probably maybe even a bit longer but the homeopathic will be good for really as long as he needed to be talking yeah\nKids might um uh have in their room at that and teach you what to look for um and so it walk you through all different things such as um [noise] uh\nI'm concealment and hidden compartments and massacres um and what I'm you know a ways that they can hide or alcohol or tobacco um clothing\nWhat brands and hiding compartments in the insides of their seems in their clothing or in their hats are just different things um things that you were I Would never even think to look for but teaching parents how\nTo what to look for and what are some of the signs um\n[noise] and so this is something that we've just started and we're kind of kicking off and we're taking around but then the the part that next step of that is so so what so what if you do find something er so what if you do um you know I think that there might be something then what do you do next so then the next part is yeah\nHaving that conversation but that first step is you're absolutely right to keep an open mind and I think the biggest thing is what I already said you come in with emotion so we always say you know um do you take a step out first so um you know\nI just have a gym today it just had this conversation with someone and I said you know start small pick one thing that you want to talk about and one thing you know write it down on a card [laughter] you know because you're going to come in and you're going to be cell emotional and you're going to speak you you're going to spew all this stuff out\nAnd you know what's going to get and you're going to start accusing and you're you're going to start\nYou know I'm you know saying all this stuff and\nCould you what'd you should you why did you do that you know and you don't want that um because first and foremost what is usually what parents want can I ask what you know what do you want and it's why wants to know that I Love them\nI Want to know that I you know I Want them to know what I'm going to be here no matter what when that's what you have to say\nAnswered them and we will deal with all that other stuff later but first and foremost that's what you need to convey and that's what they need to know 'em and so that's if that's what you're at that's what your messages and you start off with that and you kick it off with that\nAnd again and if you have to have a little piece of paper and you have to write that down and that's the only message you haven't you write it down so that you go in and you don't get sidetracked and you don't get all of a motion because you will\nBecause we're humans and that's what happens right um you know keep it and keep it simple um another thing we say is bring somebody with you um have somebody else with you have a friend to have a you know I'm\nA sibling someone else not necessarily your spouse because a lot of times they're going to be just as an emotional to 'em but to be there as your support so that if you do get overwhelmed um you know are totally work lumped in with emotion that they can you know call me down and you know take a break and you know pull it back\nUm so that's you know again kind of keep it going but\nKeep it short you know really concise and again take notes with you said that you're just gonna keep it right on target but it's an open mind again because if you start off with that negative and you know those you know you should have could have what are you know all the roads and accusing and negative right off the bat\nAnd I'm not saying you don't feel that way because you sure do and you have the right to and you have the right to all those emotions that you have\nBut that's not how you start off because if you start off that way you're going to shut it down and your ... might never get that conversation back\nAnd and the second part of the point two answers what are the most the kid might respond to protest about what you do understand me you don't understand what I'm going through you don't understand my feelings and ... the point is put yourself in your teens shoes\nYeah so if you you know try to consider what they might be going through what emotions what situations what things might be happening so if we try to consider whites um is pushing them to this point I'm so you know are there things happening at school at the things happening at work out of their billing issues um what\nIs going on because all you know there's a cause there's there's always the cause so try to instead of again thinking about what's the end what else is going on and put yourself into their perspective because even as adults you know a lot of times um we say oh well when I was a kid you know we did this and it never did that\nAnd I don't do that I'm thinking about you know you've been stress even you know and we've all done things that yeah we\nDeal with things in different ways and not everybody is the same so um there's a ... something's going on so trying to put yourself have empathy put yourself in their in their shoes and think okay you know something's happening here let's you know\nLet's try to have you ever think about it from that perspective and you know what's going on so\nThat goes along too with your about your or concise message like be clear about your goals but I see those to kind of going being tied together\nSo that's why I'm saying if you you know write it down um and go in very very small so you know we're not going to talk about ten things we're not going to have this whole long drawn out thing\nReally really short and concise because again motions are going to be high on both sides and if you go in with all this stuff for a ... called diary of the mouth and it all comes out nothing's gonna happen so if you come in with you know one or two things and you have you know two goals and you want to say there was just a couple of things in short\nThat's all we're going to convey and it's going to come out and you're going to be pretty successful and if you have a good conversation today chances are we're going to have good conversation tomorrow and it's going to lead to tomorrow but if I shut you down today\nAre we going to get to them I don't know so keep it short keep a concise you know have a goal and then we'll get to tomorrow and then we can have another one tomorrow or tonight and you know but little step start small and build up and then you'll get to the next one to the next one to the next one I'm so try you know think about\nA little baby steps but really short concise and then build on it and go from there because if you do have that emotional diarrhea of for lack of a better where you're not going to get to the next step you're going to get shut down and you won't get\nThere and the next two to our time and very well together along with that strategy be common relaxed be positive\nYeah so and they're very very hard so that's why I said I'm doing things like you know writing it down\nKnowing what you want to say trying to keep it actually scripted out said this to the person this morning I was talking to script out what you want to say like verbatim script out what you want to say because when you get in there you're going to be very very emotional and you might not be able to get it out you're going to\nGet all you know your words are going to get jumbled does if somebody said this to me my words get all jumbled them or you know I get sidetracked and then I get afterward I feel so bad and I beat myself up because that's not what I wanted to say yup scripted out literally scripted out what you want to say and stick to the script\nUm that's okay because it shows that you you know you really are trying and you want it to get their um the next one sounds silly but be positive because we know and you if you say this and you can say that doesn't work\nWe know scare tactics don't work we know [laughter]\nWe do we know that anger doesn't work we know that shame doesn't work we know that the you know you disappoint me it doesn't work it doesn't um and so you don't really you know start with the positive so even you know things like you know\nThank you for thank you for sitting down with me and even if it's just as little as that you know I really appreciate you you know sitting down with me and if that's all you can come up with that is okay because that's good or you know I think you for your honesty um you know you you know for being here\nI just those are really you know positive things so you really try with that and really stay away from the you know the shame or the negative um because that anger and that scare tactics and that kind of stuff we know that that doesn't work\nAnd that's just going to shut down that conversation and that's not what we want to do we want to open up conversation and not close it off\nAnd two ways we do that first off or finding a comfortable setting and don't lecture yeah yeah I Know or to keep ... but\nYeah and the funny part about all of these things that we're talking about these worked for everybody it's not just for your team so you know be the same kind of things or employer dealing with them and\nI say that if we were having a difficult conversation with anybody I'd say the same Ghana things um\nAnd that's you know it's it's a difficult conversation um but yeah absolutely so you know I'm really is sit through that uh you know you're you're not going to confront them you're not going to approach um you know in front of their friends and that's not going to work\nSo you know try to make it as open and inviting as you possibly can um respect them um and ah again you know be aware of the things that are going on so I'm\nOne of the things that I really encourage is um and it's worked again when we

forest home Gary Klein rams beat writer for the LA Times now joining us on the Schneider orange hotline Gary how you doing today\n[noise] I'm doing well thanks for having me\nYou've got to see them in a new team out there and uh well you know they're playing some really good football they're picked to win the NFC a by many of you know before the season started an even more so now but tell us about this team or the ranch Pacific Lee the help of his chain\n[noise] well you know as you as you mentioned I think after those offseason acquisition\nUh players like it's cheap to leave their markets feeders and in ... and branding cooks the rams that didn't stand pat after last season under a first year coach Sean McVeigh and uh they play they play very well you know they've they've won at times with her up and said ties with their defense and at times with everything including the special teams\nI'm so to this point they've been very fortunate you know other than to lead a who is out with a a an ankle injury that's going to keep them out till about week nine now receive or keep Cooper cop\nOr who's gonna who will probably miss this week uh um you know there otherwise relatively healthy so as you mentioned I think there are a favorite kind of coming in to win the NFC but we'll see you know it's a long season and that there are only about halfway there\nSo with the Green Bay Packers coming to town off of a buy a healthier I'll say Aaron\nRodgers even though he's ready to show the brace but I don't want to do so just yet they've got a good wide receiving corps the China and Jimmy Graham is a feeling a little bit better and they've got a formidable run game at least they can sustain a and help Aaron Rodgers how big of a threat do you think there's often poses to the rams and is this one of the better off as they face so far the season\nI think it's a it's a a a very big threat to the rams are who struggled a few weeks ago against the Seattle Seahawks with Russell Wilson running around back there ah they struggle defensively for most of the game against the Minnesota Vikings with Kirk Cousins so\nUh this is a defense that at at times has been dominant as they were last week but at times is shown a propensity to give up a lot of yard at your end points um so I think you know Green Bay ability to score with Aaron Rodgers on a healthier than I think there was a good chance that they'll do that the question is\nUh you know as a defense going to be able to slow down the rams often enough\nTo uh to keep you know give Roger the chance to work his magic\nAnd this is the first time really I think that the defense for the Packers has really been altogether their secondary with Kevin king back in\nAh junior Alexander looks to be coming back in in in Josh Josh in their own young but you got your among Williams back there tell me about Jared golf and what he's been able to do or fourteen touchstones on the season he's I don't want to say he's been again manager because you've been better than than I think that's an unfair uh how did you tend to use for him but he's he's been very good\nDown field and he's really progressed in his reads\nWell you're right he has taken a big step since last year uh but I don't think it's necessarily unfair to call him a gay manager Sean McVeigh system is set up a especially with the personnel that they have now\nDon't you

closing the games that they shouldn't win\nThat they really have it those are the games did bother me so if they go three into we're all happy if they go foreign one we're happy but that doesn't mean they're out of the woods because injury plays a part in his team because they're so thin from their frontlines starters to their backup players\nTake for example use ... or ... or God Forbid both in the ... comes to a grinding halt with or without Aaron Rodgers he simply can't move in the pocket because the pressure would be collapsing on him then you're using a two or three ... three tight and said\nTo be able to to be able to compensate for the blocking and things don't go well this team was only a couple of injuries away Ted Thompson's calling card used to be good talented players any gaps they don't even have that anymore or good against trying to build a team from nothing\nCan't you know even though I'm a great Packer fan and great for the three of them I think that's a bit of a stretch I mean whole three into but beyond that I always say I hope they're three and to know kind of guarantee case and that's what my fingers caught because like you have the games they shut fold out\nFor the game that we won by a margin we have not been so I'm On the time\nYeah I appreciate the phone call and I you know what I Can't argue with that\nMy point would be that I think that this team has gotten healthy it's going to be the first time that everybody's pretty much together um which should make this team better uh it's still a very ... I mean just ongoing by the bench alone and they've been able to kind of run\nI don't want us to Russia but they've been able to move the football their problem has been stalling inside the opponents thirty five yard lines and selling selling for fuel goals [noise] you know I mean if you want to look at it as okay they've had a couple of losses of games that had they kicked field goals they could have won\nThey could have one in Detroit they could have won and beat Minnesota\nSo yeah we are we talking about tea with only a couple of losses you know I mean in in in zero in the apartment and then all of a sudden you're looking at a drastically different outlook because they've been able to pull off some of those games I think they're going to have that ability to do so\nBut it is not\nYou know I don't know how to put it it's a tough schedule LA's a damn good football team they are going to come after Aaron Rodgers until he proved that he can kill them on the run\nAnd if I had to say some of the biggest things for this Green Bay Packers team to overcome wind defensively speaking you are going to have to stop tied girly and then hope that\nYou've got enough in the secondary to to kind of shut down what it is they're doing their little banged up in the wind receiving corps right now\nTo shut down ... Gurley uh in in in maybe just maybe you're able to kind of you know put the rams by the wayside so to speak may Jared golf one dimensional and hope that he really is and the real deal I mean they they're all very balanced attack and they can get you from anywhere\nI don't know how the Packers are going to stop 'em and I who put it this way I don't expect them to stop them if you can hold them to twenty points your last year when the ball game\nBut I don't know how you're going to do that and then often simply speaking\nCan't settle for a lot of field goals this team has to put the ball in the end zone\nAnd the biggest adjustment for them is run the ball a little bit keep it close and then in addition to that we talked about it a little while ago with Gary quantity LA Times Aaron Rodgers has got to be able to say okay the down field stuff isn't there I got to be able to take the wide open window moves six your best defense\nStay on the field move the stakes put it put together a long drives you are going to be successful and we haven't seen that consistently out of this team so\nAgain going back to their best defensive they're off and it still holds true today it has been for a long long time Aaron Rodgers has to be able to not only just staying in in ... game every now and that\nAnd be consistent with it but\nBut give if the matchups there but the players not take the take the sure thing there is no\nYou know there there is no shame and taking an eleven yard pass play moving mistakes and living to fight for four more down there just isn't and there has been at times probably I\nSeven or eight maybe ten times this year we've all screen but my God he's wide open any looks right at images doesn't throw the football he's looking for the match so we'll see if uh we'll see if the Packers\nTake what the defense is giving them and make them pay for it or if we watch a lot of what we've been watching a five five eight three zero eight six for eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight\nIf you want to chime in by all means ah give it a shot by the way great to me by our friends that are ... on Twitter\nTalking about some cousins cells usually like any one of these things a day and he shows the picture of the uh the character fat bastard\nMy battery [laughter]\nLike it kind of says if they go three to I'm going to be surprised and happy I'm I Am ninja twenty seven to eat just as I don't think I Would put the Vikings an elite category they're only saving grace right now is at the end of the north is terrible\nI don't know if I Would say they're terrible see north certainly isn't what everybody thought it was going to be but I don't think I Would call the NFC North terrible\nBy any stretch I mean look at everything in the NFL damn good\nLet's not let's not fool ourselves here eight five five eight three zero eight six foray the defense for the Chicago Bears\nIs above average and there are three and three football team the Detroit Lions started off awfully and since they uh they have one they've been winning football games their point differential now there is is down to a negative one\nWhen it was I think negative twenty something at one point the Vikings are plus twelve the Packers are plus for the bears are a plus thirty six so far this season they had the best point differential uh right now and I believe that's the best point differential in all the NFC the bears aren't case you didn't know\nBecause Kansas City to plug Seventy eight [noise] ah the patriots are plus thirty five so they have the second best point differential in all of football and are sitting at three and three right now at the bottom of the division ... division\nBitch just got to get itself going I mean I don't look that the Philadelphia Eagles don't look like defending world champions Washington's playing good football but how how much believed to people actually having them meanwhile New Orleans is the real deal an airport why take that back their point differential plus forty one so that makes the bears third\nThird um hopes accuse me I stand corrected I didn't go all the way down and just scroll down the honesty west cannot forget about the ramps I forgot about the rams holy mackerel they lead all of the NFL with a point to reprint differential ... seven\nSeven and on the season they're good they're the real deal Caroline is a good football team even though they don't\nSeem like it I don't know why they're three you know at home foreign to overall\nWanting to on the road but even with Cam Newton their point differential is a is a plus eleven meanwhile Tampa Bay sitting at three and three minus twenty nine the falcons at three and four mine is twenty two the cardinals or one in six minus Ninety to a one in six San Francisco minus sixty\nBut everybody except for the lion's who's a minus one everybody in the NFC North end of the vision is on the positive side when every other division in football has large negative numbers it's good to ... it's not a terrible decision eight five five eight three zero eight six right when we come back we'll wrap it up more to go Michael's you after
