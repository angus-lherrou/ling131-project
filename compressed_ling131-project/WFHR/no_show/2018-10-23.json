the last five Jane skirt or has this\nThirteen touchdowns and not a single steps in the last five game that's impressive will work I Know we're talking a lot about the homes and BP and John girlie in God's name isn't that you got to bring in Matt Ryan he's on par to what he did when he won the MVP back in two thousand two well\nFirst of all the leagues different so everybody's average him three hundred and fifty are bad it is but the other thing is we know is that yeah it's an individual ward but there's also a team aspect to it and so you know the guys you're talking about guys with the rams\nOnly undefeated teams guy with the chief you only have one law in there you know there's that in the world on fire and so I think it's going to take quite a bit and then he got Drew Brees right a good team and he's having an incredible no I've never won the MVP so\nUnless this team starts winning some games and stacking 'em on top of each other unfortunately uh he's gonna get passed over for the MVP I Believe that considering everybody else assuming everyone else stays hot but you're right I mean he's doing his part and we were just talking about if they're deep and hadn't gotten\nSo beat up um and they would have had some of those big play makers on defense how many of these calls games\nWould they have one that they ended up losing would they be ride it out and you know it is disappointing that you know some of these performances may end up being wasted because they weren't able to win a lot of those football game\nAh\nBut Alabama's all kinds of wind was better the hurt when a championship right see I didn't you know they have more of the problem that she Patterson year or two they couldn't with Joe and now you're talking but you're ... or the year two they couldn't win with Joan aren't they had to have to come in and table and the championship game they were going to win the championship but jailing hurts yeah but they already won a championship or church\n[noise] so it's it's still for one right now I really don't define what on black at the quarterback who won championships in college football\nThey're not exactly the greatest of the greats\nBut they know but the gruesome great college players and like Jill and hurt them in a great college player you know I mean this whole like he'd be the greatest transfer money she pattern is good and the point is she is good enough it's the rest of the team around that is it up to par when you're talking about feeding them the likes of Alabama\nThere not beating Alabama I'm Sorry my family because it's going to be a state that I mean they have it in a long time but you know what it does teams better than the teams that\nI'll say that much but the promise you rely on track to greet Ohio State probably is this year though two years ago they were pretty close but here's the problem in it's not just the NFL's college to the quarterbacks so much of winning games is on quarterbacks less soda well let me just explain what hurts\nIt was more about the Alabama too I mean it's it's scary to stay Nick Saban has the best team he's ever had and he's won four championships there how to Clemson do last year getting to the championship Kelly probably wasn't a good quarterback got their right and then what happened there was one one but it was totally against Jill and hurts to mediocre quarterbacks\nRight but I just [noise] because they have great talent and around them but I don't think he's in defense lights out now much shape Patterson to me you know he does use his legs but I don't look at him as the same type of threat the running the football some of these other quarterbacks\nI just don't think he I think he's at best cheese\nLightly above average quarterback maybe average\nAnd I think the big test is going to come you know ... what what what what'd you say\nShe passes what slightly above average quarterback average nine hundred that rain average she sees slightly above average she's getting better though that's too true so I thought about the pattern is my point\nIt's more about the rest of the football no but you out or oh no no no but here's the thing you have to rely more on the rest of the team because I don't think there's a hundred and confidence in shape Paterson\nI don't think the team was set up that way I mean but you know but that's because they have inadequate play quarterback that inadequate no but they had a pattern that has more than adequate play quarterback not good enough to win championships I just explained you that\nThe rest of the team is not up to par we're horrible no no no no no but he has no but the problem is you can be ... known but Oklahoma you can mask\nOther issues if you have had Georgia banks Craig trends oh look at a ... point it's the talent around she Patterson that's not up to know when it's on our cameras so my point blow the doors off in Michigan if there were ever to me no no but my point is when you don't have great ...\nYou know what she was so great got three first of all the I's and possibly to first Arctic ... that help put here and and offensive lineman probably at least one or two Julie Williams at the top I think but here's the problem Greg McIlroy\nI mean the list goes on no but when you don't have any over the quarterback or any day\n[laughter] well yeah and that was because they had a dream and Karen I wouldn't say shale region recap not in college\nMaybe not in the primaries but here's the difference but what I'm saying is that true say parents who was the top quarterback of the nation to just goes to show you know now I mean when you watch but here's the difference though when you don't have great players around the quarterback position\nYou need a quarterback to be better when you have the great players you can get by without a great quarterback what I'm saying is energy mid Michigan doesn't have great talent around it it's not ... not Alabama town well that's what you need that our talk right oh no it's not exactly what you know if you want to interrupt but even Alabama\nHasn't had what Alabama has this year in years past\nI mean this years their best team as if you listen to everybody talk this is the best team that Nick Saban chat right possibly I think it's All right so so no one can so again so what are we talking about here it's impossible for Michigan to to have that type of talent\nOr the Alabama has this year it's it's you know so it's gonna come down the coaching but you know the ... and you know I I favor Nick Saban in that battle I think yeah I I Would agree but here's a here's what it comes down to Ohio State do you see I thought Ohio State had that talent\nOr the Georgia had that talent\nBut Ohio State has a guy quarterback though\nIf you want to go to ... to to your point that might be able to exploit the weakness of Alabama which many believe is a secondary secondary yeah and that's why Trevor Lawrence distorting for Clemson\nHe can throw the ball over the yard you know that great on exactly where the weakness they're doing is all about all I think the shake him no I I agree with you on that but man I'm telling you what this Michigan Ohio State match day this is great it's a great game every year bowling ball team show up with one last which could happen\nI'll tell you what that can be a heck of a match\nBecause ... you know look that's a big loss for Ohio State losing at Purdue conference last Michigan has not lost in the conference yet\nI don't think they will [noise] Iraq was going to be it'll be boys course come on and off again and I am G G academy quarterback boy I mean the big my daddy to go see my dad was nothing about the players\nWere said he comes over Saturday when you know he doesn't care about college football had the game on obviously brings my daughter back to the playground and he's like\nThis Rutgers and the Big Ten goes why I said for the New York for the bad feelings and other quarterbacks don't a championship prices are a very you may remember he also got ten million dollars in the NFL says yeah I don't like that you don't know why because of the New York media markets rockers isn't in New York I don't know\nAnd boy that terrible\nAre a truck wasn't that kind of go in a big game they won't I don't have you looked at their scheduled press the way the play pen state law she can stay with Michigan loss\nAnd uh another tough team they lose like Wendy ... is a place for the top dogs are there to play the higher standing up on outfit to do three oh my goodness\nUm ads on believable\nSo right now off your mission glasses for I Can't you have to write a poem Michigan versus Ohio State who really the better team right now it's going for\nI think it's going for ... the ... but I Do see it I look I\nAgain Michigan lost so many times to Ohio State of the last ten years\nYou know I I Can't sit here with a straight face and tell you they're gonna win but in terms of talent but how about the genetic gets off the field\nAbout what is Harbaugh still mad about\nAnd come on Michigan Midland been Bush said I I Know so they have this tradition where they lock arms which is really corny if you asked me for the games I like to sideline from its end zone to end zone Michigan claims that they were late\nIn doing this ritual the Michigan State was late ...\nThey had no business I'm\nSo mission we had a right to be on the field Devon Bush and another player had a right to be on the field animal you know what happened they were doing this this tradition where they walk the line right like storm troopers ... like a put it and they did it close line Devon Bush but they kind of like walked right\nThrough him than words then Tony smiling Antonio mocked Antonio is fine without\n... and Bush league and he doubled down today and you won't let it go\nSo I mean come on and then Devon Bush stumped on the logo and they feel which was kind of\nDone which works if you when they did win Michigan oh rubbish you run represent you might miss you fail or what I'm saying like\n[noise]\nIt is a stupid tradition the locking arms and walking I think it looks good looks ridiculous but it's their thing if they knew it but I blame Devin Bush for being there well that's the whole thing\nOr claims that they were late in doing it their tradition as you say claims that they ... Michigan was well aware and their staff was well aware that this is what they do a ten o'clock I Am eastern ... you know he's been there before so I don't know I don't know if you want to play Michigan State of Michigan that I don't know who's to blame here\nWell off heart and horrible horrible horrible and use it as a result of that is absolutely quote gliding Devon Bush All right uh [laughter]\nSo you got the map on the two point conversion yeah email that we will explain it real quick\nWhen we come back but here's the other thing about this is what we have Twitter and hit is blowing up Twitter because people are wondering why patrimony doing well summer and it's an saver and more and more data Smith are esteem uh before he can host here on NBC Sports raise ... exactly what was the reactions are coming in explaining next\nGoing deep into sports but NBC Sports radio in\nThe NBC Sports radio mobile app [noise]\nBlues years used the sports radio [noise]\nOnly one radio station and central Wisconsin has with Dave Ramsey show have veteran right here I Am Thirteen twenty W.

can still have another opportunity to do it\nBut if that's the case then why not do what ended up happening\nWhen it came right down to what we witnessed with my ... and the and the Tennessee Titans going for to to try to win a game at the very end of the game and instead of ... and the Tennessee Titans get stop they don't get it so that is the problem with going for two there at the end\nSo I guess because the fact your chances are better than fifty fifty to score on a to point conversion if you have two chances that it chances are you going to get at least one of them and if you get one of them\nThen you tied the game regardless because even if you missed the first you get to give it to twenty twenty game and you go to overtime anyway that's the logic that's being used the logic is worn out to ... ... is from\n... to ... you're going to get it but then again it's not like the New York giants here\nSee that's the one in five going into this game and you're talking about the Atlanta Falcons are under the fence where they're missing to say and then when it suited for going into two and four right and missing to safety is there must be one of the top linebacker they're they're a mess right now so that's a ... it's a wash right\n[noise] just [noise] I'm a traditionalist call me old fashion\nIf it works your genius right like I don't like my ... going for two on Sunday I don't like that call I get to that right here but ...\n\nI don't think we even have Nick so we do have it or do we have the power we have the ... addressed this issue and on social media he is you know some people agree with what he did others of course are not agreeing with what he did and that's going to be the case\nAll right let's see do we have patch river talking about going for two and the twenty to twelve do we have that\nOkay we don't have that yet right when we get that we will no I don't wanna hear that well we'll we'll we'll talk ... all I care about from pat Sherman is the one in six coach right after being up to the browns is for this job being the browns coach before I told her story but all I cared about to hear from pasture raised his logic behind going for two they're\nSo here's the thing when he was in Cleveland we have gone for to ask you like changed his philosophy so now all these coaches who have grown up with football in their blood like fifty years

players I'm sure there's nerves I don't care how long have you played the game and you show up somewhere else\nAnd you're LeBron James in off the bat the expectations are flat out through the roof and rightfully so it's tough to adjustable abroad and twenty six minutes\nThirteen points five rebound data sits four\nTurnovers about back five and twelve shooting and twenty six minutes from the Bronx you're going to happen though he's real sick for six and a fourth quarter he's going to score twenty points in the fourth quarter because you know he can do it but don't wait the sleeping giant right runs that sleeping giant\nBut that's a struggling team and you know what though they're not really funny 'cause it's not they're not that good point is they're just not that good the born is you know what like the expectations have gone through the roof because one player like you're not getting like garage John Rondo you're going to have maybe two more wins right now we're adding a ton\nOf wins 'cause they sign rod John Rondo or Michael ... land Stevenson\nBut have you seen I saw a list Sean of when LeBron go someplace from the day he was drafted to Cleveland than the year he went to Miami than a year he went back to Cleveland the differential in wins from the year before to that year\nI think the worst was eleven wins and that was from that was his rookie year there will ever wins better than the previous year there was like twenty points they're Twenty one better when you went to Miami and then they're like twenty three or something some crazy amount when he went back to Cleveland\nSome expectations are obviously going to be there for LeBron James to get it done he will get it done but a good game by the way in Los Angeles Lakers looking to win their first game and ... the the LeBron James era their first home game by their play a lot of home games\nMeanwhile some interesting things happening Luca ... inches playing well for the mavericks but these young players\nTheir office it's their first two or three\nGames to be on the NBA yeah and you don't want when you're nervous you just don't you don't play as well and all these guys are struggling to shoot\nThe basketball I'm not surprised by that dont you had a nice night tonight shooting buddy upcoming shooting I think twenty eight percent from three forty one percent from a to point lands Kevin knocked the Knicks I watched is open or he wasn't very good he got a little more comfortable the psyche and then he hurt himself he's out now\nAnd I can't get\nNo bomb but suddenly become a six foot guard I guess instead of a seven foot behemoth where the credible wingspan he's parking himself three point line taken three point shots here's why I don't get short answer me this so now all these seven footer is are expected to shoot three pointers right\nThen who cares about the height like why is such a big deal if you just want\nThem to plant themselves a three point so they don't get blocked from three three pointers get blocked off\nAll the big men of shooting threes then on defense you're going to be guarding the perimeter aren't you guarding the five guy right who was the ... so your your side has kinda negated negated exactly yeah so who cares about all these so who cares if mold bombed by the seven foot nine inch wingspan\nAnd what good is to get what he called on the on the release of shooting but I'm not drafted the guy was seven feet tall and seven when Spanish she three pointers agreed to it so it's like an old philosophy with a new twist you can't teach I remember they always say right you can't be tried\nBut apparently they don't know how to utilize tight these days the MBA but let me ask you this that yes\nWhat are we going to see a team and maybe we maybe there was a tea maybe the team in Orlando maybe were joking with bomb over maybe they have plans for him to utilize is heightened more down ... and the low posts are we going to see the team that was ... the Nineteen nineties MBA teams what I mean by that feature laws you want or ... when the little post\nAnd go back to that old school mentality wouldn't that be a nice counter to these three point spread about shooting every seven seconds less well\nBore people to death though right I mean people seem to like this new offensive minded NBA we haven't talked to a hundred and forty points that are on the same system that Steve Curt ones as warriors have a hundred and seven points with nine minutes to go\nThere are based on how you don't even know about that now it's the pelicans in the world that a lot of scoring raptors for about twenty seven bucks for a hundred and twenty four is ridiculous where's the beef offense\nMavericks hundred and fifty two hundred and Fifteen\nBut we've seen the counter that go more to a defensive slow it down but it's kind of a often\nOn all the nineties no I don't think we should but we won't I don't think we'll see that about the Detroit Pistons of like ... for I don't think of any of the center I don't think we'll see you know offensive you know offensive game oh dream on doesn't really have an officer game\nHe doesn't have to write and now here's the thing I like I remember those guys like you do you think about it\nGuys from that generation okay where are you talking about\nPower forwards for instance okay or even centers but centers can always go back in the day but power for like you got good defense in rebounding out of them and some block shots that's all they had to do Charles ... oldest Smith you mentioned Ben Wallace yelled Davis sale Davis Antonio yeah\nHave you got a guy could scores like wow my goodness got caught him alone is driving right\nNo one cares about points from those guys they had a job to do didn't corporate scoring you didn't want them to score those are the guys who got their uniforms dirty who would be you know our muscle guys for rebounds those are the hustle guys have that anymore but in today's world the scary thing is that the scary problem is if you get a guy like that just before everybody else down\nOr do you do an acquaintance cheaper everybody plays that style of that that's why\nI'm ... I'm intrigued to see how cousins fits into that Golden State office because he slowed things down to the pelicans last year\nAnd they were better without him they got the second round the playoffs you know he went out and they didn't miss a beat and maybe it's slow down in the Davis who isn't that type of ... or run up and down the court type of guy ... it's a strange dynamic that's happening in basketball because you think you think if I go to mark his cousins play ten years ago\nBefore I mean think about you know we talk about Julie looking for right over the years till we look for is the

get the next touch down an extra point when did you the game as opposed to tie it and going into overtime\nTraditional football fans including myself incredibly bothered by this because common knowledge will tell you just take the safe approach and kick the extra point you need for gene points you get seven then you get another seven and you send the game into overtime\nBut there is a new wave\nOf analytics blending its way into football we've already seen the trend happening in major league baseball and for traditionalists like myself\nYou have to accept that it's a part of the game from that one major league baseball is run by guys in their ... analytical departments\nThey're run by guys with computers and calculators and stats that's who runs major league baseball is the reason why it seemed like the Cincinnati Reds can send out a press release calling David Bell their new field manager\nThere is no such thing as a manager now and major league baseball having autonomy there is a general manager and then there's the field manager that guy in the dugout the kind of hands the line up to the umpires and whatnot\nDecisions are made on an analytical based is\nThe department's talk about it with the general managers they formulate a plan moving forward and that's what happens and what have we seen\nTeams start to go with openers instead of starters right because hey if you throw reliever out there and she only goes to wind up one time debate the baseball numbers will tell you that the batting averages and\nThe on base percentages are lower when facing a pitcher for the first time as opposed to facing a pitcher for the second time this shift\nHas become a major part of the sport because the numbers show you based on the players spray charge that that's where you have to play and then there's taken away hits\nThe game has changed\nIt's for better or for worse it's up to you as a fan to decide but that's what has happened to major league baseball and there is no denying that now let's take a look at how it's happening in the NFL how it relates to this pet from a decision to go for two instead of an extra point\nEight points and it's all about analytics it's about the numbers there was an article on ESPN dot com several weeks ago I guess in the hat kitten article came out when the decision to go for two from Doug Peterson was thrown out there\nAnd in this article the numbers are broken down\nThat when you go for let's say a to point conversion the possible scenarios you because let's be honest\nIt's all a long shot anyway because you need to get the second touchdown without ... without have without allowing other score Syria deepened says to come up with a stop and then you have to score another touchdown but if that ideal scenario happens the percentage is broken down in this ESPN dot com article\nAre converting a to point attempts successfully\nAnd then a touchdown with an extra point the second time is forty six percent that you win the game\nIf you convert a to point attempt but then miss the extra point on the second touchdown and you end up tying that happens three percent of the time if you fail on the first to point attempt but then succeed on the second to point attempt\nYou will tie twenty five percent of the time if you fail on both attempts you lose twenty six percent of the time [noise] so what the numbers are showing you is that you have a forty six percent chance to win the football game\nIf you go for a Jew and are successful that first time I was assuming that you get a touchdown afterwards\nNow if you kick the extra point here is ... percent just kick both extra points anti eighty eight percent\nConvert one but missed the other six percent you lose the game missed the first and then converted to point conversion to tie three percent missed the first and then failed to ... to ... to lose three percent\nThe numbers that ... is looking at here is that what when you go for two in that scenario there is a forty six percent chance to win the football game\nIf you kick the extra point there is a zero percent chance to win the football game\nThat's the numbers that he's playing for get about ... percent itch okay by going for the extra point by going for the two point conversion there is a twenty six percent chance you lose the game\nOr you take your chances going to over time and in over time it's a fifty fifty proposition based on the coin flip right whoever gets the ball first maybe it's fifty five percent to lose the game forty five percent to win the game\nWhy if my son having troubling for

matter is the analytics baby get used to it\nAfter the game let's hear from you I'm manning who was asked about the two point conversion and I actually think he lives answer was pretty interesting here's what he had to say\nWe like to point place and um [noise] you know a set of you know posting the hitting that one and a new is that you know getting real extreme that a little bit better but you know coach says prove to go to\nCoach says go for two we go for it to me is not going to\nTell you what do you live in is he's not going to tell you that hey I don't agree with it he just flat out says I coach says go over to we go for two un manning on the giants inefficiencies in the red zone which is another reason why I say you don't call for\nYou don't get down there are in the red zone and just you know we can't we can't keep settled for ... so I'm gonna finish we gotta finish that's kind of been the the theme of the year we've been\nEnclosed in a lot of games a lot scenarios [noise] a lot of drives and but we're just not not finished in games fraud and not finishing drives and or just the executions that not exactly where it needs to be um and so we'll see if I'm\nNot where it needs to be asked all the New York giants are the one two three four fifth the worst team in the NFL in red zone efficiency fifth worst team this year in red zone a fish and see\nThat as a perishing absolutely embarrassing but yeah hey go for two because we're so good at scoring angle to go situations let's hear from pat germ or on the decision\nPreview in ... immigration chances by fifty percent if you go for it and make it there [noise]\nSo that's that's what you do\nIs that if we scored a touchdown we just kick the extra point with\nBack a bit about the two point play you guys saw that\nI think we got the ball in Iraq and we just didn't connect on\nAnd and again I think it's it has to approach\nIt is an aggressive approach and they didn't get the job done\nPower we didn't get it done [noise] um [noise]\nAgain [noise] shouldn't be any\nQuestions about how hard our guys fight or we just got to execute better we got to get in the end zone at a higher percentage and we got a lemonade the big place\nMore from had goats patrimony quarterback sneaks there at the end of the game\nIt's a defeat is still there should be able to you should be able to convert on a snake and we've all seen him do that and for whatever reason we didn't get it that\nThey could not get it done he said it's hard though\n\nThere are guys not play hard\nThat are not guys not fight to the end that our guy do a lot of good things but not enough to win yes so they encourage men has to keep doing it and do more things right\nThat's it and went in and that's the message as you move forward\nAnd writers right we've got to do enough to win a game\nOr do back in junior on being one in six\nLow enough to push version as much as\nYou know we all went away I'm\nA little piece that you got to put together the little things that are the difference between winning and losing um\nWe just haven't found a way to put it altogether does this feel like a one in six football team [noise] I

think that he's dealing with a situation where his quarterback is limited sort of a stretch to feel a little bit but still not able to make enough places really at all with his legs some questionable decision making out if you buy\nA factor in the math the two point conversion and I think that makes that decision look a little bit more palatable you lost the football game and you struggled in the red zone you all because it was one of those trips into a touchdown and by that point the game was when they will be out of reach\n... ... ... when I got to get to see my best made the plus because this was an opportunity against the falcon ... without several other top players that were vulnerable you should have been able to take to really take it to the Steven dictate all kinds of great\n... and the giants they do that once again they're down to schools and the fourth quarter and that's when the ... gray patch summer I have to look at all for it or not the final seven or eight minutes of the game and I think it got to settle somewhere between a C minus ... the plots\nPatio not spike the ball there on first down there's forty somewhat seconds left in the game you get to the one yard line and you run to failed quarterback sneaks and insurers defenses as well as you get in on a quarterback sneak while I'm not a good enough to get it on a quarterback so back\nTo the fourth down quite go back to the bank or whatever you were thinking there on that end around the safe from Barclay from the ... yard why they can't wait to a hundred and thirty five pounds ... up bricks truck or\nYou saw him he would have been in New Orleans Saints why not send them over the top and try to have him leap into the games on in that situation so that the two states\nWhy no one time try to have work when we were the defenders and go into the hands on like this against the war was that it doesn't work\nSpike the ball and good to play again on on third down so I agree with you that it's not like it was silly but I think the play called heating up to force down over here in the third quarter and the play on the back to back to the snakes is really suspect to say the least\nTelling them at ... dot com covering the New York giants got sunburn here it's over time and NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com oh do back in junior was certainly faded tonight here Matt does this\nCome down owed obey Jay for a little while uh his own right in his world is as father going to come out and see some more things how does this night effect on him junior\nI I think Scott when you look at

way it is and\nI think it really solve some physical street in on the field a few cameras as much as they call it ... frustrated how many times of the zoom in on the back of your sitting on the side like a really poor body\nThe connection between the un manning on the al ... is pretty damaged at this point that I Know that he scored a touchdown I Know that uh he had a hundred over the saving your average over Seventeen yards per reception political stuff is a guy who's completely focused on the individual stats\nAnd what he's able to do the fact that they didn't come out with a when a to me I I don't think I was going to be well it's not like this thing around that that might not happen this happened we'd be like manning a quota\nMet when you look at this team overall does this look like a one in six football team\nI I mean it does run I mean you look at the talent and you look at say ... you look at it from your on your evident grew up with some plan makers on the parents what Randy ... and they're getting a lot of that as a third round rookie in in a few Jay held a defensive and\nHe picked up his third sack of the season tonight so Carter got his sack so there's some of the plane that goes on this team of both sides of the football but charged ... feet over the top eyeballs and hall for a touchdown all lord of the whole I I don't know that you would recognize Margaret hold people here in Studio\n... and it was on my mind is still\nWith issues ain't soldier gave up his act and I are named as it's been fantastic one of the top of the guards but he he gave up sac tonight not even on the stump he was flat out the the same issues that have been there for this team for the past several years terrible offensive line by giving up the players over the top defensively\nAnd a quarter back which was done shy from all the hit is taken over the last couple of years\nFor his much talent is the giants have top of the ... power there isn't the big apple this feels like a one in six football team where things could get even worse rather quickly\nUh if you are gave Gettleman are you calling Tom Coughlin and saying give me something for Eli Manning\n[laughter] I think it can't hurt right but the thing we have to remember here is Eli Manning has no trade costs right so if you manage to finish his career with the New York giants he's going to finish his career with the New York giants but put on a\nGentleman absolutely I I think that anybody outside of work we back them he grooms shepherd\nAnd he may be the column and everybody else should be expendable at this point right there should be killed and call apple you should be only call us ... usually only call on for for any number of players on the census out of football\nAnd and it'd be married to me if you're going to call anybody in this week to try and trade for me to call them knows him there's obviously a relationship between calls on a panic at that time together they won two Super Bowls together if they're not all don't lick bowls and they're actively shopkeeper quarterbacks\nWhy not try to get a fifth round there were six round pick the man and get a trick\nFinal thing Matt how much does it sticking knew deep down to your core\nBeing in that building here tonight looking at that beautiful building and knowing that it costs the same amount of money as metlife

C. O. T. T. S. O. N. A. I. R. posted the segment from the beginning of the show in which I address the decision to go for it to buy a patch or the New York giants and how the\nNFL is in a new age of analytics much like it has happened in major league baseball the analytic age is happening now in the and\nIt ain't going anywhere I'm Sorry a adjusting fans gotta get used to it I don't like it pretty sure a lot of fans don't like it but they got to get used to it there was another story\nIn the NFL that occurred here on Monday and that was the Dallas Cowboys acquiring a number one wide receiver for quarterback jak Prescott and that is I'm Ari Cooper\n[noise] this was met with criticism because the cowboys gave up a first round pick and now look at the writers\nWho are clearly tanking and trying to rebuild as they prepare to get this team ready to move to Vegas they have three for from picks and extra draft they have their own first round pick which if they keep trending in this downwards direction it's going to be a pretty high tech\nAnd then they have the ... they acquired from the bears in the ... trade and the first round pick that they just acquired from the Dallas Cowboys three first round picks for John Green and the raiders\nIt's pretty nice hall I'm already Cooper was falling out of favor there and so they recover now the first round paper they paid for 'em because he was the fourth overall pick in twenty Fifteen this season twenty two catches two hundred and eighty yards and a touchdown\nHe made the pro bowl twice yeah back to back down and yard seasons to start his career but the past few years it's been bad\n... ...\nHow about Red Sox in seven well here's my thing would be fun to it will be fun to see a seven game series right it would of course it would be but yeah I I I think the red Sox have been waiting\nFor so long I don't think there'll be that they're not ready and remember the Dodgers have all the momentum but the the Red Sox don't they have no I'm into\nLike I said they've been waiting for forever it seems\nThis momentum for the ... have been ... has has gone back for what three weeks since the end of the states it's one sixty three remember that's right it's carried on how they they've been pushing and climbing in calling ... get to this point that momentum is there and that's all you need in baseball yeah\n[laughter] it's an interesting uh it's an interesting thing to think about because and we've seen this time and time again we're teams that play in the wild card game\nYou know I have to go they go all the way onto the world series\nBut I mean they didn't play in the a wildcard no it was Russia but there again one sixty ... I'm saying but that game one sixty three is basically a wild card game right yeah\nYou know they had to play an extra game to win the division right and so they win that game against the Rockies which helps them avoid the wild card game\nAnd they believe them a series against the Braves right\nWhich is probably the easier of the opponents right and which is okay and then this was a tough brewer series a very tough for all researchers and which they had to rally in and win a game seven\nThey had a chance they failed in game six and they win game seven five one the moves that they made this season have paid off\nMany Machado move as paid off\nAcquiring um you know guys like Madsen another and other players it is paid off for them Brian ...\nWell they're going to be additions that they made midway through the season right Nick ... was it was ... it was you know I'm reading this postseason lost her right now for use\nRight so it's David Freese Brian ... Ryan ... and many many shot out of all acquired this season all acquired in season right and\nI think that that has completely meal paid off for them\nBut I think it's it has paid off you can argue it asked me to or you can't argue with us because they're in the world series there's no way you can even argue that point mhm\nRegard this as to whether or not they resign management shot okay will they got here oh well even if they don't they got to this point because when they got to this point\nAnd so now they take on a Boston Red Sox theme that is hungry that is ready to win a championship ends how about this [laughter] oh I Love the streets you know information treats okay All right\nThe home plate umpire for game what\nTim Timmons has called a strike correct early on eighty nine point eight percent of batters takes this season\n\nIs it what is it good or bad I don't even know what that means I don't know I think and I mean that means he's got a bad strike zone or a good strike zone yeah I don't know what is that an you know that means like you know how they do the testing to see if it isn't really a strike is it not a strike yeah so when battered us don't\nAnd it's up to the umpire to call it a ball or strike the home plate umpire for game one has only called eighty nine point eight percent correct but that's not good\nNo [laughter] not good at all I get [laughter] good for the pitchers hate it\n[laughter] you got to ... Doug pitchers going in ...\nAnd in sale watch it'd be a eight seven final [laughter] wouldn't that be a real good I mean I'm wearing out it's gonna be the one really being cold ah I'm I'm worried about that for the Dodgers\nYeah let's see uh Boston temperature I mean let's see it affects the the the red Sox as well but you got to believe they are more comfortable in and\nLet's go it's by nine o'clock um let's see let's see if we can get to the hourly forecast for Boston we want to find out what it's going to be by first\nPitch so Tuesday ooh heavy PM shower\nOr to uh how 'bout that that's not good at all and that's not good us go to the hourly [noise] the hourly at\nBy the time let's say to a couple of hours before first pets so it's going to shower at four o'clock it's going to be fifty five degrees and it's going to rain at four o'clock then there's no rain five what time does the game start\nEight o'clock rush hours at six cloudy at seven showers at eight no showers for the rest of the night oh look they're going to get the game and yet they should but it's going to be ... with the temperatures though at\nEight o'clock first ... eight or nine okay so the temperature at first pitch is going to be it says fifty one degrees at eight o'clock that it was a real with a real feel of forty six that's ridiculous\nGoing to be showing up they're\nGoing to be showing night will the Dodgers were you able to handle the cold Nick\nNo\nDon't think so they're going to be bundled up they're going to have like the face warmer things on and you know the the masks or whatever man\nI wouldn't either way I seriously I wouldn't play I Would like to call you know me about [laughter] you ate it yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't even go to Robert I'm Sorry Robert no thanks [laughter] I don't have a ...

giants fan because you're going through what you're going through right now but\nIf if you're going to enjoy what you're doing right now so that you can have sake one um oh they'll back um junior and just ... on your team that's pretty good\nSo you know and that's pretty that's how they move up in the drop to get a quarterback\nIt's a it's not just good that's pretty incredible you can get that a situation in New York but you know it's so hard to rebuild the New York ... that he always used to say there is no such thing as rebuilding in New York you have to be competitive every year\nWhen you watch the giants this year he is he like many truly done or can you still play and be effective in this week\nSaid this for years on you I and I said as a compliment that people take it as a criticism he like can be as good as anybody in the U.S total economy at the line of scrimmage\nEnded his his op ed that he's calling the plays that he's using his brain as much as using his body very much like his brother\nHe's both of them grow up it was just football royalty they both grew up football savant they understand the game is better than boast\nAnd growing up believing that every play you should have the ability to pull out the machete at the defense makes a mistake you should go slice and dice and the what I mean by that is okay I have an entire playbook at my disposal\nAnd if the defense lined up where I think I have an advantage I shouldn't be able to get to the play that I Want to get to and try to take advantage\nAnd when he lives played Well Bruce career he's had those tools in his toolbox when he struggled he's been sequestered and I'm not blaming coaches I I'm not I'm just saying that you just watch his whole career when he has that ability\nAt any moment of any game to get to the play he wants to get to take advantage he's really good but when he's just running the ball players that are being called and he doesn't have that ammunition he you know he's an average player\nSo I you know again I don't know what's going on in that building I don't know what game planning it was like I just know that I don't see him\nDoing any time on the line of scrimmage changed a lot of ways doing a lot of different things\nThey have an advantageous looks now maybe tonight different maybe the rest years different um but to this point I haven't seen him do that much this year\nSuper Bowl champion quarterback trend do for joining us courtesy of ... America will get to that and a couple of minutes Trent is the Blake photos era in Jacksonville over\nThere has to be I mean what's the point where they just lost what had happened at the end of last year the beginning of this year as they he had confidence they had confidence but it was fragile confidence it was was um\nVery it was a day to day confidence and now after a few weeks here just being a disaster all the way around not just the way you can see this team losing conference in in all parts and\nAnd again it's if you're looking at this if you're forecasting without you go into next year with the same doubt in your teens mind\nBecause one of the things about dropped and young quarterback and they're so good in college right now I mean you are picked your guy right wherever you whoever you like in college Herbert lock you know stayed on whatever\nI'm that guy is going to give you hope\nAnd really it seemed like Jacksonville last hope so yeah they're going to have to retool I think it will be a new quarterback next year and I think that new quarterback will give them a while I'm more of a sense of hope in the house right now and I like like I did a really nice job\nPulling out of his funk of a couple of years ago but at this point it's bigger than just Blake playing good or bad it's how the team responds white portals\nNow you're joining us courtesy of Panini America tell us what you're doing with the exclusive trading card partner the NFL\nBut I've been doing it for five years is the coolest thing I get to do it it's called the ... reporter initiative and um basically kids are by and trading cards they're awesome I mean these cards are ridiculous we call a day by the card hobby shop a retailer Wal Mart target whatever and\nI enter the code of the back of a card and if you happen to be lucky winner you get to go to the super bowl of your family\nA Monday Night of media night are loose our immediate night which is Monday I perhaps the kid reporter for questions and and then we get to the front of the line and the kid it's engage with the player or the players love it the best thing for me is you know it's chaos of a media night of the super bowl and\nAs a kid gets close to the front of a line of Tom Brady or somebody will look over and see that are bringing the kid I like cool this is refreshing and they'll usually really engage their kids off a good back for the answer your question and and and like I said really have a cool though but with the kids so\nSort of the things I've got to me it's been a great part Irvine also do a weekly updates program on social media a lot of other stuff I Do a Canadian but they're great company kids love trading cards and this is the way and then be rewarded for the purchases they make during the year\n... mostly in those videos every year from the super bowl trend I appreciate the time as always continued success with any and of course we'll be reading you on the athletic\nBuddy\nThere yes former Super Bowl champion quarterback Trent do for no one really analyze the quarterback position better than him in my opinion I thought it was a major loss for ESPN when they they got rid of him I don't remember trend over used to be the guy that was always doing the second Monday Night football game\nThe first week of the season when they had the Monday Night football double header and actually thought that he would be a great candidate\nTo be a part of the new Monday Night football but the guy is just tremendous analyzing the game of football so followed Trent on Twitter at Dover dimes\nAnd of course you can catch him on the athletic eight five five three two three four in BC it's eight five five three two three four six to to almost got side and bird in your in overtime here on NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com [noise]\nWe're trying to meet you and you're listening to NBC Sports radio\nThat's going to do more\nTwenty age\nOr if you suffer from the deep end you've seen your doctor about the little blue pill you know it can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle what if I told you that a certain little blue pill just came off pat\nIn December eleventh in that scene active ingredient is in a little blue pill is now available in generic form available to you for just thirty dollars for a month supply that's a big discount\nNorm are getting ripped off and the big pharma companies with four hymns dot com you can bypass the doctor's office pharmacy visit and see huge money in your prescription ...\nJust go to for hints dot com slash hope consultant licensed physician ad following their confidential medical review you\nCan have the proper prescription deliver directly to your door for a fraction of the price and today we'll supplies last you can get started with a trial month for just five bucks that's right five dollars here's what you do just go to for him the dot com or H.

that breaks during the course of the day [noise] earlier today you must have been I Would say eastern time of south [noise] three o'clock [noise] was home\nAt a play date over I was relaxing in my own room away from them and their games they're playing enjoying a butter bagel and the news came down and Mari Cooper's gotten shipped off\nTo the Dallas Cowboys I'm not surprised first of all I'm Ari Cooper got traded we had known for about a week a week and a half that the Oakland Raiders were shopping around there you know their their top wide receiver\nBed already given away Quil back for a couple of first round pegs at this point the floodgates are open or you know they're they're selling ... tended to we're ... marketing there's mark Cooper there's you know job and Joseph there's a you know back if you want to so high on a dark car they might listen at this point\nSo you knew at some point it would be inevitable but I was under the impression because I tried to have some sense\nThat there was no way that John grew to get his asking price which we had known they were adamant about getting a first round pick for from Ari Cooper I thought to myself how they're not no one's dumb enough to give them a first round pick for morning Cooper but then the light bulb went off in my head I thought to myself well\nJerry Jones might be\nBecause I remember when Jerry Jones ship the first third of the six to the Detroit Lions for Roy Williams which turned out to be a horrendous trade Jerry Jones at one time also ship to first round picks for Joe Galloway at some point I think it was\nI mean he's notorious for shipping off draft picks for wide receivers so I thought to myself\nWhen he looks at his own roster and realizes outside of coal Beasley who's really just a good spot receivers down to number one they're inadequate wide receiver so maybe if there's some GM slash owner out there who's willing to give up a first round pick from already Cooper is Jerry Jones and lo and behold\nEnjoying my bagel my energy drink\nTheir news breaks there you have that Omari Cooper to Dallas I thought to myself no way do they give up that first and sure enough about five minutes after the news broke\nWe find out they ship the first round pack so a lot of things went through my head after I heard that first of all I thought to myself manager Jones didn't say Jerry Jones is out of his mind to ship a first round pick by the ...\nAnd I mean there's there's this might be a first half of the first round first round pick going this might be a top Fifteen pick they are shipping off for a wide receiver who has lost confidence in his ability to catch passes first two years I'm Ari Cooper pretty good pro bowler both ears the last year and a half not so good\nAnd here's the funny thing he said the same quarterback for all four years and ah he somehow has regrets to where he was below average wide receiver now the proverbial change of scenery might play a role here maybe that's what it's going to be look I'm not going to prove the fact that he's had to ... seasons and he's only twenty four years old\nBut he's going to cost a heck of a lot of money next year because let's not forget he was what a number four overall pick\nThey've already picked up his fifth year auction which is only guaranteed for injury but you don't see the first round picked a rent a guy for the last\nNine or so games or ... you know nine nine games of the season he's not a rental for the Dallas Cowboys you by the way inherit that fifth year option which means he's going to be on the books next year for like fourteen million dollars but then a couple of things came to mind\nBeing on the east stinks up the east\nIs garbage the Philadelphia Eagles are trash the New York giants are hideous the Washington Redskins or just below average football team and the Dallas Cowboys\nAre too but what's the biggest biggest glaring hole and the cowboys all fence that needs to be addressed for them to have a chance in a week here for the NFC East to win the division and that was wide receiver\nSo on one hand Jerry Jones is to appoint mortgaging next year's first round pick because he thinks he can win the NFC eastern that's great\nBut here's the problem he's mortgaging next year's first round pick when this team has no chance to win a Super Bowl I'm already Cooper doesn't take the Dallas Cowboys from middling middle of the road team to a legit Superbowl contender he doesn't do that for two reasons one he's not good enough and too wide receivers don't make that type of impact\nHow many games on the giants won in the post season with oh del back um junior there that's right none\nI rest my case how many games the postseason the Houston Texans one with the Andrea Hopkins\nOne maybe not much more than that so you're going to give up a front to the\nFront of the draft top Fifteen sixteen type pick to bringing them already Cooper and it'll help out got Prescott and he needs all the helping yet because I don't even think he's not good to be honest with you but the reality is Jerry Jones gave up a ton he gave up on the men's amount and the team is only slightly better\nThan what bothers me about this is when we got into the two thousand and Eighteen draft and the Dallas Cowboys were drafting their pick number and they were pretty late in his one pick number Nineteen excuse me they had\nAnd on the board is Calvin Ridley out of Alabama who many believe was the best wide receiver and they strapped and by the way he's played very well so far for the Atlanta Falcons and maybe it helps them out Ryan in a in a pass at the office\nWhere they pass up on Calvin Ridley\nAnd they draft late in ... book lame Vander actually good player don't get me wrong he's a very good linebacker at Boise State\nBut the necessity was helped at Prescott out\nNo one was under any sort of an illusion that the cowboys coming into this season we're strong in that position and for them to have to panic and throw a first round pick at damage good to them already Cooper tell you they screwed up early in the two thousand and Eighteen draft so you've got yourself a linebacker whoop de do\nYou needed a wide receiver and now you've admitted it by giving up a first round pick from already Cooper good luck with that Jerry Jones and know the Dallas Cowboys are not significantly better and no it doesn't guarantee that day when that division\nBut think about what we witnessed already this year in terms of trading as we are about a week away from the fray deadline when she comes our way October thirtieth thinking about this so I'm Ari Cooper has gotten dealt\nCarlos hides gotten doubts coming home I got out before the season you hear the reports to marry is Thomas is on the trading bloc and if I'm Ari Cooper gets you a first round pick their Marius Thomas there's obviously older he's about five or six years older\nHe also by the way how shaky hands the way that Mari Cooper dogs\nBut if a team is desperate enough to be the wide receiver can you shake him down for a second round pick at this point can you say look Omari Cooper went for a top fifteenth top sixteen first round pick your time you can't give me a back into the second round pick for dumb areas Thomas\nInvest in better futures and when you went\nTo the un dot org slash invest a mind is terrible thing to wait a wonderful thing to invest\nService announcement bucking by you in the I\n\n\n\n[noise]\nYou can take all living out for you don't have enough people for their thought process was saying was a foreigner back out on a sound like he played worse than anyone else out there\nUm you know didn't have the two two foremost but at the same time I just literally did it to try to get a dance far from this football season to put everyone on notice okay too that they have to focus on they have to go out there and play about\nServicing always right here\nAs a portrait of words that goes to save you were to watch it at the same thing and\nMaybe the guy that\nWas the most\nPersonal as long as they're trying to do that either facilities are you guys are hoping anyway [noise]\nSally is Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Doug ... followed by Blake portals got benched and the ugly loss to the Houston Texans but then\nToday they've now announced that plate borders will start next week ... what are the former Brown's backup starter for a while as well he's there\nAnd it makes absolutely no sense as to why they decided to continue with like ... what else you need to see\n... so far this year has turned the football over twelve times you don't eat picks these phone bill for time he is a turnover machine which is why when you get one decent here from Blake portals which he got last year you don't go crazy and signed into a contract and give them a ton of money\nYou're everybody knows boy\nBoy was the good enough this isn't something new but it's not as if we're surprised that Blake morals is playing terribly played well one gained the New York jets for crying out loud made him look like Tom Brady plus the only team that he's tricked every other team understands that playboy was not good\nFor your dog grown in your Tom cough and you're sitting there going point we should be a Superbowl caliber team we should be up there at the patriots we should be up there at the cheese oh that's right we have Blake boils a quarterback\nAs if they're surprised but is it any worse\nGoing with Cody cat for at least seeing what he's got to at least\nChange it up a little bit because you have to believe there's people in the locker room who say how is that we're going to battle\nWith Blake portals next week in London now I Know he's played well London Heathrow or you know thrown eight touchdowns one pick playing in London maybe goes across the pond in the air is different and he drinks a darker beer in bam even be you know he goes into a phone booth becomes a competent play poodles when he's incompetent here\nMaybe that's what it is he's Clark Kent\nHe's terrible\nAnd if you want like a ... Campbell or a blowout mouth jailing Ramsey or anybody else on that team that thought they were legit Superbowl contenders\nYou're respecting this move\nI think you know Mali Jackson thought they were gone undefeated this year well that's not happening they need to at least end or losing streak at this point they've lost three in a row for the last five minutes to get the jets\nNo surprise by the way but I think Doug grown is panicking\nDoes it hurt to bench borders for a game at this point does it hurt and what I mean by that is this\nLast year the bills made a move that quarterback it backfired brought Toronto Taylor back in a band or go to the playoffs if you're going to send a message right not to blame for those you do it now\nBecause there's still plenty of football to to come and if ... Kessler blows up when he plays terribly just one you don't like the Boyles fine but maybe sitting and having them ponder the rest of his future if he keeps play like this there's not going to be a future in the NFL much longer\nMaybe that's what he needs there's a confidence issue obviously playboy was the last three games he's from a whopping two touchdowns\nAny sort a whopping fight that's that's the ... I Know bottom line\nIs ... if he deserved to be bench yesterday and frankly I Would have kept the bench and going for an entire week I Would absolutely get to go and now it's interesting is the Tina facing in London\nYou know when people talk about a Super Bowl hanged overall World Series hangover Stanley Cup hangover NBA Finals hangover yes what is it true\nThat Philadelphia Eagles team does not even remotely resemble what won the super bowl last year now maybe because\nAt quarterback the guy doesn't actually resemble the guy who won the super bowl because he's not it's not hip Carson went last night or yesterday up Seventeen nothing at home go to a fourth quarter against Cam Newton Canada brought side of uh\n\nFifteen minutes later they lose Twenty one to Seventeen that's unacceptable Super Bowl winning teams don't blow Seventeen point games at home and you know what about checks on a different level I get that but you think ballot checking Brady when they have pretty much the same\nCast assembled from a previous Super Bowl would blow a Seventeen point fourth quarter lead at Fox broke I have a hard time believing they would\nEnd up questions that we have had when it comes to ... and Sean we've talked about this right Carson win didn't win the Superbowl what's Carson when like when it comes to pressure situation when all the marbles or on the table\nWell yesterday they start to implode that Seventeen nothing lead slowly starts to go go go and you hope Carson way it's going to at least put a dagger in the hearts of the Carolina Panthers to stop the bleeding right you had occasions opportunities to do so can't do what\nHe play well in that fourth quarter everybody else played poorly too but he's the darn quarterback he's the future he's the guy that they've invested heavily in and will continue to invest in cars and wants will be the highest paid quarterback and football when it's time to do is deal\nBut doesn't add to that question mark of can Carson when you get it done when it really counts\nThis is not a good example for Carson when next falls with the super bowl champs Carson went didn't win that Super Bowl\nAnd other occasions if somebody's stepping in and leading a team to the Superbowl look when Phil Simms went down and ... took over the New York giants fans at least already had a Super Bowl ring that he was responsible for okay you already had one it's not as if you look at and say well gee I don't know if they'll send a Super Bowl\n\nPerson wants to win that Super Bowl that question is legitimately out there when it comes down to it [noise]\nTerrible loss for a Super Bowl winning team that just go through the paces right now Doug Peterson [noise]\nThey should be so far ahead in the end of the right now\nThat is terrible

describes many days here on NBC Sports radio the famous so he's also catch newly on NBC TV in Dallas let's get to that trade newly er did Jerry Jones overpaid bringing them already Cooper\nYes which has given up\nSo Jerry does [noise] look no price they were going to give up is going to matter because he got the same due to can't coach and can't drop any place so it doesn't matter you get these guys Jerry Rice and it's probably\nWouldn't know what to do it then they see some Gary Scotland ahead of bad what they do Sunday laws not a good receivers coach made me wonder see whoever got good under such\nA law I Know Chris Hogan was in Buffalo was Chris Hogan ... buffalo he became a good player for New England and got a Super Bowl so big and give up the number one from our Cooper he's not the same player he was two years ago I don't trust this staff to get anything\nEven you know is it in an indictment do the fact that they've had to make this move they've had to overpay for a wide receiver when they're they are sitting number Nineteen\nPulling all draft they take a linebacker as good as lane Vander ... has been so far does this tell you flat out that they screwed up and Jerry needed to take a receiver with a cabin really on the board\nNo no no\nHere's where all defendants okay you see Calvin really having these really good year in Atlanta that's because we have who go Joel is on one side of the football and Julio Jones is the guy you must doubled so you're going to get single covered in town and released chewing that are currently when they got that here\nSo to even think the really will be the kind of player he is he I think it's totally unfair and also you're assuming Calvin ... that they want to know what they get it\nAnd what type of production and get out of ... and really like these are ... has gotten out of them these guys aren't good coaches okay now go back to ... it was clear the past the first option for sixteen game is correct but he was clearly the last three season was shuttling with not\nOut there they did not have adequate backups to help them and it was killed him because the will position in that defense should they run\nIs key so they had to address the problem was they couldn't get a guy like Sami walk him to come here\nHe's saying is like now take less money to go to Kansas City they live to themselves\nIn terms of addressing the receiver position at a better rate and not taking the second rate do like the ... and who is with us on the law in Buffalo so I'm not going to sit around here say oh you think our relieve you take a DJ more did you guys would you wouldn't be in a situation right now\nThey lie to themselves about the the committee or in terms of receives and that was a bigger problem\nYou can sit here you can blame Scotland and you can sit here and blamed Jason gap but he's got a great smile by the way and he collapsed after every place so he looks good doing it but he's ... press got really good enough to make a difference to the ... Cooper\nI don't believe that they're going to put these guys in the right position to have a good example is a great thing about sitting with Dennis term it throughout the game\nHe calls things out and well things then it says she is nearly today's DVDs cannot turn around and locate the football on deep also just really bad so they find he keeps talking about how they need to go take a shot in deep they finally take a shot deep to Michael gallons of course that's\nThe only time they ran on St play again none South Africans like did you want\nThem to play games you feel like he could be like yeah but you know the coach that [noise]\nSo we're talking about guys who don't understand the ... the personnel they have or how to use them now okay here's my thing about that press got decker bus driver but look at mental trip is what happens when you get the cash weapons or you can do some things\nAre even pay man he may have been tire time they'll pull you was there was this guy he kept drafting and putting weapons around Peyton Manning well weapons that they put her around Prescott\nYou can't sit here and think that that could magical when games on his arm 'cause that's not what he does Jason ... retired they get rid of dance by and they did not fill those spots of anybody worth a damn so now you look at that price guide to show man how come you're not good he is what it is\nBut you made the mistake as an organization misjudging your talent which is a common thing that's been happening with Jason Gary as the head coach\nHere's the thing the cowboys though this is what year number three for ... Prescott decisions are going to be made over the course of the next year year and a half but obviously you have to see what that Prescott is all about truly before they give them a hundred hundred and fifty million dollar contract\nDoes the addition of Omari Cooper in your mind I Know the coaches don't have to do with any weapons anyway these guys are just as an apt as they get but\nDoes it at least give them a slightly better idea of what jak press got his before they either give 'em a contract they will regret for years before they give them a contract that they will think is the greatest contract when he makes possible after ...\nThat's a part of it is it they're they're looking at it okay like we we the committee system stinks she has no chemistry with without her you know chemistry would Thompson so yes let's try to get them up better football player but to me then\nThat Prescott will be judged by the next coach by the coach who comes in here and twenty nine team that should be the guy that you're judging whether or not yes you want to go ahead and do it now here's the other thing you can also do attack Prescott you can give the guy contract is similar to something we're Andy dollars down where it's almost like an\nCapita cap for me was that was kind of a pay as you go\nUm you know the ones that will do hold out an outside with the cowboys are they ... got a great amount of [noise]\nOf endorsement teenage or money off the field that he does on it so it's not like he's going to sit around here and pull a lady on bell on them\nOr I'm not really worried about whether or not they pay that Prescott they could make that Prescott ... play out his fourth year they don't have to give this guy a twenty or twenty five million dollars after the season\nWhen you're talking about I've had to actually the twenty Nineteen cheese and and and then what can be talking about something totally different 'cause I look no further Mitchell tradition look what happened they brought in a coaching staff bought some players around the player we're seeing them get something out of the players so I just think it's a little bit too early for people to start talking about you know um\nHave a contract for her dad Prescott\nWhile you've been aerobics on dark hard to have a contract as evidence Derek are signed a contract he has been very good ... who's saying God man they are amazing that you're right but here's here's amazing thing for you though so I Hope you're sitting down if Jimmy ... you know if if Jerry Jones is hiring the next coach would she obviously is\nBarry Switzer Chan Daley Dave Camp all our cells we'd Philips and Jason Garrett not sure it's going to be much better my friend\nHis his when he goes back to the bill Parcells Jimmy Johnson type guy because he is desperate jets under five years old I'm look layers they told me do that to be shipped by Jerry tries to make Iran for shopping\nAnd of course when the question is what you're shopping got everything you said she's beginning this desperate that that's what they'll do that here coming out with a holding by shopping you gave away next using a picture of what kind of picks you got to give you all the players get something done but it's Jerry's try to his way and it's failing Dan is failing and that\nWhole Rodney hair and your your your your code your call if I said show me

okay\nThe other aspect of this\nIf Oklahoma he's the team that has you know I watched a\nLot of ... men do one place neat that's my big twelve by the way but everything seems to come to me where it comes like if you beat Texas is like okay it's a really good wink of Texas at the top ten team but then you have to start looking at games you're there and everything seems to come back to Texas losing to Maryland\nI think you'd be everybody's any damage right so if you're Oklahoma yeah you know you you you you know you'll be taxes are low you know what we're however the big twelve

one thing just stood out to me besides the fact there is obviously bad coaching in the NFL\nIs patch or losing his mind I'm a little confused about some beers patch firmer losing his mind\nAnd I bring that up because unless my eyes were deceiving me and I do wear the glasses right traumas these guys are pretty thick yup Byrne adds those yes I can I mean if you want to take out my legs and just the right if you want to uh take lenses out and use them as the bottom of coke bottles they certainly wouldn't work okay\nSo the giants scored a touchdown to go from twenty to six to twenty to twelve\n\nSo it's a twenty to twelve game still time on the on the clock obviously the New York giants at this point pat trimmer\nElects at that point at twenty to twelve with four minutes forty seven seconds to go he decides to go for a to point conversion you like attempts to get to do do back in junior it falls in complete\nYour pizza twenty to twelve game yet kicked the extra points it say\nSeven twenty to Thirteen game it's a touchdown they're an extra point away and you still have time on the clock Sean I'm a little confused as to what ... was thinking or smoking which led him to kick well the numbers the analytic say go going for two is not a bad move there\nAnd I'll look up a break down the numbers but overall should've caught a pass by the way ... perfectly from pass by Eli when when was the last time we spoke with said that at all but I Know they'll drop it yeah but but okay so the number say go for it because the success rate of two point conversion is good I guess\nBut even if that's the case why make you where you're gonna have to get another two point conversion to just tied the game when all you would need is an extra point to tie the game if you score another touchdown that's where I'm a little lost on this\nLike why ... if you need to get to point conversion to get it within a one possession game or a troop possession game whatever it is fine you go for the two obviously but when you're ready within a one possession game and you could be down by seven by kicking a extra point\nWhy would you not kick the extra point to make it a seven point game why would you leave it where you now have to be successful on a to point conversion that makes absolutely no sense if there's going to if it's Mike brave all you're doing it this is from football perspective dot com yes please do weight in the game\nIt it always makes sense for team after scoring it touched on the current leader for my fourteen point deficit to ... point deficit to go for to the truly team gets two bites the apple if it converts they touched down now they win the game if the team fails to get a second chance to erase that mistake\nMissing both attempts\nCart says only if the odds of missing bolt attempts are higher than the odds of making the first example distracted you fail to make sense but here it goes but here's what does it make not my ... and this is a mess right but here's what I don't like about that does that explain much to me you got at least go for it tied to even try to win a game\nLike why get greedy you tied the game you still have an opportunity to win it\nNow if you go for the two when you don't get it then you have to go for two again with God Knows how much time's left on the clock if you get the ball back and then you have to go for two again so guarantee you may get\nI'm I'm not a fan of it I just don't think he made sense and that's why to me you go when you make it a twenty to Thirteen game and all you have to do a score touching the extra point flooding easier to kick an extra point that's going on\nRight but here's another here's what you want me to here's another explanation\nLet's assume kicking the extra point the conversion rate is a hundred percent this is from predictable dot com okay mhm what would be the two point conversion right I think it's ... ... what's the two point conversion coming out\nSixty percent of the art I don't know I'm I'm guessing maybe it's higher but even if it's sixty percent\nThat knew they were trying to think of this argument they give an example that say that you point conversion rates at fifty percent right will soon you score to touch on deaf to truly my fourteen year pointing scores non and that your chance of winning in overtime is even a fifty percent but look there's a lot there's a lot to discuss here\nLately I mean it's it's it's all ended when you don't want to eat a little cold I I Know but the bats I think I Would say would suggest and this is what people are saying that going for two is not a bad decision it's actually it works in your favor\nYeah if it works out well it shouldn't work out an old old catches the past\nThat is true but it it's a big if it has to be it has to happen I mean you got to make the plays right it's not that the judgment making plays all year where it's like OK faith and there's often getting me two points as officers failing to score points all night so now we're going to have faith in the line that often give me two points\nAbout that I'll drink Rojas is a great kicker but still you know\nI look this is a giant office that didn't act right yeah it's an eye giant often is one of the worst going off into the NFL they did not lose the game because of that by the way he did and you're right it did it factor in the decision it did a factor in the end because then they gave up a field goal and then you can still be protected by the falcons and that put it out of reach of twenty three twelve they couldn't use the Bible not get\nA percentage of winning the game going for to their\nChicken next to this analytical is analytics in baseball now we have this big analytics them both I I'm not saying he's offered him saying that's why he went for two because the math has to go for two\nNow [laughter] I'm not a big fan like Josh ... learned I said I'm thirty now [laughter] [laughter] well we got to

Patterson\nI don't think the team was set up that way I mean but you know but that's because they have inadequate play quarterback that inadequate no but they had a pattern that has more than adequate player quarterback not good enough to win championships I just explained to that\nThe rest of the team is not up to par we're horrible no no no no no but he has no but the problem is\nYou know these days but Oklahoma you can mask\nOther issues if you have had Georges Bank Craig trends though I Am a look at a ... point it's the talent around she Patterson that's not up to know what it's ... ... my point blow the doors of Michigan if there were ever to me no no but my point is when you don't have great ...\nYou know she was so great got free for somebody to see them happy to first or anything like that helped put here and and offensive lineman probably at least one or two Julie Williams the top of it but here's the problem Greg McIlroy I mean the list goes on no but when you don't have any over the quarterback or any day\nWhile yeah and that was because they had a dream and Karen I wouldn't say shale raising the cat's not in college\nMaybe down the price but here's the difference but what I'm saying is that true say parents who was the top quarterback of the nation to just goes to show you know now I mean when you're watching but here's the difference though when you don't have great players around the quarterback position\nYou need a quarterback could be better when you have the great players you can get by without a great quarterback what I'm saying is and as you've met mission doesn't have great talent around it it's not ... not Alabama talent that's what you need that our talk really don't know exactly what you need if you want to be interested but even Alabama\nHasn't had what Alabama has this year in years past\nI mean this year is their best team as if you listen to everybody talk this is the best team that next saved his head right possibly a I think it's All right so so no one can so again so what are we talking about here it's impossible for Michigan's heads to have that type of talent\nOr the album has this year it's it's you know so it's gonna come down the coaching but you know the ... and you know I I favor Nick Saban in that battle I think yeah I I Would agree but here's a here's what it comes down to Ohio State though see I thought Ohio State had that talent\nOr the George had that talent\nBut Ohio State has a guy quarterback though\nIf you want to go go right to to your point\nThat might be able to exploit the weakness of Alabama which many believe as a secondary secondary yeah and that's why Trevor Lawrence of sorting for Clemson he can throw them all over the yard you know that great on exactly halfway through weaknesses are where are you guys for doing this all about\nAll I think that's shaken no I I agree with you on that but man I'm telling you what this Michigan Ohio State match day this is great it's a great game every year bowling ball team shop at Walmart which could happen I'll tell you what that could be a heck of a match\nBecause that you know look that's a big loss for Ohio State losing at Purdue at the conference loss Michigan have not lost in the conference yet\nI don't think they will [noise] Iraq was going to be to be boys course come on and off the getting the earth was there that I Am G G academy quarterback of the way I mean the big my daddy to go see my dad was nothing about ...\n... he comes over Saturday when you know he doesn't care about college football had the game on obviously brings my daughter back to the playground and he's like\nThis Rutgers and the Big Ten goes why I said for the New York for the ... and other quarterbacks don't a championship prices are a member you may remember he also got ten million dollars in the NFL says yeah federal I tell you why because of the New York media marketers\nBrokers isn't in New York I go I Know we talk about all the time or they're terrible\nThey are but for the next time they go in a big game\nThey won't I don't have you looked at their schedule press the when the play pen state law she can stay on Michigan loss\nAnd on another tough team they lose they like Wendy ... forty plus a place for the top dogs yeah dirty played a higher standing up on our fifty do three oh my goodness\nUm ads on believable\nSo right now where are you off your mission glasses I Can't you have to start up all Michigan versus Ohio State who really the better team right now I think it's going for\nI think it's going for the ... but I ... I I look I again Michigan lost so many times to Ohio State of the last ten years\nYou know I I Can't sit here with a straight face and tell you they're going to win but in terms of talent but how about the genetic gets off the field\nOh what is Harbaugh still mad about\nHe won that game\nAnd come on ...

for\nThe worst [noise]\nIt is our number three tours and NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com pro football ... dot com agreeing with patch rumors call to go for the two point conversion with four forty seven remaining seeing an eight point game so\nHere's what it comes down to Doug Peterson the eagles did exactly the same thing as we talked about it's all about the percentages to win\nThat's what they apparently say and apparently the logic is that you gave yourself a better chance to win the game if you if you do that okay by the way back from junior should have called it was in and out of his hands the guy who is\nSo sure handed not getting the job done was a bit surprising to say the least\nDefinitely was surprising to say the least falcons by the way getting a big field goal fifty six yard or from a kicker that they brought in just on Tuesday how 'bout that guy's been part of that team for less than a week\n... trust him to get it done from literally fifty six yards out and he gets done\nSo the analytics okay all the move\nIf you're kicked the extra point and again it's not a give me any more\nBecause it's much longer you're still down by seven if you scored another touchdown and you kick the extra point you go to overtime the over to and you make it and you go for you know ... and you kick an extra point then you you know you you you win the game\nOr if you go for two and fail you can still have another opportunity to do it\n\nBut if that's the case then why not do what ended up happening\nWhen it came right down to what we witnessed with my great ball and the and the Tennessee Titans going for to to try to win a game at the very end of the game and instead of ... and the Tennessee Titans gift stop they don't get it so that is the problem with going for two there at the end\nSo I guess because the fact your chances are better than fifty fifty to score on a to point conversion if you have two chances that it chances are you going to get at least one of them and if you get one of them\nThen you tied the game regardless because even if you missed the first you get the fact that it's a twenty twenty game and you go to overtime anyway that's the logic that's being used the logic is what attitude ... from\nThe yard line or not you're going to get it\nBut then again it's not like the New York giants here right which I'm going to see that one in

acclimated new players I'm sure there's nerves I don't care how long have you played the game when you show up somewhere else\nAnd you're LeBron James in off the bat the expectations are flat out through the roof and rightfully so it's tough to adjustable abroad and twenty six minutes\nThirteen points five rebound data it's four turnovers back five it's wall shooting at twenty six minutes from the Bronx you're going to happen though he's real six for fixing the fourth quarter he's going to score twenty points in the fourth quarter 'cause you know what he can do it\nBy doing the sleeping giant right ... runs that sleeping giant\nBut that's a struggling team and you don't want to do they're not really sure because it's not they're not that good point if they're just not that good the born is you know what like the expectations have gone through the roof because one player like you're not getting like Rajani Rondo you're going to have maybe two more wins right now we're adding\nA ton of wins 'cause they signed rod John Rondo or Michael beef leader so land Stevens\nBut have you seen I saw a list Sean of when LeBron go someplace from the day he was drafted to Cleveland than the year he went to Miami than a year he went back to Cleveland the differential in wins from the year before to that year\nI think the worst with a ... and that was from that was his rookie year there are a level in better than the previous year there was like twenty points they're Twenty one better when he went to Miami and then they're like\nTwenty three or something some crazy amount when he

bomb but suddenly become a six foot guard I guess instead of a seven foot behemoth where they incredible wingspan is parking himself three point line taken three point shots here's I don't get short answer me this so now all these seven footer is are expected to shoot three pointers right\nThen who cares about the height like why is\nSuch a big deal if you just wanted to plant themselves the three point so they don't get blocked from three point how many three pointers get blocked off\nAll the big men of shooting threes that on defense you're going to be guarding the perimeter aren't you guarding the five guy who was ... so your your side of this kind of negated negated exactly yeah so who cares about all these so who cares if mold bombed by the seven foot nine inch wingspan\nAnd what good is to get what do you go to the on the release of shooting but I'm not drafted the guy was seven feet tall and several weeks later she three pointers agreed to it so it's like an old philosophy

early voting is underway in Texas I'm quite never\nComing up on my team fail we continue our look at election day two weeks from today here's Jim go hand in\nThe mid term elections are very close now and we have taken a look at the electorate from a variety of perspectives we thought this morning we will do so from the standpoint\nOf the fastest growing segment of the electorate and one of the largest groups in our electorate the Latino vote or there are more than ... million Latinos eligible to vote nationwide the makeup twelve point eight percent of all eligible voters and of course in some most states do to places like\nCalifornia Texas Florida and elsewhere they make up a large percentage of the the total voting population\nWe're talking with a key late ... he was founder and CEO of ... wealthy uh helps the Latino executives an entrepreneur is to pursue\nA their economic dreams in this country and I'm just curious some thoughts about what we can say about this through first of all it strikes me that it is rather inaccurate to refer to as the Latino vote as if there was only one\nUh you certainly wouldn't confuse Cuban Americans with Mexican Americans with Puerto Ricans et cetera\nYeah that's the three headed monster or many edit monster that there are so many different points of view also the difference between the first generation immigrants ... and beyond gonna have many different so there is no less you know block\nNo doubt a certainly the African American vote has been pretty reliably democratic for the past two\nOr three quarters of a century or if it's only say Ninety percent for the Democratic party back to an unusual year or the Latino vote again to the extent that we can refer to it as an overall varies considerably there are times certainly uh uh for example a\nA former president before that the governor of Texas at George W. Bush\nDid rather well among Latino voters for a Republican so this this can be done\nAbsolutely I mean look at Texas look at California uh George Bush had the advantage that he lived in Texas all his life on the third the Mexican population there along with the other Latino population there are a great advantage for him and helped carry him to the ...\nWe would also take note of a ... a big issue and it's a big issue for everybody the issue of immigration more precisely put the issue of illegal immigration which is that really what's at stake\nAnd that is a a big issue again for everybody\nBut I'm Wondering the extent to which you feel it is a predominant issue for the Latino population because after all day to worry about a good schools for their kids they worry about crime taxes the whole panoply of issues that affect everybody\nIs the immigration issue and in particular as we speak now this a caravan of some three or four thousand Central Americans heading for the United states it is that in your view\nA bigger issue among Latino voters that among the rest of us\nI think uh the immigration policy the immigration issue is a big issue but it's not as big as per se education a quality of life of crime and some of the other factors that you mentioned\nI Know of the fact that we live in a world of nation states\nUh there are those who would decry that and I would certainly admit that there are downsides to the nation state but at this stage in the in the world a sociology ... pretty much the options are the nation state or ... or or some other form of a of tribal listing societal breakdown\nThat's that's the way of the world and there is no one world are we do not all hold hands and we do not all\nIn that context [noise] uh it is my view that a nation state has not only the right but the responsibility to determine\nBy whatever basis it decides however arbitrarily who gets into a country how many for how long and for what reasons now and then the light in the country in my view will do so based on what's best for the host country\nBut that is up to the host country at an aside that I saw in California some months back that is incorrect it said immigration is right no it is not a you may argue it should be I Would argue to the country but it is not a right your thoughts\nYou know I I you you back to that sign on Saturday immigration is right and I'm Wondering if the person had a problem with the language where it's got to admit the integration is right maybe it's a Reichert to happen or what have you on a going back to your question\nYou know we definitely have to put together both sides of the I have to get together put together some policy a rule of law or starch and start talking to each other again to put together something that makes sense and doesn't have people in seven Twenty years\nAnd that's another another point that I think it is important to to point out and we did a show on this some time back what Mr ... just said can happen you can take Seventeen to Twenty years in some cases going through the process following the rules\nAnd you can watch an entire lifetime go before your eyes you could watch your kids grow old\nAnd never have a chance at an American education playing by the rules and I would thoroughly agree with you something has to be done about that linked feeds time consuming and red tape filled

trade team to try to find a safe landing zone for all of this because no one was a trade war it only has collateral damage and right now production agriculture in Wisconsin is on the front line of that damage\nAt exactly the wrong time it's not just cranberries it's it's our corn and soybean producers are milk producers\nAnd this is happening at exactly the worst time after three years of very low commodity prices to begin with and a lot of farmers going out of business in production agriculture still a huge part of our state's economy employing a lot of people so we got to find an answer to this before and more economic damage is done\nIs there anything you can do to help these folks\nWell there's that package coming out of Washington this bailout package for are farmers and I haven't

been around talking about this for a number of weeks now so let's get some tips and advice on teenage driving safe driving that sort of thing a welcome Sarah you've teenage driver and your family\nNo no I don't but I Do a lot of a team driving instruction and teen driving schools for car control clinics so got a lot of connections and I feel responsible for every single one of them\nAre ... what was it like when you learn how to drive as a teenager\nYou know I was very fortunate dog my parents put a great importance on situational awareness improper in car training and they sent me to one of the car control clinics early on when I had my learners permit so that I could\nLearn the the tactile driving skills\nBut ultimately you know you don't even have to enact those skills as long as you're staying aware and being prepared that's why Michelin in a you know in our effort to try and reduce the number of teen deaths in automobile accidents because it's still\nEven though the number goes down your over here it's still the number one killer of teens and until we get to zero that's not really acceptable especially when you consider most of it's preventable\nSo you know as I said there are a lot of things we can do about driver training in in car\nBut a lot of what we do have this before\nWe even start the engine so Michelin did a recent survey and in seven major cities and discovered that forty percent of teens are driving on unsafe tires and probably in a lot of cases they didn't even realize it\nSo we wanted to start educating people on how simple it is to check your tires check your pressure check your tried that and in order to do that\nUh you know we we just want to make these common connections and it's it's not always\nFun to talk about tires me not everybody's a tire geek like me and\nMy I felt sorry and lit up when I tell people about\nThe dire geek are meant yeah\nWhat are you talking about when you go home at night to your husband or your general game I'd see I saw four tires were bad he got the people to change them I mean\nThat's really not too far from reality so [laughter] but I mean the thing it's it's kinda like\nAny any situation where you were all of a sudden you see something for the first time or you notice that for the first time then you start noticing it everywhere\nReally what we want to do with tires and and so what what Michelin did earlier this summer when when the kids were out of schools we launched this contest ah it was a street tread contest\nAnd they go on social media and show them taking care of their tires learning how to check their pressures or checking their tried that through the condition of their tires and what we did as a as a price for a hundred of of the winners was we partnered with bans the\nSneaker company um because you know it's not really easy to get people to care about or talk about their tires but it's really easy to get people to talk about their shoes and the kind of ironic part here is that tires or like the shoes for our cars and um I Wish you know an hour on radio so you can't see these awesome shoes\nBut they're uh you know vans created these with the Michelin Man designed into um [noise] and uh so the kids had the opportunity to make that equation\nTo you know the performance of their car and the safety of their car their tires to I mean let's be honest you walk out on a\nSlippery day war tolls on your shoes you're taking no dive so it was a fun\nKind of activity to get kids paying attention to the condition and their tires\nRobots are there are a lot of good stories you're the first female test drive or admission and so that has opened I'm sure a lot of eyes the stories that have come from that experience who you're a good teacher when

that line ... owns shares in town and I'm just trying to talk about um how business is going and where they are located in ... near them\nOkay yes you're on TALK about um your business and yeah the\nSears hometown store has been locally owned since the early nineties I purchased the store I'm In two thousand and four and have had it ever since a store is located at night in Huntington Avenue right there in the strip mall on the north end we're good well is\nAnd businesses have been great I Know there's been a lot of concern over there they had heard the news about a week ago vote the Sears Holdings Corp filing for chapter ... bankruptcy a we've been spending the time for the past six years letting everybody know that the Sears hometown source locally owned we are not part of Sears Holdings\nWe're lucky enough to have the Sears iconic name above the door but that filing has no effect at all on a um we broke off we are part of Sears hometown an outlet stores were publicly traded company\nAnd things have been great it's nice to be able to get the news out there now to groups of people instead of just individuals let them know that we are locally owned were independent we're here to stay\nOkay so yeah that's I'm Glad you brought that up as a ... totally different organization that you're apart over\nYeah it's nice because we are able to if we want to be able to maybe pool their money together to buy some products or to share on some of the costs and and stuff that makes sense maybe some of the advertising you see on TV\nBut but when it breaks down to it is we have our own vendor contracts we buy our own product we have our own transportation and and trucks and and register and everything is independent so\nEnds at and when it comes to like people purchasing stuff from you when it comes to warranties and they're like they're ... they're covered in ...\nYeah that that is one great point though we've had a lot of questions on ah the ... and our protection plans and everything like that those are under written by an insurance company so when you purchase those from us they are guaranteed no matter what happens um those will be fulfilled and taking care of so there is no issue when it comes to that at all\nAnd and um I think it's a twenty ninth year huh um and but I think we have a great group I'm looking forward I'm growing in their projects I think they will do great with them um they've got a lot of passion for 'em and I think they have the goal um\nThey've got the right strengths I'm looking at it and if they know the strengths that they do need they can pull from other people or people from the community too that they could bring it into it so\nYeah and that's another thing I always tell ... um the members of the leaders\nDon't be afraid to ask the station we can put out announcements or stuff like that about hey we're looking for help on this as part and get the community involved and broaden your project to include the community and more likely to get\nA accomplish what you want to have accomplished so willing to make don't be afraid to make use of that and of course I Will continuously be asking members [laughter] but we just a class about the project now or what's the next\nSession is going to a number of Fifteen to send me the community service um session and I'm actually just planning that such and I know\nThat much in terms of community service\nHas saved at like um tours of the library by family centered around ... we have for community services United Way on the hunger coalition ... table stuff like that\nAnd that will be an interesting those kind of like um\nMaybe the ... the community safety net mhm that we're talking about how we support one another within our community and you folks can find out what how hard that is so it sounds like you've got a really good is it a pretty diverse group\nI think so I think I mean there's some they have that same strengths and stuff it is it's a different I'm five nine and eight women um but\nI think it yeah I just it's a good group I'm excited or why are you excited I just watching them on that day and working together was really inspiring I have that ran the program in about five years now I'm In taking it back this year so I um\nYeah it was it's just inspiring I'm excited to see our community girl and watch them grow together ... what\nDo you think it was it was about your class a lead that\nI think a big thing is that we kind of we all come from different backgrounds I mean agents were from like ...\nAnd ... even with those different says everyone still had that same passion they still kind of at the same goal and everyone brought in that they just you know they need more to do more to the community um everyone just wants to find a good way to do that\nOkay so you're both ... and it's a passionate group that cares and it's like the ... the fact that you mentioned that it's a diverse age setting so you've got the young folks are going well\nWe need the sun and maybe someone that the older folks can give a historical perspective this is what it used to be like whenever or what but\nYeah we had a lot of people that share in the group that like moved away and came back to I thought was interesting kind of cool and that um you know hopefully will help tie into their um one project to\nHow do you think being a member of this leadership class will help you or you kind of touched on it and are you're opening statements with a more specifically how do you think it will help you with your current jobs well\nMine especially I just want to find ways for people coming into the community that they can really get involved if they want to a different\nAreas where they may I may see an inch shut that they have so that can kind of connect them a lot of times you know people from out of town they're just looking for that extra pizza how they can connect with any community and it'd be nice to get different avenues\nAnd give them a little bit more than just sell them a house or a solar lifestyle\nExactly yep I'm here to prepare the goal as\nI like that or like the ... you're listening you like do you like this community because we do this or I understand you have an interest in moose and we have we have better than other way from encourage looking and it's a community foundation by actually more now but\nBut and it's involved already in the community or do you think this will help you with your job\nYeah so uh for me it's not working in collaboration peace I don't have the networks here yet really that a lot of other ... of my co workers have so I think that\nJust having that opportunity to get to know these people and their organizations and think about ways that we all work together to help the community and and think differently about how we can help the community\n[laughter] yeah this this is going to be an interesting group I like the the projects divide 'em identified them look forward to hearing

give us a little bit of your background\nHi my name's ... fans like it was said I'm a new victim resource that skin\nAnd yeah I'm gonna you know I can help lift when people first come into the shelter and you know whatever they need whether it's shelter or just services if they want to you know fill out a restraining order or if they just want to talk to someone I can be that person if they come to and just talk to\nAnd are you from Erie\nI'm actually from a Scottish that's where I went to college when I went to go out there to okay yeah\nSo I actually was worked in an apple ten and you know it was kind of looking at jobs and course indeed you know you can find things all over the state and something about their ads is attracted me and go you know that's where I Want to be\nWith what was your feeling when you saw the center for the first time\nI thought it's gorgeous presidents I mean when you think of shelters this kind of like the stigma that it's not you know\nThe greatest looking place but when I came to and I saw you know ... this is a safe place and that's wonderful and you can tell that you know the community really does support it because you know it's well maintained and there's like you can tell that there are people there for the family center\nWon't have to take her via the first shelter so yeah I mean first of all the time it had firemen right five bedrooms is one yard that right across from St Lawrence and okay so this is quite quite falling\nOut and that was I remember that children does having that was big man right 'cause there was nothing and then the dream that started on or if we can only have\nA beautiful place like what you have no right and all the different people in the community that stepped up yeah I made the commitment um financially whatever to help out with the cars right\nThat that was back in Nineteen eighty four you know and the new shelters built in two thousand and four so [laughter] you know it's hard to believe that that's been there that long yeah so\nThat makes me feel old [laughter]\nSo you enjoy your\nShow yeah definitely um little passe about me and I said I've only been there for\nGoing on my third week but that doesn't mean that I don't have experience er I don't know what I'm doing [laughter] um\nBefore that I was working with women who are drug offenders order and when I was kind of helping them to prevent recidivism so that they you know didn't continues throughout the system and had an actual chance to get out the system\nSo it kind of you know a real understanding of the legal system in that area sure\nAnd you know working with probation and parole officers and officers in general and then a little bit before that I actually Internet the Winnebago County courthouse for a judge there so I got to sit in all sorts of court hearings and get a real feel how the court system works\nSo you've got a good background yeah all sorts of areas of the law so you you can um when someone comes to family center and beer in need of help and they don't know what way to turn or more work what should I Do next you can help guide them\nYes definitely and I can kind of you know give a description of what you know as available to\nTheir options than what's gonna happen because you know the legal system is very intimidating and it can be very scary especially the victims and [noise]\nYou know it's confusing it is it is and you know just to have someone to give you an idea of what's going to happen and healthy ... maneuver through that that's what I'm here\nFor and that's a nice thing that the family center provides with ear or you're a victim resource advocate for the fact that\nHere's someone may be a ... I guess my someone might be in a situation they're thinking of how can I get out of that this could be the short\nAbsolutely absolutely and this could be a start you know okay what are my options learning about what your options are then going from there right\nNow and as we talked about in the past two um as you know all our advocates can help anyone right you know but they all kind of do have their special specialty area\nSaw a lot of times I think a lot of people will be the like we said first responder and maybe they're the she's the one in ... when they first walk in the door but then they might actually\nWind up going with another advocate as well to kind of ... and I think the team work they work a lot together um and and now with our we\nI think we've talked about we've done some remodeling in the last year\nSaw all the kids kind of almost in a not a circle but they're all in in close proximity to each other so that there's a lot of communication back and forth on you know how they can help\nTherefore they all kind of know what a client is going through it might have had experience\nWith the different aspects of helping wrote quite correct yeah correct mhm okay

always you know wanted to help people that's always what I wanted to do and\nYou know I've been to the legal system personally and I've had friends go to the legal system and you know it's very intimidating and\nIt's difficult and I don't want people to feel overwhelmed and I want people to feel like they get justice so you know if I can give someone that power that they felt like they have finally got justice for themselves that's that's the main goal for me\n... ... some of the issues that are all better withdrew from resource advocate works or can we do talk about it so someone comes

the Arpaio's\nAnd get the ball there and Jones and basically keep the way the ball away from the rams 'cause I don't think any defense can keep up with these guys are score ... points away right\nI
