only time we really\nWere stopped so that we called and they may be inside the airline to come by our kids play with all the energy to pass by that was pretty fun to watch\nCoach the last seven games other than one one scored a victory over ruin you guys have dominated after that opening last Madison memorial so let's go back to that last memorial and what the heck happened to you guys have been dominating since then what what what was it in week one and what have you guys doing so much better since then\n[noise] well I think what it does is painted solidifies us with a whole pile up you know I I think at that fixing to\nYou know you're going to be Seventy two or three which I enjoy your stand old political one typically um so I Hope\nThat is one of the things and then it gives the accomplish championship game against the whole team that you know there's not a lot of people that live in Alaska Coleman and there's a lot of people and they're like on a last so ah it it's a rivalry and as we all of us for an outlet about this\nYou know audio political\nNo it it definitely will be exciting to close out the regular season in by the way Tom I haven't talked to are met a coach or a team of athletes yet that had cameras that now you know what let's just kicking tie it let's just let's play over time everybody wants to roll the dice don't that\nYeah you know and we'll ... we'll have some ideas ... ... ... ... ... what we need to develop a little heat what's with all the time was up to play play with\nThe kids look it up and give it to install cameras all over the entire game they said give it to also because they thought that this was going to support it and he did you know but that's kind of ownership you like take ownership of they'll say hey we want we want all those people because we believe in him um\nYou know but that's the kind of stuff he really liked to these little kids you always want you always go for that situation\nTime you get you get to celebrate for another ten minutes then you've got to get ready for next week but thanks for joining us on friday night\nThanks guys for having\nYou bet Twenty one twenty hang on against west Salem and now as as he mentioned travesty tease it up for that big rivalry showdown to close a weeknight\nThat is it big rivalry my sister in law might be the only one that likes both when she lives in Alaska teaches at home and oh so she might be the exception to the rule but there's not a lot of love lost certainly an added element in Atlanta that made a parent isn't it\nThat's a kind of little sneak preview could sneak peek a little preview of what's to come in we neither one of the big games and and later on travel so\nHe'll run on some of the other big games or what have either playoff implications are conference implications are just big rivalry implications to close out the regular season and joining us now from the valley is head coach Steve ... find a like his guys got another big W tonight\nKnock knocking on\nWood you knock off your knocked up Nina tonight forty nine to seven Steve congratulations are continuing to rule here against quality opponent so that's kind of feel good as the head coach\nYeah we're playing well at the right time I'm\nA little bit concerned because we're we're somewhat of a speed team and we we did that play on a tour field we're on grass and it was it was real Marty it rained all day up here in uh in the ... valley so um [noise]\nUh we did play really well daughter a slick surface um kids kids perform well\nOf course does that mean that we can expect her fun for the field next year\nWe played at Mina but uh we are working on that yeah so uh um\nYeah what I think we are better team on tour but uh uh we we we did play well tonight on a slick surface\nAnd you guys have played well all year long obviously had a very very close very exciting when over Kimberly in week one and then really have rolled through the competition the rest of the way where some of the things that uh that you guys learned from that close went over Kimberly then that you're doing much better here later in the season [noise]\nWell I think the strength and our team\nComing into the season was are often so blind and and that that has been our strength or with the\nQuarterback cursing rabbits and have been showers running back as have been a real good one two punch but the thing I'm most proud of his away our defenses pointed um they play the exceptional and\nYou know with our off supplying kind of controlling games that are defense or getting quite a few three now so it's it's it's a great combination for us\nTo talk of the joints in the head coach a final coup knocked off needed tonight forty nine to seven\nSteve your your team has been tested I mean from week one on and and and they had passed the test and you mentioned the defense and you mentioned the fence of line ... ... it it seems like you know some teams could say hey we knocked up Kimberly you know look at us now we have you know we're the team to beat\nBut even with the target on the back it seems like the kids didn't just you know the rest of their laurels on that week one victory damn going out and they had been tested against all the good teams and they pass those tests\n[noise] yeah they really they they're really played well it's a it's a good group of kids number one they like to go to practice and and that's what this was all about me and then that carries over to the game so they they work very hard to like the game of football the practice are\nUm they've kept their head of bottom after the Kimberley when and things like that I mean they they have been there are some of these kids were playing a saw mores and playing against Kimberly real close games previous couple seasons so you know they they they knew they could play at that level and a\nUm that that was an expectation they had a a um themselves that they could could ...\nAnd continue that type of place throughout the season\nWe're talking with Steve Jorgensen the head coach it found a lack of team got a win over Nina impressively to stay undefeated coach we talked to a little bit earlier this year this is your first year back as the head coach after a number of years off previously a Kimberly and ...\nUm how are you holding up in your first year back as the head coach as we get towards the end of the season\nI'm really will have a a great coaching staff\nUm and it helps me to feed it so uh but that that helps a lot because\nOf the losses are a lot more are are are real hard on people coaches and the the winds are pretty easy to take so I Know it's real well plus we have just a great group of kids so\nThat makes that that's what it's all about what your breakfast like I said we practice hard and and the it's it's been a joy so far\nAs the ... do you guys celebrate or do you do you just say okay got that one and move on\n[noise] um we celebrated this one tonight because the the scare and our kids look forward to because being a being deployed us really well last year and there was a little bit of a these kids know each other through camps and some you know I think there is a\nLittle bit of Twitter going on there was some of these more yeah uh uh uh so uh there there there was kind of a\nA R guys were ready for them because I think some stuff words out there that uh that uh I I really I'm not a Twitter guys so I don't know that was said some people just sent it to me that you know they kind of call the salt and our our guys were ready for\nYou guys are ready for NATO you're ready for social media you guys are ready tonight\nOn beaten week eight eight no the final at colonels the jars and congrats on thanks for joining us in football friday night\nThings for all you do guys thanks a lot\nThank you very weekend thank you as well yeah we were just talking about that that ... that I mean we weren't just that this wasn't just filler conversation for you and I that you can see a you know a rivalry like that\nAnd there's discussion and sometimes it's healthy and sometimes it's it's fun and playful and other times it's to push the buttons before they actually take a football game off\nLook these teams aren't I I think what you would call traditional rivals necessarily but when you get some of that chirping when you get competitive games like we saw last year like like coach mentioned things step into a a rivalry situation pretty quickly\nAnd ... and I think the ... and you know he he kind of mentioned to that how\nThese guys have handled things since the Kimberley game and that was a dynamic that I remember week one and we remember\nYou know starting our show up our first show the season and talking about that game and breaking it down and how it finished in ... you know what a big victory it was an how it ended Kimberly street\nI was interested to see how final that would respond and because now all of a sudden the target was always on the back of Kimberly now it's going to shift the filing because everybody's going to look at finding and say okay you beat them so now we want to beat you can find like has gone out and they really handled their business very well Travis\nThey have Kimberly has handled their business as well and as we sat way back in week one there is a good shot these teams could meet again in the playoffs and it would be an outstanding game maybe earlier than what some people like it might be level three\nMaybe ooh so maybe to maybe a little too depending on how seeds go and whatever else but I don't think it's over between five black in the in a\nWhile and we just mentioned earlier that there there are some teams\nThat were on beaten coming into games tonight but some teams are still surviving and thriving and they remain on beaten they are eight and oh and one of those teams to find a lack cardinals\nTrying to close up a perfect campaign if they can get the W. next week football friday night more scores more discussion\nMore coaches and previews of what's to come in weeknight coming your way [noise]\nAnd playing really good and then obviously you know we had a gear up for that uh because Martin Luther just a ... point they each and every game\nAnd so the deep end of the players really took that challenged and\nUm you know it was it was ... for us but uh you know we were able to withstand the weather um we did a great that given the bowl dried stuff like that because if they come down on us but we're not forcing at a um turn over\n'em later in the in the fourth quarter of bad nap and and that kind of got them are within scoring distance or reach in Austin and er it was just a kind of that on on afford them boy\nDan how in the world did you keep that young men and check in the starting back to you because no one's been able to do that so far this season\nWell I mean we wind up that piece on a nose guard in um Adrian Garcia is all they know he's very very quick or a phenomenal\nAnd uh you know he's he's a senior for us and he was like I said he was all state which association last year and um he just continues to\nAh make a big impact and that's where we were on a three for defense so you know you got to have that knows guard that are really demands double peas and a eight during his good enough to even a disrupt those double themes and good after the ball carrier um and then our and our our our and play very well and\nYou know we just talked about eleven eleven man or to the to the ball um all week and you know they I think our pursuit really a really um\nTook a took a step forward or against a Crowley read\nWe're talking with Dan Miller the head coach or seen saint Catherine says team said on beating\nTopping Martin Luther tonight coach you or you had your outstanding player to Shaun Brown miss the game and a half earlier this year not going to ask you to to get into the specifics of that but how do you feel his he has responded from that situation or not only land something but this week\nUm he he's responded exactly how we've been talking about you know play in the next way of putting all out of that stuff aside and are playing the game he's he's ... he's been planned a all his life I'm ... is a special kid\nAnd he is he's a he understands the you know the the biggest thing with the shot and and I tell a lot of guys this is a is extremely um you know accountable\nA ... and takes takes accountability for his actions and you know that's why I kept you know they nominate um captain and um you know he just shows that on the field\nAnd uh you know he just ... it really commanded the often you know we definitely one that game up front I felt that um but the Sean when it came down to it and it was that for them for a and we needed to get a first down the kind of the game you know the the boys just a you know let's go for it and\nThe rain was coming down real hard I didn't want to they don't want to risk going out on a spot you know snap or or um a pond and uh so we went forward and uh you know the Sean took it for a first down and and that and the\nCoach uh as far as to Shaun ... you know when you look at the recruiting things going on and I know he's really focused on trying to get this team to a deeply out front and possibly to stage\nSo he's kind of keeping the recruiters at bay the list him as an athlete you were a college coach and where do you think did Sean could be plugged in and played you know\nI I Would I look at him when I see him in practice you know the the biggest thing I see is his ability to\nA ... you really want the ball in his hand and uh you know if he's not going to play quarterback you know I I think he's very his thoughts athleticism and it is jumping ability as a Russian um he's a ball hawk so I you know me personally I Would love to see 'em a running role\nHe's a big receiver ah with with with a lot of power um he's got along supplied so I I think that bode well for him at the next level and then\nWhen you want to talk to you know when he talked to some you know recruiters and and they just lost his length and everything as a DVD as a state the\nCause of range you know they'll just go hand in hand um but I tell you know I Know the I Know there's a lot of uh you know touching the football and he's a he's done it all his life\nI'm ... I mean that's ... that's like getting up and to the side of the ball's probably got a little little nudge ahead of the defense of sides\nWell and that's why they list them as an athlete because he's got a lot of options and it's good to have options in life and it's good to have a guy like that on your angels team because you guys continue to roll coach thanks for joining us in football friday night well thank\nYou for having us and are having me on and and a cover in a A R Wisconsin football you guys do a phenomenal job\nWe appreciate it then Miller the head coach of a scene think capping the angels a panel of beatings Travis and they break tie at least for the moment they see an beaten and Martin Luther boy you've heard them talking about being able to to cap Crowley read who's been able to do that no one to the first seven weeks\nVery impressive and he mentioned Adrian Garcia [noise]\nThat's a really strong defense of unit obviously as he talked about they had a couple of really talented defensive lineman coming back so a great job by the angels defense\nStarting to wind down here on week eight of football friday night we'll take a break when we come back\nWe'll get you all

river whenever you want to call it these days I I still call it the red river shoot out I mean\nI hate to say and that's just what I always remember that it's too violent you can call it the red river shootout yeah you can still the red river really fun because Texas played much better football after re opening\nLost to Maryland nobody ... college football news dot com joining us in the eye can we just called the red river shootout please I mean come on ... year old school I'm old school that's what we know where that's right\nI I guess not politically correct in that way by coolest rivalry or show that what I what\nI call it is not calling it the cocktail party when Georgia and Florida place actually bigger issue with the Texas Oklahoma thing is I always have to Google or to make sure I'm doing the right one which is actually the showdown but\nWhat Texas Oklahoma so\nA lot of fun right that's all promising I don't know what it is to Google is I just keep calling you to shoot out because I really\nWould how do you still dream is that the um I've never ever going to trust myself how to spell James is that you know there's a whole slew of those that I got to work\nCome on it's James within before the there you go\nYou're sure it's not a dream I\nPretty much am you know she and I yes\nActually I I'm not sure I've only written in about a hundred thousand times I still don't\nTrust myself she got me all confused I'm actually pretty good this is a tactic radio by the way no now too and I don't you write is ... ...\nThat's what I'm Talking about this is where you know this is part of the issues that we're all dealing with now is we have to fortunately have this Google machine that they sure oh yeah that's one of those things that you have\nLike I force myself to learn at last let's burger or an ... you know I've got those ... before never in my house as a heartless and Philippe Frank's by the way\nYeah Philippe Frank a hard one of the larger speaking of Florida LSU at some point people believe this algae magical land you know the swamp is considered a tough place to play on those some have come out this week and said it wasn't that top I think last miles came out and said that there's a magic for you and with that or drawn this week against and monitor is Alice you just too good for Florida\nYou know I I I Want to try to preemptively defined that narrative that I wrote that this week an old ... ...\nIf you you know they still got to deal with Alabama you know they still going to do at this game was Florida they got a nasty schedule ahead\nThey're going to lose two or three games that doesn't mean that edge or dry and needs to be on a hot seat that doesn't it doesn't mean that LSU as bad\nAs that forget that they did beat ... and that they did beat Miami when nobody ever thought they would give them a let's not like all of a sudden turn this into something bad if they lose this game because you know how this roles is that\nEspecially in the FCC you lose one game I was up to Austin part of the coach new coach and because there is not really another hot seat coach out there and the FCC right now\nHe's the one that that that it\nUh but I Do think that's the only the team's good I mean their defense is great their wines are great they don't have a a Leonard for net or an old old back on the job ... just isn't that great a but they're getting the job done I'm picking Florida I'm not quite sure why because home field advantage as a matter of the series over the last few years\nUh but I Do like their defense and I do like Philippe I before ... except for poor pie a day just to just be okay or it'll be a slug fest low scoring or wherever doesn't screw up the ... when the ...\nLet's get back to the red river showdown right we'll call it that does the fat hoping he would\nShow called the humor I go you\nKnow what this is not a politically correct radio show called the damn shoot out in the red river shootout this Oklahoma's defense which seems to give up a lot of points a lotta yard does that work the way that Texas has played off ... although it did not look great offensively against Kansas State\nLittle bit I I always kind of despise the idea of oh it's a rivalry throw up you know the logic and read that they just go with that that you know we're things haven't\nI'll buy that in this game because it's weird things have happened and that they\nThey beat Oakland needed green Oklahoma team that won the big coal championship from the Charlie Strong era last year's Texas team wasn't all that good Oklahoma was the play away from playing for the national championship and it took a highly has been winning throw from Baker Mayfield\nTo the poll that thing off this thing done storing the file logic and revealing I'll show through the same thing in a couple of weeks of Florida Georgia play it just weird things happen in this game\nI I'm going to go with Oklahoma because it's the better team and I'm going to do the responsible thing and not be weird\nBut I Do think it can be close I think they're going to battle I think Oklahoma's going to be in for a little bit of a fight 'em but if ... if it's not\nIf Texas pulled this off now we redefine the narrative now you know it's easy to a blow off the the Maryland last a little bit it's weak one a look at it was a very inspirational moment for Marilyn ... great\nYou know there are no pre season games so it's Texas is improving so all of a sudden tech this goes from being in off the radar to you know what they're right there in the thick of this thing for college football playoff good\nCollege football news dot com the few times joining us going deep enforcement NBC Sports radio maybe I'm biased with my fraudulent Allen Alabama fandom but Ohio State has a good team I watch them against Penn State everybody did\nBut I think there's a gap between Alabama and everybody else I I have to say I know you you know you're you're a rational college football fan but do you see it that way to him I wearing crimson glasses here I mean they just seem better than the young right\nThere you know the the thing is Georgia hasn't totally you know how good at the Georgia is that they play like hot garbage at times over the last couple of weeks and they're still destroying teams I mean they they were awful times against Missouri and they still like All right we'll try now and then that was that\nThey were they were OK against Tennessee and like I I watch the game and I'm like gosh they're just not really doing much Tennessee sort of hanging around and then you kind of look back at the stats and show the numbers don't necessarily tell the whole story like chick from hit like eighty percent of its passes you know they were into it\nThey're just really good Ohio State you're right on the long haul timeline you know I don't think it's as good as Alabama\nOne game format they've got to tell you that was the difference against Penn State ... everything going Penn State's way you know the crazy atmosphere of the road game trace mixed or was the best player on the field of having a high caliber performance\nAnd then when they needed it all of a sudden all house that you know what we recruit really really well\nYeah we are going to put on your ears were NFL running backs go off here's where NFL receivers go off and there's ... nothing you can do about it and that's really sort of what happened\nKnow I I listen to James Franklin he gave that little speech were a great team or not an

I think ultimately for them but\nThey don't have any to can't the weakness now I don't know in January with the overriding strength is it's going to get them through but there's nothing about and while they really can't do acts and things like that we find a way to win ten games get\nHey why are the chiefs who were undefeated and who came back was a nice when ... got a pretty good defense\nOr why are the genes just eight three point favorite at home against James which NFL home fields worth three points alone and they're basically saying this was an even up games do we like the jags and that ... that much because many homes are straight up on fire\nJacksonville and the other number one and points allowed for community than their number one and yours is again for the number one\nThat'll said I Would take Kansas City in this game that she's her home ... has the best foreign to me that's all right now I Know who they're a few things that are better but if you watch and see that all I can put it on folks they they do it when we got our own hands down if you can leave for a week\nAt all he's got a long way to go to prove himself to walk him and it's pretty evident that he's not going to be a fire that he thought I might be quick with tax and bill\nIs the same questions in for a year and a half I Know that would be a really good ... are you getting out of work because there is something we really well there are other Wi Fi control for X\nTotally submarine factory and so for me gave me the quarterback coming home field I Do think it's a good man I prank crank it comes to the ... and see right now or what's going on but I Would ... the city because of her home and because it clearly have a dark advantage quarterback\n... sided dot coms or get mad at you know me being a Seattle native any Seahawks ticket holders basically sold all those games this year\nI Do know the NFC West I Believe I don't like either line rams are only giving up seven and a half\nIn Seattle no are all time is I mean nobody's playing for the sea hawks and they took Michael ... works out and are getting ready to throw them in the bubble fugitive styles okay uh yeah seven and a half more like Seventeen and a half the rams when that and the niners at home only given three and a half of the cardinals really I mean come on\nThe recording over terrible for everybody talks about the bills\nAnd the door for the bills are really bad that a crazy when in Minnesota I think most people would agree that was an aberration [noise] but the cardinals are just on on should have weight that I mean the cardinals are going to be lucky to want to get here\nSo I'm with you with the nine or ... even when after and they're like they're not going to walk again they're going to be competitive and they're going to be ... if they don't that's a serious indictment or that kind of go with that program building\nAs far as the rest of the sea hawks your a sea hawks and new are my friends will be very nice I Would agree with you that that line is too low if you're a better you probably want to hit the rams pretty hard that gift\nPattern of a problem with that I mean hey when you're a college team can be your pro team in that town like Washington surely could see offices here\nIn Washington is down here so I'm going to have fun at least they can wipe the floor with one LA team and UCLA on Saturday before the pros gets it handed to them by the LA pro team on Sunday or as well hey the battle of ... anybody hair or any one of these teams going anywhere or if you're

of the national football league season weeks six of college football the major league baseball postseason is here\nAnd uh of course if you're like me which nobody cares with me here at the network news today is now it's Saturday which means talking not in Canada that's right eight five five three two three\nFour and a B c's ah they say Cleveland Rocks and right now it's it's pretty good for sports it's starting to get where they need to on a couple of other levels other teams are\nCleveland sports historian John Eric hockey you are now makes his home out in Los Angeles but I've seen some of your work the format and great stuff John ... for being with us too and yeah let's let's go ahead and talk about\nThis I'm a sports team now and what's going on in Cleveland and we'll start with the current and the president and that's the baseball here the Cleveland Indians\nAre taking on the chair against the Astros so I I Know that early on in the series but still I mean they ran away with this division from the beginning you feel like this was a team that's been on the edge and just so close Alaska\nIs to experience I was at that World Series and uh it was really exciting when Roger Davis hit that home run but it was this gets to a real powerhouse Chicago team and uh I thought it was great so uh I think with the experience these guys have\nA solid pitching staff they have like for instance there and uh I think anything's possible I think that they can go all the way whoever uh you know pull through an October is the one that's going to make it happen\nYeah they don't have as far as the aces or are concerned I mean look Trevor power came in he pitched in game one does that concern you being a fan\nNo not at all I think Terry Frank cone as so much experience as a winter\nHe knows how to push the buttons of those guys to make them perform in October and I'm really excited about our possibilities\nOr you know he's ... he's a legend in Cleveland he's pushed us small market team to this point and there's so much talent as long as they peak at the right time that's baseball seems such a momentum game if you pick in October you can win the whole thing\nJohn Eric hockey Cleveland sports historians with a series NBC Sports radio and its NBC Sports radio dot com\nHey I talked to me about the Baker Mayfield so craves that's going on right now I mean look the browns or what they would they want to game they tied the game last the games well but the main thing is they ... every game and that's something we just haven't seen it's great\nI mean Baker may feel just seeing his enthusiasm the leadership qualities you see I mean he's like you know a gunslinger you get that kind of Brett Farr ask you know not to the accomplishments but that energy level the enthusiasm it's infectious you see him running down the field with the other players\nIt's just as a fan it's just such an incredible sight to see it reinvigorated the fan base I Know our attendance I mean we are diehards like\nIn the middle of Hollywood everyone's like why aren't you a raiders ... the hawks far I'm like I'm from Cleveland GED I didn't I was born into this I Choose this I'm not a fair weather guy\nBut you know our fan base it on sixteen we're still dry thirty to forty people I mean you're not going to say that and then the other NFL a sports team or with the viewing sites and stuff they failed but a Baker Mayfield has just drawn so much enthusiasm it's just been really incredible\nAnd you need that as far as a quarterback is concerned on John Eric hockey Cleveland sports historians with us but you heard him talk about a bar you moved out to LA and said let's open up a Cleveland a bar the St Felix\nAh in Hollywood as well so it's it's kinda cool to that they have on somebody who really truly knows their Cleveland sports to me a beat the hell out of having a you know the writers on all the time as well too so\nUm you know when you talk about may feel that this was a quarterback that you need some spunk and some passion\nBecause I don't remember Brian side are burning codes are\nHaving saying did I mean did did they do yeah they just didn't they have the same thing they feel has inside of it was I mean I Know they were great quarterbacks especially closer and stuff but but did\nHave I mean let's just the rover achievers year Bernie was lanky he wasn't the greatest athlete he had tremendous hard I mean he gave his body he wasn't the most beautiful Joe Montana ask throw he was a side I'm Guy Brian ... another smaller quarterback I think he's five ten five eleven Baker Mayfield has those size issues\nSo that's all heart that stuff that's just not physical and I love that stuff Cleveland people love that they love the under dog it's a story about a lot of the culture and passion behind the fan base and I think it's great so Baker I Hope he achieved that status of those quarterbacks and takes it beyond that that would be an exciting playing for Cleveland especially after\nComing back in Ninety nine I just remember when uh our motel took the team I didn't watch NFL for three years and I grew up watching and I was a little kid my dad took me to municipal stadium I remember how rowdy those blue collar workers were in the snow throwing dog bones and batteries and beers and\nYou know that environment can be recreated was magical but I Will say that\nA bigger Mayfield has those same physical attributes that those guys didn't he has to overcome those are the biggest things you are on all the talking heads say on a national game\nWhat's the deal always small but you know he's got ... got accuracy which is huge and it's got a really nice arm I mean you're seeing that happen as long as he keeps his head on right and runs for amateurs and takes a leadership role instead of just kind of a hothead I think it'd be great\nHi I didn't know that that's that's right I mean look physical size is nice Drew Brees has done it\nA you know I'm a sea hawks guy Russell Wilson has done it and gotten over that hump and are in that respect as well and I think a lot of people liked Baker Maine so this is certainly an exciting class\nOf quarterbacks to be able to watch this year with Mayfield\nWith Arnold uh possibly rose and you know maybe Josh Allen with what we've seen thus far John Eric hockey yeah Cleveland sports a story and joining us here is the Bush leagues as NBC Sports radio and its NBC Sports radio dot com I said earlier in the show that October is my favorite month of the year\nWhen it comes to sports yeah baseball winding up we talked about your your Indians you got football almost in mid season form\nAnd are and what the the browns are doing\nYou got hockey the just started basketball that's in its prevention

doesn't do any\nDay now maybe Duke is an exception to the rule who knows maybe again it's just me being a pessimist but when it comes to college basketball I really think if we go and we look hard

than any other one basketball is the sport where you can make I think more of an impact right away I 'cause basketball\nThe the ball can run through you every single time you come up through the floor they really can't plus you've got five guys so there's four other do's and you don't worry about you can singlehandedly how many times we've seen LeBron Jordan Kobe imagine just push everybody to

don't do that more of a team game more of a situation baseball mano a mano a you know at first base is open I'm going to walk you and I'm going to face the jump behind use it and to forty five\nBasketball more of a quicker immediate fix more of a Quaker Meeting impact and you're seeing this would be a college basketball\nNow quite honestly I look at things maybe from a different skewed view Ghana whole college athletics thing and you know student athletes I think they should always called him athlete students 'cause that's what they are\nI mean I have two kids that went and played collegiate baseball and even baseball being not even probably the third most popular sport in college we know it's football driving the bus ride in shock on his basketball in somewhere about halfway back on the buses college baseball\nAnd in fact behind those two everybody really sits for pretty much halfway back on\nThe bus right there but yet still they were athlete students they weren't

E. I. Gabriel thank you for the time how are you my friend\nI'm good thanks and they sent me are\nAbsolutely when I got to be guiding without your claim you got to be stoked about those guys\nAre you kidding me well I Am still but you know let me just tell you something\nThe feeling when ... came on them out it was electric\nAnd that may well while it was great because we were built it for Yankees were climbing back climbing back and there and so it gets on the mound and you all it was just like first of all that's why our score it should be\nManager of the year manager for this guy is incredible to pull that kind of thing to know that's what we needed but that's the one problem I'm worried about is because that feeling of having someone come on the mound leading the game of forty putting the closer we haven't had it all year and I don't know\nWe got to see where we win game but I Want to feel that all the time you think is going to be some change in the kitchen rotation to do that or are they going to put Rodriguez or or you just say we're going to sit there and and hope that are often takes care of everything\nWell let me ask you this would you rather have poor cello or Rodriguez as a starter for salary has more wins but Rodriguez reach double digits first and then you had not been for that injury I don't know why I like better or not I I think I actually like Rodriguez on rotation more\nI guess my feeling I think for so that job either tonight and he shows that he can do it I mean\nIt was price but you know we are starting so I think I think we're so it was the man I think we need them they're\nYeah no I Would agree haven't had that yeah I Would agree and and look at the Indians tried something similar and there again they they threw in Trevor Bauer off earning games do sort of try to stop the bleeding or as a starter as well too but ah is this going to look the bottom line is\nIs the bullpen there for the red Sox not as trustworthy as a Yankee both and you're fine with Kimber\nAll right but the eighth and the seventh inning if you're starters really argue you're kind of a a kind of a wait and see approach about the only chink in the armor I can see with the uh the Boston Red Sox theme of Gabriel I appreciate the call and then you call again anytime from a beach town say a lot of my uh my good friend and broadcasting Tim never the red Sox radio announcer out their eight five five\nThree two three four and a B. C.\nBut yeah if if that is the weaknesses are set up guy\nPassing it on to Craig kimbro so you are going to lean you are going to ... start as more I Will say this though and I said this before I Love about postseason baseball\nYou don't eat all five starters give me three stars your number four and your number five guys just tells me if Percival as the guy to come in like Gabriel ... I think it will be Rodriguez who will be your game three started with price being number two and whether it's Rodriguez or partial oh I'm fine with either one of those guys\nPlug the other guy in in the exact same spot that Alex core I did on friday\nAnd by doing so I mean that's exactly what the Red Sox needed to be able to win this game like Aaron judgment and interesting\nWith a home run in the ninth and he's going to do that because the guys Paul bond you know what I mean jeez you can take anybody yard he's he's that big he's that good he's that strong but the Yankees have a similar situation and the problem that haunts the Dodgers as well\nA lot of off and it's good enough pitching to get you they're good enough pitching to win some games which is a good enough in the postseason because think about it in the postseason here scores are three to to\nThis is a fairly high scoring game your scores are wanting to nothing four to nothing three nothing's ... shut outs who are not in key staff is going to shut out or even come close to shutting out that red socks off in one is all said and done that is why I think it may be a long series for the Yankees are\nGoing to say it's going to be short series well to either way I Love both teams I wrote about it and basically worth what after an earlier age like around season or the radio report with Carl hill Keith Tam Thirteen twenty that'll do as a jar [noise]\nYour NBC Sports radio updating\nThe Dodgers in ... both on cruise control I'm Rob Bush got we have all four games of the NFL and a LDS in action on friday and the Dodgers have shut Atlanta Alan Ball games ... while Dodgers beat the Rob those by three nothing tally they've out scorn Atlanta nine nothing game three will be back\nSunday in Atlanta meanwhile the Rockies\nCame up short for nothing in Milwaukee Cleveland\nThey're up to games but not as well also heading into the mile high city about the American league first up you had to Houston down in Cleveland seven to two Justin Vernon either doing what justice for land or does the elastic\nCory ... three home runs for the Astros and then the red Sox had a five nothing lead Yankees came back to make it five four great kimbro got this save a Red Sox win it on frozen bond Carolina when San jose gets an OTC went in LA this was NBC Sports radio the Dodgers in brewers von\nBraun after CBS Radio\nWould want to buy gas around\nKind of like that yeah I Know your day we're going to be talking about for college basketball baseball hockey five days and then I bought a Vegas gave all of that that that may be the\nFact that six days a week\nFrom the west would one podcast network\nWhat how safe for tennis you're ready to play is everything alright excited to share a lake redeem knows that allergy congestion can get in a way of enjoying the moment go ahead and practice without\nMe celebrity helps you breakthrough congestion ... non drowsy anti histamine plus a powerful decongestant for twenty four hours of congestion free whoa and I saw\nCould be crawling in Minnesota and to hold off to college or if this can be anything like you are last Sunday they become a lot more interesting 'cause I don't care if the great defense and that's all fine and well but it for ... doesn't play well there are always going to be ...\nYou know you talk about last Sunday probably the most impressive\nWhen last Sunday for me was the bangles going to Atlanta which is typically a tough place to play now you shake your head and you're like how the world's Atlanta one and three I can maybe see as an anti three one but they get lantis perfect back as well to a guy who likes to lower the boom and and bring the hammer as well and the bangles aren't home\nPlaying the dolphins who we saw a paper tiger did they get the you know cut back down to reality last week in in New England and are you still able to trust Andy Dalton because there's the ginger\nOr you know I think the dolphins you are going to have the type of a very weird delayed multiple times\nAnd they beat the jets and they beat the writer I think the dolphins are going to have a very wrong coming back to earth situation here over the next couple of months um as far as the bangles go look I think\nYours to miss the playoffs this year I didn't think they were before the season I stolen from during good I thought Baltimore when the division and I'm sticking with that but I think the bangles or like oil and actually I don't trust and the all once they get there because I don't trust coats I don't trust the quarterback against could have bought\nNew to the schedule\nAnd put a lot of winnable games as you mentioned being Atlanta on the road that you you'd planted and I think ultimately for them but they don't have any to can't the weakness now I don't know in January with the overriding strength is it's going to get them through\nBut there's nothing about that is wow they really can't do acts and teams like that we find a way to win ten games to get the\nWires achieved sewer undefeated and who came back was a nice when at Denver who's got a pretty good defense\nWire that she's just a three point favorite at home against James which NFL home fields worth three bones the loans that are basically saying that there's an even up again do we like the jags and that deep in that much because he owns a straight up on fire\nJacksonville about the while they're number one point allowed for community than their number one and yards against or the number one in passing or to get\nThat all that I Would take Kansas City in this game that she's her home ... did she have the best often CFL right now I Know statistically there are a few things that are better but if you walk in the city battle and put it on folks they they do it we can and week out more owns at the hands down if you leave for a week\nAt all he's got a long way to go to prove himself when you walk in and it's pretty evident that he's not going to be a flash that he could play I my question which act and bill\nIs the same questions in for a year and a half now I Know the answer\nIs really good ... are you getting bored because there are some weeks he plays really well there are other Wi Fi control for X totally silver exact aims so for me give\nMe the quarter pack give me home field I Do think it's a good game and I prank crank to compare the two best things is she right now or what's going on but I we Kansas City because her home and because it clearly have a park bench quarterback\nAnd murder in San sided dot coms or gas\n... who knows me being a Seattle native any Seahawks the ticket holders basically sold all those games this year\nI Do know the NFC West I Believe I don't like either line rams are only giving up seven and a half\nIn Seattle no are all Thomas I mean nobody's playing for the sea off any talk Michael Caine drugs out and getting ready to throw them in the bubble fugitive styles okay uh yeah seven and a half more like Seventeen and a half the rams when that and the niners at home only given three and a half of the cardinals really I mean come on\nTo the cardinal her terrible or we'd be talking about the bills\nAnd bills are paid the bills are really bad that a crazy one in Minnesota I think most people would agree that was an aberration but the cardinals are just unconscionable I mean the cardinals are going to be lucky to want to get this year\nSo I'm with you with the niners even with ... and they're like they're not going to the games but they're going to be competitive and they're going to be like the ... and they don't that's a serious indictment or that kind of go with that program building\nAs far as the rest of the sea hawks your a sea hawks and you are my friends will be very nice I Would agree with you that that line is too low if you're a better you probably want to hit the rams pretty hard and that kind\nOf a problem with that I mean may when you're a college team to meet your pro team in that town like Washington surely could see offices here\nIn Washington is down here so I'm going to have fun at least they can wipe the floor with one LA team and UCLA on Saturday before the protest against it handed to them by the LA protein on Sundays as well hey the battle of hotshot anybody care or any one of these teams going anywhere or if you're outside the Lone Star state just forget about it\nI mean Dallas Dallas is bad Dallas we not only the bad they're born they just have nothing I Know people must Kelly is fantastic that we've been yell fat cream I mean how can you get excited I have on often it out on her back Prescott\nJust Twain I mean they weren't the cowboys and that was the lions they would never be on a day and as far as the Texans are concerned\nBark I I don't rule them out completely because I Do think how could that the line is terrible coaches awful I just think it's a bad game like something I usually end up getting breaking and next week is going to be Kansas City of which would be fascinating\nYeah you might want to maybe ... or reading his mother\nIs mad burger and Trump band sided a dog I'm Betty we always appreciate you for joining us and we'll catch up with you again my friend a good reads on good times that cycle out there you go ... sided dot com yeah when I look at it a lot\nOf these games on the on the schedule see that's the thing about the NFL is you could look at the sixteen games and I could find a reason to want to watch ten of 'em uh I don't know if I could say that this week I mean cowboys taxes for the pride of Texas I mean really come on nobody's got a winning record in that game ran through the Seahawks was a blowout\nNiners and the cardinals Rajoy Montana back right now and still be should be a blow a carnival glass bad\nEagles and the Vikings the under achieving bull\nRaiders and the chargers the third most popular team in LA behind us see the rams and then ...\nUh yeah I'm a glass half empty guy when it comes to the giants and the Panthers Eli I should retire cams overrated you want me to stop or do I keep going with it right falcons and the Steelers no lady on bell who cares Dawkins why are you one in three\nYou're still having a Super Bowl hangover when you'll end up being forty five to three or whatever was jets and the Broncos uh ... just yet she adds jammed Arnold yeah OK have fun with that one meat von Miller so list goes on and on now the cheeses you eggs\nI can give you that game that I Want to watch no Randall Cobb and banged up Aaron Rodgers against the lions I mean that's a that's me playing golf with you and me given you sick strokes aside\nAll right that's what that is to bring the lines back to reality so maybe that one's close just by virtue of injury but really you can't look\nAt least on the paper side and see the best game as the jaguars\nAnd the chiefs I I don't know what you're watching with the may be a slight typically capital the

chin against the Astros\nSo I I Know that early on in the series but still I mean they ran away with this division from the beginning you feel like this was a team that's been on the edge and just so close Alaska it gets to experience\nI was at that World Series and uh it was really exciting when Roger Davis hit that home run but it was this gets the real powerhouse Chicago team and uh I thought it was great so uh I think what the experience these guys have\nA the solid pitching staff they have like ... is there and uh I think anything's possible I think that they can go either way whoever uh you know pull through an October is the one that's going to make it happen yeah\nThey don't have as far as though the aces or are concerned I mean look Trevor Bauer came in he pitched in game one does that concern you being a fan\nNo not at all I think turning Frank cone as so much experience as a winter he knows how to push the buttons of those guys make them perform in October\nAnd I'm really excited about our possibilities or you know he's ... he's a legend in Cleveland he's pushed the small market team to this point and there's so much talent as long as the peak at the right time that's baseball seems such a momentum game if you pick an October you can win the whole thing\nEric hockey Cleveland sports historians with a series NBC Sports radio and its embassy sports rate\nA a talk to me about the Baker Mayfield so craves that's going on right now I mean look the browns or what they would they want to game they tie it again last the games well but the main thing is they ... every game and that's something we just haven't seen\nIt's great I mean Baker may feel just seeing his enthusiasm the leadership qualities you see\nI mean he's like you know a gunslinger you get that kind of Brett Farr ask you know not to the accomplishments but that energy level of enthusiasm it's infectious you see him running down the field with the other players\nIt's just as a fan it's just such an incredible sight to see it reinvigorated the fan base I Know our attendance I mean we are diehards like\nIn the middle of Hollywood everyone's like why aren't you a raiders ... seed hearts far I'm like I'm from Cleveland get I didn't I was born into this I Choose this I'm not a fair weather guy\nBut you know our fan base it on sixteen we're still dry thirty to forty people I mean you're not going to say that and then the other NFL a sports team or with a viewing sites and stuff they failed but a Baker Mayfield has just drawn so much enthusiasm it's just been really incredible\nAnd you need that as far as a quarterback is concern on John Eric hockey Cleveland sports historians with us but you heard him talk about a bar you moved out to LA and said let's open up a Cleveland bar the St Felix\nAh in Hollywood as well so it's it's kinda cool to that they have on somebody who really truly knows their Cleveland sports to me a beat the hell out of having a you know the writers on all the time as well too so\nUm you know when you talk about may feel that this was a quarterback that\nYou need some spunk and some passion because I don't remember Brian side are burning colds are\nHaving trouble saying did I mean did they do yeah they just didn't do they have the same thing may feel has inside of it was I mean I Know they were great quarterbacks especially goes on and stuff but but did they have that I mean what's the rover achievers year Bernie was lanky he wasn't the greatest athlete but yet tremendous hard I mean he gave his\nBody he wasn't the most beautiful Joe Montana ask throw he was a side I'm Guy Brian ... another smaller quarterback I think he's five ten five eleven Baker Mayfield has those size issues so that's all heart that stuff that's just not physical and I love that stuff Cleveland people love that they love the under dog it's a story about a\nLot of the culture and passion behind the fan base and I think it's great so Baker I Hope he achieved that status of those quarterbacks and takes it beyond that that would be an exciting playing for Cleveland especially after\nComing back in Ninety nine I just remember when uh art Modell took the team I didn't watch NFL for three years and I grew up watching as a little kid my dad took me into municipal stadium I remember how rowdy all those blue collar workers were in the snow throwing dog bones and batteries and beers and\nYou know that environment can be recreated was magical but I Will say that [noise]\nA Baker may feel has those same physical attributes that those guys didn't he has to overcome um and I know those are the biggest things you are on all the talking heads say on a national game\nWhat's the deal always small but you know if he's got heart is got accuracy which is huge and it's got a really nice arm I mean you're seeing that happen as long as he keeps his head on right and runs for amateurs and takes a leadership role instead of just kind of a hothead I think it'd be\nGreat yeah instead of just kind of a high and now that that's that's right I mean look physical sciences nice Drew Brees has done it a you know I'm a sea hawks guy Russell Wilson has done it and gotten over that hump and are in that respect as well and I think a lot of people like Baker made for this is certainly an exciting class\nOf quarterbacks to be able to watch this year with Mayfield\nWith Arnold uh possibly rose and you know maybe Josh Allen with\nWhat we've seen thus far John Eric hockey yeah Cleveland sports a story and joining us here as the Bush leagues with NBC Sports radio and its NBC Sports radio dot com I said earlier in the show that October is my favorite month of the year when it comes to sports yeah baseball winding up we talked about your your

it was clear the patriots were born\nTo win and it took a while to get there that was in the fourth quarter a couple of things about that play first of all I think Josh corps despite that ball into orbit right\nWind up and I'm not sure when it came down I think family in the background you see the little brown things fall back down but Josh Gordon the trust a Tom Brady had in him to throw the ball and anytime Tom Brady had that much time\nTo to find a receiver when he decides to throw it he's only throwing it to someone he trust to make the play\nAnd Josh Gordon had two calls right there Gordon went and got the ball and that's amazing when you consider they barely been together for two weeks in New England and it is a sign of what could be some very good things to come as Gordon becomes more familiar with the New England patriots off that's especially with Julian Edelman back\nRock still their Sony Michel stepping up he had a big night again last night for the patriots and the patriots role and this one\nWe spend a lot of time to pulling the matchup\nChristians and I and you know to the point where okay maybe that's a little bit too much maybe we're we're not respecting the colds here and when it was twenty four to three and a half it's like yeah we got it right the cult stink the patriots are good and the colds hamstrung by the fact that played Seventy minutes on Sunday with thirty four extra snaps they had to travel to New England to get ready on a short weak and\n... still working his way back to to the guy that he once was and this is just going to be a blowout and twenty four to three at the have it's like hey you know what I was right it's going to be a blow it and then the next thing you know twenty forty Seventeen\nAnd I got to get the colds credit even after the patriots pulled away in the fourth quarter\nThey kept coming they kept going and Andrew Luck a hundred and Twenty one passes from Sunday the Thursday\nThat he he looks fine to me now I didn't see a lot of ball's thrown deep down the field but he looks fine that there are a lot of drops last night by the Colts which would have made his numbers even better\nBut the Colts were in it the Colts have been in every game they play this year it's gotta be hard to stomach being one in four when you've been in every game and they could have won every game and that just shows you how\nHow easily a season can go badly for a team you you've got to play here a play their game here again there and the next thing you know you're a team that's on the outside looking in but the coasts have reason to be proud of themselves\nGoing one in four because they have been very competitive they haven't quit they kept going and Andrew Luck looks like he's the guy pretty much the guy he used to be again I I\nDon't know if he's all the way back and if you've ever will be all the way back to for one hundred percent but the guy that I saw last night is good enough and it's not on him that if you're watching on TV that that was the ... that was the real dagger because\nThe culture down fourteen again there was plenty of time for them to make a run they were driving down the field and a bomb went off the receivers hands up into the air it was picked off and on the next place ... goes for the touchdown but I got to give the colds a ton of credit for\nPlaying with with up not enough guys they had forty four guys dress they lost more guys to injury throughout the course of the night and they just kept going and they just kept coming and down twenty four to three and they weren't willing to just punch the clock and go home they made it a game they made it interesting and and even when it was\nWas thirty eight Seventeen they kept going to get one more touched down to make thirty it's twenty four stats the morning you have a question to morning Mike yeah you sort of glossed over that Andrew Luck than a hundred and Twenty one\nPasses in two games that is the second most of the ... games in NFL history\nWell and it's only five days apart I have a feeling whoever has more than that did not play Sunday and then Thursday and it's a deal they want to say ... what did he play Sunday and then Thursday I\nTo that question hundred and twenty three past attempts or in two thousand Fifteen and back to back wakes\nMe the reality of Thursday Night Football and something weird happened the past couple of years it's almost like the criticism of Thursday Night Football reached kind of a critical mass and twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen Richard Sherman called or the poop fest remember that we had fun with that played it over and over again and\nAnd then it all just kind of went away it's like you know if you\nIf you keep shouting it'll walls\nThat isn't going to fall down eventually you stop shouting at the wall I don't know how good of a metaphor that is or similarly as the case may be but at a certain point like if it's just not going to change\nYou can either accept it or you can continue to yell at the wall that's not going to fall down and that Thursday Night Football wall is there it's it's been renewed by\nThe NFL and now with Fox through twenty twenty two Thursday night football's part of the fabric of the national football league every time the time you are going to have some strange results like the coast playing thirty four extra staff member two years ago\nWhen the buccaneers had to play thirty two extra snaps in what would have been a maximum Fifteen minute overtime against the raiders and played on Thursday night NFL moved to shrink overtime from Fifteen to ten minutes and it was all part of propping up Thursday Night Football at a time when there was loud criticism of it and now\nThirty four extra snaps for the call to and I was shocked no one said do about it all week and to the colds credit they're not making excuses for it maybe they're hoping that others will notice you know kind of help us out here like we can't really come out and say this but maybe someone else could and say this is kind of you know ... that\nThat we got to play thirty four snaps and now we go on the road to play a patriots team that didn't have to travel from anywhere they had a home game Sunday and home game Thursday made it even harder for the calls the injured guys the overtime\nThe travel the patriots getting the edge of not having to travel from anywhere before the game on Thursday the compressed times everything\nAnd the cold still I respect what they did last night I was very very impressed by where the Colts are and I think they're moving in the right direction but if they had to I help and that's a different game I think they didn't have their top receiver but Andrew Luck still made it happen so kudos to the calls now let's flip it around and give the patriots some praise here Tom Brady gets his five hundred\nCareer touchdown pass he's now from touchdown passes to Seventy one different players in his career he got Seventy on Sunday Seventy one on Thursday thirty four forty four three hundred and forty one yard is three touchdowns two interceptions and\nYou know initially they said that the second interception was a fumble because growing had the ball he turned up field and out came the ball they scored it officially as an interception which is important\nFor Tom Brady because ... interceptions hurt your pastor rating\nAnd he got to be in the top five in past rating to earn a million dollars in would it be funny if we get the weak Seventeen and I think Tom Brady would use the word other than funny to describe it if he ends up six didn't pass\nOr rating and if that one less interception would have been the one that put him in the top five and ultimately that statistical decision not even in officiating decision statistical decision\nDishes Mario and reading you know me as a race car driver by most so he meals on wheels volunteer a race against the ... biggest personalities but I've never

I got a question at a little bit I don't want to I'm disappointed that this ever happened because I really liked Julian Edelman\nBut you don't want your or they may maybe that's why I joined back away from now backing attitude is if you get suspended for ... you are a cheater your presumed to be a cheater you've and now let's see what you can do when you don't have\nEdge over everyone else I was going there if you just let me impatient Jerry I thought you were trying to back it was just saying\nTo me but yeah yeah he he cheated and I don't like cheaters and that bothers me so uh I feel you there I got to see it to okay mine it goes to one of my man crushes of the weekend here I just can't wait to see this I mean I really cannot not alone the two units against each other\nBut tirade kill Jay Lynne Ramsay show me some that I Want to know one I I Want to pick what can I pick both I Want to know\nTirade killers and the conversation for the best receiver and the NFL jailing Ramsey I think is unique in some unanimously the best corner and football right now\nBut I guess I Would say if I had to pick one I'd go tirade kill show me something show me you can run by June Ramsey on a consistent basis and get open\nThroughout the game when there's some one on one match ups and things like this but either way both of them are going to have to show me something here because it's a special match up I mean jailing Ramsey has never recovered a guy is explosive as ... arguably the most explosive guy we've seen in football that's how fast the is\nIn jail and Ramsey is a special corner with length in great speed and change the direction skills that long guys like that don't happen so\nI'm just want to say show me something that match up which one rises to the top there are and I'm going to be I'm going to be tuned into this game I really can't wait\nI mean if you're watching it on TV look how fast this guy is holy crap it's on believable like my wife doesn't even watch football and she's seen ... take off a few times and she's like\nHoly cow he's really fast talk course diverts I mean that was amazing and I'm like yeah it's it's amazing he's like he's\nDealing way bow jak Wayne wait yeah your wife cause you Christopher everybody in my family calls me Christopher anybody that's close Christopher crafts that fact that not that so that if my mom and dad or from Brooklyn maybe that [laughter]\nBut they're but they're not but yes everybody in my family calls me Christopher\nYou're not allowed a well not close enough yet trust me I don't I don't I don't I ... I call you plenty of things other than Chris or Christopher so uh I'll keep calling you those primarily off the air All right that's not a bad one even though I think you violated the spirit of the rules by picking too because what if you would pick tire retail I could have picked John Ramsey\nSaid could have been getting any yang type of thing here's where I'm going and we mentioned is on the TV side Israelis to cars and went and what the Vikings may do Mike Zimmer you got to show me some extra time to get it for the eagles and you put a linebacker\nOn Robert was last week he put a linebacker on Cooper cup last week you put a linebacker ... Gurley last week and pass coverage and the bark is up three touchdowns Mike Zimmer come on man I Know where you are as a coach and\nI don't know what's going on this season but let's start with not putting on backers on receivers can we do that at least can you promised me that Anthony bar will not be covering out Sean Jeffrey can you promised me that landfall Joseph won't be covering Jordan Matthew is can we please not\nPut anyone other than defensive backs on receivers and I think if they do that and I think there'll be motivated to come out and prove something and I also think there's a certain poetry and symmetry to the idea that the Vikings get to go back to the place where they're twenty seventeenth season crashed and that may be the place where they kick start twenty Eighteen\nI I I was going to go there I'm really disappointed actually that you pick them because our ... Mike Zimmer because I now I should have picked him first I agree\nHis add extra days his his defense or like you said the other day the code has been cracked the matrix has been broken people have figured out how to expose this scheme a little bit and it hasn't been good and they'd better throw some new wrinkles and there are there that's going to be a long season\nI'm All right I'm going to go\nTo the battle down in Texas this week and I'm going to go to Jay Jay ... cloudy to show me something okay this is the events that I Do think is under under performed at this point okay they're twenty two info twenty second defense in football and now they got the cowboys and a team that I Do think is realize\nWe're gonna ride our own line and ...\nJay Jay what ...\nTell me what I truly we are truly think you guys are capable of two guys who could wreck a game plan run game pass game whatever it may be but if they show up and reach their potential that I think we all thought they could have before the season\nMan this Texans team they can turn this around I have faith that they're showing Watson will turn it around on the opposite side of the ball and uh I just think these two guys are game records and they're going to have to be game records in this game against the Dallas Cowboys because there is a special off the line\nAnd they don't have a ... the Texans problem is their past defense and I know the Dallas Tasoff says not great but\nIt's more about stopping the run in this game and they are going to have to create havoc the slowdown is ... not cowboys round game\nSo you've already you're already stepped away from your after the game up stat and called them game records you've adopted stats recommendation I prefer F the game up I Know that should be an official stat\nI don't trust my I don't I really should be a a specialist at I just don't trust myself that the actual rest of that word might come out with the U.S so I just wanted to wreck the game\nBut you know what I don't trust either so that's probably the right way to go All right third round [noise]\nI mean it's hard to argue with what you're saying and staying healthy would be enough enough of an accomplishment for more and cloudy and we need to get a lot more credit for everything he's been through physically yeah to be as dominant as he's always been we just expected even ever going to be that guy again right All right here's a guy who's coming back who wanted back in who got back in and now has a chance\n... that you have\n... and\nI Can't go\n\nTo well what did he not planned for

kayak\nIraq how about a factor\nGoing to find a neighborhood or green paint the capital in the U.S Forest Service\n[noise]\n\n\nA pro as it was her specialists let's get that right to tourists specialists ah here's what he wants to grow as a return specialist\nTwo years I made\nMy position as a corner\nOr what the court and\nI don't understand what channel ran but he is trying to prove they're in that comment about Terry kill the chiefs receiver and it's one thing for jailing Ramsey to have a candid quote that there's always rooted in\nSome basic objective assessment that people can say you know what he's got a point there you know Rob Gronkowski is less effective when he got corner covering him and you can take them away that way\nBut that that that's just nonsense ... what's the point there and I like John Ramsey I like the fact that he talks but that's just stupid to diminish a guy who is clearly among the very best receivers in the NFL right now a guy who is faster than anyone in the league a guy who gets it done on a consistent basis the guy who can get the ball in his hands and be gone\nTo diminishing returns specialist\nI don't understand your point and why would you do it what you're going to get him even more riled up unless the unless this guy's going through a calculation that this is the way to get to our retail off of his game\nThat you're going to somehow disruptive and distracting because he's going to be walking around thinking about being regarded as a return specials by jailing Randy I don't get it I don't get it I don't like it and I think it's going to get tired retail even more motivated to have\nA big day on Sunday that leads us into a segment the recall what's more likely stats ... what have you got to eat up for me I have a feeling the first one has something to do with John rammed entirely killed just a gut feeling McKay you you're right Mike\nFirst quite worried too I Know that information there you go what's more likely retiree killed drop the hundred plus on June ... and not jak secondary or do you think the jags told him under fifty yard you do these what's more likely to leave a gap that is that it's probably the most likely he'll be between Fifteen hundred why do you do that\nIt's got to be an either or you leave a gap there is\nNick because I'm you know you always wondered a hundred is a really good game and I wonder if these are really bad game so what do you think is more or less but he has a really good anymore really bad game\nI think what's more likely that you have the game between fifty one and I wonder if that's the way they point is there to choose between the two extreme I Choose fifty one to a hundred why should I compromise my principal that's what I Believe I Believe it will be renting one in the hundreds if I had\nTo choose between one or the other I Would say\nI Would say he's more likely to be under a hundred ... place because I I ... they've jailing rabbit he's obsessed with talking about and can stopping ... kill you just okay fine you can take Terry kill and we'll we'll use Travis calcium ... cream hunt and will overwhelm you that way so\nI think that the chiefs are more likely to play into that I I still don't think you completely shut down tirade kill\nBut I don't think they're going to force it when they know they're going to have an easier opportunities elsewhere and that's what the chiefs had been about this year they find the open receiver they get the ball to the open receiver\nAnd they moved the ball down the field and it doesn't matter if Tariq kill doesn't get more than a hundred yards receiving they're going to throw the ball to the open guy and you know what I'm most gentle around who's going to play ... coverage you may see one of those as well ... had a long return on Monday Night\nIt's always risky to use them when they made him a fulltime receiver remember as a rookie had that tremendous\nPerformance as a return specialist and they didn't used much on often\nLast year they used a moron off and they got 'em away from the return game this year and they are throwing him out into those situations where injury is a little more likely so I I think they like using him\nBecause of what he can do but you got to be you gotta be careful you got to be a little worried about ... getting themself injured then you take Terry killed her that she saw fence and uh that's a different off its altogether what else got stats let's go to Minnesota and Philadelphia Mike ... is more likely to Vikings the continues to get lit up like we've seen this season\nFor the eagles defense shuts down the Minnesota off and it's like we saw in that playoff game\nHigh tide take the middle the Vikings effect it doesn't get gassed and the eagles don't shut down the Minnesota off and so you're\nYou're you're leaving these gigantic third options that are the most likely of the of the choices like of course a new irritate me are you on the road is more likely that still point the point is to pick one of the extremes obviously the rotating likely\nSomething better to do they like move again [laughter] I Wish I was moving and can answer that question [laughter] I Would\nSay that ah it's more likely for the Vikings defense to continue to get gas because I think the Vikings off events\nI I think that that uh they they are they are in a great spot and the eagles defense quietly has diminished this year we've been so focused on that he goes off and Carson went and Nick falls and where is Jay Jay and wears out Sean Jeffrey I think it's more likely that\nThe Vikings defense\nWill get gashed then\nThe Vikings off ... will get shut down I think the Vikings off ... will be fine in this game and I like the Vikings win this game I think they exercise a little bit to exercise a little bit of their demons coming from the NFC championship game although I think they still would have preferred to have the victory over the eagles in that game I think they pull this one off\nA cause I think they they had the extra time to get ready and the eagles play deep into overtime and I think those are real factors when you're talking about putting too closely matched teams together on the same field at the same time [noise]\nPackers and the line and what's more likely Aaron Rodgers beats the lions on another Hail Mary for Detroit actually gets another hundred yard Russia you're doing this to me again aren't you the Nazi theme I Do I Do see\nThe theme and the theme is that this ...

what the hell I mean you put it in front of me stats whereas well comment on it [laughter] I like the Vikings getting three against the eagles I feel like this is a game where the Vikings are going to

thought hey we'll put Anthony barn Cooper cup\nDidn't work seven yards later was touched down for the rams and then later in the game when the game was still very much into balance Anthony bar on Robert Woods thirty one yard touchdown I think the extra time here's the key the extra time for the Vikings to prepare\nPlus the very strong incentive for Mike Zimmer to fix the defense plus the eagles played nearly Seventy eight minutes on Sunday and lost these teams play deep into overtime typically have not done well the following week the saints one in New York I think they're the only team\nThat played deep into overtime this year that that one the following week I think that's the case\nI'd have to look it up there in so many overtime games already I have to look it up so I like I like the Vikings plus three 'cause I like them to win straight up beyond that there really isn't anything that's jumping out at me how about Caroline and given the giants six and a half\nIt was seven this week what the giant bank [laughter]\nHi Caroline is good at home they're very good they've had to wait to get ready for the game and the giants stink\nThey just said hey let's get back to where we weren't segment one now it's a game next week it goes down it's no it's not and I don't know what I mean the issue with the judge has very fundamental they're good when they're often civic defensive lines are good they're bad when they're off at the defense of blondes are back\nAnd that's kind of where they are\nAnd there's all this you know the ... law manning in order to do back from junior says there's always drama around that tame unless they're winning games [noise]\nHow 'bout the rams minus seven in Seattle or I don't feel comfortable with that one either way 'cause I could see Seattle keeping a close I don't think Seattle wins but I can see I'm keeping a close would not surprised by that one scares me\nNew Orleans given Washington six and a half scares me Monday Night you know Washington is seven into all the time in the super do not that that should be relevant because teams changed so much from year to year but Washington to anyone\nThe same time at home have not been good this year the saints have been better on the road and they've been at home or used to beat the saints for a no brainer when at home team and at some point they became much better on the road I don't get it\n\nDo you get these stupid ads that suggest to someone who's dead what these like two years I got Troy Aikman gone at fifty one in ten minutes ago was Terry Bradshaw gone it's Seventy

real wealth weekly with Jim Antonio on the real wealth advisor network helping maximize your life through real well [noise]\nThis is the time of the year where people who are in individual health insurance are looking at their health plans determining if they're going to switch they might be getting forced to switch like in my case I had a company go out of business last December and January first I had to start a new plan\nAfter twenty seven years now I've been notified the new plan that I went to his getting out of the business so I'm gonna have to switch plans again as well\nWhat a lot of Americans are finding is there a lot more in tune with their health care than they were in the past\nOne of the things about the Affordable CARE Act\nIs it has a luxury tax if the benefits are too rich and if you don't have minimum benefits you get a tax for not complying with the law so\nA lot of folks that had real good plans are finding themselves with much higher to Dr ... and out of pocket expense and then the plans that are affordable for people people are looking at higher to dock doubles\nPeople that I'm Talking to are just kind of crossing their fingers hoping they don't have a health event because they're doing all they can to keep their health insurance up and if they have a claim and they get a five six seven thousand dollar to Dr ... they don't know where that money is coming from so joining me today is someone who might have an answer for all those folks Don\nHanson and Don I'm so glad that you joined us today 'cause I think it couldn't be more timely but you're here to talk about critical and is an accident insurance and the products that are available and they'd been available here in the United states I Know for quite a while\nBut they literally took the world by storm probably Twenty years ago here in the United states never really took off\nI think the reason for that is the United states had kind of unique health insurance plan where people didn't need to have this supplemental coverage or at least they didn't perceive a need than other parts of the world where they've been under a system that we're kind of headed to\nPeople saw reason to supplement what was being offered by the government programs so now we're starting to see critical and those kind of take off and I know Don you had\nA critical role in the development here because you've help some of the carriers develop their products and make sure that they had a product that would help fill some of the gaps that people are looking for protection on so with that\nI don't think I could have had a better gas to describe what's going on in that space so thanks for joining us\nWell I really appreciate being on Jim thank you appreciate the opportunity yeah there's [laughter] we're we're definitely in an interesting time and health care people\nAre frustrated and it's not just consumers that are frustrated\nDoctors are frustrated [laughter] so there's frustration on both sides you know providing the care and be limited in what they get paid and then of course there's people at our side that are having to pay for health care and losing our health insurance carriers are pulling out we\nWe hear these big name health insurance company is getting out of the AC a market and thinking what in the world is going to be the solution\nOr definitely an interesting time\nI've said for a while to health care system is broken\nAnd that doesn't necessarily mean a ca just ACT has broken\nBecoming more and more implemented\nThe critical notice an accent and insurance are things that might play a much more prominent role in Americans as they try to bridge the gap with the high deductibles that a lot of people are transitioning to so Don why don't you first start with\nExplained to the audience what is critical most insurance what is accident insurance\nGood questions critical illness insurance is basically assurance that will pay you a tax free lump some amount of money in tax free means basically if you have for premiums with post tax dollar premiums in other words you're not trying to duck to those premiums the benefit that is paid out as a tax free benefits\nSo similar to a life insurance policy that pager beneficiaries if you die that tax free lump sum\nCritical illness insurance is like that sort of tax free lump sum benefit but if you survive so it's truly a living benefit as opposed to a death benefit on a life insurance critical eldest insurance really pays a benefit and one of three different ways\nIt'll pay if somebody survives the diagnosis which surviving a diagnosis is more expensive than than\nYou know dying from the diagnosis it'll pay a benefit if you've survived a diagnosis they'll pay a benefit to your beneficiaries if the diagnosis is what killed you and then of course if you died from something other than it was what was covered\nIt will return one hundred percent of premiums to your beneficiary so one of those three ways that pays a benefit out\nI Know from the refunding the premium some policies that's an option and some policies it's not but you can get that option\nThat's correct and there are some states that don't allow return of premiums and certainly there are some states that don't even allow critical illness and ...\nIt's very rare that we run into a state that has an approved at least one type of policy but for the most part it is now more widely accepted by the department of insurance is a a really important coverage so we've seen department of insurance really want to approve which is a really good thing they've seen benefits up\nSo critical insurance like you said earlier you know it's been in the states\nNineteen Ninety seven was what it was introduced it\nReally hadn't quite taken off and in the individual marketplace meeting when an advisor sits down with his or her individual customer that the place where it really didn't take off very well\nBut where we've seen critical oldest insurance really begin to explode and sales is at the workplace so whether an employer is paying for the benefit or whether an employee e is able to pay for that benefit themselves to the workplace\nWe're really seeing a lot of options they're really good options for many different carriers and just really a significant difference in the sale of that product people are really embracing\nThe genesis the father of this insurance was Dr Mary in St Bernard he was a pioneer in heart transplants and heart surgery and he saw\nA lot of families that went through this you know you mentioned it earlier living was more expensive than dying from this stuff you look at cancer treatment all that and I know I've had some guest on in the past who had been a cancer survivor and he talked about all the cancer treatments and Canada they literally have to go three hundred miles to a center\nHe talked about with his wife\nI mean she literally had to quit her job to get him to all his doctors appointments and a lot of times get in the health cost reimbursed is one thing but the ancillary costs of someone taking off of work in a family member of providing care for you can be pretty expensive and sometimes people don't think about that until it happens to them\nThat's right so if you have a diagnosis of something like cancer boom you get a benefit you have something like a stroke\nYou get a benefit you have a heart attack you get a benefit and I'm like health insurance that will reimburse you as your bills come in or disability income insurance pays you so much a month as long as you can't work\nThis pays you the full benefits one big check\nLet's say you have a fifty thousand dollar policy\nAnd you get diagnosed for one of the things that pays a hundred percent out you just get a check for fifty grand you can use that however you want and the people that exactly right survive these things that's really been a life raft for them to get through these illnesses and be able to focus on recovery versus how am I going to pay the bills is that a good assessment of what's happening\nIt is and you know the one thing that's really important to add to that is with the amount of money you can get a minimum usually around five thousand and benefit that you can purchase all the way up the million sometimes a little bit higher that money being a tax free lump sum gets paid directly to the consumer and guess who's in control of it\nThe consumer is yes who's not in control of\nThe insurance carrier that's another thing that I really appreciate about this coverage is that it empowers that individual to make their own choices to think about it if somebody had another fifty two hundred thousand dollars with a major diagnosis\nWhat could that due to empower them to get care where they want to get care not where they have to get care because they can't afford anything more and that's a huge huge difference\nIn some parts of the world we see them coming to the United states for treatment\nThere are wealthy their leaders and I remember when the Affordable CARE Act was being debated\nIt just happened that the leader of Nova Scotia came here to the United states to have heart surgery so I look at it there has to be some good things with our system if we have leaders from other countries where they have national health care I'm an air it's not completely broken we do have some positive attributes but\nLet's say you've got something that's not covered\nOr they say you know what your age\nI don't think we're going to do that knee replacement or or whatever and I know new replacement I don't think is covered unless it's an accident does the accident policy but if you do get something where they don't want to treat your you can't go to the doctor you wanna go to 'cause they're not a network and you want to let's say go to mail in Arizona\nAnd they're telling you can only go to your local hospital and you check out the dark and he has a tenth of the surgeries that the top doctor does well you've got an option you've got some cash you can make that decision\nAnd it's a very important to say I mean it's a life changing decision to really I mean it's a life saving decision\nIf somebody has the opposite of going to a physician that has a ten percent Fifteen Percent twenty percent better survival ratio from them treating the diagnosis than somebody locally it's really a no brainer which physician you would rather go to what it always boils down to his affordability\nWhat this coverage it does very different than life insurance health insurance or disability is this a Forbes the ability to go get the best care you deem necessary and can afford\nYou talked about it started out as low as five thousand\nYou talked about it in the work place starting to really take off as an employee benefits that employers are starting to offer to help bridge the gap because again because of the luxury tax\nA lot of employers are not going to have those rich low deductible plans anymore because they get penalized for doing that so we're getting forced to having these higher deductible\nSo to maybe give the employees a little piece of mind or take a little worry off you could have a plan that's going to maybe help cover those deductibles if you have one of these major diseases that trigger a benefit is that how it's being position\nThat really is one of the best ways of position and get really\nHaving a higher deductible and then just like insurance companies spread the risk with us in a risk pool\nThat is looking at the insurance companies and saying you know I Want to increase mighty Dr below on the underlying health care plan and I can actually take the savings in premium that I Would have from a lower deductible to a higher deductible\nI can take a percentage of those savings\nAnd I can get a critical illness policy that will pay me five ten Fifteen twenty five thousand or however much money somebody would want to spend a premium on one of those policies but you could get a five or ten thousand are Fifteen thousand dollar critical illness policy the ... the co insurance and\nWe have to understand and like you said earlier there is a large portion of indirect medical expense that we just don't even anticipate outside of ... and co insurance spouses that take off of work and you know of course family medical leave act will let them do that\nBut the family medical leave act does not guarantee their income disability\nOnly pays a benefit for the person that's disabled if they are considered disabled so you know there's income ramifications from major diagnosis for a husband and wife partners and so the reality is critical illness insurance does a very effective job at helping to replace income as well\nSo that's that's something else to take into consideration as a complement to some of the other coverage is somebody might already have\nNow I'm an employer and I've done this myself and what I look at is probably the biggest issue that I get feedback from my employees on\nI hear him complaining about the premiums for their health care and I hear him complaining about every time they go to the doctor they got all this out of pocket expense as a small employer\nMost of the folks that work for me are women and they're married to husbands that worked for bigger companies that can offer health care so I Can't compete\nWith what's being offered at these bigger companies and if I were to offer health insurance I'd be paying for duplication of coverage is so I decided that let's look at benefits in another way and\nWhen we looked at the critical ... combined with accident and\nAccident insurance is really kind of a close cousin of critical and this and that it pays a lump sum upon\nHaving an injury or accident you have those same doctor bills whether it's health related or accident related so you can fill those gaps and I found what I did as an employer is I paid for a basic amount of coverage for all my employees and then what they were able to do is if they wanted their spouses covered I let them\nPick that up on their own or if they wanted to get additional coverage is they could do that so I'm like health insurance were for a lot of people it's kind of one size fits all I Know there are some things you can do with the doctor bills and everything but you can't necessarily have as much flexibility is you can hear where\nDr Dana also serves as a member of the American association of pharmaceutical scientist and she's also a member of the American association of nutritional consultants\nAnd she's created several health formulas now that are literally helping millions of people out there regain their health and

significantly better than a year ago when the office has maintained their momentum despite the fact that Baker Mayfield moved on to the NFL and I understand\nMay feel the mania\nAnd I'm sure the vast majority of you did not watch the game between the browns and the raiders a week ago in fact if you were watching on the red zone they turn off the coverage cars that game went on and on and on and

way\n[noise] I'll tell you why it's like as long as it wasn't the first off because I think we mentioned a little bit earlier on that so many changes to the bar for that so many changes to the system of play\nThese players Roberto ... they don't know whether that come and go in I mean for the first call I mean if you become familiar playing with similar players or in the same system so things like that first caller there was a massive space in Minnesota I'm not sure that happens if you're playing we came we count only for a few weeks\nWith his empires around you know that has to go to an ... and of course when results on well he will be expected to make changes\nBut I still think that there's so many change in the past what you saw before his today of course on top of that the pressure that the occasion brings a marine you thought about what\nHe said off it was that the you know the younger players and play general ... were affected by the the ... around the manager now is he making an excuse for for a manager this not grueling or groove and his play\nTo put up with almost always that's something that the place a struggling with the pressure on the manager\nOf the two sets of

to know down the the this was the lowest in terms of performance level but I have seen in the four five years that sort of focus is going to cost a big transition to the managers and they got criticized strongly demos on hall of course\nBut looking at that today against and you can see it on to the store for ... for many good parents as the rubble and without a victory to be that inept and disconnected in the first off I just I couldn't believe it and\nI think we've gone over a few reasons for why that was\nBut it made a big change in non humans to buy off to oversee the I'm a bit of a tough time for one much on slightly change the system maybe go a little bit more forward momentum from a ... and ended up to take it into the second Hoff\n[laughter] let's talk about that I got to to to ... when he was back to when ... ... he's planning defensive position they saw it to to to find these Wayne ... field and I still thought saw to influence the game a lot better\nBut again you need ... to come up with a free kick on sentiments than I think was the most important goal of all the gold because I think he gave him a chance with twenty minutes on the clock I think you've got to know that by the time and he's like you know should we not get it done\nTo the to the old school line against with the second off an ultra for it and\nI think that takes away the risk element of the game or in other words there's nothing to lose would soon it'll down regard half ago and I've said a thousand times a month just you know I said I wrote that best and the judge I mean you know when they play a with desperation like while we spent all that's going to\nTake care of the desperation in your motion and desperation it is you you don't train you don't even do ration right so that's what I
