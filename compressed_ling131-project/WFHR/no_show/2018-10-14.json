good right now I was all excited for the weekend with a bunch of high school stuff last night and then I think the bucks ended up winning and like a great start to the weekend and not so good I think for me to when I watched\nThis is that and as I said even when we started watching the game together tonight I you know all week long if you ask me I didn't think Wisconsin was going to win the football game I mean Michigan is a good football team yeah I mean some some losses early knock them around but you know those defenses we found out tonight I'm is really really good\nBut early on I mean they give up to touch down some of nothing but Wisconsin comes back and you say you know what we're in the fight and that defense is playing their tail operate but yet there's often tonight I'm again against us down defense blind\nEspecially in the road you know you've got to make places certain times and whatever was going to look like a look he talked about her to match talks about or even coach Chris talked to other tonight when you look like an office you were going to take a step forward something bad would happen whether it be a drop paths to Italy or something like\nThat yeah the nose run game never really got on track I think Korea ended up with over a hundred yards but\nYou never had that feeling of like All right here we go for it other than\nYou I guess you get that the jet stream touchdown and in that ran pretty well tonight which we haven't seen a whole lot of that this year but effective for the most part tonight but\nReally when you look at it ... performance with what we expect from his office right of a veteran off until my coming back a quarter back to his junior year you have a Heisman Trophy candidate at the beginning of the year and in Taylor and\nSome receivers that really grow up a ton last year I made some great difficulty catches that have been dropping the football and when you have those type of performances\nYou shouldn't went right there in Michigan I think capitalized on some of those things certainly interceptions pressure on the quarterback I'm at a defense but they kept coming out of them are in an office that\nSet off that set off the crowd and and they did some different things that got us outside and and tilted a little bit words basically three onto and we lost that battle even we returned guy didn't contain pursuit wasn't there and I think some of the steps to from here on the field so much you get worn down and you don't run enough off into place to keep the defense of off the field\nThey get tired of it as good a condition is they are you you take a pounding after a while and pretty soon your body just gives out on you\nDo for a number to join us today badger nation want to hear from your thoughts on

good for the general and when we got to clean up in terms of the defense of mine I mean just a little techniques we feel very fresh and if you're a\nQuarterback um makes it a little bit more difficult because he's ... he's a little tougher to get after him\nI mean he's a he's a great quarterback overall he's a he's a good versus the bass man and he's around meals for in a way I think for some kind of just how keeping him being aware and where he is just kind of hard and I was from\nMichigan and they're all very one no one wants to come back on the bigger\nPicture question here as a leader on

with Jennifer Fitzgerald is a little bit about yourself you have this very cool Web site that\nIs in the insurance business how did you come to this place\nYeah not everybody wakes up in the morning and says I'm going to start a company in the insurance industry\nI Can't wait this sounds awesome I mean are going to do like I'm going to create tender or policy genius\nKnows if it was a coin toss uh-huh um before starting the company I worked in financial services and I did a lot of consulting work for the big insurance companies at McKinsey\nAnd you know the light bulb moment for me and my co founder who was also McKinsey with me was getting hired to do the same project again and again with these insurance companies so they kept asking us\nHow do we engage younger consumers what do we do about the fact that our um insurance agents sales force is aging the average age of an insurance agent in the U.S is fifty nine years old\nAnd most people certainly most people under the age of like forty five\nI've never had an agent are interested in an insurance agent but he's still have a need for a life insurance and disability insurance and the products that these agents sell so you know the fact that the main distribution channels still the brick and mortar agent was just you know pretty indicative of a of a larger issue that we felt like we could solve\nAnd when you say you know the light bulb moment how do we engage younger consumers is it hard to talk to and tablets industry like\nInsurance and basically smack him around and say well here's what you're doing wrong I mean other words I Know people who worked in as consultants to a lot of these places and they present these gorgeous\nRecommendations never did he implemented so what is the problem is they scared that they're going to ... their own business and that's it the reluctance there\nI think that's part of it so some of the insurance companies that have big\nCaptive a agents forces writer certainly concerned about channel conflict and not wanting to upset their agents by going directly to consumers so that's one concern\nI think the second barrier to change is you know a lot of these insurance companies are public companies right and they're held the quarterly earnings and there's not a big built an incentive to take a big risk and make\nYou know a a new strategic direction you just basically want to

to buy insurance on line now\nIn this segment I'm going to ask Jennifer what's the deal with policy genius offering whole life insurance many of you know that we are not huge fans so here's more of our interview with Jennifer Fitzgerald so why whole life\nSo whole life a was a recent addition um and you know if you read the content on our site talk to our team and we will you know be very upfront safe for most people who need life insurance term life is the way to go right\nUm however we do get 'em on tourist site and into our ah channels high net worth clients who do have an estate planning need so um we were just as surprised as the next person that you know these folks were coming through\nWho you know had legitimate estate planning needs and wanted whole life ah we're financially savvy and knew the difference\nNew ah the fees that were involved in a whole life policy so again we don't do a lot but it's there and we have a really good CSP teams who knows how to um\nYou know handle a the affairs of these larger hiring at worth clients show how many people in your CSP team so we've got 'em on our C. F. P. disability advanced planning team about six people\nThat's great I'll just say the permanent insurance has a use case it's just very small number of pizza area where okay so you deal with only certain companies mhm and you obviously has some financial arrangements with these so how does that\nWork so we are a licensed broker and all fifty states in DC and that means we get the company gets paid a commission on the insurance policies we sell\nOn the commission's pretty comparable across all of our companies um we don't favor one company over another and our site actually forces that transparency 'cause you can see what the rates are afraid so assuming you put an accurate information about your health profile you'll see right there and you choose which company you want to go with what\nI find interesting about that is that you have access to some policies that are normally ... only sold through their captive agents like in northwestern mutual has that changed in the digital age\nYou see so some are still a strictly filter captive agent so State Farm on the auto insurance side Newark lifestyle will still only work through their captive agents but um what we've seen is you know a lot are relaxing and they have independent and kept of channels and ... um which again it's just better for the for the consumer\nYou added on auto insurance\nAnd you added on health mhm so let's talk a little bit more me 'cause those are two huge categories which I probably the vast majority of people need to OK a hundred and fifty five six million people get their health insurance through their employers\nHow many people are buying health insurance privately through places like policy genius so\nThe the last estimates I saw it's not a lot in terms of population wise maybe like you know ten to Fifteen million I'm Better than non Medicaid non Medicare individual and family shoppers um but it's increasing rate you know fewer people are I'm staying at jobs for a long time you've got\nThe rise of the gig economy the self employed worker the freelancers so uh it's small but growing and for those people who leave that you know W. to job and strike off on their own for the first time this is a very intimidating and complicating things to tackle\nHow does this work based on the exchange and how do you have is that incorporate or not incorporate\nHere it's a great question so we um so sites like ours um that offer a private health insurance um you typically plug into the exchange so every plan that's available on your state exchange in your ZIP Code we've got we also have\nA because health insurance can't be simple off exchange plans so these are plants that still has to comply with the Affordable CARE Act but\nUm because they're sold quote unquote off the exchange there's a little bit more flexibility in terms of pricing and and plan designed so we've got on and off exchange plans um there's no\nPolitical price savings by buying anywhere else I like any insurance you know it's it's regulated or the insurance plans are ... and re tables are filed with the state regulators so you know you buy a signal plan from us or your state exchange it's the same price\nSo it's good to ... no one has to worry if you're like oh my God I'm Affordable Care act I can still go to a policy at the exact same thing probably more easily I bet your motivation is much\nMuch much more easily and that is you know what we pride ourselves on is creating a really good experience for the again the d._a. shopper ah for health insurance particular there's no\nI think the thing that's really confusing about health insurance is people think that you know there's a right answer for them or this magical plan that's going to have no deductible and it's going to be cheap it's not health insurance is a series of trade off right there is no\nBullet answer right do you want lower to dock doubles or do you want a higher premium right do you want a big doctor network or do you want a lower premium right so we walk you know the consumers lock themselves through those you know a handful of decisions that they have to decide um and that narrow down\nThe the plants to choose from on the auto insurance side and I love the of ride share insurance brilliant rental car insurance which is usually the worst deal in the world when you're at the checkout counter right yeah you usually your credit card covered that under your more products I'm interested but us\nUm identity theft insurance and tell me about that so I'm\nBe their plans where you pay you know anywhere from eight dollars to upwards of twenty dollars a month that I have a um risk monitoring on all the credit bureaus for you\nUm that help you um you know if your identity is a stolen helps you recoup some of the cost of you know fight that in court or rebuild that so um it's an increasingly you know a popular product you know\nHaving all day and reaches you are that are happening out there but it's funny because like homeowners is under the other so is this mean I think a homeowner's insurance is so weird because you can go out and and say okay I Want coverage and you can get a humongous range\nThat's interesting we actually just started a piloting our auto in home insurance coverage so we don't have a live marketplace on the site for auto home like we do for life or health or pet\nAnd what we're piloting right now I'm getting great feedback on his more concierge service so we've got an auto in home team do I have the right level of coverage um should I also have on bravo on top of my homeowner's insurance\nBy the way I'm a huge fan of the umbrella yeah so cheap and easy hundred dollars a year and you know a new million dollars of coverage it out on the fabulous so\nWhat we've been doing is you know you fill out a form on line or team will prepare and do the analysis for you right so do you have the right amount of coverage and then the recommendations are can we get you more coverage for the same price um or you know the same coverage for a lower price right which is at the end of the day what you want as a homeowner\nDo you win in that concierge service when we have rich people who call in and I'm like you're insured you know I they'll say well where do I do and so like off line all the well a Chubb is kind of like ... big standard bearer do you deal with the high end the guy we do gals yeah we\nDo show Chubb as you mentioned the id ah they're typically further to those are the right ones travelers a little bit for the wealthier a segment

we are getting through Chris writes a that his question is in regards to assets and disability or I have epilepsy and have Medicare coverage to help pay for my medication along with a small five hundred dollar check I get Medicare Medicaid\n[noise]\nI don't know about that [noise] uh I heard a short conversation on the radio about how inheriting assets or any money will discontinue my insurance cover it\nI Want to figure out the best way to inform my grandparents as to how to leave the should leave what they've decided not to interact with my disability yeah so I think you have ss DUI Social Security disability insurance the best way that they can figure out how to leave you money and not actually\nImpact your disability benefits is to see in a state attorney a qualified state attorney and that attorney would likely create something that is called a special needs trust\nThat's what I Would guess so give that a shot\nAnd um if you need any more help with happy to chime in okay uh Roberta rights that her husband will be inheriting a third of his mother's a state she passed away recently part of it is in IRAs we need to make the best financial decisions\nThey stayed in a trust meaning I guess that well let's see what property is and the trust property liquid assets and the IRAs ... [noise]\nIf the Iraqis are in a trust that could be weird I'm not sure that that you should double check that\nBecause most often ah people will not put IRAs inside trust so if you inherit an IRA\nAnd generally speaking you have to take your distributions during your lifetime or within five years after the original account holder passed away\nAnd you could usually you can roll it into your own IRA I Know that spouses can I don't believe that I'm a child can [noise] um but what you probably should do is talk to the attorney\nUm because ... you know you may want to be clear that if you have certain assets inside of a an IRA and it's left to the trust\nCan the trust then distribute those assets\nInto an inherited IRA I don't know the answer to that\nBut I Do know that um anything money you pull out of that you would have to pay tax on so I'm Sorry I'm a little vague on that one Roberta but I I Need a little more information [noise] okay [noise]\nUm [noise] let's see here is somebody call Mindy who says over the past Twenty years I've contributed a modest portion of my pre tax dollars to a tax deferred executive compensation program which my employer sponsors\nThe plans fund is

into in the big tendency Boston Michigan\nState and both of those games\nThey would've should've could've won is Penn State led at halftime against Michigan State only to get out scores fourteen to three\nIn that second half and that's\nNot really custom like of of what we see from uh a coach James Franklin team but we had that you had some troubles in the top ten altogether as you had number two in Georgia just get humbled\nBy Thirteen drank pillows you balance you I was thinking about putting some money on this game but I was like man LSU is a much better team on Saturday Night game night games down there in the bayou and a swamp forget about it I mean unless you could beat anybody anytime anywhere\nCame was three thirty in the afternoon though I just I don't know if I'm George\nIs going to show me something more that's why it's so hard to make a living it is right and then bet on football the time and it really makes you I think a stand in awe and amazement of what we see out of the boys in Vegas I'm not good\n\nEight five five three two three four NBC's not just a Georgia lost his game last by three touchdowns I didn't score and the first half\nYeah\nJake from I barely cracked two hundred yards which let's face it for college football two hundred yards is nothing\nDay in and really it was I'm Justin Jefferson was a huge game receiving wise for al issue a great game or out of the backfield as well as we're looking to pick up where Leonard for nets\nLeft off I mean my God a hundred and forty five yards are on the ground for one of the bulk carriers for el issue so you know they took it to the right to Georgia and\nLSU tough loss that they're coming off a prior to that doesn't look now they of wins with Auburn under their belt Miami under the vote in Georgia\nUnder their belt\nSo there's certainly team's gonna move up into the top ten because number to Georgia loses\nAre you also have losses with number six West Virginia number eight Penn State so a few teams go down in the top ten\nTens ranked central Florida survives against Memphis you'll also survived as well the Notre Dame of fighting Irish or in a play great some weeks and other weeks since it's like they're really plane down to their\nLevel of of competition I mean you know no disrespect to the pit panther fans but yeah maybe it is a little distracted\nProud of our guys they're grit in there [noise] um and found a way to with college football it's hard to win each and every week [noise] um\n[noise] and ah they're going to have some of these games and they found a way to win so pretty excited about it\nThat's coach Brian Kelly of Notre Dame in book\nTwo hundred and sixty four yards couple of touchdowns in this way and there's a Notre Dame is actually losing his game at halftime and virtually exchange blows with Pittsburgh Notre Dame still survives and oh by virtue of during so Notre Dame improves now to\nSeven and all on the season and five at all at home and and if you ask yourself or are they really\nA top ten team I mean the record shows are undefeated who they beat and\nThey got Michigan in week one way Michigan is playing right now we'll get to them a little bit I don't know I Would I Would bet Michigan regardless of where this game is over and over to him I just been more impressed with them and they play in the Big Ten weekend and week out they also took him to Stanford though\nAnd beat them handily beat my Twenty one point so I was like wow okay that's impressive until we see Stanford get worked in rolled in the subsequent game as well there were like oh okay I mean just how good is the pack twelve I mean honestly in on a national stage forget about it\nNobody deserves to from that conference make it into the packed off on a ... I don't care who finishes with one loss no\nI'd I'd much rather be happier seeing another SEC team in there and may not be popular to here that if you're out there on the left goes keep in mind that I Am a pack twelve guy grew up going to Washington husky games uh Seattle native I've probably seen more packed twelve football person than you've seen on TV\nBut I can call my conference out for what it is soft and finesse like and I don't like that I like the Big Ten I like what I see out of them I like smash mouth ground and pound running down your throat football where the games and Twenty one Seventeen\nFourteen Seventeen or the defense actually finds ways to get points of their own\nMaybe the mail I got\nAn ally coughing my jobs have been not only ... the nail on the coughing you dug a

a couple of weeks ago Tsongas traveled thirty five seven in Seattle huskies\nAnd then they follow that up with a loss to Utah State\nConsolidation or even one rehabilitation\nSeventy seven percent

confront that's not an issue but I think the way you confront that is important but if you do confront don't be do\nShow the the big thing is to lift people up you know other people but\nYou know make people better that is a Tom tip into tips coach of the Minnesota timber wolves former coach of the bowls\nWho has found themselves in just an absolute mess I mean oh my God is there a bunch of drama going on right now in Minnesota of all places and there's more talk going on with the timber wolves who haven't even be gone the season\nThen there is the Vikings were predicted by may need to go back to the Superbowl I mean it's crazy this stems from Jimmy Butler who played under teams in Chicago brought him over to Minnesota\nApparently doesn't play well with others\nK at first it was allegedly then apparently it's been confirmed in truth you not heard or have you been living under the NBA rockets okay will shed some light on it for you the best way to say is Jimmy Butler wasn't the best of teammates because he was okay it up with Carl Anthony towns girl\nNo you don't say look he's a ball or he's the guy he's a big\nLots of women in this world you're an NBA player I can pretty much you

twenty four hours later\nI remember there was a a very a famous college baseball coach when I worked at Cal State Fullerton ironically was Justin Turner's coach and I called their games those names George short and he's now up at a college that I'm not going to name because I Can't stand the university okay but Georgia's a great guy\nAnd he had said that when he was coming up through the coaching ranks he had like a Fifteen to fourteen game on a friday\nTold his wife God I'll never go through another one of those again the next day was like sixteen to Fifteen you know and after that

favorite you know what that sounds about right I like Cleveland in Cleveland could have a couple more jobs and they do\nI concluded on as well like I just never know what I'm getting with shark bite the chargers head games where they play like a Super Bowl the chargers also have things that you wonder how in God's green earth turned out to and fourteen every year we carnival over in the city the me dumb decisions on the sidelines\nLike I don't believe in the browns because I don't believe your taxes\nBut I Believe that the browns are a lot better I Believe that Baker Mayfield severe really requiring asleep and I think that the census legitimate\nOr if the game was in Los Angeles I Would take LA but it's not it's in Cleveland matter ... bill mostly across the country they play in an earlier window game I Do believe in that kind of stuff like that ... uh\nI wouldn't be shocked parts of on the only ones go off as they have this year the chiefs around\nBut I don't trust the chargers

if it happens all the time I\nSaw it on my feet it's just not that good and the chargers walk all talented and not always been consistent\n... sided dot coms with us on NBC Sports radio right let's venture across the pond where it should be raining which I like it could favor my see are taking on the raiders I mean two teams that are a combined three and seven\nUh right now and I said is the

a couple of scores I I was very impressed by salary that's wraps either they lost at the end of the day it looks as an orange shirt got away does matter but they\nThey played very well in that game and I expect Seattle I I like cows approach you get there early getting acclimated meanwhile the raiders or basic flying and they play the game I think that really that it's a sea hawks\nI think they know what you're doing groom has shown no go there you know he's going to hear and ultimately\nI felt better like Wal Mart or carts point they can run the ball on the Seahawks defensive ... an hour or near my God it better or the raiders of the field I think Seattle is going to win the raiders paid a hundred million dollars\nFor a guy that they don't have turned the franchise round and\nHey it's early or even see for early returns have been very very on the\nOther games that I'm kinda torn either way to go on and you want to believe in the bears a dream one I don't know and I want to think

A. chargers that sounds weird even still always will are going to\nTake on the Cleveland Browns and I'm the only way to home field advantage supposed to be worth three points right what they say well the browns ISIS the chargers actually a really only favored by one for that tell you who you like [noise]\nI don't I like I'm like the charges but I still don't like them traveling back east so but I like the chargers anyway to charter to not changing their mind and that was right\nAnd uh now I'm going to go with Cleveland I'm going to go Cleveland of for the mild upset here a Chicago going to travel to Miami\nDown Miami has had some trouble with a uh a couple of their players as far as productivity goes getting Drake is a struggle a little bit although you had a better week last week and he said a previously any stills had like a really good a\nWeek in week one and as you had to do really a whole lot since then Chicago and the other hand coming up by who do you like a thick of it all up and to this you're going to take the dog would look at you crazy man you are I'm [laughter] I'm going to take the Chicago Bears the we can't get the running game going and establish the run\nPart a next is going to be Carolina Panthers at the Washington Redskins Chris Thompson apparently is not going to play in this game Adrian Peterson thing that got a shoulder problem I think maybe an ankle or\nSomething else getting out of the problem is well uh but uh [noise] what do you think about the Carolina Washington basically a pick them inside the beltway and deep seated\nAt that point of the games I change so I'm picking the Panthers now I'll look at you see I have convinced you out on the U.S I don't think I convinced you\nAre okay up next the Indianapolis Colts at the New York jets you know I I Love the fact that Andrew Luck is such a gamer he's so happy to be back and just throw in like crazy I mean I I can think of a lot of quarterbacks would do a lot worse for you as a fantasy quarterback but just as far as winning the game goes\nA Andrew Luck in the polls at the giants jets or ... I had the ... at the jet jets her favorite who you like\nYou know that's another pick them I think I'm Still do with the home team and this one jets actually home team getting two and a half\nOn what I'm looking at here so they're favored a little bit and probably because they're at home as a three point thing again yeah I'm going to take a Indianapolis that's what I like Andrew Luck and his enthusiasm we'd be a little bit better and carry them passages sorry\nPittsburgh and Cincinnati what are they told us of the week fifty one point a van always played better at home everybody likes to make a big deal but he's not as good on the road is he is at home but he in Cincinnati I should say the and the bangles as well as\nAh they will read rifle over there those guys always seemed to shine when they play each other\nOn the point spreads only a couple of points in Cincinnati who do you like\nFor bed is from ... Ohio and he does really well in Ohio so I'm sticking with the students are going to go with your squad is an okay good for you I'm gonna go Pittsburgh or in that one as well but maybe a lot of points to be scored let's just hope so\nUh Tampa in Atlanta the biggest point total of the week speaking of the the big total fifty seven points in this one uh Atlanta been airing it out so apparently the defense is not stopping anybody all of the Kansas City chiefs\nTampa Bay Seamus Winston is a huge huge pick by a lot of guys that are fantasy gurus holding up here cause your fantasy\nWinston things that he's a big play this week and what it's supposed to be obviously they shoot out of the total is fifty seven point what do you like\nTo just the fact that I said you a nasty view about the talk of the rich to go I ah I somebody's got to give it the team make they gotta win one and this has got to be this I don't own their own home\nThere don't you know what I'm going to take it Lana too because you know what they've been they've been moving the ball they need to get a victory there at home or and I guess I'm not buying the Seamus Winston hype and this one\nAll right let's go to the London games during Wimbledon Stadium for the raiders and the sea hawks boy we're trying to encourage them to watch NFL football I don't know why within those two teams over there but I guess just your term when it's your turn it's your turn\nUp but who do you like in these sloppy London ball go the raiders and go with the raiders huh yes I'm going to have to go with Russell Wilson is put on a slightly better performance\nA than a than car will for the raiders and that was all think Seattle\nPub buffalo is going to take on a Houston in Houston Houston is walking wounded a lot of guys that are deemed up but not it's not necessarily out [noise] um so ... you know they're still going to play but maybe not be a hundred percent\nUh buffalo look at their the dumpster fire shady ... can get off and he can get some yards down and getting the ends only got a chance if not know what do you like yeah the taxes on this one Texans to point spread is gigantic that's what the Vegas feels about it\nAll right let's get rocking here with the Denver and the rams the rams take that on beating show does a mile high city there you don't want to run the ball and the ... gonna be a lot of Philip Lindsey today what do you like the rams\nI think the rams to and know that there's just a high scoring a fair that the thing that does is going to be fifty one\nUh so I like to go over that Jacksonville at Dallas Dallas the dumpster fire Jackson is all about defense who do you like jaguars yeah me too\nTennessee is going to host Baltimore\nThe total is forty one and this one of a tendency it's just been a real Jekyll and Hyde deemed up people heard who's play and who's not I don't know very confused seem I think Baltimore when's the last one who do you like yeah I think of the ravens unit take the ravens is well well here's one of the most talked about games of the week and uh we can talk about this for a second\nUh Kansas City at New England the total fifty nine I guess that's the big one fifty nine and a half of what they're saying the total is yeah that's oh anytime they say it's over fifty that's a big number this is almost sixty [noise]\nUh and pat homes and company look they ran into the jaguars last week and still were able to not only get the victory but still put up some deep the numbers that mom didn't have the passing numbers\nAre as normal he's doing over I think it was three hundred Thirteen yard but you know Tom Brady at home you know this guy's gonna air it out of Kansas City not stopping a lot of people here so we all expect a lot of points to be scored in this game but who do you think is eventual Victor\nGot to go home I got to go with the hope to you know she'd say homes yeah homes what's your back home the home team is what I can hear I I think morale here in LA where people don't go homes what's your pick well I think ...\nI think he's been I I think ... figure them out I think they're going to when he said that let me think that the uh five games in already you know he didn't show I mean yeah you might not a lot of yards passing last week but they didn't put up a lot of points last week you know the number one ... do but don't touch downs

some research shows that many you as teenagers or skipping books another print publications in favor of social media will train continue with the story here's a protracted genius to disco Gina\nThanks Chris a new study raises concerns about what digital media is doing to teenagers ability to focus for long periods of time and read along the articles skills they're going to need in college to understand complex issues\nThe study quantify teenagers use of digital media showing their consuming much less traditional media like books newspapers and TV [laughter]\nJoining us now is the study's lead author Jean twenty author of the book I engine and professor of psychology at San Diego State University professor before we dive into the nuts and bolts of the study first tell us what aspects of digital media might leave a teenager struggling to read those college books\nWell social media for example usually just has short bits of text\nSame thing with when you text the friend it's usually not going to be a few paragraphs and overall when teen spent a lot of time on digital media they tend to\nSwitch tasks really quickly they'll do one thing and then a few seconds later do something else the other aspect is they spend so much time on digital media six to eight hours a day during leisure time it doesn't leave a lot of time left over for things like reading books\nAnd it's not just the short messages but the computer screens blast them with too many choices for their attention\nWell that's one possibility and we need more research to explore that but certainly if you spent most of your leisure time switching between tasks every few seconds it's going to be very difficult\nTo sit down and read a book for more than a few minutes at a time\nAnd as I understand it from your study the concern is not just will kids learn the material in college but can they actually go ahead and think through what the material means and how to apply it is that part of it\nIt is because the Internet gives us access\nTo so much information and it's great for that\nBut it tends not to be asked conducive to reading long foreign tax so long magazine article or a book you can read that on line but that\nIsn't what teams seem to be doing their spending a lot more of their time reading these shorter snippets of text and those are just not as good for developing critical thinking skills and\nReally understanding complex issues\nAnd even though people download entire books as you were suggesting on electronic readers I understand you made a startling discovery that knew that reading itself has actually declined in the next generation\nWe found was there's been a really large decline and the percentage of chains you say they read books magazines and newspapers almost every day back in Nineteen Seventy six sixty percent and by twenty six day and it was only sixteen percent\nThere's also ban of big up tech and a number of teens who say that they don't read books for pleasure at all that used to be only around ten percent in the Nineteen seventies and then by twenty six day and it was one out of three\nSo in terms of the overall media used than anywhere hinting at this before let's take the twelfth graders are they the ones spending about six hours a day on digital media\nYes the twelfth grader spend about six hours a day and just three digital media activities general time on line which includes gaming texting and social media it doesn't include things like watching videos on line so the actual numbers probably higher than six hours a day\nHow does that compare with tents and eighth graders\nTenth graders was about five hours a day and eighth graders about four so it tends to grow as they get older\nWe're visiting with gene ... author of the book I jammed and a professor of psychology at San Diego State University on a new study about teenagers use of digital media professor isn't this trend toward teenagers using more digital media rather than traditional media affecting their intelligence\nWell most studies suggest that IQ has actually increased over time\nThat each successive generation actually gets a little bit smarter but there's a big difference between IQ and things like reading ability and then also the ability to think critically and also to understand complex issues and also to have the attention span necessary\nTo read the long form tax that will help develop this critical thinking and complex thinking skills\nSo they may have the intelligence but is it possible that they're reading activity or lack thereof is inhibiting their ability to use or leverage that intelligence\nIt certainly could be and you know what's so interesting to me is that reading books is actually easier now than it was before the Internet it's really easy to order books on line and it's also easy to\nOn a tablet or on you know an e reader so you can buy a book and read it instantly\nAnd that counts as reading and those questions that were asked to teenagers because when they're asked if they read books and magazines and newspapers it doesn't specify format it could be a lot of digital device yet reading is still declined\nDrew hockey right here on your twenty four hour information station am Thirteen twenty W.

talking about ways to improve your memory in a chaotic world and we had an amazing gas coming up later Dr ken Kern and wait until I read people his like why do you believe that I never\nEver found someone who is such\nA tedious person but he's going to help us with memory and he's got to be good at if he has that many degrees after his name but Dr game and out today the I myself in Dr Anderson here let's talk a little bit about ah what we know about memory\nOkay\nYou can't remember which you know about memory\nI mean uh you know I'm kind of going back to basic sciences than we were taught how memory in print and you know psychology one on one and\nI always took the way I think about it is I've got you know so much of a hard drive [noise]\nPutting computer terms and it's only got so much memory left in it so if I'm going to remember something new that some point I'm going to have to delete something out other filed a Mac room on the memory unfortunately is I've matured there are points on that memory chip that have been corrupted and no longer able to imprint\nA you know and then I talk about that long term memory short term memory is kind of like rapid access memory ram around and ... you know how much is there that you can pull up it's a pretty recent so I'm interested to learn about memory is not something I've really delve into\nYou know there's I heard this term and I love this term mental bandwidth and how we're getting becoming so prone to try and and just like you said it's just so much stuff in there there is only so much bandwidth until you can't take any more and maybe part is the reason that people have trouble remembering things\nIs grown think about it on our cell phones we don't you have to remember the numbers right we use the memory and everybody thought they were all these digits all these things memorize and and now you just have to look it up and and hit a name if you want to remember facts like it didn't do it\nSo we all know crippled our style crutches or yeah so we're not using every day I Would\nArgue I mean I agree with you I Do agree with you in a large degree I could argue also argues that you relieved yourself of having to remember the minutia that allows the brain tend to explore other areas\nAnd maybe have a broader with Anna Marie right now\nI don't have to take up that data space with phone numbers I can use it to remember the other thing that the scientists the physiology and says you know memories are made by hormonal and printing and now that physiologic changes that take place so just reading something is not going to\nTrigger that memory respond okay only a little fear like I'm studying for that they test the final tests reporters all adrenaline going you know and then you're going to make you remember better I'd checkup caffeine little fear of toys good for not always\n[laughter] than than out much right okay so I'm going to ask you are you a are you more likely to remember something you read something we heard or something you saw\nMine is visual I'm so patient they were talking about it that uh\nI'm going to class and they actually she does better if she she's older she's a you know she's not as a kid but\nUh so that's the way she and I and you to a lesser degree we're all taught as of his classroom stuff so you know when they talk about today is on line and schools are like when I have to do continuing education it's on line [noise]\nDo you feed the big dot org don't get left behind your tips and tools a treat to go to war brought you by the American

every day in your life\nHave been searching for the secret to immortality probably say first grass concept of time on the immortal man who's been promised weeks on law code we're down to just one gene throw away your cell phone lasts as long as\nWe got it down to just a single gene that\nThere is a key step and ... and we're just going to turn it off and you'll be useful forever okay\n[laughter] well see they couldn't publish it if it wasn't true\nOut of Africa the entire Internet full of stuff that's not true really\nOne gene triggers a key step and so it was published June twenty fifth move Eighteen is at the University of buffalo and the scientists have identified a protein on the cell membranes that they referred to as CD thirty six\nAnd a just in a nutshell what they did is I took this chemical and if they put it in a petri dish or no to cells are basically uh started the aging process so that started the cells aging if they were held so you know the big problem is are are healthy normal cells age but\nCancer cells don't age so this holds a couple opportunities one is they could use this induce aging you can't change though yeah make them more susceptible to treatment to help cure cancers\nAnd the other is it offers you can slow down the aging process but interestingly that even when the cells were exposed when they added other cells to the culture\nThat hadn't been exposed to it they started age too even though the protein already been taken up so it's almost like it was a viral deal so it's like oh crap all you have to have this one cell that decides who wants to age and everything goes to hell in a handout\nBut they're starting this is you know we've talked about this for years we have the technology is the treatments now the slow the aging process down eventually we'll get to the point when we literally can shut it off and uh you know you kind of the stage for the most part that's thirty five forever\nNot sure I'm going to be three aside for him but anyway as we got a grand gas coming up right now and African currency author of cracking the steady cared a hundred and one kitchen technique to raise your grades and test scores he has been

housing University of Connecticut than a master of science regulatory signs are skinny and go\nState University and then general surgery Adam John hopkins university and the list goes on and on I mean I can sit here and talk about your doctor current for hours because you just have such an amazing bio and I'm so glad you're on the show with us today\nI was glad that I'm Glad I'm On edge been fun already which\nAre interesting school that I got to get that thing thirty six is like where do I do I just wanted to go over there yeah\nSo okay I can I ask you first why you decided to write this book cracking a standing count to answer that but also why memory tiny your thing and\nI wrote a book about\nUm I work a lot with kids in a volunteer program ... believe it allowed US marine corps has a voluntary program during the summertime on on a lot of money in her explained that I work with kids aged fourteen to Seventeen and pull up to recap Palin and I've been giving talks to them about\nUm how to build character how to do better in school and that sort of inspired me to go back and look at all the way that I improved my own grades I used to be a football player for a short period of time\nI always dreamed of being a doctor but a football scholarship out of area like a sheep plus grade average I transferred to California Berkley I knew I'd never make it if I didn't get my courage up so I went on this but now the whole campaign\nTo study using every technique I could think of and I would manage to get virtually straight A's and get an Harvard Medical school and now years later I decided to put it all together in this book to help kids they don't have to do what I did that was kind of an addict\nBut if they get a few of the things in their their grades will go up but I think that the school system I don't think is teaching kids how to study they\nWant them to study but I don't think there's a special place where they could share them here's how you study and here's how you train your memory also that's the key linkage between your topic on memory in this book which is\nYou can train your memory the way you train your body for sports the way you train your mind for any skill I think it's not a oil understood that memory as a training process and any a memory athlete so called memory I Will tell people\nMemory but they trained it to a high level that is the optimism we want to give kids an adult which is no matter where you are in the life no matter how you feel that your memory you can always train it to improve it and um that's the message of the book but\nThat we've seen these guys come on and you know they can memorize the order of a car or a a deck of cards right right and and the other guys I think you're referencing the you know my memory is any better than yours they've just learn to do train themselves\nAnd I was done before in the intro that you know I my practices every day I Try to memorize license plates on the way into the office just a writer a little bit\nAnd so I I agree with you I think you can train that up I tell patients to memorize Bible verses or a poem or something that you know to use it or lose it just like any athletic skill\nDo you remember Lucille Lucy I tell you this current she was at my best friend she died just shine a hundred and four but we go to the grocery store and she just like say give me his name I gave her name she ran and lost their phone number and I mean she could write a lost Homs had all this stuff but she every day\nWe're trying to test her brain do you think that we should be testing our brains a little bit more instead of only\nYou know right now you cast your brain only if you have a test or somebody else wants to be keeping them or something but should we be self caffeine ourselves\nWell this sounds really hashing topic that you bring up because\nI'm here's the situation with the memory of modern modern people don't need to eat or memory that's a big problem because we have all these electronic devices ancient people's you know Greece well ancient people had to use the memory they had no writing or if they did they'd have to chill something I Would take forever\nThe ancient people have spectacular memories and develop methods to memorize a lengthy hours of speeches\nBased on certain components of the brain which modern person can also use but in modern times we don't use that show this woman is a do a good example of the bell shaped curve probably for genetics involved in memory some people\nParticularly in fact she lived a hundred and forty asked me as part of the fact that she has a good brain to begin with I'm and I'm On my own mother lived too like Ninety five and it was a bridge a champion bridge player\nThat's sharp as a pet right now at least he'll play duplicate bridge there must be about this brand is actually study well isn't this study it was in New York Times had a real\nThat's right the question is whether people who are great bridge players live longer because of the bridge or they're they're great bridge players are and there are a subset of pay up people who just have Great Plains has nothing to do with the bridge but the point is\nUsing either don't lose it is a general principle for everything even as people age muscle weekend\nThey shrink their their you know their little joints become arthritic things change your your age and so does the brain but you can train your body physically when you get older and you can train your heart and the three things I tell people\nOn I'm going to stop you there because they go to a break but I Want to talk about the three day and I only three three as of memory when we\nWhen we get back though down already got to stay on the American dot com you can follow us on Twitter stay young media and technique\nStay tuned to the stadium and remember you can reach us by other when they're young America or goal for for a well one hundred\nI mean I Can't bring them

your body reduces important hormone production each year as we age hormones that regulate things such as muscle strength and energy lose the weight gain mental clarity\nAs to the\nState it may be something small and make such a big difference\nBe balanced by biology providing these solutions for years happier use\nAnd therefore they can adapt and change the future so this\nIs a fascinating process of survival and it's always changing\nAnd um to get a memory to stay the way it is is over every time you bring it up it's prone to change and that's when there's nothing wrong with that just people have to recognize that even hold grudges let's say from past emotional events bicycle or something I mean it may be completely wrong about what happened because every time you remember the ...\nThe only show like even that is as they almost pointless in a way\nI think you you're watching current event [laughter]\nYeah I Am actually is a fascinating thing about it because everybody wants\nTo be politically correct and all that but this is an interesting situation because I'm\nActually well we could talk about things such as people being convicted and going to lead a execution who've been wrongfully convicted on eyewitness accounts\nAnd I think about ... percent of people executed or whatever innocent\nShow under a severe emotional episode you can fix\nCompletely off and this is a well known fact and it's interesting that and I don't want to get into you know\nIt\nDoes point out the problem of cooperation you see something happen to okay at some point in time and the question is how is collaborated where's the evidence and of course that's different than a political issue which I don't want to go into a part of the fact that I witnessed a cap somebody what is\nThe Arab because memories prone to Arab because we are not tape recorders\nThe biologic systems I should have been better educated when I was in high school so I could have used some of these is defensive [laughter] when my mother was accusing me of things and I said no no that's the memory I had I was under duress and that changed it versus we caught ya\nOkay and the other hand those take off I mean alcohol can modify never ... you know the alcohol or not it was right\nCan modify memory so what this means that whoever testified that somebody did something to me and they were under the influence of alcohol and let's say there were a teenager drinking\nA beer or whatever and the person show somebody ... how do you how can you say that memory Jack up their own without show again uh I wasn't sure couch but anyway let's get away from now on to the fact that the the people age\n... always worry about their memory they worry about recall function they worried about how fast they can recall

be with you along the way keeping you up to date with every play every score everything that's going on uh the great Kate the lady will take over at three PM Easter noon Pacific but we've got weeks six to the NFL a wild week seven\nFor college football with a handful of upsets including the big one and the SEC is LSU took down number to Georgia also\nGot the American league championship series and the question is will it be a series in the American league so we've got that going on plus that's not\nThe NBA regular season tips off on Tuesday night so this is without a doubt my favorite time of the year olds are said to every year every time around this time and we're absolutely loaded today's let's get right to let's kick things off with the big three\nOr\n\nThat's what we do and we're going to start with of course weeks six Sunday in the NFL nine early games as I mentioned\nThe bigger game I guess if you will is the game in Cincinnati the foreign one bangles surprising for one bangles boosting the Steelers the the big plus for the Steelers who uh according to reports today\nStill haven't heard from loving on bell even though he let it be known through some media outlets that he plans to report this week after the game today the Steelers were off next Sunday for their by week and then there'll be back the following week so\nThat's the plan for now we'll see what happens with James Carter [noise]\nUh the big plus for the Steelers and you heard it from John stash our Ben Roethlisberger\nFor teen and two in his native Ohio fourteen to in Cincinnati I should say he's from Ohio but fourteen to in Cincinnati so we'll see if this one turns out to be a shootout today between the Steelers and the bangles looking for that one of the surprises of the day\nAnd this broke ... about forty five minutes ago or so or out of Miami just kind of came out of nowhere apparently dolphins quarterbacks white tannahill injured his shoulder and the winner over the raiders back and we three and apparently vine tannahill unable to go today\nActive [noise] so what does that mean that means ... is going to get started for the dolphins at quarterback and [noise]\nUh [laughter] [noise]\nWe knew that the ... the fences already pretty good going into this one at a ... a big guy big man but not a very mobile quarterback\nOr this could get ugly today in Miami the other thing too that the as pointed out by some others the dolphins are even without um gays and you know his off into mind running their ... the dolphins are very slow offensively and they don't run a lot of plays so\nTime of possession all that comes into play and of course for the bears come into this game aside from the defense remember they're coming up there by week but remember right before the pie week\nMitchell Trybulski you know there there were starting to to question hey this guy was the number two picking the draft last year is this guy a bust you know what's going on with him and and what happens Matt nagging set them loose and he threw six touchdown passes against the bucks so\nYou know was that is Mitchell forbid ski really that good as the bears off and truly that good or the bucks really that bad\nSo everyone is kind of looking forward to seeing how this game plays out but now\nWith outlined tannahill the the dolphins who are already kind of struggling remember they got up to that three no start and everybody thought wow okay they've got right Tana held back remember he led them to the playoffs couple of years ago you know they back and now they've lost two in a row and both have been pretty bad\nSo we'll see that's going to be interesting though Brock ... Wyler given to start and if if that's not enough it's really hot today in Miami like they said the heat index right now like over a hundred\nSo we'll see how that one plays that we've got the raiders and the sea hawks coming up from London Martian Lynch facing his former team\nThe raiders or one in four they're really really desperate if they will want any chance of just\nBeing contention they got to get this one today uh the Seahawks have never played in London but they're doing so today also the one in four falcons home to take on the bucks with James Winston back as the starter for Tampa Bay we'll see how he looks and how he played the second half of that bears game but we'll we'll see how the box office looks\nI Would Jamieson quarterback today or the browns would Baker Mayfield tried to win back to back games the first time since ... twenty four team\nAs they host the chargers is a big game for the chargers as well there are three and two but the thing about this chargers team over the last recent years they\nThey get off to slow starts they lose games that they should lose and then they finally start to get get it together late but it's it's usually too late and they end up coming up short so\nBig a big road test for the chargers or the Vikings are home to take on the cardinals the colonel's coming up their first one of the season curious to see how the colds and the jets at MIT life\nOr the jets and it surprised a lot of people the way that they came out and blew out the Broncos last week Sam Donald and Robin Anderson connected and had a really big game so you know or the jets backed they kinda turned the corner and figure some things out and then for the Colts Andrew Luck and the culture one in four\nThey've been better but there are still questions about Andrew Luck and you know where he's out with his recovery and the other no a Andrew Luck is never lost for starts in a row and his career and he's lost three heading into this one\nOf the quiet in Carolina Panthers there there are three and one\nDidn't look great squeaking out that when on the sixty three yard gram going to a field goal last week there on the road at Washington Redskins for the second here oh they're just completely banged up a no Chris Thompson today\nA gym is in Crowder is not expected to play they just and they looked terrible terrible coming off of there by that Monday Night blow out against the saints so\nUh that's a big game in DC and then you've got the Texans and the bills from Houston to shut Watson is expected to start but he took a beating last Sunday night

sell it and make money on it it sounds like right now All right\nYeah we can we took money that front 'cause they on the debt\nBecause um and now we could probably make about ten or Fifteen battling it out right but you know when we do it in that and we can make that and you know two or three years to collect rent but not really because we would have a mortgage on it oh ... oh that's going back and forth\nYeah so what does that you pay off we paid a visit and the home\nDepot and credit card mhm and some other small I don't remember\nOkay here's for eyes start um I I start with the premise that somewhere down inside of you know but it's not there all the time my premises is the shortest way to become wealthy is to have no payments\nAnd use your assets and your income to invest and grow things that have no pay much I'm In the show the shortest way is not to borrow because if the shortest way was to borrow you'd go to this deal like terms taint on you do tend more of these right\nAre mortgages on a trip here's where you've had a fungal graduate high school or college point\nAbout how the today show he's taking out loans to be other and I stopped contributing to it if I got a bigger babies to say but I just feel like I I'm not sure what to do next I feel like I'm\nDoing everything I could do my family right now\nGo to a hundred thousand\nOkay so can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school and stop the studios\nBut if we don't if we're not as aggressive on a these properties as we've been for the past couple years\nOkay if you um I mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into bed I Would rather put get them through school debt free and then work on the rentals is their wings and the land doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a 'cause he's got two younger brothers\nThat are going to be going to college to your next few years you\nWill ... maybe stuff for five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement five is kids college what you want or cash flowing in this case\nAnd a six is payoffs mortgages how are you know rentals in the house and so forth a but really um you know in your case you're going to really does you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to pay on your mortgage is\nYeah which is stupid\nIn an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think a lot of our consumer that we should go to save up a a but for three maybe four month alerts eight five and then yeah\nAnd then and then I stopped taking out student loans\nAnd clear them out and then do the same with the other two and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids it's there's money above that then we start throwing it at your\nEither your mortgage or your rentals one of the two so it sounds like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn the house is tiny and then around your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about about fifty sixty Seventy thousand hippies okay a fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen the yeah yeah and for what is the only ones only twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year from now when I was going to feel good and my son is still alive and take out a loan\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay Hannah there was one in there somewhere to make them at work All right Ah yes still I'm just going to plink along on those minimums and take care of college without that first\nOnce we got college without that then we find money we throw it at the at the probably go knock out little twenty five one out and then I'm going to next knocked my house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\nAnd then how about first we're getting back in the world okay or not\nDo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now now okay\nYeah well no says you get your emergency fund ... emergency fund is maybe step three and then maybe step forest Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack baby steps four five six in order\nTo actually three four five six cars you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then it was money left we keep going down the list in the next thing on the list is mortgages doctrine is that there's so there's still a prioritization even though it simultaneously that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before then skipping tree for two and three I guess technically years given five or ...\nYeah yeah yeah and you have any skip three to yeah [laughter] yeah so what's your back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks

waiting on a vacation or\nYou know so you're not in the house in Harrisburg proper then\nNo no I'm In like north east\nWe're up here in New York border but\nYour biggest problem is you have a very limited market yeah the a dummy three sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment around\nI mean and all that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff right and you just have a limited market I don't know what\nTo do your other than a is there anyone in that resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort\nIs or is there a a real her up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that usually there are signs everywhere the kind of specializes in
