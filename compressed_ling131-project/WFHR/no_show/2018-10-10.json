Ohio State it I don't think Ohio State loses they're not going to lose to Michigan playing especially at a the horseshoe Canada not going to lose to Michigan\nI think Ohio state's in that class of greatness so the chance comes down to this is it possible to have a pack twelve winter a big twelve winner at an ACC winter with two lost his each is it possible\nNo it's not possible I mean pigs are gonna fly out of our rear ends before that happens right\nI mean I'm going to win Powerball in a mega millions in the same week to the to the six hundred million dollars is may be more likely than Washington West Virginia slash Oklahoma or Clemson all\nWinning their conferences with two losses the only way you see a has a chance at a final four playoff spot with Alabama taken a spot Notre Dame taken a spot in Ohio State taken a spot is Georgia having to losses\nAnd everybody else who wins their conferences out of the other tower coverage is having to losses along last washing team gets Washington gets in a one last Oklahoma or West Virginia gets in a one last question is going to get it over and undefeated UCF\nBilly question will be if there is to last teams doesn't undefeated UCF jump out of a\nSo George as I said John they have to lose in the regular season still make the SEC championship game and lose the Alabama to losses for Georgia they're out of the picture right cause you potentially see where the pack twelve winner the big twelve winter and they see the winter all have to losses\nNot really right not realistic but that's the only path in my mind doing the math here were UCF undefeated gets into the playoffs that's it has to be then undefeated against teams were two losses and it still doesn't guarantee of\nGeorgia is not getting into the college football player put one loss over a pack twelve champion ... a big champion of moss or a Big Ten champion what with us it's not happening here's what you may be wrong but it's not how I Will tell you where it's not happening I'll tell you where you're on\nTheir schedules ... trying to beat Ohio State and when the Big Ten championship\nThey're they're in the playoff over they won last year but I'm already counting them but the Big Ten winter it okay to make ten winner gets in Oklahoma with one off the taxes\nNo no Georgia's no because Texas wants to Maryland Georgia's only last being Alabama with wings over Florida LSU Kentucky all bring back to back to back to back there in\nOver ... Oklahoma absolutely ... percent of the laws come on come similar laws clubs over the last doesn't make the playoffs\nI'm center of the they're out I I Will defeat the measure tomato or doesn't know James and I'm giving Notre Dame even with one last they're getting in over Georgia one loss\nIf they were they weren't you know way at USC no way one game they might if anyone who's the navy either out no come on USB may not even be a top twenty five teams are going to have a big a top ten went over Michigan okay\nVirginia Tech you by the way Old Dominion [laughter] they continue to lose that have it will make more than five and if you look toward\nThat might be the worst lost in the history of of college yeah absolute biggest upsets are they clearly yeah that's a terrible well do you team to how the hundreds somebody arts and that was in the same as definitely get again 'cause they're Notre Dame you forget about this stuff is their Notre Dame money money [noise]\nMoney is there any way the money is there any way come writings\nMean Alabama Notre Dame rematch that draw huge numbers absolutely we don't know what she was going to be at the end of the year they can have five ... out of the top twenty five don't seem to care about that when you add to that that is true and that's what I'm baking on how good is that one issue\nNot very but here's a here's the problem is Florida what if Michigan has three losses\nI sat her today ... and that could happen Michigan lose three games this year\nThan mine some who's in three years this year the losing Ohio State is to ah is that pen today it's at home that Michigan\nThey had to lose two out of this weekend they're losing three games this year especially is losing three ... three\nIt's possible it's possible I get as possible so if that happens then Notre Dame does like 'cause I mean I don't know if they do they do they talk to anyone who won last okay 'cause that that's the signature when then you know just after losing to Utah hurts too by the way\nIt is yes I I just think that Georgia is a team that people want to see the only two people look at and say they can compete with Alabama if they compete with Alabama to close game that's easy championship game and that thoroughly laws they could get in you know what it's happened before right where do we see it last year\nI'm not too short Georgia to compete with Alabama one we're going to find out I don't care about last year's team who can compete with Alabama right now\nHonestly speaking in college football today I think I think I think it's kind of like nicks David another coaches\nThere's a gap between Nick Saban urban Meyer I don't think so Oh absolutely oh no no there's not I think there's a gap between the Alabama the talent on Alabama and everyone else I think there is a big gap there only because of the quarterback though\nRight wouldn't you agree they've always had great receivers although this year they've had I mean that the phenomenal receivers phenomenal and they have to first round picks it running back and they have two receivers are first breast I mean they always have great right now but I'm saying is if you look at the skilled position players right now and Alabama and the offensive line compared to years past\nThe difference in Alabama is oh it's it's just a quarterback it's the quarterback yeah I look at that offsets\nIf there are plenty of fifty six points a game or something right\nAny not playing fourth quarter I I think he's the best he is the best quarterback college quarterback\nNick statements had absolutely no question about it and but that's in a ... a human hair and it's a very ... very good one three national championships he was responsible for two of them know that being said though\nThere's not that you did a gap yes there's not a huge gap between urban mine they said no but there's a gap and and you have to take into account the success urban Meyer has had to get six habitat that matters\nWhat's his record\nAt Florida he wants to big games against Alabama and an at Ohio State of course in the college football playoff they beat Alabama or if you remember that [noise] yeah that's true and he out coached makes David and I gained by the way I'm kind of Cornell Jones a third string quarterback\nSCA player though he was not in college he shouldn't be in a failed him but he was the third one way to the next year for them into teaching Barrett terrible one leg he beat Michigan on one leg lift your well I'll tell you what urban Meyer gets the most out of the quarterbacks\nHe's a great come you think about they might have is best quarterbacks and some people probably yeah\nAbsolutely I'm not going to say is better than ... ... you can't be better than what Tim Tebow wasn't got no I'm Sorry what was on the ground in college football history not be the best pro prospect right but in terms of college players to people on the greatest caused players in our lifetime\nNo question about it I mean he was on those dominant players we've seen since the year two thousand two so Charles wasn't out of this equation okay he's out of this question Peyton Manning's up\nFrank your top five college football players since two thousand\nSo since ... I think when when I was Ninety nine\nWas crouch who wanted to be no two thousand one crouch\nTop five college football players\nA Ron Dane no from ... from the year two thousand wonder aren't being played a Wisconsin Ninety seven\nNinety six that long ago ... one time I mean when I read in what Ninety five what was it really I'll tell you right now really wanting to sell so since Christ Frankie wanted him to sense ... they want to Ninety nine sorry okay so I just missed\nAll right ah he goes to the top five\nTouch it Reggie Bush Reggie Bush I Can't put it in John ... Peterson he kept getting banged up\nA boy\nMichael Crabtree was great in college town\nAnd you know was a great cost for a job the court I mean he was a legendary defensive tackle or my putting ... he was fired and\nIf you put offensive player he's in that conversation ... voice Reggie Bush ... to ... young not in that order I think you can show the man's delicate maybe no\nOne did it for a year and do it for a year yeah December African\nNah miss the whole year Kim Newton\nJust one year one year the airport Mandela shaker may feel\nHe's in that conversation yeah since two thousand yeah since it doesn't make him he'll bakers in that conversation who we missing though for like two thousand for two thousand five two thousand three\nThat bad that range no one nobody thinks oh who are like receivers putting a big numbers that were really ... [laughter] no regard the receiver Michael Thomas now that's a good little pace he was in the nineties\nHe was like you know I ...

I Will not second guess Cora ... was the move on the court has out managed Aaron Boone this series he asked me corps runs circles around but we'll give you examples right several Reno last night was awful several Reno yesterday\nFifteen pictures in the first thing not a single swinging Mr Right and this is the guy that strikes out a lot of people\nMany balls were over a hundred miles an hour in terms of exit velocity hard hit balls so he gets to the first inning getting smacked around doesn't give up or run gives up are running the second in and getting smacked around as well\nAt this point chef somebody warming up right third inning he gives up to more runs smacked around to get all the out by the way we're heart out\nAnd next thing you know what happened is you had yourself a situation where several Reno comes back to the fourth and no one's warming up and yet you both but Aaron Boone he said yes ma'am manager and that's why he has a job but ... not a good manager the way he managed yesterday proves she's not a good man\nStrategy in place ads you have bases loaded in a free nothing game and no out it's not out of hand yet\nYou have chat green right that you can bring in the game was a strike out artist who used to coming into situations 'cause he's the reliever instead he brings in Lance Lynn who's a star during the ball but who on Fort pictures walks Jackie Bradley\nBecause he's not comfortable coming into a situation in the middle of it anyway three runners on that's not who he is just an off we managed game for Aaron Boone are you really have to question he's capable of taking the Yankees the next level listen Joe Gerard he's a better manager\nAnd I just think looking at Arab ... today as well here's the other thing\nThat's been on how many days rest now three days rest right\nShe sees the bath you have to pitch well and the second half of this season he's not giving you only lengthy either\nWhy would you pitched a bath in this game\nI knew he wasn't going to pitch well I think most people knew he wasn't going to pitch well that once he started by the way and he couldn't find a strike sooner oh you know that trouble for the season that blur see he's not blow in Ninety eight mile an hour fastball by anybody any more of those years along God he's learning he's nibbling and not finding the corners he's in trouble\nSo he's walking guys because he's nibbling and not finding the corners\nYou probably were better off going Jay half on short rest\nBecause you didn't hear you got three innings out to see these about your hat on short rest who only pitch to innings in the first game anyway so he's probably fairly healthy then you go to knock on short rest in game five with all hands on deck in the bullpen and to knock at the first sign of trouble via the third fourth or fifth inning you take 'em out\nBut you you\nYou rely on the CSA bath you washed up hatred that's worth above me\nTo be the saving grace for you're wearing boots I may have done terrible meanwhile Cora\nTweaks his rotation of all these been a Yankee killer what does he do not have all these pitch two years in New York anyway right so the face by Yankee Stadium the basis of all the game on the New York which has games free of all the pitches another gem\nMoves for cello back to this gay because frankly with that to one lead okay a poor cello bombs you have Chris still going on a normal rest in game\nFive\nBack home in Boston by the way you live with that\nShowed up telling you right now if you're a Yankee fan you have to question Aaron Boone and the sense of

gory is with a seeing eye base it between the first and second baseman Jiang Carlos than doing what he's done all series long striking out and just looking horrible doing so\nI mean John Carlos standard is absolutely lost to the plate and this is the moments where you are on your three hundred and twenty five million bucks not striking out being the first out and I think we're too runners on being the tying run ... an awful awful you start to wonder you know fifty nine home runs hit last here\nIn Miami\nThere's no pressure in Miami right no one cares because no one cares about baseball in Miami you I've no media members that show up and you're not playing postseason where the baseball playing for the Marlins\nStick John Carlos stand in the postseason and he looks absolutely lost and

I'm going in there going Chris cells get me three out you know why because I always get your three out he doesn't walk a lot of guys right he finds this right so he came in an age any boost strike after strike after strike bloom yeah he's going to\nWe now towards that and I shot through the warning track right caution we ground down to the strike out right I mean it's still got better as three batters one by one we're not talking just gives you didn't even dawn\nJudge yeah All right All right so I mean judge de ... pitches yeah\nHe eats ... left handed pitcher ... he's a right handed batter huh I'm just saying I mean I don't think it's as easy to make it make it out to be to to bring in sales for a second and I don't think it's as easy as as as you make it sound\nI was just I think it was the right decision about core but you can have Kimberly not a great postseason ... he's not going back to this day the lead the here struggle both sees I remember the ball game and the regular season\nWhere you had to uh you know you never closed out a series right this is the first time you've ever done it again like thirty he's been around since ... happened to play for the Braves here Korea time where they had opportunities to go to the post easily boom and the regular season are members that trauma Hoffman now\nWell that's another love I mean he's not he's not Mariano Rivera you know you're not Rivera ... who is a failed ... Thirteen endings in the Yankees this year at a point six nine your right and so that's the reason he went to ...\nPoker selling the most critical to our against Yankees Chris uh Craig chemicals numbers against the Yankees this year let me tell you I Will get to that information are you ready\nThe modern day I Will get you the information do probably hear y'all right his numbers\nAgainst the Yankees this year we're four point seven sixty are eight and five and two thirds innings us that's a show you keep yourself alive I still think you can branch off kimbrell a really understand that yeah\nI I just think court that you're always analytics but let me let me let me tell you this right if you pass up kimbrell in that situation he going to ... do you do you\nRun the risk of losing kimbrell for the rest of the now he's a guy he's he's old ladies but he's been around as these ... nine years in the league he understands that come on it's not all the games guy gives them a lot of games was idle hands on and off ... you can't go with credit Kimball that situation you can't\nChris Kimball in the post season this year the eleventh like I said don't many are in jail is not close the out that game you know the right\nShow right what does that and it looks like a line might not know what I'm saying is the first sign of trouble they're Yankee for sale it's you know what I mean like kimbrell he's going to work out of his the gyms ... it's his game to lose right that point by that point exactly\nThe ... the last four and a third posting the New York hotel on bringing Kimberlin with runners I I Would look at him he was wild to begin with our leaders on no I I just have more faith in the better pitcher\nChris still without a doubt about it but yeah so that's why you you you keep them on the mound after third sluggish struggled through the eighth inning right and if you're twenty seven pitches and he was lucky to get out and had runners on base so lonely but you don't know what he's going to be like for a second and he's not pitching on it for us\nYeah but you're not and he's just he's had an problems coming down the stretch okay you wanna you don't want you don't want to wear 'em out\nRight you got to be mindful that write his velocity I Know it was great game one it was up wasn't great it's about Ninety eight was Ninety five right but he said his boss and he was been way down the aisle number yeah you got to be mindful that pushing them a second inning on now for us\nYeah but that's the problem in baseball today we're coddling guys he pitched Thirteen pictures\nYou know he's Thirteen Days rest yeah\nYeah I'm actually make a point where the hell he he's he's the bat you've gotta coddle somebody like say that's why the food Morgan Thirteen pitchers looking through twenty five pitches enough in the eighth inning in trouble then sure no problem\nBut when he comes out there and dominate them the eighth inning then I think you bring up to three run lead to one more note we still don't want to read I Would tend to agree with you would sell\nComing out for the knife but if you're OK with him on the winery kimbrell has a cushion\nRight but you don't want to run the risk of burning I fell right is that you're getting five star or right and and and the fact is ...\nBoston has been down in previous starts\nPrior to the postseason he's on three days rest you want to be\nCareful here's where you're wrong on that okay the factors and you said if Craig kimbrell starts that night than struggled with his game to win or lose right he's either save it or get if you go to the ninth grade yeah right but if you go to the knight's still on the mound not that I think you have any problems because you can't touch him but\nIf he had any problems you still have an alternative incorrect Kimball ready to commit you don't want to go to Hawaii which will you just going to you're going to um bring sell out for one better know what I'm saying you know if he gets in trouble and he got up on two guys on two guys on his some guys on his trouble yes one guy on it's not trouble because you have a three run cushion\nBut you're you have so much faith in Christ cell I Do with two guys on you know\nIf I'm going to get them I Would ... them at that point I Would not be comfortable I Would be more comfortable breed Kimberlin just started cleaning than bringing him in ... but also in terms of commissioners on the arms of command Kimball intern here right now with this year he also walked about every two weeks\nThe only one walks in two weeks that's fine but it was pretty well of course it was thirty four batteries in a hundred and fifty eight and ... it's not a question of who's the better picture as much as I pointed out is relevant if we're not talking about who's a better picture we could all Greek herself a better picture right so why don't you know because you got you got to\nTake into account what we just talked about\nHis the fact that he's on three days rest that's nothing to the fact that as you're getting five star yeah you have a three run lead mhm okay the fact that down the stretch his arm had or probably something very about ... about his velocity you have to be mindful of that ...\nThat that all factors in here that's why you go to ... ... that's why the eighth inning was crucial if he looks like they're issues in the eighth inning use it Ninety six I write but somebody was what was the first better he allowed ... labor not wasn't wasn't going to talk about or sell a Higgs know dropped out X\nMcCutcheon ground it out yeah\nWho hated to the warning track\nYou know one of the labor because many guys came to the baton bombed and I think he scored two runs right through hundreds on that a bunch of guys come up the player goes labor warning track and then he had those the ground out from the ... and then I got X\nMeal it worked out for Cory not going to get second guest now because they will he will be will always be too close for comfort now here's the question do the red Sox are in a hundred and eight wins the Astros are in the hundred and three wins right the second most of

know how\nWell Leslie your phone your phone is breaking up beyond but thanks for the phone call though as my friend in are you talking about the Yankee line up and it's it's good Leslie it sits up there with every team in major league baseball you know I I think the red Sox lineup is very comparable to the Yankee light up I might give the Yankee wind up a little bit of an edge but where the red Sox have the edge\nIs with Chris Sale with Rick pour solo\nWith David Price against other people besides the keys and with Nathan you've all the\nAnd maybe Aaron Boone should've gone ... maybe a bunch

a ...\nYeah absolutely ... on the ... defensively is what I'm concerned about is you know can they stop really good officers I mean let's call it what it is a bipartisan made some throws that um let's just say help with defense out a little bit I agree with you um\nIt you know ... everybody's a little bit ... I'm a little bit worried about the rams defense and that\nYou know you kind of rising you you run you can run the football on but yes I I think that\nThe key for Kansas City is again can they get off the feel on defense as they you know go into the playoffs and and they perform you know often simply as I always like to say it in any level it's great that you've got all fetch but you are more likely\nTo have an off they on all fence and they have an all day on defense if you're a good defense and so\nIs that are they going to be good enough on defense can they play well enough I Want to see I Want to see them go on the road\nA digital at and I want to see how they defend Tom Brady you do that defensively you make a statement and then obviously\nOne way you can help your day fence out is what you're off that score points early and have a balance to keep your defense off the field I Can't wait I think that you've got a few games each year Scots that are just\nYou know your stand up and take notice and boy this feels like playoffs in January that's what it's gonna feel like ... even though we don't have the cold weather yet that's what it's going to feel like a win Kansas City of New England play\nA new team playing for legitimacy last weekend was the Cincinnati Bengals the Miami Dolphins Miami at a Seventeen nothing lead Cincinnati scores to defensive touchdowns in the fourth quarter when you watch this Bengals team or are they for real\nI tell you what I was watching them yesterday on tape and in my notes I'm looking at look mix and runs a football well\nAndy Dalton folks is playing good ball a ha green by hitting the backs they're working the ball down feel they played really well the defense stepped up you mentioned it dolphins control this game in the first that they may too\n[noise] uh start off the third quarter a late hit out of bounds a late the targeting call and all of a sudden I'm Tim mentioned not only to be to do defensive touchdown to pick six is awful bad boy that would normally get on a fault\nI mean it was ... that's the difference in the game there but Cincinnati once they kind of turn things around\nTheir defense started to wreak havoc with Miami what I see what Cincinnati and what my concern would be is consistency\nThey play in stretches they played in the first half and we're fortunate that they were able to get the to pick Sixers or or else they lose that game so I'm curious to see you know against division rival Pittsburgh can they take care of business they definitely have looked better than Pittsburgh\nIn stretches but they're stretches where they look like they're all the bangles again they're pretty good they're pretty get up front defensively Dalton is playing well and when mixing as in the game there really are tough to hand\nWhen you are looked at what happened between the New York giants or do Beck and junior he claimed that you know and the team kind of came together after that he's trying to be a leader patch Irma was kind of upset about it after the game said that you know he wasn't going to talk about it anymore but he likes the way the team fought\nDo you see problems with the New York giants or did you did you like the way that they played before losing to the sixty three or ... or ...\nNow I see problems I mean I'm I think it's it shows you um\nDo Dell's comments and the interview show that he really doesn't know what leadership is all about and it's all about him and it is got to be disheartening for that organization ever to gastric given him the contract for him to\nTo go off like that and think that that's what revised them and and it's almost like yelled out played well you know and and now that we lost but you know I I I worked I did it that that he just doesn't get it now I you know hopefully\nBecause according to ... that it's been handled in the locker room\nOr maybe all day I'll learn to just keep it ... and and to just play and lead from within\nI think it depends I think it really depends on that locker on how they responded how they feel calling out did they come together\nOr they're in a dire straits right now and they're facing a Philadelphia team that's you know not much better in terms of a record I mean we're talking to him where he wanted for this is another big game on Thursday where we're going to see a better eagles team having to go on a road against the desperate giants team\nAnd you know better than anybody as the the the don't get off the bat start in a in in midlife stadium\nChris I appreciate the time as always my friend will catch up your next week and look forward to it got thank you so much for having me always love talking football with Chris Landry Landry football dot com crash than I\nDo a college football pod cast each and every week it's called the rush the field and you can subscribe to it wherever you get your podcasts follow me on Twitter at Scott's on air S.

their trailer every single day and only these sorts of snacks and only this bottle beverage in yadda yadda yadda it's unbelievable to lift the stuff\nThat you have to go through to\nSecure one of the stars for a movie or a ... or whatever it is and all the the helpings infections that come with that so I told your brown now facing not one but two lawsuits\nFrom an April incident\nSo the first part about it is Antonio Brown yelled at security and whatever okay the second part is he threw items from South Florida apartment\nOff the balcony almost killed a two year old boy who is two year old boy is walking with his grandpa at the mansions that our caller Lina by the way that sounds really fancy doesn't it to mention that I call Lena like I'm thinking\nI'm thinking you know vaulted ceilings\nThe bedrooms got trace feelings I Want a while I watch a lot of uh you know she TV but like it had that paint them everything in Florida you ever noticed that like everything in Florida sounds so fans the right\nLike all the towns sounds fancy West Palm beach zero peach very high class no idea what it means but just as high class right\nAnd then like all the uh the the apartment complexes have these great names\nLike it's all like coconut grove or citrus masters like wow I Want to be there and it's much like old ladies with blue hair having the four pm blue plate special\nSo I can only imagine the mansions that aqua Lena probably is really fancy with a bunch of like old people with sagging skin hanging out by the pool ready for the for thirty dinner and then as a nurse to show up and help them get ready for bed\nSo Tony browns up there on the fourteenth floor\nThrowing off to vases an Ottoman and other pieces of\nFurniture out the front you know what are you going\nTo the multi million dollar condo brands been leasing get he's getting sued by the owner 'cause he's obviously breach the agreement and only part of the agreement as I have the right to throw furniture and vase is not the damn window right\nBut talking about not caring about others like talk to a guy who just doesn't give up about anybody else but don't\nYou realize these obviously not the brightest cat in the world right like does he not realize that when you're fourteen floors up and you throw stuff out the window God Forbid you hit somebody you're gonna kill him\nRight you're gonna kill a toenail brown has total disregard for anybody not named Antonio Brown like this one guy who doesn't care about anybody bought himself and his great players he is\nIs a world class jerk and I watch them on those stupid commercials with ju ju Smith Schuster dancing around the pizza ones yeah stupid dances I might come on you're in a Paris been making a fool of yourself that's not his fault he can say is the fault of the\nCampaign but he'll say no or him but he could say no I'm not making a fool of myself as he did all players like he's not he doesn't like he just wants the money they'll dance like that for money he doesn't care\nObviously 'cause these days are like that for money but stupid commercial so they looked like a friendly and nice to one better ... where the kid young young kids watching the Pittsburgh Steelers play and gets all excited\nHe's tears the box up oh yeah yeah it's a little better now made as much for himself dancing around like well he's not in it so yeah I'm not a fan okay I'm not but like every store you hear about Antonio Brown outs like it just\nMakes them look worse right for every light you put them and it just makes it look worse\nThe antics on the field the complaining on the field the complaining off the field now no regard for human life throwing stuff out a window from fourteen floors up almost killing a two year old by the way the guardians of the two year old is suing him for a quote intentional infliction of emotional distress an assault\nIf you're a young kid and stuff starts flying and raining down around you\nI think you'd be pretty scarred right like oh my God like you're walking with grandpa or whatever it is next to you know like\nRace is an Ottoman other pieces of furniture just fall from the sky I'd be a little I'd have trouble sleeping and get a little anxiety which is what they said this kid's going through here's the problem for the New York giants this is what to do back him junior is like hotel back him junior fits the mold of Antonio Brown\nAnd here's the worst part about the thing when when it comes to dial back from junior somebody made those comments on ESPN refined daddy's sitting with little Wainwright 'cause little wanes and New Orleans guy just like a just like go back and junior\nAnd oh del you know he liked manning was asked about the comments and little way being there and he like played it off and he's the flack being any life saying I don't know anything about little weight so we're waiting takes offense the fact\nThat he manning is saying he does know ... years they'll listen to music and he's like what do you do all the world you know we're all New Orleans guys here blah blah blah\nAnd I'm thinking to myself I don't care what little Wayne has to say ever I think his music is horrendous\nI don't really care do Dell has to say or ... has\nTo say but the reality is I Do care they don't tell back him juniors hanging out with will wane hangout Bieber on that party boat when the giants were going to the playoffs and they remember the week leading up to the playoff game which got smoked in they were down in South beach on the boat\nThink people was part of the

I Will tell you it's not happening I'll tell you where you're on\nBetter schedules big garbage strike or to beat Ohio State and when the Big Ten championship mhm\nThey're there in the playoff over they won last year but I'm already counting them but the Big Ten winter it OK the big winner gets it Oklahoma with one all the taxes\nNo no Georgia's no because Texas lost the Maryland Georgia's only last being Alabama with wings over Florida LSU Kentucky all bring back to back to back to back there in over ... Oklahoma absolutely Clemson was the last come on\nCome some of the last ... the last doesn't make the playoffs I'm\nCenter of the they're out I said don't defeat the measure tomato or there's been no James I'm giving Notre Dame even with what they're getting in over Georgia one loss\nIf they were they weren't Lulu do way at USC no way one game they might lose the navy other out no come on USC may not even be a top twenty five teams have a big a top ten went over Michigan okay\nVirginia Tech or are you by the way Old Dominion [laughter] they continue to lose that have it will make more than five and again the blue and\nThat might be the worst loss in history of of college yeah absolute biggest upset sorry they did clearly yeah that's a terrible well do you team to how the government I mean somebody argued that was incredibly theme is definitely get again 'cause they're Notre Dame you forget about the stuff is their Notre Dame money money\nMoney is there any way\nThe money is there any way come writings\nMean Alabama Notre Dame a rematch of that draws huge numbers absolutely we\nDon't know what she was going to be at the end of the year they can have five also out of the top twenty five ... to care about that when you add to that that is true and that's what I'm banking on how good is that one issue not very well here's a here's a columnist Florida what if Michigan as three losses\n\nI sat her yesterday ... and that could happen Michigan lose three games this year [noise]\nThen my son who's in three years this year the losing Ohio State that's to ah is that tendency to tell them that Michigan yes that that could lose that or is the data losing too because a lot of this weekend they're losing three games this year especially losing three ... three\nIt's possible ... again it's possible so if that happens then Notre Dame does like it was something that well if they do they know they've got to anyone who won last okay 'cause that that's the signature away and then you know just after losing to Utah hurts to find a way\nBut yes I I just think that Georgia is a team that people want to see the only team people look at and say they can compete with Alabama if they compete with Alabama to close game that's easy championship game and that's their only laws they could get in\nYou know what it's happened before right when do we see it last year I'm not too sure George can compete with Alabama one we're going to find out I don't care about last year's team who can be with Alabama right now honestly speaking in college football today\nI think I think I think it's kind of like mix save it and other coaches there's a gap between Nick Saban urban Meyer\nI don't think so\nOh absolutely oh no no there's not though I think there's a gap between the Alabama the talent and Alabama and everyone else I think there is a big gap there only because of the quarterback though\nRight wouldn't you agree they've always had great receivers\nAlthough this year there had been phenomenal receivers to nominate one I'm a first round picks it running back then they have two receivers her first for us I mean they always have great Renault what I'm saying is if you look at a skill position of players right now in Alabama Andy off into wind compared to years past\nThe difference in Alabama is ... it's it's it's the quarterback it's a quarterback yeah and look at that often\nIf they're putting a fifty six points a game or something right\nAny not playing for the corners I I think he's the best\nThe quarterback college quarterback Nick statements had absolutely no question about it and but that's in terms of very ... very good one three national championships he was responsible for two of them know that being said though\nThere's not that you did a gap yes they're not a huge gap between urban mind they said no but there's a gap and and you have to take into account the success urban Meyer has had against exhibit at that that matters\nWhat's his record\nAt Florida he wants to big games against Alabama and an Ohio State of course in the college football playoff they beat Alabama or if you remember that [noise] yeah that's true and he coached next David in that game by the way I'm kinda Cornell Jones a third string quarterback\nSCA player though he was not in college he shouldn't be in a failed him but he was a third one way to the next year for them to do with Katie Barrett terrible one leg he beat Michigan on one leg last year well I'll tell you what urban Meyer gets the most out of quarterbacks\nHe's a great come you think about they might have is best quarterback ... probably yeah\nAbsolutely I'm not going to say is better than ... ... you can't be better than what ten people wasn't got no I'm Sorry what was on the ground in college football history not be the best pro prospect right but in terms of college players to people on the greatest college players in our lifetime\nNo question about it I mean ten people don't those dominant players we've seen since the year two thousand two so Charles was out of this equation okay he's out of this question Peyton Manning's up\nFrank your top five college football players since two thousand\nSo since ... I think when I when I was Ninety nine\nWas crouch ... without could be no two thousand one crouch\nTop five college football players\nA Ron Dane no\n... from ... from the year two thousand wonder aren't being played a Wisconsin Ninety seven Ninety six that long ago has sent one time even highlighted what Ninety five wasn't really I'll tell you right now really wanting to sell so since because Frank he wanted into science Chris ... hotel in one of the Ninety nine sorry okay so I just missed All right\nUh see most of the top five\nTouch it Reggie Bush Reggie Bush I Can't put a young ... Peterson he kept getting banged up\nA boy\nMichael Crabtree was great in college town\n[noise]\nAnd you know it was a great concert gel decoy\nI mean he was a legendary defensive tackle or my putting he was ... and if you put a fence a player he's in that conversation ... ...

I Will not second guess Cora ... was the move on the court has out managed Aaron Boone this series yes records run circles around but we'll give you examples right Severino last night was awful Severino yesterday\nFifteen pitches in the first thing not a single swinging Mr Right and this is the guy that strikes out a lot of people\nMany balls were over a hundred miles an hour in terms of exit velocity hard hit balls so he gets to the first inning getting smacked around doesn't give up or Iran gives up are running the second in and getting smacked around as well\nAt this point up somebody warming up right third inning he gives up to more runs smacked around to get all the outs by the way we're heart out\nAnd next thing you know what happened is you had your self a situation where several Reno comes back to the fourth inning and no one's warming up in the bowl but Aaron Boone he said yes man manager and that's why he has a job but it's not a good manager\nJust yesterday prove she's not a good manager you know strategy in place ads you have bases loaded in a free nothing game and no outs\nIt's not out of hand yet\nYou have chat green right that you can bring in the game was a strike out artist who used to coming into situations 'cause he's a reliever instead he brings in Lance Lynn who say started during the ball but who on four pitches walks Jackie Bradley\nBecause he's not comfortable coming into a situation in the middle of an ending with three letters on that's not who he is just an off we managed game for Aaron Boone and you really have to question he'd be capable of taking the Yankees the next level listen Joe Gerard he's a better manager\nAnd I just think looking at Arab ... today as well here's the other thing\nJay have spin on how many days rest now three days rest right\nShe sees the bath you have to pitch well in the second half of the season he's not giving you any length either\nWhy would you pitched about the in this game\nI knew he wasn't going to pitch well I think most people knew he was going to pay twelve that once you started by the way and he couldn't find the strike zone early you know that trouble for Sisi the network see if he's not blow in Ninety eight mile an hour fastball by anybody any more of those years along God he's learned he's nibbling and not finding the corners he's in trouble\nSo he's walking guys 'cause he's nibbling and not finding the corners\nYou probably were better off going Jay hype on short rest\nBecause you you got three innings out of the seats about your hat on short rest who only pitch to when he was in the first game anyway so he probably fairly healthy then you go to knock on short rest in game five with all hands on deck in the bullpen and to knock it the first sign of trouble be at the third fourth or fifth inning you take 'em out\nBut you you\nYou rely on the CSA bath you watch the pitcher this for the buck needs\nTo be the saving grace for you're wearing boots I may have done terrible meanwhile Cora\nTweaks his rotation of all these been a Yankee killer what does he do not have all these pitch two years in New York anyway right so the face by Yankee Stadium he bitches of all the game on the New York which has games free of all the pitches another gem\nBlue sports cello back to this gay because frankly with that to one lead okay a poor cello bombs you have Chris still going on normal rest in game\nFive back home in Boston by the way you live with that\nShowed up telling you right now if you're a Yankee fan you have to question Aaron Boone and the sense of what's so great about Aaron Boone what has he done that Joe Gerard he wasn't going to do so he wins a hunter regular season games okay but he has been\nTerrible this post season and people have to stop giving him credit credit for Luis every does foreign things in the wild card game what do you want to do fire him he's not going to get fired not getting fired he makes one point one five million\nAccording to reports it that's it you know majority would've made five Joe Torre is making six one point one five million that's all Aaron Boone mix so you get we pay for your right\nFor the Yankees skipping on paying a manager after they pay you know the managers tore and Android already all those years major league baseball has devalued the managerial position score and gave capital get paid around the same\nAbout one point one five somewhere that range an amazing amazing it's all analytics\nMust feel good about the analytics\nBullied votes to be an ... you managed by the book the hit anybody to do that cash from the ... and this was a match ups you go by the numbers yeah there's no thinking you know they have all ... already\nLaid out in front of him and he managed by the numbers look at look at our score a perfect example of Iraq holds its fullest cycle first and sees a first time ever next game he's out he was in I guess what it was right move because he came through today yeah yeah\nSo the analytics or telling a you know telling you your bonus ... let's surreal is going to come down I guess is that what's happening in game three\nOr ... years of ... do\nThey know it's not actually it's it's telling you that way because they didn't have that many of the swings and Mrs example last that he was really high especially the last ... or ... or so so yes so isn't that I probably should have your Brian cash when you're on to this analytics and you're watching your manager go against the analytics in a crucial moment\nNot only that why why bringing Lance when was the bases loaded and relieve a start in these normally a starter right humble you bring in Chad green there ... he has more comfortable in those situations I Need to strike out guy terrible job done by boom terrible job\nAnd those are the types of things you go back and look at and you say you know what you you wonder here's a guy who by the way people wondering about his

hundred and twenty five million bucks not striking out being the first out of the night thing with the runners on being the tying run age that awful awful you start to wonder you know fifty nine home runs hit last here\nIn Miami\nThere's no pressure in Miami right no one cares because no one cares about baseball in Miami you I've no media members that show up and you're not playing postseason where the baseball playing for the Marlins\nStick John Carlos stand in the postseason and he looks absolutely lost in right now is one of the worst at bat you're going to see just hideous that bat by John Carlos than just awful between the two pictures that weren't even close\nLow and away and not just below what I mean we're talking Florida where it's killing worms and yet Shawn he swings those pictures regional terrible\nAnd we talked about how this at bat would wipe away his failure to write all season and and yeah yeah\nExactly it takes one had to get the fans on your side one hit for people to forget the utilities like force strike outs in game one of the series\nPeople forget that if you have a big moment especially a Yankee Stadium in junk Carl stand by the way\nIs quickly becoming public enemy number one human Louis Severino probably right now we're fighting because the thing is Yankee fans won't be able to see the ... because he sees about the I think this is the last time we'll see impact I think it's about is done I think retirements next receive the he had nothing and really I mean for John Carlos stand you know here's the thing you can't leave it up to\n... voice when your junk color stand a three hundred and twenty five million dollar man boy ... voice has been great now look boy that's been great for them I mean he has been great and the fact is though that lost them now I I [noise]\nYeah you know it looks void has been great for the Yankees but you're relying on loop void to hit you to three run Homer when John Carlos ... is paid to be the three run home run man not only paid to be the three run home run man right\nBut he's also the guy Shawn there is the reigning naturally going to be with fifty nine home runs last year\nWe bought last year is playing double and triple a baseball OK and boy that was the guy batting third ... serious long until tonight when boom switched voice and sing exactly yep wide Yup I I don't I don't they're both right handed hitters\nThey're both right handed hitters\nAnd [noise] I think that look I think what you're looking at is Aaron Boone\nWho figures if I'm going to lose I'm going to lose that the best he still has the confidence to John Carlos stand right overlook voice and puts standing up you know the better spot in the order when frankly he hasn't really earned that right considering how great loop boy does play down the stretch\nAnd I just didn't look voice just walked by the way on four pitchers staying swinging a swap\nLook voice has a much better batting guy right now and that's another question the faith and John Carlos ... do you think he was pitching around ... there are no way right you don't want to put the potential game time run on on base right so it was no no way because he was he wasn't even close wasn't kimbrell with his pitches right that ...\nYou know really careful with a with a look for it is very careful with boy look voice got a lot of power we know that boy this is a very powerful here he is the second most home runs from August twenty six the under the early Christian yell at each hit Fifteen voice had fourteen\nBut here's the thing for the Yankees though and and what's scary if your credit Kimberly is\nAfter look forward I presume who is going to go and do ...\nIn ... who's now you know he's I'm In the order tonight okay he's not playing right now he's ... okay here's let me ask you this\nMiguel and do our had a tremendous season\nStruggling in the postseason yes but he to Ninety seven new walks into the regular season guy coming into tonight new Walker had been over the last twenty seven in the postseason okay so he struggles even more you got hit time though it's far so here's the thing for me\nYeah and do our heat to Ninety seven forty seven doubles twenty seven almost Ninety two rabies and probably should be the rookie of the year correct\nPlays lousy decent lousy deepens okay in this situation though you don't get much by the way okay\nWell you mentioned the jak what I'm OK bases loaded would you rather have new Walker or Miguel and do are at play a good point I I'd rather have oh that's a great I don't I Know walkers the quote unquote more professional hitter because by the way cumulus just ... Neal Walker to walking or to put her running\nMaybe Chris still should have pitched night that I as I said no because you would have went to ... kimbrell anyway you know you you won't have if they all got in trouble and it wouldn't matter here's the problem wasn't going to get in trouble\nWith these guys down so most of the pie kimbrell is the right move really I bet is twenty twenty but it's not for me 'cause I don't like it\nIs the game over yet toast [laughter] not close well away chemicals pitching do you start who's warming up right up the red Sox\nIt just no no one is it is it's it's just that it's a game they lose the walk off and we'll see you on Thursday night and Boston yeah but you know here's the problem though Europe for one and we'll probably opt to go there is no see you in\nBoston this is let me beach right now I don't use your clothes are\nA good call that\nLot of benefit I set it on record right I Want to remember wrong\nThirteenth interest for sale\nJerry than just trying to win at all with one swing border to base voters want to leave the eighties or make it interesting here let you know what happened on the other side here\nAt least it's an interesting game at Yankee Stadium and also what does it mean boss moves on are they better than the Houston accidentally see that that wasn't NBC Sports [noise]\nCentral Wisconsin twenty four hour news and information station and over the Wisconsin badger ...

I'm going in there going Chris sales get me three out you know I always get your three out he doesn't walk a lot of guys right he finds this right so he came in an age any booster I got to strike after strike bloom yeah he's going to\nWe now towards that and I shot through the warning track right caution we ground down in a strike out right I mean it's still just got better as the three batters one by one we're not talking just gives you deny your ears dodge\nYeah All right All right so I mean judge the state's pictures yeah\nHe eats ... left handed pitcher ... he's a right handed batter huh I'm just saying I mean I don't think it's as easy as you make it make it out to be to to bring in sales for a second and I don't think it's as easy as you make it so\nI Would have just I think it was the right decision by car but you know what you think Jim Thome [laughter] Kimberly is not a great postseason ... he's not going back to his days in Atlanta he struggled with both feet and I remember you blow a game and the regular season\nWhere you had to do a you know he never closed out a series right this is the first time you've ever done it again it was like thirty he's been around since you happened to play for the Braves here earlier time where they had opportunities to go to the postseason rebuilding the regular season I remember that from Hoffman now well\nThat's another one I mean he's not not in Iran or Iraq you know you're not Rivera ... who is a failed cartoon Thirteen innings in the Yankees this year at a point six nine your right and so that's the reason he went to ...\nOf course Eli me most critical Oregon's Yankees Chris uh Craig chemicals numbers against the Yankees this year let me tell you I Will get you that information are you ready\nThe modern day I Will get you this information do probably hear yard his numbers\nAgainst the Yankees this year we're four point seven sixty are eight and five and two thirds innings ... so you keep yourself alive I still think you can branch off kimbrell a really understand that yeah\nI I just think court you're always analytics but let me let me let me tell you this right if you pass up kimbrell in that situation he goes to ... do you do you\nRun the risk of losing to you both for the rest of the ... now he's a guy use these old ladies but he's been around in these ... nine years ago league he understands that come on it's not about the game seven I Want to give up it's not a game so hands on that lost like ... you can't go with credit Kimball that situation you can\nChris Kimball in the post season this year the eleventh like I said don't many are right now is not close the out that game you don't write\nThe hit show right what does that and it looks like ... went on and what I'm saying is the first sign of trouble they're Yankee ... you know what I mean like kimbrell he's going to work out of his the gyms that it's his game to lose right that point right at that point exactly\nThe credit Kimball is last four and a third post the New York hotel the brand Kimberlin with runners on I Would look at him he was a while to get wild without runners on no I I just have more faith in the better picture\nIt ... without a doubt about it but yeah so that's why you you you keep 'em on the mound after third sluggish struggled in the eighth inning right and if you're twenty seven pitches and he was lucky to get out ahead runners on base so lonely but you don't know what he's going to be like for a second inning he does not pitching on it for us\nYeah but you're not and he's just he's had an problems coming down the stretch okay you wanna you don't want you don't want to wear 'em out\nRight you got to be mindful that writers velocity I Know it was great and game one it was up wasn't great it's not Ninety eight was Ninety five right but he said his boss and he was been way down the aisle number yeah you got to be mindful that became a second inning on now for us\nYeah but that's the problem in baseball today we're coddling guys he pitched Thirteen pictures\nYou know he's Thirteen Days rest yeah yeah I'm asking they don't go well he he he's the bad you've gotta coddle somebody like ... that's why the through more than a third team pitches to twenty five pictures enough in the eighth inning in trouble than sure no problem but when he comes out there in dominates in the eighth inning then\nThink you bring it back to three run lead to one more note wasted a one run lead I Would tend to agree with you would sell coming out for the knife but if you're OK with him right kimbrell has a question right what you don't want to run the risk of burning out fell right that's got to get\nIs ... ... ... wants to block that he's been down in previous starts prices postseason you don't really trust you want to be\nCareful here's where you're wrong on that okay the fact is you said if Craig kimbrell starts that night the struggles with his game to win or lose right he's either save it or get if you go to the ninth grade they're running but if you go to the knights were still on the mound not that I think you have any problems because you can't touch him but\nIf she had any problems you still have an alternative inquiry Kimball ready to commit you don't want to go to Hawaii which will you just going to you're going to um bring sell out for one batter and what I'm saying you know if he gets in trouble and she got on two guys on two guys on his from guys on his trouble yes one guy on it's not trouble because you have a three run pushing\nBut you're you have so much faith in Christ cell I Do with two guys on you and get them\nOr if I'm going to get them I Would ... them at that point I Would not be comfortable I Would be more comfortable upbringing Kimberlin started cleaning than bringing him in we can also in terms of commissioners on the arms of command kimbrell intern here the ... with this year he also walk to better be two innings\nThirty one walks in the ... that's fine but of course still walked thirty four batteries in a hundred and fifty eight and ... it's not a question of who's the better picture as my point is relevant if we're not talking about who's the better picture we could all Greek herself a better picture right so why don't you know because you got you got to\nTake into account what we just talked about\nIs the fact that he's on three days rest that's nothing wrong with the fact that as you ... you have a three run lead okay the fact that down the stretch his arm or probably children's story about ... I read about his philosophy you have to be mindful of that ...\nThat that all factors in here that's why you go ... ... that's why the eighth inning was crucial if he looks like they're issues in the eighth inning usually Ninety signal I write but somebody was what was the first battery you about a ... labor not wasn't wasn't laid off about a sale a Higgs dropped out X\nMcCutcheon ground it out yeah\nWho hates warning track\nAnd I didn't know labor many guys came to the baton bomb and I\nThink he scored two runs right now to hundreds on that a bunch of guys come up the player goes labor warning track and then he had though the ground out from the cartoon and and then I got an X.\nMeal it worked out for Cory ... not going to get second guest now because they will he will be\nPeople managed it would be too close for comfort now here's the question do the red Sox are in a hundred and eight wins\nThe Astros are in the hundred and three wins right the second most of the major league baseball this year that's the juggernaut series of the two best teams in baseball but does the red Sox with a hundred and eight wins and home field advantage obviously should they be the favorite against the Houston Astros defending champion when you get that next door to ban sportsman NBC Sports radio in the NBC Sports radio mobile app [noise]\nIs [noise]\nFor a complete look at new sports weather and other great information it's a new report was Carl ... am Thirteen twenty held you as a jar [noise]\nIf you suffer from E.

know the Yankees are relying on a rotation to think about what they're relying on in the rotation compared to Boston outpour cello wasn't great because you really want to start your own two years ago dinner prices are terrible contract that will always be a terrible contract and David Price might as well just start off season's early once the regular season ends you'll not you can't piss David Price\nDo you pitch David Price and as soon as the ashes and shepherd upstairs to give them a start\nI think they have to I don't want to but I think you'd have to know the good news is it's not the Yankees who own David he'll oppose the friday we'll be right but there are two strikes against them to get the Yankees won the campus of the postseason to weaken campus get the Yankees\nAt least it's he can't fish in the postseason I'm not sure how he pushes against Houston but it can't be any worse than the Yankees right\nI was looking what are you there you go sail\nYou gotta go price came for

[laughter]\n[noise] I Would say that the ultimate goal like where they want to get is [noise]\nForty seven forty eight wins and reaching the second round of the playoffs I'm I'm curious what is going to happen if they fall short of both of those goals um I I Can't\nI just can't imagine what brought you a little brunch team not making the playoffs I'm that said the west is brutally tough and really deep and if they get off to a slow start there's going to be a lot of people trying to hit panic buttons and it's very possible to get me off to slow start if you watch them play right now they're still trying to figure things out\nUm and they've got a really tough upfront schedule and they start in Portland they've got a Houston after that and just the whole front front end is loaded um\nMore interesting though is how they're going to react and how would react if they end up you know five six seven seed whatever it ends up being and they get bounced and the first round of that's going to be the interesting thing and and how they adapt to that or are they going to be patient stick with the plan or is there going to be you know are finding other\nFree agent and star and building with some of these guys they've got and and figuring out how to content or is there going to be again are they going to be reaching for the panic button\nThat is being questioned no question about uh will they be reaching for the panic button or not a buddy currently healing pro basketball talk on NBC Sports dot com joining us going deep bench war's been NBC Sports radio\nWhat are your guano ball I fought him and you know I think\nPeople's opinions differ when it comes to his rookie season I was disappointed I thought he was going to be better in the sense that Magic Johnson was talking when they introduced him about it you know his numbers going to be hanging in those raptors yadda yadda yadda\nHave we have temper expectations moving forward with him I mean we weren't real lift up as to what Lorenzo ball eases a player or should we still give them the benefit of the doubt look at him as potentially a generational type a player [noise]\nI think magic did him like just just did him wrong with that like that is just\nTo say hey we expect your number up there by the way the Lakers only retire hall of fame numbers like we expect you to be a hall of famer we expect you to bring us championships is an unrealistic expectations for even the very best players coming out of college I mean you you don't want to hang that on anti\nTo the towns are like any of these type elite elite guys let alone that with all due respect all wasn't it wasn't grading out at that level\nOr because so many things have to go right in your career to to have that kind of career even if you've got the work ethic and the talent that said I think I think he's going to take steps forward this year he defended better than we thought they played really well they play fast when he was out there um\nIf he becomes more of a scoring threat I think he he can work with the bronze as part of that are within you know branded a room in the rest as part of that future I can see this working\nBut I see him more as a\nQuality point guard who had best makes an all star game or two maybe but he's not just nobody out there really thinks he's that generational kind of player now and it's it's unfortunate when\nYou know that the combination of magic and the Laker hype machine and then he goes out and has a spectacular summer like a ... really just ramped everything up higher than to than when I suppose I suppose dad was part of that\nAnd ... Murray I guess is going to be out for the season for the down into neo spurs how big a lawsuit this\nLet's put it this way I took them from in the playoffs out of the playoffs I'm partially really has\nThe west yeah because the west is that tight\nBut they nobody ... hey he looked really good he is and you talked to people around the spurs his jumps out what's coming around what he\nBeat Tony Parker out for that job Tony Parker went to them and said look you've got to play this kid he made second team all and da de ... he was a big part of what they do and he was becoming a better game manager and a better off than to force for them\nOr he was going to have to prove that but the guys they have a backup or you know white and and you know you're gonna see a lot more pat patted meals are just very different kind of more score first players I'm not sure maybe I'm wrong is papa that she just pulled guys out and and you know it's it's ... it's like that which I just stuff works\nBut I think this is a really big blow for them on both hands before\nYou know what can be it'd be season starting off in about a week here and\nI have a hard time getting into and here's why and and maybe I'm missing from the car but you have the Golden State warriors they won three the last four championships with the best team in the lead even add the markets cause in ... in our conversations about the markets cousins far easier fit\nBecause really slow down that high powered off and it tells you how talented they are when you take a guy who's the twenty six and twelve guy and it might be detrimental to the team\nHow should we get excited for an MBA season when I ready to predict the outcome and I don't think I'm the only one to say hey goals they weren't going there for five years out of any league in sports today that is the most predictable thing out there which is that the Golden State warriors are the best teams and she'll be champions\n[noise] and yeah the ... it's it's always been the NBA's\nI mean you can argue it say the best team wins and that was supposed to happen yeah but it's like we liked the drama we like unpredictability it is the beauty of the NFL you know any given Sunday um it is the really the beauty of the NC double a tournament is that\nYou know the sixteen she we can actually say this now the sixteenth he can be the one seat um you know you do get the upsets you do get the Cinderella every year and that that is part of the fun and you don't get that as much in the NBA really ever in the NBA there's there's rarely upsets in the playoffs that said I think there's two things may\nThink Boston's got a legitimate shot and there's\nThe margins are still relatively thin like if they're banked up if they're not a hundred percent were assuming healthy they aren't healthy um\nThings can happen I think Houston still good and they just need some things to go their way out but I think they took a step back on the other part of it is man\nYou got to enjoy the journey like there's really great basketball out there you know who's going to be fun this year\nSo I can ... bucks\nThe bucks finally got to coaches could put you on us and and better

its way to getting done\n[noise] ah [noise] I Love the reporting on his way I'll just go with what I've heard from people which is Mick [noise] from sources\nMinnesota keeps moving the goalposts there's a real sense around the league the typical does not want to do this deal part of it that Glenn Taylor has always been indecisive as an owner part of it is that typically do is\nReally hard to deal with on a normal day and now he's got the leverage and they're trying to make this thing work so that's really what it is a Miami finally put the guy in the deal everybody thought would get it done which is Josh which which some ripe for people who don't know Jack Richardson is a forty three and the\nGuy on a great contract like this is good in these young like improving that's a good diet is you're going to get in this deal with no leverage\nIn the package is part of it and it wasn't enough and that's that's what gets used everybody and by the way that turned on the exchange information um you know the medical information on butler and Richardson and all these guys\nThat's like during the five yard line at that point like you would have down there close to scoring so this to come apart at that point just speaks to how much Minnesota keeps moving the goalposts on everybody and at some point\nIn Miami's daily she may have traction with right now Dan if some point it while it just goes\nScrew you and walks away from the table or it then it gets really messy and it's going to be a long time before you get a deal because the clippers aren't that are close at all [noise] Houston it's just hard for them to make a deal work without getting up she says they don't want to give up Miami's the only real options to them in the short term\nVery avid the latest on the

HR it's time now for the morning magazine brought to you by income for their heating cooling plumbing\nNow with the morning magazine here is Carl hill ... thank\nYou Jerry and good morning everyone and welcome to today's show one AM Thirteen twenty and streaming live at W. F. HR dot com it's time for another update with our friends from family natural foods you can find them here in Wisconsin Rapids at nine ten west grand avenue\nA on the west side down downtown not too far from the tracks and\nThere are number someone five four to three three one two zero four to three three one two zero and today\nWe're bringing back I guess we're part two of a of a of a discussion on hold me up and said and march Robertson as president and CEO of Newton home you're up\nOn a path ethics and I'm a and we're going to talk about a natural ways to fight the cool a cold and flu season Marge walk back to the morning magazine\nThank you for having me back\n... well since we last talked criminal cold and flu or cold season especially in our area has kicked in big time it's even it said yours truly it's a bunch of folks in the office and end the tone so when we start their someone's dealing with a um with a virus\nAnd they don't know and they're saying maybe they are going I don't want to be taking drugs or I don't want to I'd have some other concerns like I have ... doctor say you can't take some stuff\nOh what kind of recommendations do have this kind of ... oh no time of\nYear like today we're we're in the sixties tomorrow we're going to be in the tonight will be in the thirties and people are suffering viruses\nBut I was fortunate that our bodies are so flexible to deal with the extremes on both ends um and that goes back to something that's not even home the apathy but it's healthy living and decreasing that sugar and eating right and giving all the things to help\nYour immune system strong start with a and then of course we had on the other day to supplement we have a couple of paying a couple of complex this one is called cold climate\nAnd that was great during the winter during this time people have to hit balls or whatever we also have a flu complex now of course we can't say that it's got to prevent the flu is all I can tell you\nYou know we use it in lieu of the flu shot 'em that's up to the individual and their doctor\nUm but it it actually made um according to the hunting ... we don't have a choice it needs to be made from uh the vaccine whatever the world Health Organization and Haiti he gets side but those trains are for the year\nUm a relationship with the food and Drug Administration so because homey apathy was recognized in the food drunk as a matter of fact that's Nineteen thirty eight were regulated\nLike a drug [noise]\nThan we are as a supplement our our ... and ... so it gets really irritated when people say homey out that the it's not regulated order comes to our facility unannounced spent stays with us looking through all of our papers in our lab everything so we are regulated\n[noise] um so that's one of the the major difference a couple of the major differences on may ...\nLike aroma therapy may use the same plant but they're prepared totally differently\n[noise] and like you have your standard your your professional standards that you have to make it homeopathic compared to something so horrible\nMhm okay I'm I'm wonder you know one of the things we talk about last year we talk about liquids pellets or tablets\n[noise] okay so what's the best way you were mentioning is liquid form the best way to take your product\nWell most people probably over Ninety percent of our sales are liquids it really comes down to ... personal preference um and but the African see should be the same between tablets pellets and\nLiquids however some people say one works better for them than the other um and that's probably true everybody's an individual but for the majority of people it doesn't really matter which forum at by model liquids I'll take a pilot\nUm but I prefer liquids myself it just seems to be easier to take easier to give to animals [laughter] than the pallets\nUm ... do you know to support it right in their mouth all the time I Do recommend\nPellets is for recovering alcoholic or somebody that has really sensitivity to alcohol now the homeopathic a farmer copious says we have to have a preservative so we choose alcohol which has historically been\nI'm a ... because we don't want to use the chemical as a preservative and it's such a miniscule amount of alcohol that you're really your body makes more alcohol then you're going to get in a dose of of the opposite but for the recovering alcoholic there's an emotional component as well so I hung up on those occasions\nUm I say go ahead and and take the palate\n[laughter] what's your most popular product\nDetoxify\nOn my life are a number one can talk about what to do and why should you mentioned you know I end up on the discussion was lending you help us put together a homeopathic medicine Trista but tell us about that product\nWell did the tax the fire is liver and kidneys remedies because everybody is exposed to toxins and every talks and goes through your liver and kidneys now there's also a couple in there for your bowel and a couple and for your spleen and your pancreas which are secondary Oregon's\nUm but I have seen for instance headaches go away we have a great headache complex but sometimes headaches are caused by toxins and I have\nHad people you know they just take the detoxify are and they didn't even tell me they had a headache and then they come back and say you know what I haven't had a headache I've had a headache for two every morning for two years since I've taken a defect so far no more headache\nDo it because it because your liver and kidneys are still vital in the overall health of your body it's so important\nTo take care of your liver and and and your kidney\nAsk your question for guns mind no more gentleman are learning about possibly you know they're going through problems with their prostate or something to help them with that\nYeah we have one called prostate care and um for you know because it like you say it's happens to most people most men [laughter] as they get older um that the you know the prostate gradually grows I mean it's normal it it gets larger with age\nCan sell if people are men have trouble urinating um or they getting up at night a lot it would be the the prostate care the prostate formula\nAnd what makes it work\nWell it does have the ... it has um I don't know offhand all the different ingredients but they're put together by way of the material medical which is the Bible of the homeopathic\nUm that help help to find the remedies that um are are beneficial for it I can let me see I can look at my ... and probably ... [noise] kill you some of the things that um [noise] but\nThey're there for the different when we put a complex us together [laughter] it's for the different aspects\nOf whatever the problem is so\nThere's something in there for inflammation there's something in there for infection because sometimes his press the tide is for the beginning of that um there's things that are specific to the swelling\nOf the prostate there'll be something in there for the the kidney or like I'm looking now here solid day go there's something in there\nBecause in their breast is for liberal kid I mean I'm yeah kidney and bladder so you will find because those are all related organs around there\nSo we take into account homeopathic that I'm dealing with a particular Oregon and then told me about ethics that deal with a particular function\nOkay now how often do you think\nYou would if you have something active going on you would probably take it three or four times a day to start with\nAnd then all with with with ... apathy you tune into your body and you just it's so as you start not having an issue then you go to three times a day and then two times a day you may not need to take it forever the whole idea of ... is that you don't take it for the rest of your life\nUnless you like to talk to fire you're supposed to talk with all the time so I take it you know three hundred sixty five days\nBut you know when I have a cold for or I haven't had a cold or forever because I take it right when that itching and tingling start it never developed into ... and so in a couple of days I don't have to take it and I never got the\nColts are not there okay theories people got to tune into their body a bit\nWell I'd said in the er I'm at the end I wanted to wrap up where you helping put up a homeopathic medicine just together so we're in the cold and flu season now what should people have in their medicine just\nThe cold sinus formula [noise] a fever infection formula [noise] the flu care formula I and and the throat care that those are specific to this season\n[noise] I Would also say every medicine chest should it doesn't run not related to this season but related to everyday life is the one called accident injury rescue it's just an overall things for injuries that has the same fight him for bone injury high pair come from nerve injury\nArticle for Bruce and swelling on echinacea for a burn 'em route tougher muscle it just is a comprehensive is called accident injury rescue I mean it's an amazing formula even has the second item to Palestine it for the fear\nThat may come from an injury but people can take it before they get their teeth cleaned anytime you might have some trauma certainly pre and post any type of surgery that people might have to have um\n[noise] now this is not the time of the year but there's another product called natural response and I always say you know anybody that's out hiking working in the woods that sort of thing it's actually full of snake found them so it has copper head rattlesnake water markets and\nAll those things because I tell people if your five hours from hospitals you better have another plan\nIf you get bit by a by a snake\nAnd so we've actually had a couple of good oh good reports of some dogs that were to dog sat worm bit at two different people and took the natural response and you know I still say you go to the vet or the human doctor or whatever and get checked out but by the time they went there they were fine\nOkay I just had\nNo um so that's a that's not this season I mean the snakes are going into the ... for the night for the winter now\n[laughter] it's a good one for the spring\nOr could you know again a Mars is ruining our time people can go to your website do labs dot net and of course they can stop by and visit with these words or even a Katrina over in family natural who the most after\nA and learn more about your products but I guess you've given us a game plan for dealing with what's coming down the road here in the upper Midwest\nYeah and if people I mean we have also education on a website that has nothing to do with our products if they go under the education tab they can see a you know out of the history of homey apathy what it is all that sort of thing as well\nYeah and it's getting every but like I said everybody that's in Boulder or cares about this and getting them at the table and talking and learning from one another now why don't you read a lot of good will be damned pills again so folks and wrote it down and then you can go to encourage website there's a sign

ready\nFor the weekend and then obviously coming up on a on friday you've got brewers baseball as well so big action packed weekend coming up but ah we may chat a little ... who knows but for the most part Packers and the NFL and uh you know I got to ask I mean\nAnd I asked Paul immigrants question I ask you do you feel like this Green Bay Packers team is closer to having a couple of extra wins\nOr a couple of extra losses and Paul guy just my reaction to that\nWhen I asked the question 'cause you really you make a kick against Minnesota you get a when you make the case against Detroit you get a win okay so I look at it and say you know way maybe it's a little bit different\nMaybe this team at this point as a couple of extra what maybe this team asked for wins in the season you know maybe things aren't nearly as bad you know Aaron Rodgers and and the office play with a little more urgency early on in a ball game they get into a flow get into a rhythm a little bit earlier maybe things you look it up right maybe things are a lot better\nThan what I'm looking at and then you get to kind of the eyeball test and you think okay the eyeball test um it\nJust it just doesn't look good you know I mean can his team before zero in one or can his team be foreign\nAnd one at this point in time and just the one loss pick one\nThey play the ugly in Washington that was the loss but you you make a kick against Minnesota that three wins you make the kicks in Detroit that's four wins and all of a sudden things are looking different you're sitting here looking at first of all you'd be a top division you'd be four in one sitting here saying you know what and you haven't played your foreign money and put your best football yet\nBy far the outlook would be different but because of the ms kicks you know\nOkay special teams that hurt this team of fumble Aaron Rodgers usually feels that pressure from the back side is very good at getting rid of the football and knowing that in time and it's something that is is like Paul use the word dysfunctional as something that isn't right so as a Packers fan\nDo you feel like they're close like all you need is that one game maybe this game against San Francisco you get it together you get it at home you get it on a Monday Night and then you get a week and a half to self scout venue then you're off you have a by we coming up then you sell scout and you try to figure things out everybody goes away cools off cooler heads prevail\nThey come back and everything's right with the world because I really thought offensively speaking this thing would be on track and in a well oiled machine once we heard Joe fielding was returning maybe it's just I was looking for that magic of two thousand twelve I don't know\nBut you kind of felt that that would be the directions team would go and just hasn't been\n[noise] do you remember in twenty Fifteen the Packers started off six you know and we all kind of\nSat there and we watched the six in a football team and we said you know what they don't look right yeah there are six now remember Mike mccarthy came out and said you're not worth ... football team you know there's you know we shouldn't be freaking out about that but the writing was on the wall that that team\nIt didn't look like they deserve to be six to know one Randall wheels came off remember that that all of a sudden it was like a struggle when football games 'cause I think they went on a three game losing streak where they came out after being in the chargers twenty seven twenty\nHuh that was the plate to marry is Randall had to make very bad it down a ball right remember the charges were just given the Packers fits ... field but then they lost the Broncos last of the Panthers or they lost the lions\nAnd then you know that was the Hail Mary season in Detroit and\nThat's what that's what this season kind of feels like where you're right a couple of different plays in some of these games and the Packers I have a couple of more wins to their name but even considering that they still don't look like a great football team ... right seem kind of reminds me of twenty Fifteen\nIt it yeah I can see that I mean you just like I said there's there's just a [noise] I guess\nWhere you get hope is when let's just say in the past we've seen the defense not play well but Aaron Rodgers on money and you're like wow you know as long as they're in Rogers there you're going to cover up all the blemishes well now you blemishes and Aaron Rodgers isn't covering them up in a full\nGame wasn't that also the season and twenty Fifteen where Aaron Rogers was off\nYeah because remember everybody blamed it on a limb on\nWhile I blame that more so on the on the play calling you know these constant isolation routes and they never a change and we kept complaining about what is Mike mccarthy going to change his game on friday\nBut always said it was it was it was off as one on one guy to study is a film for him to be yeah so it was ...\nAbout this he says Mike mccarthy was what he would probably boring and and often one on one you know this whole innovators thing ... something like that there's nothing there what are you kidding this is stuff that people installing the first week of training camp and he never expound upon\nI mean you look back at when they win six and all that season they beat the bears by eight points they beat the Seahawks by ten they beat the chief spy tend they beat the forty niners a low scoring game Seventeen of three they beat the rams by fourteen and they beat the chargers by seven all those games are pretty darn close and then they got just\nBlown by the Broncos twenty nine to ten you know I\nMean that was that was that it ... no I was at Denver was in Denver okay\nThe crush them there I just it it it just seems like right now are they the player to away from being a really good team or the other player to wave from just being an awful thing\nAnd it just doesn't feel like there's any\nFluidity this you know and now you've got like I said how how Clinton Dick saying us nobody's going to be here you've got Josh Jones said he wants more playing time you've got other players now kind of saying well you know we got this going on in that going on\nA you know we've always had those kind of backhanded veiled even though we know what he's talking about comments from Aaron Rodgers regarding the head coach and by the way\nI said this a while ago I said that you don't really hear this come out and say like Tom Brady towards Bill Belichick not until recently and even still I was listening a Knight Bob and Tom Brady does things at half time\nOn the Monday Night football show now granted he's doing of Jim Gray so everybody's you know Mr softball pitcher\nBut it was it was something about the team and he said you know he did nothing but praise be organization praised the coach and we all know there's a rift there\nThen again brings probably feeling pretty good 'cause he won the rift cause the owners' side with him but\nWe there they're winning football games and I thought this might be the beginning of the end of the New England patriots this year and they still continue to when they still continue to surprise and he does not rip the head coach\nYour home for great mobile high school or just Thirteen twenty usa jar Wisconsin rabbit was twenty four
