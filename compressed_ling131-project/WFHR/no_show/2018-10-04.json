poorly aren't going to share your bag thanks for calling in men is one of those bands in Colorado Springs I ban how are you\nYeah you do better than I deserve what's up\nThere I Am self employed I'm a real estate agent and um we've got the thousand dollars for your baby steps wide and art but they were were\nKind of a crossroads on how to how to go up to about going on with the next babysat\nI'm of the opinion which isn't in your plan that you know because I'm self employed and money isn't always the air I Need to have a you know two two months or so of income to fall back on in ... to be able to make the budget\nThat does your wife work I Do she does not she's a stay at home mother and are you sure you're not making any money in the real estate business\nI mean I'm making a hundred thousand a hundred and ten thousand a year somewhere in there they are not having you know it was the role months\nNot any zero month or during the winter in Colorado there's um a month or slower than others where you know making the making the budget would be tight tighter in ... I'm\nNot I don't I don't I never expand the baby step on emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly follow do and I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like it is you might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really\nYou really need to stop and think about what you just said but anyway if you're going to go to zero in December because nobody's buying a house in Colorado Springs in December you don't want to have the zero money I'll go along with that part but I don't think that's what's really happening you're making eight thousand dollars a month average\nSo I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month whatever so anyway set some aside but we're\nAnd so on and we're not going to add to the thousand dollar account we call it an Illinois valley account mailing valley is the volatility of your income\nThe hill is when they come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to set a couple of ground over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts one is for emergencies and one is for you if you run out of money because you don't make any money in a month\nBut dude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow to analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run out of money\nI mean you can make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if you told me he made forty thousand dollars in real estate business I can imagine you having some zero much but you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money\nA year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back in track your revenues in charge revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nIn giving in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are then okay set some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is\nAnd uh but no we're not changing the emergency fun we might have a hill and valley account if you truly have a volatile income Mark's with us in Seattle Highmark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nYeah thanks Dave hey it's a great honor to talk with you know you had a great impact on changing my life five years ago I'm getting I think you are currently I I I got a great question I'm In baby steps eggs are the only thing right now I'm paying off my um do you get a net worth of a half million dollars uh [noise]\nWhat happened was this five years ago I I left a small company with a great a company culture when I hear you talk about your company that company I was working for a very similar culture\nWas making an average salary or for what I did I went to a competitor a much more you making um I was making eighty thousand dollars a year what do you make now I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year\nOn your question is what I make my question is I really miss that small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really\nReally interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost my passion for my work and um you know I should have to work every day I get great reviews um I'd\nProbably go back but I Want some equity or I Want some indication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually worse in the marketplace\nThis idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less\nIs not necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going with\nSo maybe that particular company can't tell you but if you want you could probably find somebody with a decent culture\nAnd pay you what your worse\nDid you know statistically when it comes to life insurance in protecting your family that women are more likely to be uninsured or under insured than men this doesn't make any sense women make up half the workforce contributes mightily do family incomes\nAnd in many cases are the breadwinners and take care of their families twenty four hours a day lives as one of the most overlooked areas when it comes to financial planning\nMaybe it's a relic of the past but a loss of income or the need to replace family care\nIs equally important for women\nAs it is for men single moms working moms stay at home moms all need term life insurance rates are actually lower\nFor women which is why I send your designed or insurance they shop the top term life companies to find the lowest rates available you can compare rates on line at ... dot com or call eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two this is something every family\nThey treat you like crap and they over charging for most of the services and this day in time there online offerings of their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated they're not that good\nThey're not good at anything that I I just don't get it so that that's why we endorse credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank\nAnd I'm just a a huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and it's what I did\nEverything I endorse on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation I kind of a thing I don't have anything is inconsistent like I'm too big or too good to do that I I'm not I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell you to get but\nYou know ... you know in most cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York ...\nHow are you I'm doing better than I deserve how're you doing just the same how can I help\nBy ... thank you and your staff writer doing it's a blessing you um how it'll be needing a lifetime saving operation about ten Fifteen Years I don't get hit by a bus\nAnd I want to know if I probably should continue funding NHL say with my employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks here first I just put that extra money into a Roth IRA her four one K.\nWas it just a couple of hundred bucks a year the company I don't know whether she can put you come out they're matching a couple hundred bucks a year or more\nHow can I show the the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you've got to have in ten years what is it\nFinally deliver ooh I got on the sea so yeah fortunately if you can't live without\nYeah I've heard that you know our K hobby I'd say it's a it's a slow or slow progression then\nYeah it is they they estimate that you know Seventeen years out so okay I got to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to retire early you know if I\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're going to want is a ... you got to have the cash in your age are saying or somewhere else in an investment to cover what is going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking health insurance is going to cover a large portion of this correct\nThat if I don't retire um that I'll be on um either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nYeah I think I'd be on cobra or or I wouldn't retire because this is a guessing this is a multi hundred thousand dollar event isn't it\nProbably has\nNow and so I'm thinking we're going to turn retirement around this a little bit um or and or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the ... cover only last what two years or something\nUm I don't know you can keep that indefinitely so I think that's number one I Want to make sure you got health insurance to cover the vast majority of those I don't want to\nTime that poorly a but then how much have you got coming out of pocket a over ten years you could put five thousand dollars a year into that age essay or whatever your big the duck double is what you are to duck double\n[noise] um when he made that up to ... or ...\nWhatever the doctor bill is on the ... year\nOh now a trustee of the health insurance amount of fun I don't\nKnow the ... say their health savings account that is attached to a health and ... say health insurance policy that has a high dollar ... policy\nIt it depends a dependent on a policy I pick a cheater six to nine to five thousand\nDollars is what I'm Talking about you can put up to that amount per year into that savings account\nBecause that would be six thousand yeah really fun that yes and I don't touch it until I you know pretty higher\nYes here's why so when you're when you need the money out of pocket to cover the whatever comes out of pocket on on the liver surgery or and you keep your health insurance in place then you've got this big juicy health savings accounts sitting there in and\nUse mutual funds in it and let it grow over the next ten years be as big as a ... there's no downside of that whatever you don't need for the liver transplant or liver trans whatever the processors they're whatever you don't need you can pull out and just pay taxes on no penalty\nAnd so um you're going to want to build that up and you just not going to become sort of what you don't use you can use for retirement\nAverage sixty five so I Would love that up knowing that you got this coming down the

just it just seems block this you we we expected so much more out of him\nThen we I Would think so but I got some extra rest falling on Thursday Night Football game of course I'm Talking about the biking\nUm bailout porn and sixty five passing yards\nOn thirty six passing place when they took on ramps\nAnd um the defense\nWhich we thought that a lot better with Sheldon Richard sending George I woke up first round her the rookie Mike use it a lot of comments to score for twenty seven points per game\n... inch okay that's not very good\nEagles meanwhile they're passing tack looks maybe perhaps revitalize without Sean Jeffrey back in the mix although he's got a chest injury now\nWe'll see what a what if anything that might do with\nIn terms of uh [noise] you know making him available for Carson when scoring climate has ... has a hamstring so I you know it's not like they've got all the pieces\nAnd apparently they all ms practice again today\nWe're being told that Jeffrey has been battling virus or at least was last week after getting cleared falling shoulder surgery so we'll see Doug Peterson such rules by the way it would be expected to work through his injury and currently remains day to day\nBut there are a lot of ... a lot of teams that will leave us scratching our heads including\nBoth Pittsburgh Steelers and the Atlanta Falcons who ... who will face off\nThis week as well\nOr you've got one team who is a one in three people NFL consent and you've got the Pittsburgh Steelers who won two in one and you're like what the hell's going on\nIn fact I asked this question earlier who needs to win worse\nOr more who who who needs to win this game or the Atlanta Falcons\nOr the Pittsburgh Steelers\nI mean you can make arguments for either right now and I know some people a Steeler fans believe those who haven't already burnt their lady on bill ... he's the one lady and come back we're told about week seven to ... that he's going to fix all their problems\nThey a lot more problems than running back position\nWhere do you help yeah you know that defense is just horrible\nI mean some of the statistical analysis this defense Dana played this badly since Nineteen sixty eight and a couple of categories they'd never played as badly I don't know people in Pittsburgh already calling for the head to keep up with the the defensive coordinator\nA lot of people had wondered\nHow they were going to place the guy like Ryan ...\nWell I I figure it's pretty safe to say that they haven't come up with that answer yet\nThat guy was an amazing player especially point in the middle linebacker position but his ability to run sideline decide one not to mention covering the number two wide receiver down the field was as good if not better than anybody in the national football league so anyways um\nThere's bad\nI saw an overnighter\nBefore the season started for the Arizona Cardinals\nAnd three wins and I thought three wins are you kidding me [noise]\nI knew at some point in time Josh Rosen would find his way\nAnd by the way it looked relatively good I thought in the last in a close game but in the last last week but I had this football teams better than that right I Know they've got a new coach they're gonna end up with a rookie quarterback at some point but it's not the roster it improved a little bit from a year ago and all of a sudden you've got an own for football team what else going on in Arizona\nMeanwhile the Chicago Bears our football team that everybody's like rule ... through six touched no no no it was ... he doesn't need to throw six touchdowns doesn't need to do it\nI mean I don't know that he's the next\nDrew Brees I doubt it\nWhether it's the running back colon or\nSome of the wide receivers in the speed that they have now outside\nThe defense is ridiculous\nClue Mac has\nThe access of defense in that entire NFC North he's not only\nI mean just obese that I don't know how you handle a guy like him the more than that he's made everybody else in the defense aside better\nSo he's incredible\nAnd I'm thinking to myself okay so I said this when the season started that I you know I I kinda\nI kinda wanna see how the NFL unfolds for the first month the season\nBecause the way teens now attack training camp in the pre season you get very little work with your stars it's all about trying to get to the to the regular season with\nI so\nAll right so it's an extension of the pre season let's take the first month and we'll get into the end of the first months here are we're at the end of the first month and and I'm scratching my head going geez do I know any more about this I picked the I picked the Steelers represent the AFC\n... I mean they're going to him on\nMet Ryan a former MVP with a lot of weapons and I know they've been hurt on the defense side of the football don't get me wrong and that's that's that's been\nVery difficult to overcome so far\nBut I'm thinking to myself [noise] okay\nI Know anything more about this this this NFL a month into it I Know this the rams are by far the best team in the NFC by far\nWhat they are able to do it in terms of running the football at ... sets up the player action and to me they do that better than anybody in the lead anybody in the way if you're if you're a football junkie get some tape\nAnd you watch the outside stretch play to Todd early and you watch the play action to Todd from you know stick the ball and ...\nAnd you look at the office of line and

any questions about how good Eighteen may or may not be in the pre season but [noise]\nExcept for the first time Laker fan saw\nGutsy were brawn James played staples Centre\nAnd apparently it has become hardest ticket to come by in the NBA believe it or not yeah\nUh they had a sellout Nineteen thousand people\nFiled into the staple center and\nChanted MVP\nI guess if you guys are out there you know\nVandalizing murals of what Brian James will spray cans\nApparently they couldn't get it to\nA James if you're wondering finished with Thirteen points who's five and six from shooting\nHad a three rebounds racists\nAnd after the game said quote unquote it was great atmosphere for the first a Microsoft game\nBy the way that anybody see him he just did this stuff all tied to me I mean I don't know that they were like short shorts but a short slipped\nTight stop looked a little tight\nBut he's been there for a while mantle tip somebody coming in to that make it to his specifications [noise]\nAccording to stop this is interesting\nFor Lakers tickets has have increased\nSeven percent over the last season\nThe Lakers right now I Believe this or not\nOur outselling the warriors and the next step up says that their website immediately took on more traffic from Lakers purchases since July third\nBy the way that is one of the broad announced it would be edited Lakers [noise]\nThat's crazy crazy stuff in fact the two most expensive tickets on a pub or the rockets at the Lakers\nWhich by the way is a October twenty of\nYou know what the average ticket prices there for that one\nNine hundred and thirty four blocks\nOut she go to that once you get do you get a ticket on set up\nA bar you know I just\nShoot 'em in the past I'm going to pay like twelve hundred dollars to the Celtics players\nAre you ... you are not tied probably will if there is crazy if I'm going to see LeBron and the Lakers uniform it's one of the Celtics are in town\nA well first of all I could care less what brunch worn a Lakers uniform or cash uniform that means nothing you're Boston Celtics fan once you spend that money fly home until your parents and and see what the guard\nBut my parents would want to go to the game huh my parents wouldn't want to go to the\nGame I didn't say that just go and see your parents go to the game yourself\nSo you might as well spend the money why would you spend twelve hundred dollars to go down the street the staples center to watch an NBA\nGame I just pulled the number out of the out of a hat there I mean maybe I can cut a deal and\nJust ... thousand dollars but you're right it makes sense to say Hi to my folks and go back to New England during the winter or they can hold off than\nI can check whether on the schedule I was actually more interested to see who we should come back this time tomorrow because the LA Clippers are having their first home preseason game and I wonder how those numbers stack up\nWhen the Minnesota tempered will come to town a night\nJimmy Butler obviously not what the team but who let me tell you they're ready to see Patrick Beverly them and also the Indian jury for last year I think there is I think you can get\nOne of those tickets for twenty five bucks and you get a free Popeye's chicken coupon or something like that that sounds nice yeah I think that's where weapons\nBy the way the second most expensive ticket right now and stuff up or the Lakers that the warriors that's on Christmas Day that one's only seven hundred Thirteen bucks\nI thought that I thought that was a bad idea I I don't I mean the only reason the Lakers are in that Christmas game is because of a broad they should've at least had a more compelling western match up whether it is Houston and Golden State or I just thought that the warriors fans are getting robbed on Christmas Day\nWhy why are they gonna rather than Christmas Day the Lakers aren't going to be relevant\nSo do you have a conscience that's why we're talking about them on a preseason game but by Christmas Time already know that they're going to peak at\nAn eight seed okay that's fine or a playoff team if people wanna see the Bronx most people who have season tickets on Christmas Day you're going to the game in a given where selling them some step up merry Christmas\nDuring the game that you are [noise]\nAs we continue you know despite the despite the soaring ticket prices and all this hyperbole\nA I think we need to kind of pump the brakes\nAnd I think this is what you were alluding to out what's on the Showtime Lakers comparisons [noise]\nUm I mean listen I\nWho who are the preseason favorites to win this December the title\nBy the way I guess you can thank the rockets and the Celtics for this because I Know they're GM's did not vote for\nThe warriors but uh eighty seven percent of the gyms voted\nFor the warriors to win the NBA Finals which would have been my vote\nThat's down by the way from a Ninety three percent\nSo apparently it's just not the ...\nThe rockets and the Celtics who else voted for\nSomebody other than the warriors\nAny any opinions Alex\nI mean the conversation begins with Houston and ends with Boston I don't mean\nIt just about who can match up in a best selling what the warriors I don't think either those teams can beat them\nBut I think they both have enough data to survive a couple of injuries well I mean\n... it's tough because James Harden as one of those guys that\nThe rockets are still a playoff team but they're not models content or if they lose them I guess I'd say the same about\nAh I mean I wouldn't say Kyrie but they did go to a game seven without um last year\nSo I I think those are the teams that at least are good enough to be in the conversation come may June time\nI mean there's some other very good teams I'd like to see Utah the another year Donovan Mitchell and\nUm they well I mean\nThey'd be competitive I think they could run with gold I don't think no no no no I mean in the western conference final I can see them go by games as opposed to the warriors sweeping everybody on the way that the finals okay\nHave you had to start a franchise who what where would you pick to a stark difference is\nI think the day I go with\nThe ... it seems pretty easy to me\nThat's what the GM's out there so they got thirty percent of pick a\nPicky on us up to ...\nAnd I think there were you know some other young promising guys on there that make up a ton of sense but I Can't believe that some GM's still would start their franchise today with LeBron James

Wrigley Field [noise] and it's interesting because at least the conversation of welders Joe Madden coming back and\nWhat I liked about the conversation and look I'd be Joe ... most overrated managers and all of baseball I really do\nLike this whole like nice guy I'm a cool guy act I'm just sick and tired of it oh he's like so cool he let just players like dress up and like you know he's going to be careful of baseball he's got this cool frames and you know men like still young and old man's body likes to get tired of that whole narrative like stop it okay\nJoe Manchin another manager they've got nothing against Joe man I think he actually did a nice job in Tampa Bay worked well young players but as you listen to the debate today asked you should joke Matt income\nIt really highlights the shortcomings of how he misused the bullpen this year which by the way we saw in the world series when you know I mean he overused are all just Chapman it was practically criminal how much chat and it was pitching Japanese armies like no no not again not know they always costs the world series because of at\nCleveland comes back it's all round they always come back and when the world series why because well you can't picture all just chat with every single day\nAnd damage Joe Madden tried and if you\nLook at Joe ... think to yourself very what you know what at least in Tampa Bay it could be like these are some young players and he got the most out of them and he's good at developing young talent right okay good\nWell here in Chicago it's a bunch of like high paid guys right these are like high paid stars guy sweat history before they got to Chicago Jon Lester in history\nJason Hayward at one time was like a good baseball player just forgot how to be a good baseball player\nI Will never let our producer Sean block to block you live that one down his love of Jason hey we're going sign that massive hundred and eighty million dollar contract you said he wouldn't MBP or be in that conversation is that what you said was\nA and B B candidate when he played for the cardinals yes and if he continued to play that way he would continue to be the MVP get it that's what I said yes but what happened was he took the money and ran well I thought he would continue to play that way yes he thought completely wrong\nWhy you haven't been wrong you've been wrong numerous times not like that not like Jason hey we're wrong yes you have met Theo Epstein wronged by the way you run feels level chasing a or does he gave\nThe damn money he didn't have that better citizens here oh my God what have you know the standards on Jason hey we're now it's like not that bad of a season ...\nBe serious what are you bring up is fielding is that we're going to hit me well that's the whole point of the signing a hundred ... is feeling of course not for a hundred million dollar Yankee fan when judge was out for a month\nAnd a half and to make a difference in my field\nBut not a hundred and eighty seven million dollars different\nMade a difference though I mean Jason ... for Jason ... one of these seven where are you getting used it for I I'm Sorry Jason advocate for tax purposes I gave you three million more the guy hit two Seventy with eight home runs than fifty seven RBI that's what he does he's a two Seventy to eighty hitter\nThat's not a hundred and eighty four million dollar man no kidding by the way you remember he did it when he started his own mind as long as you're ever having you're hosting anytime you say anything and be like what about Jason Hayward\nMember yeah but you're misconstrue in what I was saying and I figured he continued to have the season he had his last year in St Louis to to be worth it\nTo us that was the analytical looking at it through the spectrum I think you've kind of changes scope a little bit of that no you just don't remember the conversations we had the white deciding back\nThen I didn't say that no I didn't I never said I liked to signing I said that if he continues to have the years that he hadn't St Louis right right that will be MVP candidate\nA he was in St Louis I Want to hear you know I Wish we could ah you know go back in time and bring up that moment in the show when Jason ... came up I don't think he came up on our by the way you know it did it was all fair you sure I think it was all sorts of these conversations are off her know when the guy signs a hundred and eighty four million dollar contract to old we'll talk about it a lot of money\nThat's a lot 'cause I I I guarantee I didn't like that signing when it happened more goes into a if you're just looking at his traditional numbers like batting average home run ... with us\nYou're kind of late to the party with the civil metrics to look at the analytical look at things yeah I'm not by any of those analytical style it does make a difference defense look I'm at Chapman today yeah but he also what I what I also had no but I'm saying but it's the fitness elite that is a different guy I don't do or he could hit can't play defense can't play defense or right\nBut you know I mean as much as you go to the favorite metrics and you know they look he's wars one point six I think that kind of breaks it all down here that there's a Jason ... is a better player he's a he's kind of like Andrew McCutcheon in this sense he seems to age like prematurely\nJason here it's twenty nine years old isn't incredibly twenty nine years old and to be honest with you I think he just kind of is not quite the guy was like\nTwenty four he's like the desert Bryant the baseball\nBut you have great years like does but like he's the debts Brian baseball you have Andrew McCutcheon somehow the guy he's aged it happens how you know why they're not on the juice\nMaybe that's how you can determine who's on the juice who's not on the juice and baseball like guys who age like twenty nine years old you have to sit there going yeah no way he's on the Jews guys who get better at thirty seven thirty eight yeah I'm looking at you big Papi yeah I'm looking at you Barry bond yeah it's called juice\nNo question about it but the thing is like you know the old show mad narrative aren't we passed the whole point of Joe ... manager why do people still buy in the cubs\nYou know postseason every year when you look at baseball today with wild cards you look at their payroll you look at the names on that team they shouldn't be going to the postseason every year but the fact that they lost all home playoff game yesterday to the Colorado Rockies\nAnd like to me yes I you know home field advantage of baseball not that big a deal I get that\nLook in the Oakland A's for instance yoga Naser a much better team on the road than they are at home in terms of off and it's there to the best hitting team on the road and they lost on Monday to the brewers are some bright they lost the brewers on Monday so I mean they collapse down the stretch that is one year made Joe man\nAnd people seem to just give them a past all the time and it's because of the cool dude activities that white people seem to give a man that pass if Steen truly considers making a change that man driving a problem with that\nI think you know what if you're the cubs pie bringing children already things are better manager them Joe Madden he just doesn't get the same notoriety because the fact is just not as cool\nBut I just think that cool guy act where's that at some point and I think what Joe man that could be happening there what does he do with Chicago except the world series either ... you're like wow he's an exceptional job management team\nBut he didn't really do anything egregious and yesterday's game that would warn him being let go there was nothing like super like dumb or the second or you can second guess ... little things here and there and how he maybe he pinch it a little bit too early for for a player but nothing catastrophic\nThrough that you have\n... in our town so\nLow Google what did he not planned for today\nCan be found anywhere [noise]\nHow so natural areas outside to discover\nBlessed that come together to create it off or get them all in century\nIs the fourth or fifth one to one of the council and the U.S Forest Service so\nIs well I'm Glad you enjoyed it but I think it's that had back in\nTime I'm sure they'd be careful getting a\nI'm going to return the kayak\n... how about a factor\nHere needs are going to find a neighborhood or green thank you I Can't blame the U.S Forest Service\n\n[noise]\n\nMore and more so it's always\n\nThe only one that we are going to get it for suddenly these sports radio there's just something about postseason baseball for everybody out there all baseball so boring\nBaseball stinks it's an\nOld person game just the people at but here's the thing that we are getting ... kinda spoiled with here game one that actually wild card game was at Wrigley Field in Chicago this is a classic baseball fans game to American League wildcard game this is at Yankee Stadium classic baseball fans\nLike they know how to act right to know what they're doing\nAnd you got the rich folk of course behind home plate they're going to sit because for twelve hundred bucks a pop you might as well sit in a nice comfy cushion seat but you look around that stadium as you did Wrigley Field yesterday I mean everybody's standing the people it's like a concert people are standing throughout the game\nAnd it's just a different feel if you've never been to a playoff baseball you maybe you don't understand or maybe you need to put that on your bucket list\nYou'd never live and die with every pitch in a regular season game you do in the postseason where are you a guy walks in the regular season game and Europe to runs you don't really sweat\nBut in a post season game you absolutely sweat absolutely you sweat\nYou buy your fingernails with every pitch in a postseason baseball game there's just something different about it and you watch all the managers are managing and it's kind of interesting what how they're managing because now you have this whacking is of\nYou know the bullpen and are now you're starters and you're seeing it tonight let me Fran do Rodney who's been a closer do career comes into this fix betting Blake Trina and who's been in a closed the Oakland A's all fees and he's now we knew the sixth inning meaning who's going to be pitch in the night of Oakland gum back in this game\nIs over managing is this a new friend is it a fad is it over managing to the point where it's like come on it's not sustainable or he's going to start asking for bigger than you know twenty five men rosters can you do this ... man roster do you keep let skaters and that more pictures now because of the fact\nMean Tampa Bay this wasn't like you have abated at once or twice Tampa Bay was pretty much doing it every other time except what Blake snow was pitching actually I think they were doing it every time except in Blake's now is pitching Sergio robo had like a ton of starts this year yeah like twenty starts pretty rich Tony ... you know you want it\nThe ... the who pitched today in the first thing for the Oakland A's headache eight or nine starts this year they ...\nI don't think this is a trend that I think this is like the shift you know and the ship came into baseball it had been there Ted Williams in the fifties and stuff like that and it went away because whatever but then they came back you know just to let the hitters and only some teams would do it\nRight now it's like every lefty hitter you get a shift in it doesn't matter every team's doing it now they shipped to third base side for writing I never saw that\nUntil the last couple of years it was always a lefty guy\nI'm Glad there's equal opportunity here because I'm left handed I think it was really discriminatory but only left these were getting shifted out in their batting averages go out forty fifty points like Jason Gianni wants to start shifting and maybe that's when he got off the Jews went from like three forty two Seventy no joke\nChris Davis went from like two forty to one sixty\nMaybe yeah it might be shipped related just stunk but whatever but now you have this and it works Tampa Bay\nOne like eighty nine games or something this year\nWith a bunch of relievers they traded Chris Archer go at that point was there a best picture it's almost ... twenty four years old who's going to be the Cy Young award winner\nCame you know and just ran through everybody this year but the fact is Kevin Cash isn't going to change his stripes vary Kevin caches next you're going to be like I have my traditional five man rotation in surgery was just my my long guy no he's going to keep us going and why not you might as well keep it going\nSo is it over managing or is this more baseball I think that's the debate or we have that now like you said still analytics of well this guy does this and that and we can track every single hit ball and every swing and miss Sean ... now we're past even that and now it's such a radical things such as\nI start to relieve earning one\nAnd then I worked my way backwards in the game and that's starting pitcher is not going to give me three innings in the middle of the game\nAnd it's going to continue and the more and more teams are going to do it\nAs baseball goes on why not Tampa Bay if Tampa formed with that right of Tampa had lost a bunch of games with their strategy this year may be dies Tampa want a lot of games doing this and here's why\nIt's like this right emily's the jets against the browns as an example the jets dominated tier I tell her I absolutely dominated tire out tailor their fourteenth another tier I couldn't do squat you go to big or maybe\nIt was like well what's different story and Jamal Adams the jets they became I said well we weren't really prepared for Baker Mayfield we were prepared for Tyrone tell that's not an excuse 'cause usually very regardless but I kinda get it right you don't prepare for the backup quarterback you protect you prepare for the guy is going to start\nSo baseball it's like okay we have the film and we have all the stats what is there and judge do against this daughter that start everything's ready on computers right so if you're preparing for this pitcher now it's OK I'm going to prepare for a guy that's going to throw the one in in\nThe next time around and say somebody else the third time around and face a different picture it might for bats I may face for different pitchers which is not easy for it or to do\nRight and that's why this is not going to go away I mean we've seen it where in LA especially would kill for chill yeah he didn't say so on a third time around I Know hilarious so I mean this is just an ex evolution that but the other thing too you mentioned tier I tell her and the jets effects don't you pay defensive coordinator so to adjust\nTo the game you would think yeah you can adjust you may feel that we know what he does the playoff almost three years you know he does go above the D. C. and go to a lot Todd Bowles who's a defensive guy\nThat was an ally is atrocious\nTotally atrocious\nWant to you don't want to keep going to be a slam 'cause I Want to get to that [noise]\nYou know

tear down to rebuild this or I was just kind of go this is not anything what I expected that tamer I guess you on the other side of that one I think the giants have been pretty well disappointing uh\nI was expecting more on the same I was expecting that they would\nJust play better football especially on off and they just haven't been there or maybe this is because you like really is truly dog but you know ... they're squandering their sense of lines not great but it was better and maybe a couple of weeks without flowers\nThey'll really start to make the shift but that's not what I was I I wasn't expecting that out of the giants\nChat with Jason coal and about Thomas the bleacher port Huron going deep bench wars when NBC Sports radio I've been talking about this on my show and you can help me out here is Antonio Banderas invisible has slowed down to San Rafael forget he's actually on the team how do you go from putting up just seven politic seasons with the same quarter back to this you'll be nothing but at the point is happening\nWell because people are saying we don't want to let him beat us well you know if you want to try and beat us we're Jewish Schuster Smith I'm great great that's fine I mean it was okay but not the end and the tight and it's not going to hurt us right\nI mean just you know for a player but he's not going to hurt us so you know and you don't have a running back who's really going to kill us either so without bell to keep it ... what you get out the out of the Steelers\nThey don't have a ... year old woman game of ... it's been okay at times but not great\nConnor is not the same kind of receiving threats you know you can't come out and play 'em like his wide receiver so I think we're seeing what the real value of lobby on bell is I mean I Know a lot of people are like oh the cops I feel about\nIt is now like you got to remember is a special talent um he's maybe not special if he thinks he is\nBut he's a special talent at that position with his ability to both be right back and reflect shot at the wide receiver and that changes the way that the defense how supplied you're able to take Antonio Brown away 'cause look Antonio\nPretzel really really nice player but he's not Julio Jones\nRight he's not as big as human beings we're like he's going to either overpower he's going to run through you but he's a monster Antonio rather we only nice player\nUm it was a smaller receiver who if you rice him and you're careful not to let him go over the top you should be able to keep him under control you're not going to stop them completely but you're going to keep control\nJason ... you know through Fifteen stark ... nothing but just the guy\nHe puts a fly first touchdown passes sixty the game against now it is Tampa's deep and but he actually made some frogs right he actually looked like a competing quarterback is that the company out in your mind to ski or is it a case where that's just you know one great game and they'll keep kind of holding back the moments that you were not like\nYou know of course not I mean look he was awesome\nNo other way to put it was you know spectacular now\nIs that is awesome and about to step into upper echelon quarterback or the awesome you know me remembering when I was twenty five and twenty straight jumpers part you know like I kind of got hired by one dead\nEffort you know I Do recall that that um but that was it like that was all you have I don't I don't know um\nI like a lot of things about ... I think he's mentally tougher than I thought he was coming out like I thought he had a lot of Mark Sanchez yeah and he seems to be tougher than that\nAnd I'm more resilient but look it's four games into his second coach\nRight and the first coach was you know John Fox was nodding off on some guy so\nWe'll see if matinee is able to turn him into their do with him what\nJerk off and do that you know I Hope so [laughter] I mean I really do not know because I'm a ... that we need good quarterback so that's what it's like when we be as many as we can get\nSo that it did miss what you did these moment in six touchdown pass in the game Jason calls moment is twenty straight jumpers back in the day and of course al Bundy is for touchdowns for Paul ... so we now know exactly what you're Paul ... moment is that twenty say jumper chased\nYou'll never was a God I just ducked day you'll never do it again that's why\nNo I mean there was literally there was no she was shooting into the ocean sports are good I was a rubber others nerves North Hollywood park there right down to write down the street from the uh the library where her stature is right there I was God I was I'm Sorry about\nThat you are the men are buddy Jason coal NFL conversely George Jason appreciate the time as always go running as my friend ... documented Jason\nGreat catch up with a buddy Jason goal and a columnist for bleach report All right interesting if you look at the top of the quarterback list right now in terms of past rating in the NFL where those two quarterbacks to topple is having common\nThe shift to the NFL is completely explain exactly what I'm saying next door to dance what's been NBC Sports radio when the NBC Sports radio mobile apps\nOnly one radio station in central Wisconsin has with Dave Ramsey show\nRight here I Am Thirteen twenty W F a jar\n\nTakes a lot to get excited about it back but most\nCats they be twenty percent of the parts and accessory that's twenty percent outbreak twenty percent off oil bills or twenty percent off virtually anything you can fit inside the Ninety nine cent Napa reusable bags so Joe your buddies there's a back they just have to check out all the parts couple people that don't know\nParticipate in up to ... watch less minimum ... ...

H. R. dot com it's easy joining us let's get right to Institute is to\nLook up to a great quarter season so far but Bob you saw before two thousand Fifteen shoulder injury you're watching him so far this year have we gotten to see the old Andrew Luck is this the old guy\n[laughter] we we did this past week um where he was what forty of sixty two for a hundred and sixty four yards or something along those lines for touchdowns\nNo interceptions I thought the first three games he was kind of feeling his way through it or trying to integrate some of the the new um you know the new things that he's learned about how to pro football I'm twice he failed to be two hundred yards passing games two and three\nSo I didn't think he has a lot of shipping his ball especially against Philadelphia\nBut man last week against Houston even look like Andrew Luck\nWho absolutely carry this team to the playoffs or two thousand twelve Thirteen fourteen and he uh\nHe looked special and uh he's going to happen to be special if they're going to have any chance against doing Glen because right now they don't have Marlin Mac they don't have the Y. hill and they don't have jak oil there really are really found that the skill\nPosition spot do we expect him to keep getting stronger or is this kind of what he's going to be I mean why do we know medically in terms of that\nWell you know he said at the beginning of the season that it's gonna it's gonna be a a a long process and we've seen that you know the first first game against Cincinnati had good numbers but the average I think it was around six yards per pass attempt\nWhich is pretty miniscule and not at all like you know Andrew Luck like and uh you know the second and third games he was not\nTerribly good I'm the fourth game it was terrific I just think it's it's just going to be a matter of growing you know growing back into\nFeel uncomfortable uh with with the way he's throwing now and and get that arm strength back and I thought we saw we saw what we needed to see I thought against use them and the game that\nThey uh they could have won and\nBob it's been a half a week since his controversial fourth down calling overtime with what twenty seven or so seconds left what's been the reaction the fan base to that they like him being aggressive or was that just plain stupid\nWell in my mind it was just plain stupid but you know you know fans are you know and fans want you to go forward on fourth in forty seven at your own yard line right hand\nLove the idea of being aggressive my question would be if you wanted to win the game and you wanted to be so aggressive why not go forward on fourth and to have to use in twenty five or six minutes left in overtime\nThat was the time to be aggressive and go for it rather than having to visit Terry kick a field goal I mean there is a fence was absolutely gas\nAnd it wasn't a zero sum game where if you fail to score they're filter a pick up that fourth down you know they weren't going to go ahead when the game almost immediately I thought it was a ridiculous call and I know what Frank is thinking\nUh he uh even pointed out to me that a Doug Peterson there's some crazy stuff his rookie year\nTo try and change the culture and give give guys the idea that the coaches have complete faith and their ability to convert on those four thousand nobody's doing I just think ties are\nNot as bad as the loss and you know if somehow they end up\nIn a in a wildcard position and they they finish a half again out ah you know don't come crying to me I just thought that was a facility move 'em I thought it was unnecessarily aggressive and um you know they had a bad about ten point four percent chance of winning that game by\nGoing forward according to the analytic wow that's that's not good ah that's not good at math by the way I look\nAt it W T H R dot com columnist crab is make sure to fall back on Twitter at ... here going deep down towards the NBC Sports radio of course\nAt Fox roads lead stadium against the patriots coming up a massive win over the dolphins dominating performance for New England after the last uh Detroit as you mentioned coming in you know the culture very short handed the staff at the Y. Hilton who obviously you're gonna need to have if you're gonna try to win some games and have Angela continuous success I mean is it just a banged up thing or is this something that could linger for a while\nWell you know with him at the chest and I think uh I think it was a hamstring this team and it's like the year of the hamstring ... so it's been out all year the hamstring Marlin ... without\nAll year because of a hamstring they have no skill position and people you know they get Robert turban back after four game suspension for performance enhancing drugs\nAnd I think that will help a little bit but ah I just think they're set up for a for a beat down here in New England on Thursday um it's tough enough\nYou know you you play on Sunday and then you've got to travel for the Thursday game\nBut they're so depleted and they played in overtime game against Houston basically played five corners um you know I don't know how much they're going to have left to be honest I I just don't know how they're going to move the ball against against New England which\nBook they they go to a to every every year and then they rip off nine or ten wins a out of the next eleven or twelve games so uh I I think they're in a very very tough position coming in here on Thursday\nAnd rural quickly only about thirty seconds or so are the kinds of lines something new team to spend a lot of high draft picks on including quit Nelson says the real quick their performance is the first four games I think\nThe interior of the fence of one that's been fine uh the problem has been that after the ... has been out the entire season they don't have a right tackle that's been a revolving door so uh but the problem has been the edge rush hours has been a lot of pressure on Andrew Luck or throughout this early portion of\nThe seasons now you had Bob Kravitz W T H R dot com columnist or you know Fox boroughs Gillette Stadium Thursday night calls at the pages Bob boys appreciate inside my friend okay thank you\nHere's crab it's by the way not so popular in the Boston area because he's the one that broke the whole deflate gate story I Want to get it takes a look right here and this is why it's going to succeed regardless of the fact is that Armstrong ever comes back to what it was free shoulder injury in two thousand and Fifteen\nHere might be a Peyton Manning of this and he's a smart football player\nRight people talk about Andrew Luck and that he's a smart football player he was a smart football player at Stanford he was a smart football player advanced in high school he was a smart football player and he got through a call to make some bad throws any rookie would make\nI think the culture get a get absolutely slaughtered here I think the Colts do not stand much of a chance\nYou know you're talking about a team short handed on talent anyway uh the skill positions and now you talked about T Y held is not going to play ... not going to play I mean they're missing the bulk of their talent and you have to say to yourself ... you know who they're looking to get the football to\nGet out great your quarterback is if he has a lack of weapons it's going to be hard to move the football and he's got a lack of weapons going in there he's going into a gunfight with a knife and the opponent is the patriots the big ...\nCheck the big bad Tom Brady as a big badge let stadium good luck so I think you're going to see more or less kind of what you saw against the dolphins\nFrom the patriots I think they'll have their way in this game went the Colts and then also going to be good in New England and people are gonna stop worrying about Brady and they gotta stop worrying about the patriots in his fellow check losing his touch\nYou know what how many years have they had a stink or the game right usually it's the opener last year they get to a super when we forget gave one that got absolutely demolished by Kansas City demolished by Kansas City a couple of years back they got demolished by I\nWas at a was Arizona in the home opener knowing what it was like what's wrong with the patriots fan to go to the super bowl here and they're right it happens\nSo it's funny when people worry and I think I fell into this to what's wrong with the patriots my goodness that's the worst thing I've ever seen Tom Brady play Fifteen or thirty one for a hundred and fifty yards may come on that's not Tom Brady what's going on father time winning out\nAnd then he comes back and they destroyed the dolphins All right All right Sarah one stink of a game it happens\nI mean you can't really be perfect every game right unless you're the patriots of\nOh seven and it couldn't be perfect every game and sadly the game that couldn't be perfect and it was a Super Bowl\nBut it's really cold I I Do have to give the cold some credit here as much as I look at that team and I go man they lack talent at the skill positions\nI think they've done it right in the sense of building up that all sense of wind\nAnd here's an example of why Russell Wilson runs for his life on everything went when Russell Wilson says hike\nOr whatever the heck the cadences that he uses to get the ball I Do have got to be on a swivel 'cause he's not trust them as often of line when he like manning says hike I think he uses I think his hands shaking you know what it's like you remember in saving private Ryan\nWhere Tom Hanks captain Miller his hands just start shaking uncontrollably here and there remember that it's got to campus in his hands shaking in Tom size more ... you know sergeant ... looking at him and you're kind of realized people look at that he knows it's not a good it's a good thing it shows his nerves are afraid\nBut he like many you say hike and you know you're very flowers on the right although now it's wheeler me really that confident wheeler right they have that off into the language is just awful it's a bunch of turnstiles like a subway station like\nHe's got to be shaken by the expressions on his face every time he gets actor knocked to the turf and he's sitting up\nAnd you're like my goodness he looks like he wants to throw up you have to have it often divine that's capable right jak Prescott with an offensive line looked like an old pro actually wasn't all pro that Prescott with an offensive line that shaky just the guy\nAnd the coats had a terrible off and said why Andrew Luck why was luck banged up to lock was getting smacked around\nI don't care how big an athletic he isn't by the way you know people don't give Angela credit for his athleticism people get Andrew Luck ran a forty at the Columbine that was the exact same time as Cam Newton\nBullock is you know white and has that ridiculous looking beard he looks like a goat boy and you say to yourself no way the athletic right but he is\nSo he's getting naturally killed out there is getting hammered out there what do they do they drive Ryan Kelly center out of Alabama first round draft quitting Nelson a guard high in the first round sixth overall\nMeans it's not sexy picks when he dropped a center and a guard in the first round but you know what you need to it's a necessity when ... Martin showed up in Dallas there was an old pro first team or his first year that was the year they were just great and they open up all these running lanes in you know they were they're killing it\nSo I give credit to the cold where it's like All right we have to have some patients here and maybe we have to skimp on skill position players when it comes to draft unless we can hit with like ... around dies and late round guys but we have got to spend high quality picks\nOn the offensive line 'cause if you're going to have a hundred and twenty five million dollar quarterback and people get Angela is what twenty seven twenty eight years older than that but can play another ten plus years this league right if you can stay healthy if he can keep them up right\nSo a lot of colds going to get killed tomorrow in New England and they're an average team at best right now I Do give them that credit of building it from the line now\nThat people are gonna say it's not sexy but it's the right thing to do you have to do it you have to because if you can't keep your biggest investment healthy and protected to find the weapons I don't care how great your weapons are they're not going to find that one rex Ryan\nThe first two years he was head coach of the jets one year he beat the Patriot to the post season in New England the other year he beat the colds and Peyton Manning in the postseason\nAnd those guys looked average why because the jets brought pressure there blip thing from every angle Brady Manny didn't know where the next Blitzer is coming from\nDidn't matter what weapons they had I mean the Colts always had good weapons of course Reggie Wayne Marvin Harris and guys like that and I drink James I mean you know they always had great weapons but those weapons were useless in that game because when the quarterback doesn't have time is not protected or here's foot foot you know here's the footsteps constantly\nThey don't feel they have enough time to weigh those weapons get open to render them useless\nWhen the giants beat Tom Brady and not one but two Super Bowl Tom Brady was running for his life pretty much ... did not yet Randy Moss didn't matter what weapons the ad you know trying to find a weapon\nSo you have to buy Andrew Luck time natural luck a beach you if you have time I mean most NFL quarterbacks will beat you they feel comfortable in the pocket there in the NFL for crying out loud Andrew Luck the top quarterback\nSo coats look you know it might take a couple of years and you know what look signed for a long time again he's not old\nAnd a couple of years if they can now start concentrating on skilled position all players\nYou know when I got jak suppose grape as long as you actually go has played portals they're not going to be at least in the sense of every year you look at and say this is a team that is certainly going to the super bowl because Blake boils cable overthrowing for three interceptions it a playoff game and costing his team ball if he plays the jets defense every week maybe\nWe'll get into all here's here's the difference the jets they going to be in the postseason for ... fourteen or Fifteen is the first apps for two hundred yards amazing amazing\nI'm watching that going I like playing you know we always have a great experience\nTo Blake boils in Lake Tahoe every July right\nNot a good quarterback and anything like this year it was like Joe Montana\nI mean Tom Brady was looking at him going wow which I can play about level is unbelievable he could've met\nBy college football the salaries have been released by USA Today\nAre these guys actually worth this money for is this getting in St Louis one thing in common we have to talk about next forcing NBC\nSports radio [noise] for

Yankees Red Sox and why some ... it's great for baseball this year we have email tomorrow\n[noise] perfect place you're right right and he wanted you know for a while you were going to hit that grand slam in game seven\nAnd then he signs with the Yankees [laughter] unbelievable right took the money had to shave their the idiots right the idiots they call themselves is this what baseball needs this\nThey needed it in the championship round but I'm sure as heck betting that they needed it and then he round here's why Houston versus Cleveland Houston's intriguing Cleveland Cleveland okay\nOakland Red Sox\nFans to Oakland when you think of building a thirty one thousand seat stadium it tells you just don't think you know packet right opens not exactly a draw their the definition of a regional team outside the confines of the city of Oakland no one cares here's why giants fans dwarf up\nSo you get that against the red Sox or you get the Yankees against the red Sox the greatest rivalry in sport history with a ton of tradition and the bad blood from fourteen years ago yeah you need the storylines right\nYou're not just get get the pure baseball fans get to enjoy it but you

three thousand miles away to blame three different divisions she needed at least one of these match ups in the post season to be what we can call Markey\nYou don't get more and more key than a Yankee team against the red Sox team first time ever I think that both have fought over a hundred or more games that same here you got a jerk and I was a hundred and eight wins a jerk and I was a hundred wins that two hundred and sixty seven home runs on the season amazingly record\nI I Will also say that the Yankees are playing that house money\nAt this point why yes why\nBecause the red Sox are the better team won more games than the regular season a hundred and eight yep\nThere the favorites home field field yup\nYankees are going to be loose Lucy do see is it like to say because if they lose a serious no one's going to look at their season to say it was a big big failure they're supposed to lose your right but\nThey can't say it depends on how they lose now though can't get swept they can't get swamped right well I'll tell you what can't blow up at two o lead if they get one here's the interesting thing though if you think about this book at the match ups\nSo you're going to get Chris Sale who's velocity dip significantly is last star a lot of concerns ... right ... have been a Red Sox I say killer but he's always pitched well against the red Sox and his career\nDavid Price has to go game too in Boston you're not pitching David Price the Yankee Stadium David Price walks on at Yankee Stadium mount and he doesn't know what to do he used a ... he goes from being a guy who's one of the site young to being a guy who's going to get the hook into second or third inning\nBut David Price doesn't pitching well again the Yankees really ever\nSo of course still doesn't regained that velocity informing game one in the Yankees somehow take a moment Jay ... Tanaka goes game to against aid David Price against the Yankees they haven't price give up nine runs in three innings happened more than once\nI look I made the prediction last month to myself off of of course if the Yankees played the red Sox in the playoffs I ... I I liked the Yankees chances\nI I really do ups I Love the Yankees chance to just ...\nJust said you know we're still hasn't been the same right down the stretch it I don't even know if he's a hundred percent the average price has a lousy track record a Trojan is historically a bad track record in the postseason frantically happens is is a Red Sox killer so yeah I I liked I liked the Yankees fans\nNot only is price\nAtrocious in the postseason in fact he's ... he's the worst postseason starter in terms of one last\nBuddies atrocious the NCAA's uses a double whammy what do you think about David Price in the postseason if not crazy to think they weren't hypothetically speaking here obviously because anything can happen or hypothetically speaking here thinking that there's a chance the red Sox you'd be down old to go to Yankees stadium\nBecause of the fact the Yankees may have the advantage when it comes to the pitching match ups a healthy Chris tail is dominant right I'll be Griselda dominate the Yankees but we're not sure it's a healthy Chris still in the last ... shows that he may not be\nHere's the problem with this the series though as you mentioned that one it's the division series for the Yankees Red Sox two games want it to friday night\nAnd Saturday Night\nAre going to get the ... yeah that's a problem\nI got you know that's got to be a national TV I mean that's got to be on a national network right it's got to be on like Fox I don't like that they're putting the I mean he he's Red Sox can't be on cable [laughter] since ferocious can't be on cable but friday night Saturday Night\nWhat's a good college football games coming up seven thirty games eight o'clock game for there's something good right the west coast games whatever it is\nThat baseball has got a problem the problem is you know they're more key time of the year is\nA time where you have what you know college football's running wild data bells or jogging and about ratings ... for up ten percent when people now thinking that if I may where they back we'll see what ten percent up in ratings\nSo I mean major league baseball you know I'm telling you right now Dodgers Braves Rockies Milwaukee is not going to get big ratings\nCleveland Houston to not going to get big ratings and you mentioned the Yankees Red Sox based on where they're playing in terms of time days in a channel their only hope for big ratings they're not going to get him\nIn five that's their hope for big ratings mitigating five and you're getting five you're right so what are the first four games though I mean this is a showcase right there's just a showcase you have to showcase\nThe glove slapped with very tack this and that you got to showcase all that Don Zimmer getting pushed over by Pedro that's what you have\nTo do baseball has to play this up because it's their last hope for big ratings I mean you think about World Series match up right the hope for World Series match up some big ratings are Colorado know Milwaukee no Atlanta no they need the Dodgers\nIn the national league Cleveland the American league know Houston not really\nThe good news is but it's not because the exit Red Sox play each other right here's the one's going to be knocked out you get Yankees Red Sox against the Dodgers you have hope for decent World Series ratings no there would be great\nBut that's the only chance they have one of those two teams the jail the Dodgers have yet to be an all you got Colorado versus Cleveland you might as well played on public access television because no one's watching it outside of Cleveland and also Colorado\nStick it on your pay TV channel Tiger Woods Phil Mickelson those old losers shouldn't be back in this country the passport she'll be revoked from me not that that happened in France the Ryder Cup that'll get higher ratings more buys been Rockies versus Cleveland what a joke\nThat you have common McGregor there's the seven to ... against ... yeah and and you have Yankees Red Sox year of college football boxing fun weekend they will be but it's all going on in a sauce you got the Dodgers to the the during this somewhere we have to mention the Dodgers Nick Dodgers are playing Thursday and Saturday\nI guess they would be wow oh my goodness Thursday Friday Thursday Friday for the doctor side and Sunday what a fun weekend it's gonna be\nMan I Can't wait to get there are more major league baseball here we habits wild card games do they're done I Would change your thoughts on the wild card game do we like it do we not like it are you coming around

baseball insider several was at Yankee Stadium witnessing the seven to two New York Yankees win that\nDescribe the atmosphere and what it felt like being at Yankee Stadium which seemed to be an absolutely packed house\nRe crowd um it really is and I'm waiting\nTo get out of here [laughter] really [noise] um because you know I I drove this time I normally never drive but I had a funeral and I had to go from there right there so I drove through much information you need that uh but the idea that\nUm this crowd was electric it was it was it was a lot of fun but uh I thought it was kind of a clunker of the game and it's funny 'cause baseball's had four games if you count the two um typewriters baseball's had two really good nail biter and to conquer\nParents oh All right to work through\nYou know step I think a bit as baseball fan so we got a little spoiled and I said this earlier on the show I said\nYou have a classic loyal baseball\nLoving fan base that we got to see yesterday at Wrigley Field\nAnd the same thing is true for Yankee fans are Yankee Stadium and I think\nTo have those two atmospheres those two stadiums those two organizations\nHosting the games I kind of get spoiled that based you know if your baseball are like you or me I think we understand what that means maybe you know the peripheral fan doesn't get it but I thought it was cool to have fans at Wrigley fans a Yankee Stadium be the venue used by the way for both wild card games that\nYeah but I'm an artist started for some of the new part of the brewers have to go through this is Tony eleven and that there were parts at great place like what a great atmosphere and courts field that's one of my top three alternate ballpark so I'm looking forward to it it's very funny to aid arriving crowd though a land and the Dodgers [laughter]\nWe're we're going to see you know you got Miller Park and course park do this or Budweiser either one of those [laughter] those\nYou know I I don't remember I don't I don't remember I Would have to look I'm Miller Park is what I was at the opening of Miller Park when uh\nThe um or the bullet proof vest bounce the pitch right that was the game that was the game that led to the big story of Derek Jeter putting all that pressure on him to throw strike uh after nine eleven a buck Taylor park's great place to watch a game it's er it's really nice stadium and there was a force that I did not right but\nThat there was a great argument\nOn how the benefits of the public money that was spent on the retractable roof for Miller Park and how that help them and just look at this just stick the Chicago Cubs\nPlayed thirty games in thirty days not granted they had a day off and a double header but they played thirty games in thirty days because of rain outs\nThat Milwaukee didn't have to deal with because they have their tractable roof\nOur baseball instead of severed sitting in traffic outside of Yankee Stadium after witnessing the Yankees so that was going over and Oakland go into the city and driving for a while there are joining us going deep into words but NBC's portrayed it how important is it for baseball to have Yankees Red Sox first time they made the post season since the infamous old Ford matchups ask\n\n'em they're yeah they're they're they're excited about it I mean look box is very very happy because they are or CBS that get the\nUm you know they're they're very excited about it but you know the reality of it is I just don't like that that the litmus test for the sport you know I was talking to neck on the other side a just a second ago and he was saying like what how great with the ratings be if it's Yankees Dodgers in the world series right\nAnd he's absolutely right and he didn't say anything incorrect but why is baseball judged on whether or not it's Yankees Dodgers versus Indians\nRock [noise] everything is Rockies does that mean the sports struggling like\nThat [laughter] the thing no nobody in and basically you know what it is completely connected to the big market and they're right\nThere and this is something I did write about for Forbes because there was a statement in baseball I think fans to believe that baseball is still just keeping up with the Joneses that it's it's the big market it this versus the small market and like there are national shows today they called the brewers an upstart Cinderella\nThe Henry last record they had the best record in the national league what's upstart about\nNo but that's the problem you know I was talking ... but that's the problem right it doesn't matter who plays in a Super Bowl is becoming so little entity with the you know the half time matter of course the commercials are\nNBA Finals it's kind of similar it's just a matter of what stars it doesn't matter stars wearing a you know Oklahoma City Jersey or Cleveland Jersey is only ... Bronner to ramp people going to watch\nBaseball outside of a handful of teams is just a regional sport now in\nEven the stars I mean people do they really tune in to watch my trout they should\nBut you only get to watch them bat four times in his hands on his ... in the outfield a bunch of times right so I ate sadly become a regionalized sport and that's why I let you get the rare team like the cubs to the Yankees the Dodgers are the red Sox involved in the world series if you're lucky enough to get both of them that's how you been asked audience that I'm not saying it's right but that sadly what has become\nWell and and I was a big proponent of it when the red Sox are trying to break a curse\nAnd the same thing with the cubs like I was a very big proponent of like we have to get these teams into the fall classic because that will be great drama I wanted the cubs and the worst way no three of the bargain here\nAnd I remember that because I thought now what are the chances that you could break one of those curses what great drama\nBut you know people talk about the world series and we've seen classic World Series and I you know I did not call after his Dodgers last year a classic world Syria I thought it was a very good World Series but I thought it was not a classic we've seen classics before\nA two thousand on two thousand two that those were classic World Series\nAnd at the time but it was angel giants I never was thinking about market size the way you do now\nIt seems like now for the sport considering the fact that they were under Seventy million for the first time since two thousand three they're counting on a big postseason for something to post and I think that's comical but they're boasting is going to be based on what teams make it\nAnd I want to see objectivity I've often that the MBA doesn't care or walk is playing Denver like they\nDon't care about it and yet in the same situation I Want baseball\nTo to to be proud of its product and it's the best World Series out there happens to be the Cleveland Indians versus the Milwaukee Brewers I Want them to be fine with it I don't think they are\nI got to bring showing on here real quick ... are you thinking here that says now advocating to add a half hour or two is already agreed upon our of what's wrong with baseball with this to me I\nMy teacher didn't have the life we needed to make our collages\nWhat if I never got the chance\nUnfortunately that's the reality our teachers face every day they're forced to spend their own money sometimes just to keep it cost him running\nWith the book for students to donate one million dollar donors choose our\nAttorney that help teachers get what they need to bring learning to live for students\nDonors dot org has held more than seven hundred thousands and probably been benefiting more than ...\nIt's an idea that changing world\n[noise]\n\nYou can always catch up on the job\nIs there a three day in court for them to be

irks me I'll say what that is set up Fifteen minutes\nBut we do have to throw a personal bath we have to call out those reserves recalled out we do so right now we're yourself\n[noise] because nobody is going to\nBe paid [noise]\nAll right [noise]\nWrite this I have to do to the poor Miami Heat\nMy personal ... goes to heat here's why\nNew word coming out in the NBA that they are trying to get the Minnesota general to take care of by trade offer for Jimmy Butler they've been talking for two weeks [noise]\nNot gotten close to make it a trade people think Tom vivid always putting the price so high that no one's going to\nAccept it so butler stays with that right [noise]\nFor you or Miami\nWhy do you want you to be butler\nJimmy Butler is not exactly a good teammate we've not realize this considering he's now exit two places or will be exiting his second place\nRight to exit from Chicago wasn't pretty distracted from Minnesota obviously is not pretty\nYou know Miami is going to be a team that's going to have young players dribble apparently isn't a fan of young players that Carl Anthony towns and ask a you know Andrew weakens about that [noise]\nHe's also going to be a free agent that's going to command a hundred and Ninety million dollars over like five years he's like a big financial backer door guys what twenty eight twenty nine years old\nI'm giving you the reason why you don't want anybody here's another one\nBullet goes to Minnesota they already had Andrew weekends they already had currently at these out to be making that much better\nKnown right do they even one fifty games only forty eight games [noise]\nI just think you're barking up the wrong tree getting all hot and heavy for Jimmy bowler here Miami I just don't think he's dead difference maker and he made that you need you know rebuild\nPutting Julie Bollywood that Ninety year old Dwayne wade is your isn't gonna make you a better game where you're actually going to compete for even the eastern conference it's a waste of your time\nSo the deal that ... apparently once it was like Josh Richardson bam out a bio or first round pick next year [noise]\nI mean I I just think from Miami sake\nLike every other team that has expressed interest in you know than a year he's gonna be a free agent anyway Miami's not a Jimmy Butler this year away from winning anything\nKeep the assets keep your draft pick and weight back what Miami's will be my personal fouls forgetting all hot and heavy for all people Julie butler I Hope they do get them to get them because\nI think Miami being competitive in the east would be ought to fund Dan my personal fouls goes to Nick Saban\nThey one fifty six fourteen this past Saturday over Louisiana Lafayette but Nick\nAt his press conference was unhappy with the students section because both a lot of the Boston didn't show up altogether [noise]\nThis is what he said quote I can honestly say I was a little disappointed there weren't more students at the last game end quote he goes on I think we're trying to address that I don't think they're entitled to anything either me personally I think it ought to be first come first served\nAnd then a Thomas Fletcher\nWho's the wrong snapper he goes on Twitter with curb streets and you got all of this and it was a a shot of the Penn State wide out yeah he he treated must be nice to have people come to your home games [laughter]\nOuch here's why I throw a personal felt how about scheduling and look they do schedule some tough opponents but what do you want to squeeze in Lafayette\nNick your team is so great diseases might be the best team nicknamed added Alabama ... going to say it is a major wanted it for national championships\nIt's these students are smart enough to get better at getting up that Louisiana Lafayette sorry wake them up\nIt's more interesting games\nHere's the funny thing I don't know I Want to go into your living at half time anyway here's the funny thing Sean they're formed more home games the rest of the way voice probably or Vanderbilt no show up against Missouri which he wants to walk I guess they don't care\nI Mississippi State okay there there were ranked\nThe Dell boy and then of course is short for all that but you can't get a ticket for that the Auburn social fault you know I think that you can't get a ticket for that one that would be hard to get but still it did amazing like I mean you can't force students to have to go to every game that is\nNot that was next stop stop but here's the other problem does she eat these ridiculous with this but here's the other problem\nThe best out of conference game they play\nIt's never at home it's always going to be a neutral site\nElse you know a little bowl Noel shooting is holding them they don't know what I'm saying that the best out of conference game that there were so the seas with him and they played Michigan in Dallas right\nBlue oval Florida State\nThose games are never going to be in Tuscaloosa to start the year\nRight and you know what programs probably don't want to play\nAlabama school so they're probably hard to schedule home and um I I don't think the big tens of schedule one on one album anytime soon oh they have in the past but not in the Nick Saban era I I Do know\nCan we think of\nA team or something to do that\nYes [noise]\nYeah I Can't I Can't think of a potential that schedule home and I'm In Alabama to Penn State but that was when I was a long time ago yeah that was a long time ago no I don't I don't I don't see it would be great if you had that my crossover conferences like that like are mandated\nThey tried to do that with the Big Ten pac twelve they actually agreed to it where every Big Ten to Yuma play every ... every year at a conference but then they bring in college basketball right in the ACC like Big Ten twenty no uh tournaments and all that the challenges will be great to design college at night conference game that he said I might\nTake that first of all that bother you mentioned ... statement\nAt the top list the highest paid coaches I'll tell you what's wrong with that list next day it was an NBC Sports radio\n[noise]

then the college football fan that says he has no problem\nBut I got a ... I I Love college football I tell you Saturdays or Sundays but I Do have a problem when I see state schools paying their coaches exorbitant sums of money when the tuition is that the schools go through the roof and these players that they recruit not all of them go the NFL all Nick statements kids at least get a shot at the NFL\nIs free labor it's free labor labor so college football just making money hand over fist and mainly college football in college but I guess college basketball to signal to pave the way they don't have to pay their employees amazing\nYou know right exactly [laughter] so you're a boss when you're paying the marriage or the restaurant nobody else\nI mean it's ridiculous\nAnd credible right that's what it is the problem is the money from is not a problem but if they get so much money from these TV deals [noise]\nA college football as what would I I wanted to is there a sports bubble is is there a college football bubble would burst soon no no why would the whining ratings were these are declining everywhere a time where you are but a tendency to the major schools now or ... well I was always going\nA poll find bumps said something and she said the there's a lot of no shows at the Alabama football games that sounded like that but I bet you are you in ten years ago I think the tickets are sold people losing interest though can you believe that people losing interest because they're winning too much is that amazed when all across the country though I attendance is and what it was\nA Penn State now put the Penn State now um [noise] there was a game on a cousin comes to Syracuse for no Syracuse team a team that beat comes from last year yeah so it's an opponent you would take seriously\nThey're empty seats at the surprise seats in the course but I Wonder is that because it could've been sold out but there was just right but also you wonder is it\nI mean I don't know how much these college they're making kids pay for tickets for the kids should never have to pay for tickets to go but they do they pay you gotta pay Michigan and that they always have but I I find that to be just terrible like you're a student at that school and the kids would you sell them\nAs soon as would sell them and make some money\nWell but they they did away with that at Michigan with\nBut here's how you can cheat right but here's how you change that I have to have your ID I knew what when I got a ... huge you you didn't have to pay for tickets obvious not Michigan where it's like the demand drives stay with the demand that I never see obviously bought you just walked up to the stadium with your ID and you got it\nSo the fact is sure like if you want to get tickets should be free for students right but they shouldn't be able to get it in advance or should we first started I got to have you give it to them they have peeled outlets intense\nI hate that they coached the cave ill or whatever and Duke they hang out there for like weeks you know why I don't want these people hanging out at ten for a week\nSean but if you're like sanitary kids are paying fifty thousand dollars to go to the school the football tickets in basketball ticket should be part of the deal does he feel yeah but that's part of the deal that if you're a booster a parent you should pay for your ticket\nBut a kid with a student ID has no business being charged for a ticket I think it's orderly outrageous and wrong\nBut these universities that are already getting an arm and a leg from parents and kids will charge them to go support the football program or the basketball program shame on these money grabbing greedy administration is that these universities that charge for this nonsense it shouldn't be should be free to the kids\nAll right fine but then you're going to have people pitching tents fine who wants that it's so that's so boring\n[laughter] it's it's just so I I I remember being a noxious\nRemember being a poor college kid [laughter] yeah right now I remember I probably three dollars my bank account so I'd have tend to take out ten from the ATM right because you can't take out seven\nBrides for like for instance I have a Lebanese they got they have a dial up and down and it's like honestly imagine having to buy tickets to to go to the games\nTo watch your white you could sell them yeah well yeah but how would you want to go see the game while he can't anymore but [laughter] right but but you're right you're right that that's a problem but I I just think the salaries outrage but here's the thing to\nSay but you could easily say they point three million he's worth being the highest paid college football coach and the land I mean it's not even an argument urban Meyer number to not even\nThe sports ball sports ball's gonna burst there's a sports bubble that\nNow with the amount of money just bringing in going to have to start paying these kids\nAll right well that's when the bubble I Want some saying there's a level that right and and so that's part of it and also cable\nIs going the way of the ... it's just going away in in ten Fifteen Years won't be cable TV\n[noise] what was your yeah maybe years the one that that I don't agree with the ratings are declining then\nYeah but here's where I don't agree with you we saw recently a couple of weeks ago remember the amount of money revenue in profits as the top college football programs and Texas Tech was number twenty five I think he made like forty million bucks profit or thirty one million dollars in profit\nIf you're paid the kids and you have to pay walk on to pay the scholarship catch right ten thousand bucks each that's eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars honestly it's a pittance of the total that the most book the schools like Ohio University schools that are the mid major or if you\nPay the college football kids you got to pay the college basketball kids the men's and women's teams you have you got to be fair you got to have to pay the whole I thought it program so to me more than a hundred and fifty thousand dollars [noise]\nOkay but I'm saying out of the football budget that's what it's going to be\nI don't think it's going to be a bubble where they're going to stop paying these coaches somebody's would always want to paint Nick Saban no top dollar no ... well top dollar be like five million instead of eight million\nHere's what a difference will be no bubble yeah but I don't think it affected ... urban Meyer\nSchools will go either way to make sure they could bring that guy in and pay him the bubble will be when Scott Frost moves or the bubble will be when you know one of those types of coaches are younger like hockey coach instead of starting off it like\nThat Kirby Smart started off like six million bucks or five million bucks that won't happen the starting salary won't be that high starting salary will be a million and a half\nDollars but can Michigan truly justified Jim harbor what seven and a half million\nA third what two third places in fourth place finish in the Big Ten correct I mean one in five against Michigan State in Ohio State is he\nOut of the top five guys and take the first two out 'cause they deserve to be wanting to say but an urban Meyer which of these guys doesn't deserve to be where they are hard bought three jumbo Fisher for ... five\nI think it's got to be horrible it's horrible yeah of course well GMOs has won a championship or state I Believe got smells on he was the O. C. when they won yes he's also camp Newt and he's also recruiting months and he went to another one right as a coach he he went to that you went to the ice the championship game last year\nNo I mean national championship owe\nYou one one no no I Want to see those see with our gene shit like rice yeah\nThen he went to a game I think yeah yeah and then you went to one last to Oregon or no no no no\nNo they didn't want Oregon get new ... like yeah and they went to another one I thought they went to\nThe last one yeah\nBut here's the thing he's yeah I heard was the guy and then also honestly number eight ... at Florida six point oh seven when something I mean we know what he won enough games of Mississippi State that's Mississippi State when eight games people love you\nBut the Mormons make them on the highest paid coach Tom ... said coach Scott for us the ten times the coach\nI think it's ridiculous to these schools are paying just through the you know there will be above all those types of coaches that will suffer with the bubble yep the top of the top somebody always find a way to\nPay that okay you got smells on was the coach and the BCS national championship game last the Florida State that's it yeah does your bill Fisher yeah\nThere yeah that's right and Jim is where is that Jim is\nWasn't Janice what was it was an EJ so yeah it's yeah\nThey have it if you get James on the national championship we do forget that well 'cause there's someone else there's so much more to remember about his college life than winning a national championship sadly All right we're

[noise]\nSo now the American league division series is that we already at the national league divisional series that major league baseball's post season is in full swing Scott that broke here with you it's overtime on NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com\nThe wild card game and the American league featured the hulk when they used against the New York Yankees teams that are no one for hitting home runs the Oakland A's\nAny more home runs on the road than any team in major league baseball this season the Yankees hitting more home\nRuns deep in major league baseball doesn't matter where they play an early on the decision by Bob Melvin to go with an opener\nIn this game instead of starting pitcher\nWell you would find out right away whether or not that division would pay off Andrew McCutcheon the lead off better for the New York Yankees he walked and then the second battle of the game well that was one Aaron Judge\n\nThere's going to want the judge [noise]\nNo the call the Yankees' radio network judge taking medium Hendricks deep in the first inning\nAnd the Yankees took a quick to nothing lead now the eighties pitching staff kind of settled down after that in and what I mean pitching staff I mean bullpen guys because that's exactly what they did it was bullpen guys a tribunal comes in and gives them three innings and he was stellar\nAnd he is just such as started reliever all those guys on the age where all stood relievers Trevino gives them three solid name's Kelly gave them one solid inning then Fernando Rodney\nAnd this is where the game got out of hand sixth inning Fernando Rodney comes in\nHe does didn't register and out he does not register in out\nPut two guys on Blake trying an enters the game and frightening who is probably this season the seasons most dominant closer and he already of below one\nAnd what happens you got the you know\nLoop void of all people loop point\nA guy who was basically a throwing in the trade for ... from the cardinals\nLoop point did this\nWill be a free to [noise]\nGoing on right\nOn the other try\nNot\nAgain the calling the Yankees' radio network he would score on a sec fly a plane it'll get reviewed but then upheld Yankees kicking six nothing lead and just by Chris Davis to run home run in the eighth was not enough\nJohn Carlos ... with a towering home on the bottom of the A's and the Yankees when it seven to two\nAnd this is the decision that's going to be second guessed\nAll off season for open these fans should they have gone with a starter instead of trying to do a bullpen game maybe a starter gets out of the first inning without allowing at you on hold on Darren judge but then again there and judge ... home runs off very body\nYankees were just too deep of a line up for this ... team and I don't want to take anything away from what the A's did this entire season 'cause they had an incredible\nWho would've thought that the ... the fourth best record in major league baseball they started the season with the lowest payroll they finish the year with the twenty eighth payroll what Bob delving did he deserves to be manager of the year and the American league\nAnd yet an injury to show 'em and I asked that he's not available and you you could have gone with Edwin Jackson or Mike fires Trevor Cahill but instead he went with the strength of esteem\nBetween Hendricks Trevino trying in Rodney Familia these are all guys that could be closures on every other team in major league baseball\nAnd so he felt if I can get the out from these guys that's my best chance don't want to throw a fly ball pitcher and Mike fires at Yankee Stadium against the team at the home runs\nI'd rather take my chances with these bullpen guys coming in they're throwing a hundred miles per hour and never giving the Yankees assemble little look at it on the picture but it backfired because as you start multiple guys or as you asked multiple guys to come to the game\nAnd the the percentages change\nWants to talk about analytics right well what's the odds that five guys are getting all throw perfect endings\nOr what's the odds that one guy is going to throw five perfect endings\nThat I'd have to do something to crunch but Luis ... did not allow it hit through four innings for the New York Yankees\nIn that debate who should start for New York well Seventy came out and prove the Arab boon to be the smartest man in the room because despite a couple of walks he was\nOn edible didn't give up I Know it's been four innings and the way that he exited that game this was the big moment because I thought that he was done after four weeks\nThe announcers thought that he was done after ... I think that Severino thought he was done it before ... based on the way that he celebrated getting out of that fourth\nHe comes into the hip gives up it puts a couple of guys on base Aaron Boone turns to do in protests and protest is who usually is not comfortable coming in with runners on base you'd rather start pretenses would they cleaning\nHe was very impressive very impressive lights out performance Yankees then moved down the line with their relievers David Robertson with lights out jak Britain continue to struggle she's the one that gave up the whole month of Chris Davis and then shot and got them in the ninth\nAnd here's this Yankee team as healthy as they've been all year\nNow ready to face the Boston Red Sox and I think that this is a bad match up for Boston I really do\nThis Yankee line up one through nine is as deep all line up as you will find in major league baseball with the addition of McCutcheon and loopholes voice yeah look voice\nHey however is\nSeven usually [noise]\nEven John throwing didn't know what was going on [noise]\nGot better guaranteed overtime and NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com Yankees beat the seven do and now the division series is set\nFor the first time since two thousand and four the famous or infamous depending on which side you were on comeback by the red Sox in which they traveled three oh in that AL CBS and came back\nTo give me the first time the Yankees Red Sox are playing in the postseason series since that moment Yankee manager Aaron Boone first on the victory over the A's\n\nChevy set the tone and really came out on a mission and I thought he threw the ball so well I'm\nCredit to the age though they made a tough on them and they battled him and he was able to make some big pitches when he really needed to and then down when you know we want to do and for that part of the order\nAnd uh so I was willing to go to him is obviously as early as we were in for him to go through and get a six big ... big outs at that point and then we're able to add on which which was nice and\nUm yeah rolled out pretty well\nBob Melvin the A's manager on this loss\nAs far as the wild card game though yeah we've had a tough time with it and you know what they it's frustrating they got off to a good start obviously with the home run and you know then ended up bad non and we just didn't do enough offensively tonight you do have to give them credit they pitched really well what was the message here players well\nReal briefly for had come in here I told them you know and all it was a great season I was proud of them and hopefully this just to start for us so you know we were\nYou know we feel like with the group that we have here together that we're going to get better or each and every year and and unfortunately it's disappointing right now but due to keep their heads up how would you look back on this twenty teens season unless you live\nIt's disappointing so you know I think when you reflect back and look where we started the year you know kind of where we came from you know it ends up being a good year but it doesn't it doesn't feel good right now well Matt Chapman says that his team you know they should be proud of themselves\nObviously that's not how you want to go out and there's only one things can be happy at the end and [noise]\nUm [noise] I mean it's obviously\nThan when we were happy to be here but we wanted to win back into when sodas\nDisappointing but from you know come into the season where nobody counted on us and nobody has to do anything what we you know what you should be should be proud of and you know I'm proud of my teammates and probably be on this team and I think that's just the beginning for us\nYeah should be proud of what you accomplished this year tremendous season by\nThe Oakland A's All right Aaron Boone your Yankees will now take up take on the Boston Red Sox the rivalry you are very familiar with talk about that match up\nI think they can't wait and I think they're ready and relish the opportunity to go up against the game's best this year and obviously we're very familiar with them when we know how good they are\nYou know I mean we know we have to play are best for going to have a chance to beat him you know obviously they're they're very tough at Fenway but you know I think do you say the same for for them probably\nBut I Know our guys can't wait to get there and try and get it done\nAaron Judge got the scoring started with his to run home run in the first inning he talked about it after the game\n\nWas already got it from the national anthem on the other one of the crowd was I was on their feet on either Russia and the whole game is over\nOf the first one so\nYou know the first day you know cut it up there\nFantastic out that you know a couple of it isn't\nJust trying to do my job and how about the match up with the red Sox now they've got a great theme over there you know I've been down there whole line of business so they can do a lot of damage to their projects that was great you know sort of an overthrow of the same way we did all year and your home or you know celebrate than I\nFrom them all I Know you're ready to go\nYeah you can't really celebrate that much when you have a game on friday right how much celebrating ... really do you stay up late tonight and party and drink and have a great time and celebrate and\nThen what show up to the stadium and get ready and travel to Boston\nThe Yankees might be in better shape if they were to go home and\nTake it easy what do you think next go home and take it easier celebrate the victory easy take it easy\nYeah to get to celebrate the victory [laughter]\nEight five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six to do so

O. N. A. I. our ah our baseball insider ... will join us\nAbout ten minutes or so from now you know look at the national league series which are beginning here on Thursday you have the Braves and the Dodgers the Rockies and the brewers the brewers are going to do a bullpen game\nSort of like what we saw here from the Oakland A's I don't necessarily like that\nI didn't like it to the age so I got to be consistent and not like it for the brewers\nI just I don't but I can see you know why Craig councils doing it may be the rotation is not lined up right now and he feels more comfortable you know just keep in mind they had to play right they had to play the game one sixty three\nAnd now\nYou know as an ex well they had to play all these games at the window of his games for the end of the season so every game uh you know every game mattered but now they played the one sixty three and here they have a situation where ... cancel has decided who's going to start the game\nAnd you just you know who's going to start\nMaybe he could change his mind right before the game but it's going to be open it's gonna be a bullpen day and he hasn't decided which reliever it's going to open up yet maybe that's going to be to his advantage\nAs maybe there are players that are going to be on the Rockies that had been seen some of the relievers we'll we'll see how that plays out for the Milwaukee Brewers ... five or seven eastern time and then the Dodgers it's going to be a hundred review again stuff all the neighbors so that is a decent pitching match up\nYou know it's very interesting is that it's not Clinton gr Russia\nI mean it's not Clinton Herschel in game one hundred and ...\nIf they lose game one\nYou're going to be very thankful\nThat claim car shows on the mountain\nI guess let me jump out to a to a leading\nTalk a little more about women's earns over ... on NBC Sports radio [noise] what about\nCoverage of high school sports teams are right here I Am twenty WMA job was twenty four hour news and\nStation your NBC Sports radio updates now\nThe division series are now that major league baseball's postseason after the Yankees did beat at the age seven to the American legal wild card game Aaron Judge with a two run home run to the bottom of the first inning loop voice uh to run a triple in this game drunk calls to end a solo homerun ... as well the Yankees advanced and take on the Boston Red Sox\nIn the division series elsewhere cubs shortstop Addison Russell has been suspended forty games for violating the league's joint domestic violence policy the puck dropped on that's what the aging NHL season Wednesday night\nThe capitals raised their Stanley Cup better and then went on to route the Bruins seven nothing that goal end and it's just from Alex Ovechkin before the game capitals ringer Tom Wilson suspended twenty games for an illegal check during the preseason game last week John ...\nLeaves debuted drawn to Montreal on overtime three do cannot stop the famous five to ... with the sharks five to was well I'm Scott ... and that's just NBC Sports radio\nBut it takes a lot to get excited about it back\nBut most facts cats they do twenty percent of parts and accessories that's twenty percent operate past twenty percent off oil bills or twenty percent off virtually anything you can fit inside the Ninety nine cent never reusable bag\nSo tell your buddies there's a bag they just have to check you out of all the parts couple of people that snapping that well you know participating up out of our stores last ... last minimum ... supply hopper instead I'm thirty one Eighteen\nBought a day for tennis you ready to play a\nIs everything All right this past year electric dean knows that allergy congestion can get in a way of enjoying the moment to\nGo ahead and practice without me celebrity helps you breakthrough congestion ... non drowsy into histamine plus a powerful decongestant for twenty four hours of congestion free Morrow nice Ali how about another woman did you\nTalking to our baseball inside are set to read hear and overtime Scott's Eisenberg with you and be sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot Campbell now there's Yankee lineup which looks healthy even the first time in a long time we'll take on the Boston Red Sox in a match up or that we haven't seen since two thousand and four sets in the postseason\nWhen the red socks of course came back from three oh down to the beat the Yankees and the A. L. S. C. S. how does these two teams stack up against each other now that we've seen what the Yankees look like here in the postseason\nUh [noise]\nYou know I ... I think it's going to come down to fail and if you know if they fail can can manage his last name is not what it's normally a but can he pitches way through this and what kind of picture as David Price\nYou know everybody I again if you turn on sports radio and I thank you for pod cast so do not have to listen to it on my way with a ballpark but you know you you you hear a call and the first thing they say well well we got price because price campaigns against the Yankees\nAnd immediately and all I'm saying about the price and that could be dead wrong on this but for a guy that works as hard as he does a guy that as as smart as he is a guy that meticulous as he is he is going to just continually lay eggs against the theme is never going to pitch well\nI I I don't know I just think nothing's a sure thing and I think\nThe team that's going to have a lot of pressure is just the team that goes down one oh because if it happened to that fast\nAnd so game to to me is the game that you circle because it will whoever takes game one they will go for broke\nAnd that for the five game series is awesome and I think the five game series should never be extended I think the wild card should never be extended um trust me I have a list from a mile long of things I Am worried about for baseball but I'm telling you one thing I have never worried about the playoff structure the playoff system is perfect\nAnd how about this uh Jay have likely the opening of the first game starter for the New York Yankees\nA moody bets uh let's see JD Marta ... is ... or ... guards and uh who am I missing here is another big time Red Sox play that I saw this that they are combined Eighteen of one of those three versus tapping their careers\nYeah Frenchman or it's the post season and the reality of it is is that you know that's a light up that's a very good light up I Know their line up has not been a ... as belly\nWho'd as the Yankee lineup is and I understand that and I respect that but the fact of the matter is\nIs that you know this Red Sox team has a lot to prove so does it get Nikki team I don't think the fact that they eat either team won a hundred games means a whole heck of a lot I've said all along but if you took ten window away the analysis on both teams are still the same I just\nLooking forward to a good theory so I'm hoping it's a good series and I'm hoping that there's excellent drama that that that that would be the best thing just give me some drama and you know hopefully you get a classic you know Aaron Boone was a part of a classic I was at that game when Aaron Boone hit that home run with gravy little of a lot of people want to leave them out the United states\nAnd you know I remember those things and you know you've had classic series in you know ... people say on Twitter all the time like if something's a classic last year's World Series was not a classic\nIt was a good World Series but it was not a classic you'll know when you see a classic when something you can't take your eyes off of and you know ... again if you have games like you had last night at Wrigley Field you'll have that\nWhich National League series do you think will give us more drama\nWell I think brewers Rockies is great because I think both teams are built very similarly and uh I I'm very intrigued to see them because the Rockies or a better roads in this year than a home team and yet that ballpark but they have there is a whack a doodle place and you never know what's gonna happen there so\nI'm you know my attitude is always been a I think I think Rockies brewers could be really really compelling uh as far as the other theories and land and the Dodgers you too late arriving crowds empty seats the beginning all five games\nUm I I again to pick them because\nYou know you ... you look at the Dodgers and they say well they're a veteran team and they have veteran players and they've been there before and then you know they they they went to the world series and here this is Lana Braves team they start up team that is so over achieving\nThey have gone so far ahead of their rebuild and the fact of the matter is is that you know for the boss for the Atlanta Braves a lot of people wondered when the other shoe would fall and people who genuinely thought that the the Atlanta Braves we're going to drop off a pack they just never did the Phillies choked instead\nAnd so what Braves team are you going to see I think the question the two most questionable teams that are unpredictable our Cleveland and the Braves I have no idea what the Braves are going to bring to the table and you have no idea what Cleveland is simply for the reason that they are honestly\nA team that did not played one game they have not played an inning\nThat they absolutely needed yeah they showed up and they posted this entire year that they are going to have to flip a switch and I don't care if their battle tested I don't care that they went to the world series and sixteen that's hard a hundred and sixty two games is a grind and all they had to do ever will show up\nSo that they have in our baseball incentive joined him he's got a number of years overtime and NBC Sports or any on NBC Sports radio dot com wholesale changes in Baltimore Seth Showalter out GM ... get out\nYeah yeah it's a shame to really good guys and [noise]\nMy attitude has always been you know when you're dealing with those particular cats um you know buck Showalter is a baseball savant when the guy knows so much\nAnd uh he has been you know such a such a great ambassador for the sport\nI'm In all of his stops as as a manager got a chance to work with him a couple of times and he was just a wonderful person to know and a really really appreciate uh the relationship I had with him you know tend to cat is a really smart guy to um I thought Dan ... built a winner there\nAre that team that went in twenty four team to the post season was a kind of restoring the pride and oriole baseball and uh you know kind of\nFell off the wagon and you know they need to reinvent themselves but but the Orioles really want is to get into the modern day favor metric world they want they want to get into the model of you know let's figure out how we can\nUm you know join keep up with the Joneses so who's the next manager going to be\nHe's probably playing right now they want to have these young guys and they're going to bring in these analytic guys and and and it's going to be all statistics and that that's the trend of the sport\nJokes are already I listen to an interview he did it earlier today do you expect a Gerard each get a job this coming year\nI I really don't um and I'm a ... it's for the same reason um you know why would why would the cardinals are hired ... already when they can hire Brian shelter for a third of the money\nThere's a great article about night and you wrote in USA Today not today but he wrote in USA Today about the diminishing manager salaries\nAnd it's something that you know people don't talk about but it's a it's a reality because what you've seen now is if you're going to diminish the value of the manager\nYou're going to pay them a lot less\nAnd that's the trend credit counseling David Robertson toilet below in Arizona and uh you know ... Martinez in in Washington game capital or with a psychedelic a press conferences and you know all these guys they're great communicators the great with the media and they understand all those things\nYeah what they really are are conduit from the research department that research department has a lot of guys with computers\nYes it does except I appreciate the Simon inside I'm sure we'll be catching up as the post season progressed as\nWe shall see areas are baseball inside are set to every you follow him on Twitter at sets on their score every eight five five three two three four in BC it's eight five five three two three\nFour six due to what's serious do you think will provide the most of the drama as now we prepare for the division series in major league baseball's postseason I'm Scott that bird it's over time you're on NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com\nMcCaffrey the Carolina Panthers here and when I'm not scoring sessions and listen and NBC Sports radio\nThat Governor Joe Hi\n...

C. O. G. T. S. O. N. A. I. R.\nIt's week five in the NFL and it will begin on Thursday night when the patriots host the Indianapolis Colts enjoy them and returns to the patch\nI Know it's a short week which always hurts teams but it hurts the road teams more than the home teams\nThe pet's got right last week with a victory over the dolphins and welcome in the in the Indianapolis Colts we're still dealing with injuries and the office of line they aren't really that good of a football team to begin with this is the opportunity now for the patriots to get\nEven sharper as this season progresses funny\nOver the past several years if you were ... if you weren't going to get to the patriots you had to do it early\nAnd I started to think is this by design\nNow I Know that you're not going out there trying to lose and they're certainly not your you know bang ching players or you're not keeping guys on the sidelines\nBut\nDoes it seem that through the first quarter of the season bill bell checking the patriots treat it like an extended pre season because think about it\nWith all the restrictions that you have now in the NFL limiting practice time limiting the amount of contact you can have\nThe training camp preseason all that stuff you you just can't put it in the work that's necessary certainly not the work that Bill Belichick finds necessary\nAnd so maybe over the past couple of years he has evolved and he has pushed his programs if you will into the regular season and maybe\nHis teams just aren't ready until after that first month because they've struggled in the first month of seasons\nBut then they've gone on dominant and this could be another year like that where they have struggled in September but now we're into October and they will continue\nTo dominate gotta see it first is nice in theory gotta see at first but I mean look at the schedule\nPolitical cheer and then you have ten days to prepare for the Kansas City chiefs 'cause that's going to be a test\nGo on the road to face the bears an extremely talented defense\nBut I don't know how for real they are then you've got a game against the bills which as winnable\nGame against the Packers but at Fox borrow so that's a little different than going to limbo at the titans you get the face my rebel another students versus teacher match up\nAt the jets could be challenging at the bowl games against the jets might be challenging but you'll likely when both them at the very worst split then games against the Vikings dolphins Steelers heal this pet schedule is not exactly a cake walk\nRight so yeah it's a nice idea that now that they are through the grind of September\nThat they will all of a sudden kicked into high gear I just can't say that right now\nI can say that though when the division because they are the class of the AFC used those are the best team in that division but do they win the division at ten and six or do they win the division at eleven and five twelve and for\nI think Ken in six might be more likely because I could actually see for losses on that schedule you know if they lose let's say at the Steelers that's one loss and then maybe they lose at the titans\nVikings Packers bears\nChiefs could lose two of those remaining games maybe one against the jets maybe the other one against the dolphins in Miami I always have a hard time going in Miami\nAlways have a difficult time go to Miami\nSo yeah I think the patriots could be ten and six but you know what was the way those other teams are playing tendency ... this year\nAnd the pets can kick it into another level when they get to the postseason eight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six to chew Julian Edelman returns from his four game suspension\nOther players returning from their suspensions so how do they impact their teams Jimmy Smith returns to the Baltimore Ravens and so the defense that has already been a top five defense in the NFL to the first four weeks of the season now gets their number one quarterback\nBack quarterback back say that to non fasting that's a big improvement for their defense OK bond says perfect returns\nFor the Cincinnati

okay ... obsessively they are truly great Andy Reid I've been saying for years\nIs such an underrated coach when it comes to getting his team's prepared to play and that and having them\nExecute on all cylinders\nBut you cannot ignore his shortcomings come postseason time\nAnd that's what I Want to ask you as a chief span or are you concerned that this team could be headed towards another division title and double digit when season but under Andy Reid may fail in the postseason\nHay and my uh I've been into your ... or ... or before my kids um we went to the uh Pittsburgh game or two years ago with\nOut a Smith or when tiger's a a rookie um there's three throws he should've\nGave a shock to and I told my wife I was never buy a ticket for Alex and I love the opposite he's a great guy but are putting money down but this this kid [noise] um\nI we have a quarterback thing put\nThe team on the shoulders even with the shortcomings like you're saying um another thing I Want to measure Oakland okay I'm coming\nFrom Kansas City Missouri law a he is forty five minutes from his home town uh from my house I play gets his eyes but when I was younger I'm thirty seven long time ago but\nWhat do you think he's going to do in the draft this year yeah yes it's Missouri bought 'em off into the play and the college football game anymore and especially with the quarterback getting uh all the treatment like they get\nA ... it's pretty exciting but yes I think Patrick the homeless is going to benefit from that but I've never seen anybody do what he's doing right now\nNo you're right and and ... and he is a different type of quarterback than Amy Reid has had a in a long time with the arm ability that he has the running ability that he has\nAnd he's built for that team because you have guys like ... that can stretch the field and the homeless can throw the ball Seventy five yards where they flick them the rest so he's perfect for that offensive scheme and I appreciate the phone call Ryan as far as true lock is concerned he's an NFL caliber quarterback there's no doubt about that\nIt's just a matter of what the demand is going to be\nFor the quarterback position from the teams that are at the top of the draft and how high he goes\nBut I absolutely believe that drew lock will be playing on Sundays kids got NFL goods\nControllable Scott good size but there are a couple of guys that are performing right now the collegiate level where maybe it's not true lock as the number one quarterback taken\nJustin Herbert from Oregon is getting a lot of love he could very well be the top quarterback taken in the draft\nYou know had it seems feel about will Greer who's lighting up right now for West Virginia had teams feel about Jared stood amid Arbor shape Paterson she turns a good great season it mission\nSo it does allow quarterbacks um I don't really see a home runs slam dunk guy that's going to be the number one quarterback taken but drew locked right in the thick of things is right in that mix\nHe will absolutely be playing football on Sundays I I can tell you that much a five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six to ... before we get back into baseball\nThe any show season began on Wednesday I'm not sure a lot of people realized is that yeah\nThe regular season began here on Wednesday evening for games on the schedule highlighted by an NBC ESN game which I saw the Washington Capitals raised their Stanley Cup championship banner\nAnd put a hounding on the Boston Bruins seven nothing route of the birds they scored in the first they scored two goals and the first two minutes of the game\nCapitals obviously feeding off of of that energy right feeding off of of the energy first game for Todd Reardon who took over for buried trots\nHouse Ovechkin to have a goal and assess you had a guinea ... scored two goals TJ oh she had a goal and it's just as well and the Bruins were kind of just stunned right from the opening book drop\nRight ... scores when the four seconds twenty four seconds TJ oh she scored into the game\nAnd there was a moment here after the capitals scored their sevens\nGoal right Brad Marsh on took exception to the way that Lawrence Taylor was celebrating and so more Sean gets involved with el or who is not a fighter ours ours is a guy who does not fight\nIn ... took it to I mean he pounded him he got a couple of clean shots to the face to the side of the head Eller left the left the ice bloodied beaten\nIn ... after the game was was not happy he said he didn't like the weight that eh we're celebrated\nQuote his celebration wasn't necessary he took an NGO\nIn front of our bench and celebrated in a seven nothing game so I just let him know\nNow here's what I'm Wondering and\nAnd again I'm not trying to knock more Sean for doing this this is hockey that's what happens but there's more Sean do this\nIf let's say Tom Wilson was on the ice\nTom Wilson is the capitals you want to ... he's their enforcer and he was suspended before the game for twenty games for a vicious hit in the legal hitting a legal check in their preseason game on Sunday\nCapitals are certainly not happy about it capitols fans are certainly not happy about it I understand why the we did it like I Try to clean up the game try to send the message\nIs like that are going to be unacceptable\nIf Wilson was playing this game would marsh on have\nDone that because\nWell then you're facing some repercussions\nGet back the major league baseball we return eight five five three two three four six to do\nI'm Scott ... radio the radio\nThem going make is\nThat\nWhat you have a job you were NBC Sports radio ... now\nNow that major league baseball postseason after the Yankees did beat at the age seven to the American legal wild card game Aaron Judge with a two run home run to the bottom of the first inning loop voice to run a triple in this game drunk calls them for so little home run as well the Yankees advance to take on the Boston Red Sox\nIn the division series cells where a cubs shortstop Addison Russell has been suspended forty games for violating the league's joins domestic violence policy puck dropped on that's what the aging NHL season Wednesday night\nCapitals raised their Stanley Cup better and then went on to route the Bruins have nothing to do end and assist from Alex Ovechkin before the game capitals ringer Tom Wilson suspended twenty games run a legal ... during the preseason game last week\nJohn ... maple leaves debut Toronto be Montreal and overturned three do cannot stop the famous five to document the sharks five to was well I'm Scott ... is NBC Sports radio [noise]\nIt\nTakes a lot to get excited about it back but most cats they

to\nGo ahead and practice without me celebrity helps you breakthrough congestion Rudy combined to non drowsy anti histamine plus a powerful decongestant for twenty four hours of congestion free whoa night how about another when you go\nAnd yet an injury to show 'em and I asked he's not available you you could have gone with Edwin Jackson or Mike fires ... hill but instead he went with the strength of esteem\nBetween Hendricks Trevino trying Rodney familiar these are all guys that could be closures on every other team in major league baseball and so he felt if I can get the out from these guys that's my best chance\nDon't want to throw a fly ball pitcher and Mike fires at Yankee Stadium against the gym at the home runs\nI'd rather take my chances with these bullpen guys coming in they're throwing a hundred miles per hour and never giving the Yankees a similar to look at it on the picture but it backfired because as you start multiple guys or as you asked multiple guys to come to the game\nAnd the the percentages change everyone wants to talk about analytics right well what's the odds that five guys are getting all throw perfect innings\nOr what's the odds that one guy is going to throw five perfect endings\nThat I'd have to do you know that's something the crunch but Luis ... did not allow it hit through four innings for the New York Yankees in that debate who should start for New York well Seventy came out and prove that Aaron Boone to be the smartest man in the room because despite a couple of walks he was\nOn the animal and didn't give up ahead no hits before and things and the way the he exited that game this was the big moment because I thought that he was done after four weeks\nThe announcers thought that he was done after ... and I think that separate already done it before ... based on the way that he celebrated getting out of that fourth\nHe comes into the fifth gives up it puts a couple of guys on base Aaron Boone turns the dumb but dances and potentially this who usually is not comfortable coming in with runners on base you'd rather start pretenses would they cleaning\nHe was very impressive very impressive lights out performance Yankees then moved down the line with the relievers David Robertson was lights out that Britain continue their struggles he's the one that gave up the whole month of Chris Davis and then Chapman got them in the ninth\nAnd here's this Yankee team as healthy as they've been all year\nNow ready to face the Boston Red Sox and I think that this is a bad match up for Boston I really do\nThis Yankee line up one through nine is as deep all lined up as you will find in major league baseball with the addition of McCutcheon and loop voice yeah look voice\nThey can get you from multiple ways\nAnd how about the defense of replacement to Danny ... a guy that was acquired as a waiver deal in August because of the injury to Dee Dee gr gory as the shortstop decision he made a play of the day you\nKnow the I just had a lead so it wouldn't have mattered if it was a base hit but I mean you never know what happens but we're talking about a rocket based off the bat a semi in the ... airplane third leaps up and makes an incredible catch\nAnd that's something that the Yankees have now defensive replacements for late inning situations put Neal Walker at first put ... third\nI find it very difficult to find holes in this New York Yankees team and then you look at the match up here now with the red Sox and the division series\nDavid prices had his struggles with the Yankees and this year he's been pretty good is Chris ... healthy and a hundred percent and kept the red Sox after playing lights out ball\nAll season long a franchise record one hundred and eighty victories cruising through the last month or so of the season because their lead over the Yankees were so large and the American league east can they now flip the switch and going to do or die mode\nBecause there's something about these wild card teams advancing after they win the wild card game\nThe time these wild card teams I Know Yankees really wasn't there wasn't for them but to an extent because the A's were chasing them probably feel but these wild card teams at the end of the season\nOr playing for their playoff lives every when is that much more important because a loss and they might not make the post season\nAnd then you get to that wild card game and you're still in we don't go home mode so then you advance to a division series where you're allowed a little leeway because you could lose two games and the advance but coming out of that wild card game you've been playing with this winter I go home mentality for over a month now\nAnd that's ... there's no\nNo it's no surprise that we've seen wild card teams throughout the years go on the post season lots even go to the world series and one of\nEight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six to jokes and now that the

Epstein wronged by the way you were on the ... level the mayor when he gave them the damn money who have that bad of a season this year\nMy God what have you know the standards on Jason hey worked it out like not that bad of a season come on you to be serious\nBuilding is that we're going to get me well that's the whole point of the signing Andre the age of all it just feels like of course not for a hundred seven million dollar Yankee fan when judge was out for a month and a half and to make a difference where I feel\nYeah but not a hundred and eighty seven million dollars different\n... different so I mean Jason ... before Jason hey route one eighty seven when you get to use their money for I I'm Sorry Jason advocate for tax purposes I gave you three million more the guy hit two Seventy with eight home runs than fifty seven RBI that's what he does he's a two Seventy to eighty hitter\nThat's not a hundred and eighty four million dollar man no okay by the way you remember he did it when he started at home I just want to have you ever have in your hosting yes anytime you say anything like that Jason Hayward\nMember of your misconstrue and what I was saying I figured he continue to have the season he had his last year in St Louis to be worth it\nTo us that was the analytical looking at it through the spectrum\nI think you've kind of changes scope a little bit of that no you just don't remember the conversations we had the deciding back\nThen I didn't say that no I didn't I never said I like to signing I said that if he continues to have the years that he had in St Louis right right that it'd be VP candidate\nA he was in St Louis I Want to hear you know I Wish we could uh you know go back in time and bring up that moment in the show when Jason ... came up I don't think he came up on air but I don't know it did it was all fair you sure I think it was supposed to these conversations are all her\nKnow when the guy signs a hundred and eighty four million dollar contract and we'll we'll talk about it a lot of money that's a lot 'cause I I I guarantee I didn't like that signing when it added up with\nMore goes into it and you're just looking at his traditional numbers like batting average home run ... with us\nYou're kind of late to the party with the tip of metrics look analytical look at things yeah I'm not by themselves analytical style it does make a difference defense look I'm at Chapman today yeah but you also what I what I also had no but I'm saying but it's ... elite that different guy found do or he could hit can't play defense can't play defense right\nBut you know I mean as much as you go to the favorite metrics and you know they look he's wars one point six I think that kind of breaks it all down here that there's a Jason ... is a better player he's he's kinda like Andrew McCutcheon in this sense he seems to age like prematurely to Jason here it's twenty nine years old\nIsn't incredibly twenty nine years old and to be honest with you I think he just kind of is not quite the guy was like twenty four he's like the desert Bryant the baseball\nGreat years like dead but like he's the ... baseball you have Andrew McCutcheon somehow the guy he's aged it happens how you know why they're not on the juice\nMaybe that's how you can determine who's on the juice who's not on the Jews the baseball like guys who age like twenty nine years old you have to sit there going yeah no way he's on the Jews guy should get better at thirty seven thirty eight yeah I'm looking at you big Papi yeah I'm looking at you Barry Bonds yeah\nIt's called juice no question about it but the thing is like you know the whole show mad narrative aren't we passed the whole point of Joe manage this great manager why do people still buy in\nThe cubs should be making a postseason every year when you look at baseball today with wild cards you look at their payroll you look at the names on that team they shouldn't be going to the postseason every year for the fact is they lost all home playoff game yesterday\nTo the Colorado Rockies and I to me yes I you know home field advantage of baseball not that big a deal I get that\nLook in the Oakland A's for instance yoga Naser a much better team on the road than they are at home in terms of off and they're they're the best hitting team on the road and they lost on Monday to the brewers are some bright they lost the brewers on Monday so I mean they collapse down the stretch that is one year may Joe man\nAnd people seem to just give them a pass all the time and it's because of the cool dude activities that white people seem to give a man that pass it feel apps dean truly considers making a change that man driving a problem with that\nI think you know what if you're the cubs are bringing children already he's a better manager them Joe Madden he just doesn't get the same notoriety because the fact is just not as cool\nBut I just think that cool guy act where's that at some point and I think what Joe man that could be happening there what is he dealt with Chicago except the world series eater you're like wow you didn't exceptional job management team\nHe didn't really do anything egregious in yesterday's game that would warn\nHim being let go there was nothing like super like dumb or ... or you can second guess ... maybe a little things here and there and how he maybe he pinch it a little bit too early for for a player but nothing\nFeeding America and your local food bank and Feeding America\nMessage from being America handy I

everybody out there are baseball so boring\nBaseball stinks it's an old\nPerson game just the people at but here's the thing that we're getting kinda spoiled with here game one than actually wild card game was that Wrigley Field in Chicago it was a classic baseball fans gained two American League wildcard game this is at Yankee Stadium classic baseball fans like they know how to act right they know what they're doing\nAnd he got the rich folk of course behind home plate they're going to sit because for twelve hundred bucks a pop you might as well sit in a nice comfy cushion seat but you look around that stadium as you did Wrigley Field yesterday I mean everybody standing people it's like a concert people are standing throughout the game\nAnd it's just a different feel if you've never been to a playoff baseball you maybe you don't understand maybe need to put that on your bucket list\nYou'd never live and die with every pitch in a regular season game you do in the postseason guy walks in a regular season game in Europe to runs you don't really sweat\nBut in a post season game you absolutely sweat absolutely you sweat\nYou buy your fingernails with every pitch in a postseason baseball game there's just something different about it and you watch how the managers are managing and it's kind of interesting what how they're managing because now you have this ... of you know the bullpen are now you're starters and you're seeing it snow let me Fernando Rodney\nWho's been a closes all career comes into this fix setting Blake training who's been the closer the Oakland A's all season he's now we knew the sixth inning meaning who's going to be pitching in the ninth of Oakland gum back in this game\nIs over managing it's just a new friend is it a fad is it over and managing to the point where it's like come on it's not sustainable or he's going to start asking for bigger than you know twenty five men rosters can you do this with a twenty five man roster do you keep less hitters and that more pictures now because of the fact\nMean Tampa Bay this wasn't like yeah but they did it once or twice Tampa Bay was pretty much doing it every other time except what Blake snow was pitch and actually I think they were doing it every time except in Blake's now is pitching Sergio Romano had like a ton of starts this year he had like twenty starts but he gets Tony ... you know one thing\nWe can drink the Austin who pitched today in the first ending for the Oakland A's headache eight or nine starts this year they ...\n\nSwinging image Sean Penn now we're past even that but now it's such a radical things such as I start to relieve or knitting one and then I worked my way backwards in the game and that's starting pitcher is not going to give me three innings in the middle of the game yeah and it's going to continue and it was horrible and more teams are going to do it\nAs baseball goes on why not typically if tablet form with that right apparently I lost a bunch of games with the strategy this year may be dies Tampa want a lot of games doing that and here's why\nIt's like this right emily's the jets against the browns as an example the jets dominated Tyrone Taylor right absolutely dominated Tyrone tailor their fourteenth another tier I couldn't do squat you go to big or maybe it was like well what's different story and\nJamal Adams a jet faith became I said well we weren't really prepared for Baker may feel we were prepared for Tyrone tell that\nAbout an excuse 'cause usually very regardless but I kinda get it right you don't prepare for the backup quarterback you protect you prepare for the guy who's going to start\nSo baseball it's like okay we have the film and we have all the stats what is there and judge do against this starter that start everything's ready on computers right so if you're preparing for this pitcher now it's OK I'm going to prepare for a guy that's going to throw the one in in\nThe next time around and pay somebody else the third time around the pace of different ... it might have pets I may face for different pitchers which is not easy for it or to do\nRight and that's why this is not going to go away I mean we've seen it where in LA especially would kill for chill yeah hitting a face to wind up a third time around I Know hilarious so I mean this is just an ex evolution that but the other thing too you mentioned tier I tell her and the ... don't you pay defensive coordinators old too\nAdjusts game you would think yeah you can adjust you may feel that we know what he does the playoff almost three years you know he does go above the DC and go to Todd Bowles Tuesday defensive guy\nThat was an ally is from\nWant to keep going to face like I Want to get to that\nWhy you don't like to talk a little

H. R. dot com and Sandy joining us and let's get right to Institute is to\nLook up to a great quarter season so far but Bob you saw before two thousand Fifteen shoulder injury you're watching him so far this year have we gotten to see the old angel ... is this the old guy\n[laughter] we we did this past week um where he was what forty of sixty two for a hundred and sixty four yards or something along those lines for touchdowns\nNo interceptions I thought the first three games he was kind of feeling his way through it\nOr trying to integrate some of the the new uh you know the new things that he's learned about how to pro football I'm twice he failed to be two hundred yards passing games two and three\nSo I didn't think he has a lot of different his ball especially against Philadelphia but man last week against Houston even look like Andrew Luck\nWho absolutely carry this into the playoffs or two thousand twelve Thirteen fourteen and he uh\nHe looked special and a is going to have to be special if they're going to have any chance against going on because right now they don't have Marlin Mac they don't have the Y. hill and they don't have jak oil there really are really fed into the ah skilled position\nSpot do we expect him to keep getting stronger or is this kind of what he's going to be I mean what do we know medically in terms of that\nWell you know he said at the beginning of the season that it's gonna it's gonna be a a a long process and we've seen that you know the first first game against Cincinnati had good numbers but the average I think it was around six yards per pass attempt\nWhich is pretty miniscule and not at all like you know Andrew Luck like and uh you know the second and third games he was not terribly good I'm the fourth game he was terrific I just think it's\nIt's just going to be a matter of growing you know growing back and to feel uncomfortable uh with with the way he's throwing now and and get that arm strength back and I thought we saw\nWe saw what we needed to see I thought against use them and the game that they uh they could have one and they should have tied and they should not have lost but that's Frank Reichs doing\nGripe Bob it's been a half a week since his controversial fourth down calling overtime with what twenty seven or so seconds left what's been the reaction the fan base to that they like him being aggressive or was that just plain stupid\nWell in my mind it was just plain stupid uh but you know you know fans are\nYou know and fans want you to go forward on fourth in forty seven at your own yard line right hands love the idea of being aggressive my question would be if you wanted to win the game and you wanted to be so aggressive why not go for on fourth and to have to use in twenty five or six minutes left in overtime\nThat was the time to be aggressive and go for it rather than having to visit Terry kick\nA field goal I mean there is a fence was absolutely gas\nAnd it wasn't a zero sum game where if you fail to score they're filter a pick up that fourth down you know they weren't going to go ahead and win the game almost immediately I thought it was a ridiculous call and I know what Frank is thinking\nUh he uh even pointed out to me that a Doug Peterson\nDid some crazy stuff his rookie year\nTo try and change the culture and give give guys the idea that the coaches have complete faith and their ability to convert on those four thousand nobody's doing I just think it ties are\nNot as bad as the loss and you know if somehow they ended up in a in a wild card positions and\nThey they finish that half again out ah you know don't come crying to me I just thought that was a facility move\n'em I thought it was on necessarily aggressive and um you know they had a bad about ten point four percent chance of winning that game by going forward according to the analytic about that and that's not good ah that's not good map out the way I look at it\nW. T. H. R. dot com calmness Bob crab is make sure to fall by ... joining us here going deep to enforcement NBC Sports radio of course\nAnd Fox real joint stadium against the patriots coming up a massive win over the dolphins dominating performance for New England after the last to Detroit as you mentioned coming in you know the culture very short handed the staff at the Y. Hilton who obviously you're gonna need to have that you're gonna try to win some games and have Angela continuous success he's he I mean is it just a banged up thing or is this something that could linger for a while\nWell you know with him is the chess than that I think uh I think it was a hamstring this team and it's like the year of the hamstring ... Anthony ...\nAs they're not all year the hamstring Marlin ... without\nAll year because of a hamstring they have no skill position and people you know they get Robert turban back after a four game suspension for performance enhancing drugs\nAnd I think that will help a little bit but ah I just think they're set up for a for a beat down here in New England on Thursday um it's tough enough\nYou know you you play on Sunday and then you've got to travel for the Thursday game\nBut they're so depleted and they played in overtime game against Houston basically played five corners um\nYou know I don't know how much they're going to have left to be honest I I just don't know how they're going to move the ball\nAgainst against New England which yeah look they they go to and to every every year and then they rip off nine or ten wins a out of the next eleven or twelve games so uh I I think they're in a very very tough position coming in here on Thursday\nReal quickly only about thirty seconds or so are the kinds of lines something we seem to spend a lot of high draft picks on including quit Nelson says the real quick their performance is the first four games\nI think the interior of the offensive line it's been fine\nUh the problem has been that Anthony ... has been out the entire season they don't have a right tackle that's been a revolving door so uh the problem has been the edge rush hours have been a lot of pressure on Andrew Luck or throughout this early portion of the seasons\nThere you had Bob Kravitz W T H R dot com columnist or you know Fox boroughs led stadium Thursday night colds at the pages Bob boys appreciate the ends on my front okay thank you\nHis Kravitz by the way not so popular in the Boston area because he's the one that broke the whole deflate gate story I Want to get it takes a look right here and this is why it's going to succeed regardless of the fact is that Armstrong ever comes back to what it was free shoulder injury in two thousand and Fifteen\nHere my Peyton Manning of this and he's a smart football player\nRight people talk about Andrew Luck and that he's a smart football player he was a smart football player at Stanford he was a smart football player advanced in high school he was a smart football player and he got to call to make some bad throws the any rookie would make\nI think the culture get a get absolutely slaughtered here I think the Colts do not stand much of a chance you know you're talking about a team short handed on talented anyway at the skill positions and now you talked about the White House is not going to play the oil is not going to play I mean they're missing the bulk of their talent and he'd have to say to yourself ... you know who they're looking to get the football too\nGreat your quarterback is if he has a lack of weapons it's going to be hard to move the football and he's got a lack of weapons going in there\nHe's going into a gunfight with a knife and the opponent is the ...\nBill Bela ... the big bad Tom Brady at the big bad blood stadium good luck so I think you're going to see more or less kind of what you saw against the dolphins\nFrom the patriots I think they'll have their way in this game with the Colts and then also going to be good in New England in ... people going to stop worrying about Brady and stop worrying about the patriots in his fellow check losing his touch\nYou know what how many years have they had a stink or of the game right usually it's the opener last year they get to the super bowl we forget gave one they got absolutely demolished by Kansas City demolished by Kansas City I don't know a couple of years back they got demolished by I was at a\nWas in Arizona in the home opener knowing what it was like what's wrong with the patriots fan I go to the super bowl here and they write it happens\nSo it's funny when people worry and I think I fell into this year what's wrong with the patriots my goodness that's the worst game I've ever seen Tom Brady play Fifteen or thirty one for a hundred and fifty yards may come on that's not Tom Brady what's going on father time winning out\nAnd he comes back and they destroyed the dolphins alright alright Sarah one stink of a game it happens\nI mean he can't really be perfect every game right unless you're the patriots of\nOh seven and it couldn't be perfect every game and sadly the game they couldn't be perfect and it was a Super Bowl\nBut if you're the colds I I Do have to give the cold some credit here as much as I look at that team and I go man they lack talent at the skill positions\nI think they've done it right in the sense of building up that all sense of wind\nAnd here's an example of why Russell Wilson runs for his life on every single one Russell Wilson says hike or whatever the heck the cadences that he uses to get the ball to has got to be on a swivel 'cause he's not trust them as often of line\nWhen he like manning says hike I think he's I think his hands shaking you know what it's like you remember in saving private Ryan\nWhere Tom Hanks captain Miller his hand just start shaking uncontrollably here and there are a member that she had accomplished in his hand the shaking in Tom ... and you know sergeant or a vast is looking at him and you're kind of ... people look at that he knows not a good it's a good thing it shows his nerves afraid\nBut he like many you say hike and you know you're very flowers on the right although now it's wheeler me really that confident in wheeler right they have that all kinds of language is just awful it's a bunch of turnstiles like a subway station like\nHe's got shaken by the expressions on his face every time you get sacked or not to the turf and he's sitting up there like my goodness you like looks like he wants to throw up\nYou have to have an offensive line that's capable right jak Prescott with an offensive line looked like it all pro actually wasn't all pro that Prescott with an offensive line that shaky just the guy\nAnd the coats had a terrible off and said why Andrew Luck why was luck banged up because lawmakers getting smacked around I don't care how big an athletic he isn't by the way you know people don't give Andrew Luck credit for his athleticism people get Andrew Luck ran a forty at the combine that was the exact same time as Cam Newton\nBut walk is you know white and has that ridiculous looking beard he looks like a goat boy and you say to yourself no way the athletic right but he is\nSo he's getting naturally killed that there is getting hammered out there what do they do they have Ryan Kelly a center of Alabama first round draft quitting Nelson a guard high in the first round sixth overall\nMeans it's not sexy picks when he dropped a center and a guard in the first time but you know what you need to it's a necessity when sack Barton showed up in Dallas and it was an old pro first team or his first year that was the year they were just great and they open up all these running lanes in the you know they were they're killing it\nSo I give credit to the cold where it's like All right we have to have some patients here and maybe we have to skimp on skilled position players when it comes to draft unless we get hit with like mid round dies and late round guys but we have got to spend high quality picks\nOn the offensive line because if you're going to have a hundred and twenty five million dollar quarterback and people get Angela is what twenty seven twenty eight years older than that but can play another ten plus years this week right if you can stay healthy if he can he locked right so a lot of colds going to get killed tomorrow in New England\nAnd they're an average team of best right now I Do give them that credit of building it from the line now\nPeople are going to say it's not sexy but it's the right thing to do you have to do it to have to because if you can't keep your biggest investment healthy and protected to find the weapons I don't care how great your weapons are they're not going to find them when rex Ryan\nThe first two years he was had to go to the jets one year he beat the patriots the post season in New England the other he beat the colds and Peyton Manning in the post\nThe Annapolis and those guys looked average why because the jets brought pressure there blitz thing from every angle Brady Manny didn't know where the next Blitzer is coming from\nDidn't matter what weapons they had I mean the Colts always had good weapons of course Reggie Wayne Marvin Harris and guys like that Andrew and James being you know they always had great weapons but those weapons were useless in that game because when the quarterback doesn't have time is not protected or here's foot foot you know here's the footsteps constantly\nThey don't feel they have enough time to weigh those weapons get open to render the useless\nWhen the giants beat Tom Brady and not one but two Super Bowl Tom Brady was running for his life pretty much both Super Bowl ... map yet Randy Moss didn't matter what weapons he had he not trying to find a weapon\nSo you have to buy Andrew Luck time natural buckled beach you if you have time I mean most NFL quarterbacks will beat you they feel comfortable in the pocket there in the NFL for crying out loud bangs or look at the top quarterback\nSo told look you know it might take a couple of years and you know what look sign for a long time again he's not old\nAnd a couple of years if they can now start concentrating on skilled position players\nYou know when I go jak those grape is on Jacksonville has Blake Bordeaux as they're not going to be a leak in the sense of every year you look at and say this is a team that is certainly going to the super bowl because Blake boils cable for throwing for three intercepted a playoff game and costing his team ball a few plays the jets defense every week maybe a\n... year but here's here's the difference the jets ain't going to be in the postseason for ... fourteen or Fifteen is the first act for two hundred yards amazing amazing I'm watching that going\nI like play you know we always have a great experience to Blake ... than the lake Tahoe every July right\nNot a good quarterback\nThis year it was on Joe Montana\nAnd he thought he was looking at him going wow which I can play at that level it's unbelievable because met\nBy God football the salaries have been released by USA Today\nAre these guys actually worth is money for is this getting insane there's one thing in common we have to talk about ... meant forcing NBC Sports

any\nSucked it's terrible and he was a hell of a picture of Kevin round the Dodgers were the hell of a veteran one time in his career\nHad an anger management issue though there are also the red Sox yeah yeah yeah yeah painful awful but that's the beauty of Yankees Red Sox ... it's great for baseball this year we have email tomorrow\n[noise] replace your light right any one you know for the call yeah we'll get to that grand slam in game seven and any signs of the Yankees [laughter] unbelievable right took the money had to shave\nTheir the idiots right the idiots they call themselves is this what baseball needs\nYankees Red Sox they needed it in the championship around but I'm sure as heck betting that they needed it and then he round here's why Houston versus Cleveland Houston's intriguing Cleveland Cleveland okay\nOakland Red Sox\nFans do cling when you think of building a thirty one thousand feet stadium it tells you just don't think you know packet right opens not exactly a draw their the definition of a regional team outside the confines of the city of Oakland no one cares here's why giants fans dwarf up\nSo you get that against the red Sox or you get the Yankees against the red Sox the greatest rivalry in sport history with a ton of tradition and the bad blood from fourteen years ago yeah you need the storylines right\nYou're not just get don't get the pure baseball fans get to enjoy it but you got to play off the entire story line to get the peripheral fan involved there's no storyline with open in Boston right what's the story line not\nWhat's a storyline between Cleveland in Houston none you need Yankees Red Sox because that's it that's what it's all about\nColorado Milwaukee nothing outside of the action on the field right Dodgers Atlanta any sort of a rivalry there know that three thousand miles away to blame three different divisions so you need it at least one of these match ups in the postseason to be what we can call Markey\nYou don't get more and more ... than a Yankee team against the red Sox team first time ever I think that both have fought over a hundred or more games that same year you got a jerk and I was a hundred and eight wins a jerk and I was a hundred wins that two hundred and sixty seven home runs on the season a major league record\nI I Will also say that the Yankees are playing with house money\nAt this point why yes why\nBecause the red Sox are the better team won more games than the regular season a hundred and eight\nYep there the favorites home field field yup\nYankees are going to be loose Lucy do see is it like to say because if they lose a serious no one's going to look at their season to say it was a big big failure\nThey're supposed to lose your right but they can't lose it depends on how they lose now though gets swept they can't get swamped right well I'll tell you what can't blow a tool lead if they get one here's the interesting thing though if you think about this book at the match ups so you're going to get Christian Bale who wants to dip significantly as last\nStar a lot of concerns ... right ... have been a Red Sox I say killer but he's always pitched well against the red Sox and his career\nDavid Price has to go again to in Boston you're not pitching David Price the Yankee Stadium David Price walks on at Yankee Stadium mount and he doesn't know what to do he is a ... he goes from being a guy who's one of the site young to being a guy who's going to get the hook into second or third inning\nBut David Price doesn't pitching well against the Yankees really ever\nSo of course failed doesn't regained that velocity informing game one in the Yankees somehow take a moment Jay app to knock those game to against aid David Price against the Yankees them apprised of nine runs in three innings it's happened more than once I look\nI made the prediction last month to myself off of of course if the Yankees play the red Sox in the playoffs I I I liked the Yankees chances\nI I really do ups I Love the Yankees chance against our socks\nYou just said yeah of course there hasn't been the same right down the stretch it I don't even know if he's a hundred percent the average price has a lousy track record atrocious historically a bad track record in the postseason frantically happens is is a Red Sox killer so yeah I I liked I liked the Yankees chance\nNot only is price\nAtrocious in the postseason in fact he's ... he's the worst postseason starter in terms of one last\nBuddies atrocious the NCAA's uses a double whammy what do you think about David Price in the postseason it's not crazy to think they weren't hypothetically speaking here obviously because anything can happen or hypothetically speaking here thinking that there's a chance the red Sox you'd be down old to go to Yankees stadium\nBecause of the fact the Yankees may have the advantage when it comes to the pitching match ups a healthy Chris Taylor dominant right I'll be Chris sales dominate the Yankees but we're not sure how the ... the last ... shows that he may not be\nHere's the problem with this the series though\nAs you mentioned that one it's the division series for the Yankees Red Sox two games want it to friday night\nAnd Saturday Night\nTo get around yeah that's a problem\nI got you know that's got to be on national TV I mean that's got to be on a national network right it's got to be on like Fox I don't like that they're putting the I mean he's Red Sox can't be on cable [laughter] since ferocious can't be on cable but friday night so\nWhat's a good college football games coming up seven thirty games eight o'clock game for there's something good right the west coast games whatever it is\nThat baseball has got a problem the problem is you know they're more key time of the year is a time where you have what you know college football's running wild yeah bells or jogging by land about ratings week for\nUp ten percent when people don't think you know and I thought maybe they back we'll see but ten percent up in ratings so I mean major league baseball you know I'm telling you right now Dodgers Braves Rockies Milwaukee is not going to get big ratings\nCleveland used that are going to get big ratings and you mentioned the Yankees Red Sox based on where they're playing in terms of time days and the channel their only hope for big ratings they're not going to get him\nIn five that's their hope for big ratings maybe in five any of the game five you're right so what are the first four games though I mean this is a showcase right this is the showcase you have to showcase\nThe glove slapped with very tack this and that you got to showcase all that Don Zimmer getting pushed over by Pedro\nThat's what you have to do baseball has to play this up because it's their last hope for big ratings I mean you think about World Series match a right to hope for World Series match up some big ratings are Colorado know Milwaukee\nNo Atlanta no they need the Dodgers in the national league Cleveland the American league know Houston not really the good news is but\nIt's not because the Yankees Red Sox play each other right here's the one's going to be knocked out you get Yankees Red Sox against the Dodgers you have hope for decent World Series ratings\nYou know there would be great but that's the only chance they have one of those two teams the scale of the Dodgers how'd you get to be at all you got Colorado versus Cleveland you might as well played on public access television because no one's watching it outside of Cleveland and also Colorado\nStick it on your pay TV channel Tiger Woods Phil Mickelson those losers who should be back in this country the passport she'll be revoked from me not that that happened in

individual series that get on the waves and actually games later today our baseball insider several was at Yankee Stadium witnessing\nThe seven to two New York Yankees win and set describe the atmosphere what it felt like being at Yankee Stadium which seemed to be an absolutely packed house\nRe crowd um it really is and I'm waiting should get out of your computer and really a\nUm because you know I I drove this time I normally never drive but I had a funeral and I had to go from there right there so I drove not too much information you need that uh but the idea that\nUm this crowd was electric it was it was it was a lot of fun but uh I thought it was kind of a clunker if a game and it's funny because baseball than four games if you count the two um typewriters baseball's had two really good nail biter and to Congress\nAnd so you know All right to into you know step\nI think a bit as baseball fan so we got a little spoiled you know I said this earlier on the show I said\nYou have a classic loyal baseball\nLoving fan base that we got to see yesterday at Wrigley Field\nAnd the same thing is true for Yankee fans are Yankee Stadium and I think\nTo have those two atmospheres those two stadiums those two organizations\nHosting the games I kind of get spoiled based you know if your baseball are like you were me I think we understand what that means maybe you know the peripheral fan doesn't get it but I thought it was called the ab fans Wrigley fans a Yankee Stadium pizza Venus by the way for both wild card games\nYeah but I'm I'm excited for some of the new park figure the brewers have opposed to just turning eleven and that built parks a great place like what a great atmosphere of course bill that's one of my top three are all time ballpark so I'm looking forward to it it's very funny and I have to wait arriving crowd though a land and the Dodgers [laughter]\nWe're we're going down the street you know you got Miller Park and course park do this or Budweiser either one of those or [laughter]\nOr you know I I don't remember I don't I don't remember I I Would have to look\nA parking spot I was at the opening of Miller Park when the President Bush or the or the bullet ... bounce the pitch right that was the game that was the game that led to the big story of Derek Jeter putting all that pressure on him to throw strike uh after nine eleven\nBut Miller Park great place to watch a game it or it's really nice stadium and there was a four strings but I did not right but\nThere there was a great argument on how the benefits of the public money that was spent on the retractable roof for Miller Park and how that help\nThem and just look at this to stick the Chicago Cubs played thirty games in thirty days\n... granted they had a day off in a double header but they played thirty games in thirty days because of rain outs that will walk you didn't have to deal with because they have the retractable roof\nOur baseball inside of severed sitting in traffic outside of Yankee Stadium after witnessing the Yankee something else going over and Oakland and they should against each other is sitting in traffic for a while there are joining us they're going to be enforced NBC Sports radio how important is it for baseball\nTo have Yankees Red Sox first time they meet in the postseason since the infamous ... matchups Seth\nI'm ... yeah they're they're they're excited about it I mean fuck box is very very happy because they are or are not CBS that get the um the ... they're very excited about it but you know the reality of it is\nJust don't like that that the litmus test for the sport you know I was talking to America and the other side a just a second ago and he was saying like well how great with the ratings be if it's Yankees Dodgers in the world series right and he's absolutely right and he didn't say anything incorrect\nWell judged on whether or not it's Yankees Dodgers\nVersus Indians rock everything these rockets does that mean the sports struggling like the\nThe thing no nobody in and basically you know what it is completely\nConnected to the big market and they're right there are there and this is something I did write about for Forbes because\nThere was a statement in baseball I think fans to believe that baseball still just keeping up with the Joneses that it's it's the big market in at the spur of the small market and like there were national shows today they called the brewers an upstart Cinderella\nThe Henry last record they had the best record in the national league what's up started about\nNo but that's the problem you know I was talking ... but that's the problem right it doesn't matter who plays in the super bowl it's becoming so little entity with the you know the half time matter of course the commercials are\nNBA Finals it's kind of similar just a matter of what stars it does matter stars wearing a coma city Jersey or Cleveland Jersey is only ... Bronner to ramp people gonna watch\nBaseball outside of a handful of teams it's just a regional sport now in\nEven the stars I mean people do they really tune in to watch my trap the should you only get to watch that four times in his hands on his it's in the outfield a bunch of times right so I said sadly become a regionalized sport that's why I let you get the rear team like the cubs to the Yankees the Dodgers for the red Sox involved in the world series if you're lucky enough to get both of them\nThat tell you the national audience that I'm not saying it's right but that sadly what has become\nWell and and I was a big proponent of it when the red Sox are trying to break a curse\nAnd the same thing with the cubs like I was a very big proponent of like we have to get these teams into the fall classic because that will be great drama I wanted the cubs and the worst way no three out of the bargain here\nAnd I remember that because I thought now what are the chances that you could break one of those curses work great drama but\nYou know people talk about the world series and we've seen classic World Series and or you know I did not call after his Dodgers last year a classic World Series I thought it was a very good World Series and I thought it was not a classic we've seen classics before a two thousand one two thousand to ... those were plastic World Series\nAnd at the time but it was an angel giants I never was thinking about market size the way you do now and it seems like now for the sport considering the fact that they were under Seventy million for the first time since two thousand and three they're counting on a big postseason for something to boast\nAnd I think that's comical that their boasting is going to be based on what teams make it\nAnd I want to see objectivity I've often that the NBA doesn't care Milwaukee is clay Denver like they don't care about it\nAnd yet in the same situation I Want baseball to to to be proud of its product and it's the best World Series out there happens to be the Cleveland Indians versus the Milwaukee Brewers I Want them to be fine with it but I don't think they are\nI got to bring down here real quick Shaun how

you see yourself\n[noise] because nobody is off limits\nOr right [noise]\nRight [noise] yes I have to do to the poor Miami Heat\nMy personal power does but he here's why\nNew word coming out in the NBA is that they are trying to get the Minnesota general to take care of by trade offer for Jimmy Butler they've been talking for two weeks\nNot gotten close to make it a trade people think Tom vivid always ...\nPrices so high that no one's going to\nAccept it so butler stays with that right [noise]\nFor you or Miami [noise]\nWhy do you want you to be butler\nJimmy Butler is not exactly a good teammate we're not real life is considering he's now exit two places or will be exiting his second place\nRight to exit from Chicago wasn't pretty this exit from Minnesota obviously it's not pretty\nYou know Miami is going to be a team that's going to have young players cheap well apparently isn't a fan of young players that Carl Anthony towns and ask a you know Andrew weakens about that\nHe's also going to be a free agent that's going to command a hundred and Ninety million dollars over like five years he's like a big financial investment to guys what twenty eight twenty nine years old\nI'm giving you must be reasonable why you don't want you to buy the here's another one bullet goes to Minnesota they already had Andrew weekends they already had currently at these out to be making that much better\nKnown right do they even one fifty games the only forty eight games [noise]\nI just think you're barking up the wrong tree getting all hot and heavy\nFor Jimmy polar pure Miami I just don't think he that difference maker and he made that you need you know rebuild putting Julie Bollywood that Ninety year old Dwayne wade this you're isn't gonna make you a better team where you're actually going to compete for even the eastern conference it's a waste of your time\nSo the deal that Minnesota apparently once he was like Josh Richardson bam bio or first round pick next year [noise]\nI mean I just think from Miami fake\nBe like every other team that has expressed interest me know than a year he's gonna be a free agent anyway Miami got a Jimmy Butler this year way for winning anything\nTo keep the assets keep your traffic and weight that's what my actually my personal fouls forgetting all hot and heavy for all people Julie butler\nI Hope they do get them you got them because I think Miami being competitive in the east would be ought to fund Dan my personal fell goes to Nick Saban\nThey one fifty six for seeing this past Saturday over Louisiana Lafayette but Nick\nAt is a press conference was unhappy with the students section because both a lot of the Washington didn't show up altogether\nThis is what he says quote I can honestly say I was a little disappointed there weren't more students at the last game end quote he goes on I think we're trying to address that I don't think they're entitled to anything either me personally I think it ought to be first come first served\nThomas Fletcher\nWho's the long snapper he goes on Twitter with Kirk streets and you got all of this and it was a a shot of the Penn State wide out\nYeah he he treated must be nice to have people come to your home games [laughter] ouch here's why I throw a personal felt about scheduling and look they do schedule some tough opponents but what do you want to squeeze in Lafayette\nNick your team is so great diseases might be the best team Nick statements headed Alabama ... going to say this to me is wanted for national championships\nIt's nice to just hard to know better than getting up for that Louisiana Lafayette sorry wake them up one more interesting games\nHere's the funny thing I don't\nKnow I Want to do either you're living in half time anyway\nHere's the funny thing Sean\nThere for more home games the rest of the way a voice probably or Vanderbilt no [laughter] I was just show up against misery which he wants he grew locker yo they don't care\nI Mississippi State okay there there were ranks\nTo the Dell boy and then of course is short for all that but you can't get a ticket for that\nSolver they'll show for it but you can't get a ticket for that one I Will be hard to get but still it's an amazing like I mean you can't force students to have to go to every game that is the match that with next stop stop but here's the other problem though she was onstage these these ridiculous with this but here's the other problem\nThe best out of conference game they play\nIt's never at home it's always gonna be a neutral site\nElse you know a little oval Noel shooters is holding them\nThey don't know what I'm saying that the best out of conference game that there were so the seas with him and they played Michigan in Dallas right\nBlue oval Florida State\nThose games are going to be in Tuscaloosa to start the year\nRight and you know what programs probably don't want to play\nAlabama disclose death probably hard to schedule home I don't think the big tens of looking to schedule holding on without them anytime soon they have in the past but not in the Nick Saban era I I Do know\nCan we think of\nA team or something to do it\nAnd yes\nNow I Can't I Can't think of a potential that schedule home and I'm In Alabama is Penn State that was the way it has a long time ago yeah\nI don't I don't I don't see it

I I Love college football I tell you Saturdays and Sundays but I Do have a problem when I see state schools paying their coaches exorbitant sums of money when the tuition is that the schools go through the roof and these players that they recruit not all of them go the NFL all Nick statements kids at least get a shot at the NFL is free labor it's free\nLabor labor so college football is just making money hand over fist and mainly college football in college but I guess talk best one of the things they don't have to pay for they don't have to pay their employees amazing\nActually [laughter] so you're a boss when you're paying the manager of the restaurant nobody else\nI mean it's ridiculous\nIncredible right that's what it all the problem is the money from it's not a problem but if they're getting so much money from these TV deals\nCollege football is what would I I wanted to is there a sports bubble is is there a college football bubble would burst soon no\nNo why would they are lining ratings were these are declining everywhere you look good at tennis and the major schools now or ... well I was always going to all our vows David ... said something and she said the Latino shows at the Alabama football games best out of it but I bet you are you in ten years ago I think the tickets are sold\nPeople lose interest though and can you believe that people losing interest 'cause they're winning too much isn't that amazing all across the country though I attendance is what it was\nA Penn State now put the Penn State now um [noise] there was a game on a cousin clubs in Syracuse for no circuits team a team that beat comes from last year yeah so it's an opponent you would take seriously they're empty seats at the at the game\nSurprised a lot of seats in the course but I Wonder is that because it could have been sold out but there was this does right but it also you wonder is it\nI mean I don't know how much these college they're making kids pay for tickets\nFor the kids should never have to pay for tickets to go but they do that they that they pay you to Michigan and that they always have but I I find that to be just terrible like you're a student at that school and the kids would just sell them\nAs soon as would sell them and make some money well but they they did away with that at Michigan was\nBut here's how you can change right but here's how you change that have\nTo have your ID and you ... when I got a ... huge you you didn't have to pay for tickets obvious not Michigan where it's like the demand drives stay with the demand that high anniversary obviously bought you just walked up to the stadium with your ID and he got it\nSo the fact is sure like if you want to get tickets should be free for students right but they shouldn't be able to get it in advance or should we first started I got that you can you give it to them they have peeled outlets\nIntense I hate that they coach that caveat whatever Duke\nYeah but why should I don't want these people hanging out at ten for a week Sean but if you're sanitary kids are paying fifty thousand dollars to go to school the football tickets in basketball ticket should be part of the ... yeah but that's part of the deal that if you're a booster a parent you should pay for your ticket\nBut a kid with the student ID has no business being charged for a ticket I think it's orderly outrageous and wrong that these universities that are already getting an arm and a leg from parents and kids\nWill charge them to go support the football program or the basketball program shame on these money grabbing greedy administration is that these universities that charge for this nonsense it should be should be free to the kid that's\nAll right fine but then you're going to have people pitching tents fine who watch that so that is so boring\nAnd it's just so I I I remember being a noxious\nRemember being a poor college kid [laughter] yeah right now I remember I put like three dollars my bank account so I'd have tend to take out ten from the ATM right 'cause like you can't take out seven\nFor like for instance I have a Lebanese they got to have a dollar thing and it's like honestly imagine having to buy tickets to to go to the games\nTo watch your white you could sell them yet but how would you want to go see the game\nWhile he can't anymore but right but but you're right you're right\nThat that's a problem but I just think the salaries outrage but here's the thing said you could easily say they point three million he's worth being the highest paid college football coach the land I mean it's not even an argument urban Meyer number to not even in the sports\nBall sports ball's gonna burst there's a sports bubble that\nNow that the amount of money to get and bring it in going to have to start paying these kids\nAre All right well that's where the ... were also saying there's a level that right and and so that's part of it and also cable\nIs doing the way of the ... it's just going away in in ten Fifteen Years won't be cable TV [noise] well yeah maybe years the one that that I don't agree with the ratings are declining then\nYeah but here's where I don't agree with you we saw recently a couple of weeks ago remember the amount of money revenue and profits of the top college football programs and Texas Tech was number twenty five I think he made like forty million bucks profit or thirty one million dollars in profit\nIf you're paid the kids and you have to pay walk on to pay the scholarship catch right ten thousand bucks each that's eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars honestly it's a pittance of the total that the most look the schools like Ohio University schools that are the mid major all if you\nPay a college football kids you got to pay the college basketball kids the men's and women's teams you have you got to be fair you got to have to pay the whole athletic program so to me more than a hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nOkay but I'm saying out of the football budget that's what it's going to be\nI don't think it's going to be a bubble where they're going to stop paying these coaches somebody's always want to paint Nick Saban\nNo top dollar no ... well top dollar be like five million instead of eight million\nWell here's what a difference will be no bubble yeah but I don't think it affected Nick Saban urban Meyer\nSchools will go either way to make sure they could bring that guy in and pay the bubble will be one Scott Frost moves or the bubble will be when you know one of those types of coaches are younger like hockey coach instead of starting off it's like\nThat Kirby Smart started off like six million bucks or five million bucks that won't happen the starting salary won't be that high starting salary will be a million and a half or two million dollars\nBut can Michigan truly justified Jim harbor what seven and a half million\nA third what two third place there isn't a fourth place finish in the Big Ten\nCorrect I mean one in five against Michigan State and he is he out of the\nTop five guys and take the first two cars they deserve the wanted to say but an urban Meyer which of these guys doesn't deserve to be where they are horrible at three jumbo Fisher for ... five I think it's got to be horrible\nIt's horrible yeah of course well GMOs has won a championship now that I Believe ... smells on he was the OC when they won yes he's all little Cam Newton also recruiting monster and he went to another one right as a coach\nHe he went he went to the sea championship game last year no I mean national championship fall\nYou won one no do you want to see see with our genes user crisis yeah\nThen he went to a game I think yeah yeah and he wants\nTo one last to Oregon or no no no no\nNo the Oregon we're new ... like yeah\nAnd they went to another one other thing I went to the last one yeah but here's the thing he's yeah I\nHeard was the guy and then also honestly number eight ... at Florida six point oh seven when something I mean we know what he won enough games and Mississippi State that's Mississippi State when eight games people love you\nBut there are moments Peyton demos the highest paid coach Tom ... said coach Scott Frost attend high speed coach\nHave used the schools are paying just through the you know there will be above all those types of coaches that will suffer with the bubble yeah the top of the top somebody always find a way to pay back okay because I was on was the coach and the BCS national championship game\nLast the Florida State backed it yeah does your bill Fisher\nYeah there yeah that's right and James where is that James\nWhat's interesting is who is a shame wasn't EJ so yeah\nThere you have it if you get James on the national championship you just get that well because if someone else there's so much more to remember about his college life than winning a national championship sadly All right we're wrapping up next a court

H. R. dot com it's time for another update or all the good stuff happening a mistake technical college the main campus is located here in Wisconsin Rapids they also have a campuses Steven's point and march we'll rent a center over in Adams and today it's the\nJeopardy and coal Leno show us the way things are going to be a teaming up one of the ladies Jackie hasn't been as the manager of K. twelve an adult outreach\nAnd I guess we're going to be\nTalking about when Truman spring program starts it's hard to think of spring when we're leaving at where\nI Know but but when you think about um a registration is opening soon and and we're getting the classes and the programs out on the website so long to get people aware of what we've got coming down the pike\nOkay so Jackie where did you want to begin first\nWell why don't we start with the winter of options that's comes a little bit before spring so um we have a number of options are coming in\nMid mid December and actually when I'm Sorry that after the first year in January so to on what we end up doing is we offer a variety of programs are courses I should say we have a handful that our program specific so if we have current students Oregon students\nThat want to start their program or a good example hospitality management\nUm you can take a single course I typically it's a three credit course over a three week period before spring semester starts\nThe other options that we have as a variety of ... ad course that you're insured a sociology microbiology things like that\nI now what's cool about that is odd the students that come home for winter break if they're for your student in many cases they could actually take a course at mid state and it transfers back to their for you and\nI was going to ask you about that the guy I talked about that last year with the winner program is that uh that makes it a uh your your winter break or your spring break very useful I mean you cannot and you can save money and get something out of the way and in order to Columbus something\nRight yet because our courses are typically a fourth of the cost of a four year institutions so you ... yeah I mean and and if it transfers bacteria institution you're going to save yourself the money and some time\nTo to find out last through that you had on a students taking advantage of that\nWe did we actually had on we had Seventy seven percent of our students last year or so about three quarters of the students that took one arm courses\nI'm continued on and our spring semester so about a force them do and\nI took a course that we assume wet and transferred back to their four year institution so a lot of people actually did take advantage of last year\nWhich is the whole premise of the event is why it started as 'cause they really do want to build that pipeline educator use here locally to stay local because there are some great in demand high paying jobs right here in central Wisconsin\nOr what what what's the reaction of some of those things when they see some of these companies\nOh my gosh they're blown away than they have no idea that machine can equal\nReally contributing to a larger guys sell our mission if they're making the tiniest parts that will go into a Boeing airplane or maybe they're human heart or human heart down like a mechanical heart needed 'em to keep someone alive so\nReally educating them to the technology um what these parts can do and how they impact really the greater good\nOkay what do you suggest to parents who may be son or daughter went through one of the tour and now they're excited ... how do you follow up on that\nGo work or are we seeing a mentor ships for instance with from business folks with the students while they're in high school here here's some ... for your knee in high school and when you get the ... we're going to mentor because those are invaluable mentors ships are invaluable\nYeah exactly on there are a number of different things once a student gets to high school so that's why this eighth grade salad right now because they are preparing on what's next they get to start chasing classes in high school and I get to start making more decision that's going to impact them after high school\nUm youth apprenticeship is a great way for students to kind of get involved if they're interested in manufacturing or maybe another area we have a ton of local and players are community as so supportive of\nNot only mid state that use the kind of ships and really allowing those students to get a little bit of experience and a particular industry while earning some maybe high school credit and then that could potentially translate to a college credit down the road\nYou know kids are getting a lot of great opportunities nowadays mhm and and their parents or maybe someone who's listening to us and they're here to other students about maybe next year it could be an eighth grade or they want um is there an officer can contact admits to to learn more about\nCertainly they can contact me I'm as outreach or any outreach coordinator at on any one of our campus locations but they got the head over to our website MS PC dot edu we have a counter of events that just really um\nHelps students explore rare discovery um or other careers and programs\nWe have a program showcase which is kind of geared for high school students at the end of this month on October twenty third so that's really opening up our campus doors at our Wisconsin Rapids location and having\nHigh school students meet with our instructors to see what kind of program senior labs and just really getting a taste of what they could do after high school I met state\nWell that's a nice that's what we call a nice segue Jackie [laughter]\nLet's talk about upcoming outreach events segments that\nCertainly so like I mentioned program showcase it's geared for more of the high school student typically um sophomore junior seniors are the ones that\nCome to that event we have some adult focused events to sort of coming up in November I'm maybe you're looking for a career change I mean have some prior experience in a certain industry it's called the get credit of that so we're worrying some credit based on previous experience or maybe previous education\nUm protected just by bringing your transcripts we can have that evaluated and see if there could be potentially some credits we could've words you to get a head start into whatever your next career program might be\nThat could be very valuable to someone who is an industry that it's kind of on a downward trend room thinking uh I I get I got to get into something one of these new growth industry or use this could be a great way to transition into that while still making money\nMhm yeah I mean there's a number of reasons why adults change careers if it's a I tend to get better work life balance to make more money at\nA you know they're just unhappy um and and so we definitely if you have prior work experience to Jackie's point if you have um transcripts available that we can evaluate um we you know we want to give you a jumpstart or in your in your new direction saw\nHim again just contact with the state college and set up an appointment to go over what you have been develop a game plan right and one thing I was on I've heard on her during her segments with the college\nIs that you are very much\nAbout the individual that everybody's situation is different and unique and it's not about uh you know putting people in a massive thing that doesn't fit the mold you you and the

and I think they think ... areas have showers and storms in a friday or any other way below the body with the highest that he did agree is\nFriday night let down below forty seven anyway the areas that showers and storms and Saturday Saturday otherwise reach out I think he's Seventy degree\nOzzie when they sent her party Simon's\nCourtney mostly cloudy and forty four at am Thirteen twenty and welcome back to the morning magazine and far too We're visiting with with Tony family living educator Jackie carotene talking about or your credit report Rosenberg you're getting the information\nAnd uh they drew new to keep track and what we're highlighting as the importance of keeping track of this stuff no be worried about your score but to worry about someone's stealing your identity\nOr using very dark catching someone using a who you are to make money off of you are right and so we just talked about a credit report freeze\nWhy would you want to do what Jackie why one should a person say okay we got to do this [noise]\nSo if you know for sure that you've been the victim of an identity theft or you're notified by a specific company that said there's been a breach\n'em and you're concerned then definitely go ahead and put that freeze on especially now that it's been made available and it's free um and what that phrase does is it prevents companies other than the ones that journey do business with from junior credit report\nSo then they can't go on and on ... and open new accounts so they can't use your credit to open new accounts so it blocks that and prevent that from happening\nSo um and you can go on and you can um\nI'm a lot of the ones that you currently have but it won't prevent new ones from being able to use it so um but I Do know that it does make it slower for you to come by some normal ones so like I said if you're looking to\nYou know I purchased a a vehicle or open um you know apply for a mortgage or something like that you would have to make those adjustments but again now with the new law changes you are able to um a start and stop for free and you don't have to pay that fee\nSo it does give you a little bit more lenient senior able to do that\nThey would you say ... or standard operating procedure but someone should put a they have any reason to believe that got word from somebody who says listen we've been hacked and your information has been compromised future automatically do that\nAnd that's kind of where they're leaning now is is you have the ability yes unless you again unless you're in the place where you know that you're going in for um some types of credit and you wrote to be purchasing yep go ahead and set it up and then you know that you're protecting yourself and then\nWhat basically you keep it on and on until you clean up everything that is of concern to yup\nYup or until you needed again yeah you're you're in the clear it's\nBecause I I I think you know what I'm hearing a lot more people are putting an African format trees to report on\nAnd again like I said there's the ability now to extend it they've the laws of extended it\nAnd they give you the ability to turn it on and off with for free so\nI'm really it's been very beneficial so it's good um some other things were changed out earlier this year in regards to credit reports that it kind of want people to not go ahead I'm a medical debts do not appear on your credit report until six months after that initial bill\nUm and that's because they found that um insurance companies on health care providers impatience [noise]\nUm it took them a little bit of time to sort out what was happening\nSo sometimes stuff would appear and then it was a mistake because it really needed to be filed\nUm so that's six months leg now gives them time to actually work it out and so it's accurate by the time and actually shows up on your report so um you if you see that stuff really isn't showing up and you're like oh what's happening there is now a six month Lagaan medical that so that doesn't show up\nUm do know that uh if overdue medical um that is eventually paid by the insurance company as opposed to being paid by the individual that that will be removed from your credit report so that will be taken care of the tunnel yep so that is good um judgments and tax liens no longer are on tax reports um so that's good um that\nTaken off um investigations uncovered many errors in out of date information and these types of public records um bankruptcies are still on there they'll continue to be in public records and will remain on the credit report and it does it seem like the times seven to ten years\nSo that is still on there um and depending on what type of bankruptcy it is so that'll determine the length of time that it's on there so those bankruptcies are still on but judgments and tackling tax liens are no longer on there\nSo that's good for some people and change their credit so that's good I'm\nPositive rental history I'm so for people who are a tenant's um that can be put on but I ask your landlord because it's totally up to the landlord whether they want to report or not so it's not required by law that the landlord reports it's totally out their personal preference [noise]\nSo um they can report so um it's up to them so if it's something that your um and it's your benefit especially if you do um\nI always tell when I teach landlord tenant I always tell the talent you know it's to your benefit if you pay your bills every month measure your building your credit so definitely\nAsked a landlord if they do report 'em 'cause that really will be to your benefit if they do because it builds your credit I'm so asked them if they do um that's one of those things that had a time but they don't have to but that does show up now so that's really important [noise] um and then again those are things about the credit freeze also come into play and those\nUm outlook are in effect now in the fall so I'm again you have the ability to have that free um fraud alert and its fending for one year um and that's an increase from before where it was Ninety Days and then also the um freezes are or you can get a free from all three credit rebels\nAnd that is free and that's the longer the ten dollar fee to put it on and a ten dollar for you to take it off um so that's also a big push\nFor it and that was something in and out here in the state of Wisconsin there was a runner 'cause I remember talking to senator tester here about legislation to um make a Wisconsin was working at to give people the right yeah so that's why knowledge and so it's already legal\nIt is the up so that was put into place um someone into place in April someone into place in may and then they just are now in so yep so\nWhere do you do a freeze on your door would do it for all three bureaus at the same time or um you have to contact each bureau individually or you can do that yes oh definitely yeah there you have to into\nAll three and so you bring up a really good port so how do you get it how do you do hear freezes and how do you get your credit reports um so we recommend you can go to annual credit report dot com\nSo again and your credit report dot com it's all one word\nUm and then you can choose each other three barrels right off of there um and that's where you can get them all for free so don't pay you'll see you mentioned earlier you see advertisements and things um and I was so glad this went away but they're used to be that great jingle that was free credit report\nAnd I used to say don't go that\nWater here but in your credit report dot com is the what is the place to go and it'll hit all three bureaus off of that website and then that's where you can also do any um corrections errors freezes all off of that too so that'll it hits you to all three\nSchool board and Thirteen twenty usa jar Wisconsin Rapids central Wisconsin twenty inflammation saying [noise]\nBS news on the hour

David do or he was also a guy hitting to Ninety eight in September I mean this team got high the right time much there are a lot like the brewers\nThere are a lot like the brewers that ah when things needs to be ratcheted up to to you know get themselves into the postseason they were able to do it paid five five eight three zero eight six forty what what about this Colorado Rockies series\nMaybe not so much the team specifically what about this series makes you a bit nervous I have to listen to every good man you know when you start to look at a series down the road a yeah their starting pitching they bring it home they get a win at Miller Park and then they bring it home they've got some strength right there to of course we'll get some strength would that starting pitcher\nEight five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight if you want to chime in\nFeel free to do so give us a shout I'm\nAlso you can serve on Twitter Advil underscore Michael's Advil underscore Michael's you can find as their\nEyes he had mentioned you know what the same thing here and he was talking about this Rockies team many people would play taps for them thinking they were dead and they kept fighting back I said while ago that look I thought the brewers we're going to end up with a wildcard who knew that the cubs were going to start playing just above five hundred in the brewers are gonna go on the eight game win streak that they did kudos to the brewers defined the odds in defining history\nYou know proving a lotta people wrong including me it's great to see that they've made it this far I'm\nBill says my feeling is would have been hit it would've been more ideal right now to play the cubs they're pitching has not been great as well as hitting\nA Tempe says I really like with the brewers have going on I think the Colorado Rockies or a mirror image\nThe cubs are team that's on the decline of the Rockies or a team that's on the incline and they are going to be a team to watch out for Ali and says I don't care who's starting today go brewers fits rose center so I my assumption is she fits row behind the plate when you say center\nNot out in center field 'cause that's a battered by not going to be out there\nAh this one's from Eric and Eric writes ah hey what do you think of this pitcher by committee I just can't wrap my head around it I understand what the brewers are attempting to do but don't you need somebody to come in and shut the door and give your bullpen a break well but who\nI agree with you look at the old school way is to say give yourself two or three really solid starters go out and get six innings gave it to your set up man turn it over your clothes are and that's the end of the ball game\nThat's the way it should go\nBut when you don't have that you don't have that ace in the whole or to what do you do you just have to get out fast the brewers philosophy\nSo as much as I Want to say I'm with you and\nFor most ya I'm I'm probably gonna be with you again when we get to the off season which hopefully doesn't come any time soon\nBut I I understand what the brewers are doing\nEight five five eighty three zero eight six for you to go to the phone calls to talk to Mike in Oak Creek Mike welcome to the program that will Michael sure what's going on man\nMarch wanna rock brewers are ... that ... that five series fearful you drop that her school now you gotta take three out of four mhm I'm sure those were two of those being on the road um IBM Syrian or is that I think it so much anger on his first game it's huge yeah\nI Would completely agree but for a number of reasons one\nGot to win and now I can relax a little just play our game were not going to be uptight we've got them on the ropes not us or not to mention it gives you that load of confidence that you belong 'cause he both of these teams aren't you know post season ... notch so both of these teams them kind of sigh of relief and say okay we do belong\nAnd then obviously the brewers hard fought to get here with the best record in the national league then they say okay we're for real but I think both teams are also young enough to understand that this is\nKind of like a collegial atmosphere they you know hey you lose the game big deal we got tomorrow we're we're coming back I I think very experienced enough and veteran enough to know what it takes to get here and get through this I also think that that kind of good to be young and stupid not know any better to say okay we'll come back tomorrow we'll get a win no big deal so I think\nSo a lot of experience and a lot of youth and a lot of court players all rolled into one to get back to the phone calls Peter listening to his out in whitewater Peter welcome to the program but Michael shows going on now\nFor for a class from a guy that they are out there and yeah and I wonder if they're bad bad alive and it may have get out of the guys that are not yell at\nYou are actually playing that game ... bad\nMood that she was a kid I mean that that's a great question and I appreciate the phone call um\nAnd by the way you're going back down and why are you going to see a hell of a football game I mean I scratch comes rolling and I mentioned this earlier than to whitewater his out scored opponents this year so far one sixty five to Nineteen\nThere's going to be a big game ... should try to stand me what it is whitewater does so well they changed offensive coordinators and the off season and defensively they've been playing lights out football creating turnovers so that should be as a jury sororities a hell of a coach for you don't wash cash a but that's going to be it's not like her down there\nAre gonna punch and people in the nose down there at ... stadium come Saturday I'm going back to your question with Aguilar a moose stock has Shaw a RC a which leaves you earned on ... and Jonathan scope to becoming off the bench\nA and as far as your bench bats don't forget you got Bronx there you've got to Braun Cain and yell at age which means you got Bronx in Santana in Granderson all coming off the bench as well Domingo has been really hitting the ball and they'll keen on Bronx it's more of a defensive ... and\n... running kind of guy Granderson gives you some experience there I think he's got a terrific mix I heard on for as has been uh been solid when it comes to pinch hitting a Domingo Santana has been so much better\nI I don't know what to make a scope scope is obviously struggle but he's giving you some big moments everybody's contributed which makes this team do you have to wise a little bit stronger so\nCan they yeah they can they been doing it all season long will they when the light through the brightest now you wait and see because this is this is a whole different animal\nThis is a whole different meaning the bunting is out red white and blue announcements getting introduced to the first base in the third base lines people screaming and yelling hanging on every pitch this level of enthusiasm and excitement trying to contain the butterflies when you're sitting on the bench waiting for your number to be called waiting for your name who yelled for like Craig counseled down the bench you know\nIt's ... it's different these some of these guys embraces before so\nI'm I as much as we want to talk about the players and containing the butterflies and you know it's baseball once you step onto the field I agree with that but for fans\nThere's a lot of finger nail biting\nA lot of enthusiasm lot of energy right now the city I shouldn't say just the city because that's the law he's calling from whitewater we had somebody just a little while ago called us from Madison I
