up in a in the early for us in the bay area hello Ralph how can I help you out today\nFor taking my call of course\nIt's a lot of you about\nQualified love Germany's a new contracts\nThe famous cue lack\nOf\nWhat's going on in your life that you're considering it\nWell I'm a single man without children about to turn of sixty five or retire from teaching\nCongratulations\nBoth sexes can although receiving a small pension now a little bit of Social Security of saved about a hundred hundred and fifty thousand for all through the ah some of the traditional Ira and a little bit on a raw okay I don't have a bit\nAnd I was in cases I'm probably not going to have errors a martyr you're good idea where to look out about a thirty so ah employs McHugh lack that supposed to be good and for the around\nEight years of age ... understanding of it you are is that pays about two thousand a month depending upon which insurance carrier you your shoes right\nAnd for the rest of my life\nAnd one of the concerns I out of all being a single man without family is that you know make bad decisions as I get older maybe long term care ... oh I Wish I'd become senile I'm frightened of market volatility\nAnd having a ... view sort of a good book or a for me\nSo you get older so just so I understand that you are using the you would be using the most people look at the cue lack as a way\nTo kind of push off you're required minimum distribution till later in your eighties\n... or you know so to mostly it's used as a theoretical way to kind of delay receiving required minimum distributions is that what you are using it for or would you be using it to create income okay\nWhich would you say is more important at this point\nI Would say probably I'm from ... to have the added income towards the out of my life okay private insurance\nUh-huh I mean I might okay so I went to one of the smartest people I Know because I'm not a cue lack expert\nBut um ... it's a guy named Michael ... says he he writes a cool\nUm he runs a website called nerds I view and it's mostly for nerdy people like him which would include me he's a financial advisor and he wrote very eloquently about the ... so I went to him and kind of wanted to see what was going on\nAnd he thinks that\nUm unfortunately that although it sounds good it turns out I'm going to quote him here it turns out the unique nature of the longevity annuities payment structure is not very hospitable as an R. M. D. ... strategy it can take until the retirees late eighties just to break even\nAnd recover principle which means the retiring risk significant foregone grows by trying to merely differ armed ... through the use of a cue lack so here's what I Would have to say to you about that\nI think the problem is that\nIf you want income then it is reasonable for you to say hey I think that I Would like to add some income to my pension and my Social Security I have this traditional i._r._a. how much is in a traditional i._r._a.\nUm about\nA hundred and eighty thousand\nMhm and and there's eight fifty in the forest rebate and even right now the traditional i._r._a. how was it invested generally\n[noise] about ah sixty percent or ... forty percent ball\nAnd you like doing this yourself are you doing this in a no load mutual fund environment ya okay I mean if you really are concerned about income than what I might look at is um to actually look in at\nA low cost annuity\nThat it's just that not necessarily a cue lack and doesn't have to be you know could or could not be but I think that low cost annuities are hard to find okay they really are\nOn and so what I think you might want to do is to say All right where can I find a low cost annuity a or a low load 'em and I might start with vanguard I'm just to uh where are you holding holding your accounts right now your IRA count right now\nOkay I've heard of them [laughter]\nThink he should send since you're doing this I Do think that\nI'm a low load 'em annuity might be something that you should explore Iowa\nThat is at that they have through vanguard I don't know if the ... the offers a low load but if you're seeking to create a stream of income that is going to be uninterrupted and then maybe perhaps you look at an annuity on the other hand if you're really worried about sort of like what happens\nIf I lose my mind I'm Wondering have you done your state plant look there's a really realistic I like have you done estate planning it\nNo I'm not so\nI mean look I think there there is another issue here which is a ...\nIf you have nobody in your family do you have a friend who would trust a younger friend who you trust or should you just hire someone to act as a trustee on your behalf an institution that could help oversee\nAny issues that arise if you take a turn for the worst and so what I'm going to tell you is actually first and foremost before you starting to look at an annuity and doing this I think you should start looking at your own state planning\nAnd even though you may not have any air is maybe you want to leave money to charity maybe you want to have someone to have some flexibility and and you know some ... maybe make a charity the\nThe beneficiary of your traditional i._r._a. and then if something happened to you then it goes there or maybe you want to pay an organization to act as a trustee if something bad were to happen for you\nI think this is a story that begins with estate planning it then incorporate what you are a lot like what you're thinking\nAnd then you may find that if you had that person that was in your life\nFor you know again you you find a good qualified as state attorney then you don't need an annuity that and you just have somebody who's going to help administer assets this could be a really important step for you and not get involved with any insurance product at all so I think that's where I Would start\nTo think that makes sense\nSure All right good then go off and make some money keep teaching what what do you teach by the way\nTo reach a government's history you got a lot on your plate right now Mr Mann which are a lot of government and there's history being made everyday thank you so much for calling let me know how it goes okay thanks so much to take their good luck\nAnd sometimes you see it's funny there we are we get to the nut\nQuestion but only by doing a little digging it's fascinating to me it always is and uh hey estate planning week bark you missed it coming to the end of it right now but\nIt is so important it is important to distill what is the issue that has really underlying\nThe question that's what I that's what I think it's fascinating here and so thank you so much to Ralph that was a great question fantastic question if you have a question\nLike Ralph maybe it's not estate planning meetings and

woman who negotiated your divorce and state planning attorney with that expertise\nPlease please do that and you know we're talking about what is midlife yes we're all going to live longer chances are and one of the cool things is that because of that because we are all likely to live longer\nChick Conley says we need to redefine what need life really means\nFirst of all ... for those of us who are in midlife and and and let's start by saying mid life I think has actually changed it used to be forty to sixty five today I think it's thirty five to Seventy five because people feel irrelevant earlier because there are more people in the mid life marathon and feeling a little confused by it\nI think the key is to start start saying which habitats are going to be open to your wisdom and ah so\nOne of the things that I had a lucky going for that was fortunate for me was I was in an industry hospitality and these the founders of there'll be an be it started in that field but had nobody in the company would hospitality background\nSo start by asking is there a field or an industry you may be in health care\nAnd you have some people want to disrupt health care and I got some great technology but they really don't understand how the industry works or they don't have the contact they don't have a rolodex does that know how and I know who the combination of those two together is something you have going for you especially if it's an industry where people are learning the industry along the way\nSo I think that was helpful I think also it was helpful as it was clear that Bryan and his co founders really wanted to learn from me why because they asked me a lot of questions rather than sort of having to you in the room and then on occasion just saying okay I was taught ship out\nAnd talked about hospitality they started looking at me three weeks into friends and you're in her in charge of strategy now so it's just er just in terms of hospitality and three weeks into it and now in charge of strategy for the company which was not something I asked for but he clearly saw that I had a strategic mind so that was great\nSo but I but let me just say I had you know the book was doesn't work the making of a modern older is full of Apple's a hundred and fifty examples beyond me I Am an unusual case in the sense that the founders of this company asked\nMe to join them that doesn't happen a lot for people in their fifties\nI think that there's something interesting you point out\nMany people face their modern elder years with a sense of anxiety I hear that anxiety when people call the show up and they're in their fifties and I have friends obviously you I'm sure you have the same thing you have a group of friends you grew up with them or you went to college with them and\nThey're in this place where they just don't know how to channel themselves into a next chapter and there is anxiety financial anxiety obviously when you probably didn't have as much but\nI think that sometimes people stay suck in a place where they feel like they are becoming obsolete and kind of like running out the clock yeah and don't know how to make a move and and I find that to be a that's pretty consistent\nAnd really consistent we have um we started something called the modern older academy which is a social enterprise ... you know we have half the people coming on scholarship where people come to a campus in in a in a beach front in Baja which is in Mexico and yes and they come and they learn about how to evolve into a modern elder\nWhat the four steps that are outlined in the book so you don't have to go to Mexico necessarily to do this\nAnd a number one you have to evolve and this was the hardest up because many of us\nI I Would have been very hard for me if I think back on it to be fifty two years old I've run my own company for you know for twenty four years and now I'm actually reporting to someone who's Twenty one years younger than me ouch forty percent of us in the workplace\nHave Abbas younger than us and that's actually only growing as a phenomenon so if I didn't evolve and say okay I'm no longer the sage on the stage at the leader of the company but I'm the guy on the side I'm the person who's helping this guy Brian be successful and I\nHad to have the right size my ego so that was one form of evolving I needed to do and that idea of evolving is not just in your identity but it's in what you know and that gets you to the second lesson which is to learn so the first lessons are evolving learn which are two things that frankly people in midlife\nOften feel like they don't want to do because it takes work right\nAnd it's uncomfortable the idea of uncertainty is something that grits us often as we get older I certainly can come from feeling ages them in the workplace regime can feel like oh my God I could be you know one\nOne round of layoffs right away from being at the what are some things we can develop while we're still working to try to help us get to the next stage before that happened\nSo uncertainty as painful but irrelevant\nThat's a good idea not in the bucket\nRight here right or good a job where I Would go down the road um\nSo the bottom line is I think that if you do the math let me just start by saying this I'm fifty seven years old I hung out with my dad you know in a scuba diving with him in rural Indonesia in may my dad's eighty one this month\nUm and my dad and I took one of his online tests where it says how ... how long have you lived to we both both for both of us is that we're ... we're Ninety eight\nTo five fifty seven now and I'm a little Ninety eight you can do the math I Am thirty nine years into my adulthood and I have forty one years of adulthood ahead of me I Am a less than half way through my adult part of my life\nWhen you think that way you realize oh my gosh I have a lot of time ahead of me\nWhich means that you're may be more willing to have a beginner his mind and be a little bit curious about things that you might say yeah let me try that out I'm going to be a beginner and the idea of being in mid life you know let's look back in childhood we had to learn how to walk which means we had to fall down a few times\nAnd we've had to do things in our life where we've had to get be not very good at it learning a language at fifty seven among Spanish and money surfing last year when the surf this is not the thing that people in their fifties do but the process is great it creates curiosity ... curiosity is an old licks her\nFor having a life affirming kind of experience so long story short is once you realize that it's not over at age fifty you're open to maybe trying some things and looking awkward along the way but having fun and being able to laugh at yourself\nCan you explain this role that you have at ... and you know as a modern elder you say that you have to be an editor\nYeah explain what you mean by that well there's a great book the jaws and rush brought out recently called the happiness curve in a ... it goes into great detail about the fact that frankly people get happier starting around fifty or forty your forties are your worst decorated the reason for that is because we tend to accumulate\nUp until about ... at age fifty what does that mean well you she really friends you accumulate relationships or you know ... ... children and and having kids ... roles and responsibilities and things you do for nonprofits and\nBy the time you get your forties it's a mishmash of so many things that you really don't feel like you know you have much control or freedom in your life and so you accumulate in the first half your life you edit and the second half your life and we see this a lot with people in their homes\nThey have a you know have a big home then they become an empty nester and then they downsize that's an example of editing\nThe process of editing your life down to what's important to including who you want to spend time with and what you want to do is a really valuable exercise because it means you start focusing on what makes you happy\n[noise] okay we'll get back to our interview with shipping just a

clean out some email\nMike says in past years we will we were able to write off twenty six thousand dollars in itemized deductions and also sixteen thousand dollars for personal exemptions for our family of four that told forty\nDollars now with the new tax brackets it looks like we will only be able to write off twenty four thousand is that true well so two things\nFirst you've got to determine are you going to claim the standard deduction or are you going to itemize\nThere's a few things about itemize deductions that you should know first of all I'm you are limited in your uh itemized deductions for state and local taxes to ten thousand dollars overall you also um if your\nCharitable contribution limits for a year cash donations is limited to sixty percent of your adjusted gross income I think for most people that's not going to matter medical expenses deductible in excess of seven and a half\nPercent of your adjusted gross income so Utah Boulder itemized deductions and you say to yourself is that more\nThan what I Would claim for the standard deduction\nSo if you had twenty six thousand dollars in itemized deductions in the past\nPresuming that some of that state and local taxes we don't know because I don't know where you're from but if that reduces if your state and local tax part of it let's just let's pretend that you had Fifteen grand in state and local taxes we kept at just ten\nSo then you have to add up all your other itemized deductions to see that makes sense and if it adds up to more than twenty four thousand dollars and then you then you would have\nTo itemize but if it's less than twenty four thousand then you would just basically claim the standard deduction which is twenty four thousand so you lose the personal exemptions that just went away the real question is\nOnce you've made that decision all is not lost maybe your tax bracket went down maybe all of a sudden your tax bracket which was you know twenty eight ... goes down to twenty two\nSo you didn't mention how much um what your income was but you may find that your total tax picture improved I don't know because I don't know what last year was but that's the big decision around standard versus itemize like\nYour standard deduction it's twenty four thousand for married filing jointly you've got to tally up all the itemized deductions including the new limitations and see if it's more and then we'll figure it out but no you don't get those unfortunately those ah [noise]\nA personal exemptions anymore okay ah Rob wants to know a strategy for creating income during his retirement he's fifty four he\nSays he's a computer programmer and he would love the option of renting or cutting back at sixty\nI feel most comfortable knowing that I could have a hundred thousand dollars a year pre tax pre tax and retirement income no pension other ah or expected income stream other than Social Security\nIt makes a hundred and fifty grand a year he contributes thirty grand to his four one K. with the company match his retirement savings he's got about a one point one million dollars in\nInvestments of nine hundred or so he's got to a million bucks okay and\nHe's got let's say five more years where he's putting away let's say a hundred and fifty I'm\nFine I'm doing quick math let's say that by the time he retires in five or six years that he's got another say conservatively with very minimal growth to point three million bucks\nOn I don't think he says if he's married or not does he mark I don't think so\nNo I don't think so so let's say that you are you're looking at two points three million dollars which you could say is maybe it's two point four but let's say you got that Seventy grand prix tax from that money and then you'd have Social Security pre tax probably about right you probably just about hit it\nSerious things up for human drama and politics of migration on immigration were on display in Central America and also at a pretty

tune in to the store and online at NBC Sports radio\nDot God well we finally ever World Series it's a really what are they a lot of baseball fans across the country wants to do very popular teams as well I think major league baseball and there's thirty teams what I Do is\nThink of and I would imagine properly merchandise salesman tickets and interest in the history of the franchise record it all together and I would\nSay that there's about six teams that stand above the rest of the teams in terms of popularity All right in terms of overall interests are some others that are close\nBut I'd like to say that the ANC ease the red socks of course are two of them or write to us we knew that the cubs and all invite the cardinals to be a part of that top six and then out west you have the Dodgers and all invite the giants I probably arrange a St Louis in\nUh San Francisco either fifth or sixth there a number one still being the Yankees number two I Would say the red Sox narrowly probably ahead of the cubs\nAnd then the Dodgers are after that and so anyway you rank those six unequivocal believe those are the six most popular franchise is when it comes to selling advertising tickets merchandise you name it so major league baseball is looking at jobs at what they have here with the brewers\nTaking on or not the brewers rivers lose the Dodgers taking on the Boston Red Sox it'll start Tuesday\nAt Fenway Park\nOr it'll be Clinton courage shock going opposite of Chris ... you're going to see JD Martinez you're going to see I see oh boy you're going to see Justin Turner you're going to see ... bats and\nReally look that's what it's all about and the best of the best in the Korean rising to the top uh this window for the Dodgers is actually stayed open for a pretty good amount of time that means six consecutive years making the postseason\nOr back to back years making the world series and when all the way the game seven last year will it go seven this year and then if it does it will end on Halloween Night of all night to number to chime in if you'd like is eight five five three two three four NBC and I were on a Boston would love to\nHear from those Red Sox fans do you like your chances are as\nA talking to a gym never texting him during the game\nOn my good friend and mentor for many years and voice of the Boston Red Sox and\nAnd I asked to me who he wants to face maybe hey we want we want the the better team we feel the Dodgers you know you want to go out and and win that game and and head out and soak up a little bit of that ad sunshine and take those cross the cross\nA you know across the ocean or trips that they have their a cross country uh trips I should say five five three two three four NBC is\nThe number of Christian theology although he did Homer in game seven still overall disappointing series a that we have Justin Turner although he did Homer in game two still a disappointing\nSeries overall Clinton Kurdish off pits well in one game not so well in another Walker ... same thing to be said for him\nBut boy this young man ever a rise to the occasion in game seven I mean this is a guy who's pitched in the SEC nothing like what are you seeing here buddy went through a great program at Vanderbilt the same one that put out David Price\nA Tyler Beatty a picture with the giants Pedro Alvarez\nA you know the list goes on and on I Believe dance we wanted if I'm not mistaken from there as well too so this is really a program that is not new to a cultivating\nAnd sending these young men off into the minor league baseball worlds and eventually working themselves up to the big league level and Walker Baylor came out and eat pets like and I mean it's like a boss from day one\nThey only through Seventy three pets are so that was a bit interesting as he came in and started one for two thirds innings gave up six hits but here's the thing a lot of those came with two outs and nobody on\nAnd if you do that you're able to keep the brewers off balance a little bit I Know Dodger fan so it was around some of them added he's sweating a little bit in the first inning oh God here we go\nCan't can't handle the press or he gave up around already but there's really a nice job to be able to rebound back and Cody balance or help them with a a two run blast\nIn the second inning so the Dodgers\nAnd the red Sox are when you look at those national fan base which is what they have when you look at the advertising dollars everything out there at stake east coast west coast a cold ... weather\nOld bent out of shape you know a Boston type of people per se and I love it back there in Cape Cod is really no more beautiful place other than that that I Know of in this country as well as you get out to LA and him and

Wyler\nHow surprised were you by the way he performed in is this something that given his mastery of the off chance he can continue\n[laughter] I was very surprised for the simple fact that I saw in practice during training camp and those were not impressive in Middle East I also saw him play and\nAh with the exception I think of one pre season games um you know he was he was not very good and\nIf you look at that and you put it against the backdrop of\nA career in which you know multiple teams have had him on the roster and then they didn't want him on the roster you figure you know this is not going to be a good experience just stressing a guy into a starting\nA Simon against a very good bears the friends that have potential defensive and the peace candidate\n... Mac and yet there was any through for three hundred maybe yards you had the two interceptions\nBut he also had three touchdowns and the dolphins racks out five hundred and forty one yard which was not just the most this year but it's the fifth most in the history and the other four\nWere done under Dan Marino so in San Marino Dan Marino Dan Marino Dan Marino oh yeah and ... and ... so\nThat was very surprising going forward he's going to start again this week probably next Thursday against the Houston Texans\nWhat I Would say to you that we're going to see now is at some point they're going to be a regression demean\nMeaning you're gonna get\nNot Ninety five quarterback grading broadcasts Wyler not three touchdowns rock house while are not\nNecessarily a five hundred and forty one yards of often broadcasts Wyler but you're going to get something much less which will get us to where he's the guy that he's always been\nBut let's say he can keep this going I Can't help but wonder Armando whether or not\nAdam gaze will continue to ride with broad costs water until Ryan tend to hell is quote unquote one hundred percent and we've seen that from time to time\nKenya won't be a hundred percent until ... while there does indeed regress to the mean and then hey pantyhose given us a better chance to win an Oscar Wilde but I feel like gay I think the smart players continue to play offs Wyler as long as he's playing well and\nIf Canada hills healthy well he's not really healthy 'cause he's not a hundred percent he's only Ninety eight percent\nPure banking on us while are playing well longer than it takes for tannahill to get healthy\nNo no I'm not saying that's going to happen but in the unlikely event that it would do you think gay students ethos while they're out there until the moment where he realizes it's time to flip back to thin out\nYeah I I obviously if prop ... plays like he did last Sunday and he does that stack games after game after game doing that they're not going back though Ryan tannahill right away it's going to be right and you're not a hundred percent yet\nYeah uh no not yet not yet not yet\nBut at my side and I don't have a crystal ball I don't know what's gonna happen\nMy thought is that period of time where broadcasts Wyler plays like last Sunday is not going to be very long and so call me a skeptic\n'em by definition that's what that is skepticism but I just don't think he can maintain that a\nCause and consistent quarterback play\nIs a lot harder to attain than stellar quarterback play you can be stellar for one day and that's amazing but consistent over multiple games over a season very few people do that\nIsn't that something to be said though for the fact that us father had his career bottom out the failed season with the Houston Texans then he'll get a shot at them next Thursday night\nBye to a game that otherwise may not have all that much faster but both teams can be over five hundred going into that game\nAnd you look at what happened last year he was on the grounds roster that ultimately would would go when lesson he wasn't deemed to be good enough to even make it onto a roster that wasn't able to win a single game\nMe for him any chance he plays now you just go out and let it rent because it's all it's all free money at this point it's all found doughnuts for him at this point\nBecause he thought it was over in the rest of us thought it was over\nDo a yum\n[laughter] yeah um it was\nLook this is a great story for broadcasts why are there is no doubt about it\nIs an improbable thing that he is doing it is the feel good kind of situation um you know the guy cast aside by multiple bad team suddenly get this chance and he's a magazine that\nBut again [laughter] [laughter] I don't want a raid on his parade but I just have to tell you brought over fast that\nEnds in a couple of weeks he's gonna be over for a oh this is going to be something that uh we're going to the four five six seven\nEight nine more games is just not what he has been in his career and I think if us even the Miami Dolphins in there if if you put truth serum into the entire organization if you send them to do one at least with truth serum\n[laughter] I think they would say hey you know what we're very happy\nAbout last Sunday but we don't know that this can continue until January\nLasts thirty seconds the dolphins are foreign to are they a viable playoff contender\nAbsolutely there is the season and the fifth day they're not in the play\nOffs but you know what they've got to winnable games coming up on Sunday at home against Detroit and then a Thursday night at Houston\nIf they win those two games are going to be six in to Florida teams that started the first half of the the the two\nTypically get into the playoffs\nAll right well hey Armando appreciate some of your time uh enjoy any donuts that may be left to save some for us the next time and we'll talk to you soon\nWell it

he had said hey man it is the rocks entity days you go through about a twelve days stretch\nWhere all the four major sports coincide with one another of course football is almost mid season right now baseball wrapping up we know who are World Series participants are that's exactly what the networks want it's exactly what I think a lot of the fans wanted as well to the Dodgers a gene that pose international\nAudience with their roots being from Brooklyn\nAnd the red Sox are the red Sox All right so you put those two together east coast west coast while I was going to be one hell of a series of storage on Tuesday then there's the NBA that is just a few games in\nAn already a little excitement here's I was a staple center earlier watching parts of the Lakers and the rockets and now as we're doing the show here you miss all the good stuff too because bench clearing brawl and\nI Know my friend Dave Smith who's a huge Lakers fan doesn't show before mine that that brought came out like the last thirty seconds of his a show where the benches cleared\nAnd the one thing about NBA people for the most part at least nowadays they fight like cities\nAre right it wasn't like when a now Rudy John John original curb it you know went at it back in the day was increase or we'll go isn't current rampant it's getting close wind and the Lakers versus the Celtics now it's more like just you know get a couple of little bitch lapse in and see where we can go is that's really what we had\nChris Paul pointing a State Farm loving finger enraged on Ron does face which to point it is one thing but to actually like I got your nose that is what he did once he was on so many times Rondo stepped into him hit him\nPaul hit him the benches clear they're trying to sort things out looks like we saw some blood out there on the floor which is which is nice to see that at least I I Know there's some testosterone a floating around\nWhich you don't often think so too many times but we saw it and of course trying to play these maker is LeBron James\nAnd a curse ball really wasn't having it because he went over to grab CB threes and get off the man this isn't the Olympic Games anymore not friends you know we're not buddies anymore\nAnd that game is going to be interesting as it's going to come out of a wire but they've been going on about ten minutes or so now that this thing has been stopped while they try to sort out who's going to get ejected or how it's going to be where it's going to go look site there are now just sorting things out with the free throws here as the rockets do leave at that game\nBut we're talking of course a major league baseball is ending not too long ago\nGame seven in Milwaukee and congrats to the Dodgers I I think the Dodgers have the better roster overall top to bottom\nOr they should I mean the highest payroll or in baseball with with what they have what they throw out there all the time comparable to an even more so than the Yankees despite all the hiring is that the Yankees have I mean this has been brewing for quite some time\nFor the Dodgers a Dodgers are an underdog in this World Series this video Vegas odds makers just put it out that the red Sox are a plus one thirty five\nI'm to the Dodgers a Dodgers are plus one Fifteen actually\nThe red Sox or minus one and thirty five cars or baseball you've had straight on the money like baseball's baseball's nearly impossible to bet if you ever try to well how many runs that they're going to win by the spread is always do that you can't go on it's got to be too so in order for you to cover its really one and a half\nYou have to go out and win by two runs words I mean look at some of these postseason games a lot of times\nThey are one Ron games I Will say this though not very compelling again six in game seven in Milwaukee as after the Dodgers took a three to lead back to the great state of Wisconsin you were thinking we were going to exchange blows one runway and hear another one run when they're like we saw in the beginning of the series it was anything but\nAnything bud is Milwaukee a boat race the Dodgers on Friday nights or to put some fans on edge in la la land only to have the Dodgers are I mean I was an impressive when\nOn Saturday nor the waiting sum it up they fell behind early in this game and Ballenger teed off after a one nothing deficit to make it to to one and then walk or bealer settled down and and quite honestly pitch better than anything we've seen adequate and her show in the post season\nAnd you couple that with the ... we're going yard as the Dodgers just have a so many big bats in the lineup that is until a they face a Red Sox team that is equally passed out\nAnd as stacked whether it's ... whether it is an herbal guards and we haven't even gotten to the J. D. Martinez so\nI mean the one hell of a series you're looking at starting pitching uh you would favor the red Sox bullpen\nA I don't know I mean you you'd like to maybe say the Dodgers I still don't know if we trust Kennedy Janson he that he has been better than a bowl season uh than what we saw in the regular season but as far as the ball bends I don't know\nIf that's a coin toss as far as the actual benches concern on the in Boston as a deeper bench a lineup one through nine I think Boston has better top heavy players but I think that uh the Dodgers are more balanced one through not and you have to worry about see any way you look at it should be a great series\nWe'll see if it goes seven games and being the fact that we start the series a little bit later we're not even starting a series until October twenty third can you imagine if this thing go seven\nThis thing goes seven we're going to end its in November I'd like to welcome and now the executive producer of the Bush leagues and of course that would be a good friend Jim and Dr ... second cousins you Richard right this and I always say looks just like I'm so first of all congratulations on your daughters I have to get it out\nThank you for saying that I Know that was difficult\nFor you it was and I would really be in a in a pissed off mood but I Will say this Oregon got smoked on the grid iron so when you know that you know that I I Love football and especially hockey and more so than anything else in the ... one of the overtime so you're going to have your World Series and glowed over that one there too I'm just\nHappy that ah that the next one and more in Portland, Oregon last you know so that nothing can go wrong the rest of the night I think any one by one of those lotto tickets perfect if I can strike at big out here so hey how you would know this sort of now I'm sure you could oh look this up here for us wins the latest the world series has ended\nOh there have been a one or two that have gone into the first couple of days in November okay so it has been one or two of them got man okay he could be looking at that Wynwood a game seven be if we\nGot that far up the red Sox we'll let it get that far as I got to tell you man I was impressed with what they did against Houston Houston was just an absolute buzz saw with the best starting pitching staff and there was no doubt about that I'm just look at the statistics and what they did and\nThe red Sox I don't want to say made it look easy but after a game on you're like OK Vern lander waves we got a series on her hand and then after that was just lights out\nI Want to take this opportunity to tell you about the growing threat of hepatitis C\nUntreated hepatitis C is the number one cause catastrophic liver damage and liver cancer\nAmericans born between Nineteen forty five in Nineteen sixty five I most\nIt's estimated that one and thirty baby boomers is\nFortunately new treatments can cure the virus in those cases for the first test is on and find out\nJust ask your health care provider for a simple blood test\nOr a baby boomer the test is covered by private insurers and Medicare\nHepatitis C shouldn't be a silent epidemic get tested and know your ... to learn more and for a list of local testing site\nIs it limited government dot org\nOoh this is Josh Groban ... my favorite thing about music is its ability to inspire and newer versions so\nThat's why I'm proud to work with Feeding America in an organization that inspires most families in and help them ... million kids in this country struggling with\nFeeding America nationwide network of food banks gather surplus food and helps get it to kids need\nMind on how you can help and Feeding America down\nOnto by Feeding America and the outcomes\nKelly Clarkson and I'm One of the country doesn't have the time and there's one thing I'd be everywhere in childhood hunger ...

can live and their mom and dad's home maybe help with the chores\nAnd they can go in their own room and watch Netflix if that's what they like and they will come and go as they please so it's become more accepting and acceptable for young people to live with their parents\nAnd guess what a lot of the parents say they kind of a life to help out that may be just the biggest challenges gleaming them off of this idea of continually helping their kids as it is a challenge to have these kids kind of get their umbilical cords cut and got out on their own\nDo you have any advice for parents who might

it they don't ultimately wind up in trouble financially and having to be a burden on those very same kid this\nThat they're trying to be so kind to and there needs to be discussions between the

connection between the weather and gun violence and the effects are significant here with the story info tracks really Mickey Roy\nThank you Chris we're talking with Jeff Asher he's a nationally recognized crime analyst based in New Orleans [noise] so do your research has showed a pretty clear connection between crime and the weather it's only common sense that there would be less crime on a frigid winter day versus warm summer day mother's more to it than that right\nWell I looked at specifically gun violence trying to track shooting based on what the lower high temperature wise from the and away and what it shows is as you say not surprisingly when it's really cold there are fewer shootings and when it's warmer there are more shooting\nThan we tend to associate this change as oh in the summer gets hot everyone goes outside and there's lots of gun violence but I think the real way to look at it is when it's cold people essentially have less shootings and there's less gun violence\nIt's not so much a when it's hot pattern much more effective when it's cold a couple of cities Philadelphia and Baltimore pat data that allowed you to separate whether or not a victim was inside or outside and when it showed is that it doesn't matter what the temperature is\nThe number of shooting victims that are inside is going to stay the same and both of those cities but the number of shooting victims that are outside can as much as double or triple and these cities when it say eighty five or Ninety degrees versus when at twenty degrees\nI understand you also found that these weather related swings and crime are more pronounced in northern cities\nOr right and that goes back to the fact\nThat it's more reliant on coal so in a city like Los Angeles or New Orleans where it rarely gets cold enough in the fifties and forties and thirties to really affect your shooting patterns you might have five or ten days a year where\nYou're going to have actual cold weather whereas if you're looking at Chicago or Detroit or Baltimore you're looking at many many many many more days per year that's actually cold\nAnd so you may see an\nEffect if there are more days where it's colder and a particular year you may have you know five to seven days in New Orleans whereas in Chicago you may have Seventy ten Ninety Days and that's a huge difference because that's twenty more days of fewer shootings versus one or two more days if you were shooting the New Orleans\nSo you sound as consistent in every major city or where there is some outliers maybe the book\nThe trend well it was consistent in every city I looked at except for San Francisco and San Francisco was largely due to the fact that it's never gets hot or never gets cold in San Francisco\nEvery other city the pattern was there to some degree and it was stronger in the northern city that was almost identical in cities like Detroit and Philadelphia in Chicago\nI knew the bulk of these violent crime statistics come from major cities and I'm sure the bulk of the shootings overall are in these cities do you think whether couldn't even be a factor in lower crime areas maybe rural areas\nAbsolutely I think it would be a factor in pretty much everywhere that it's colder longer or hotter longer that compared the murder count and every city that were the twenty most murder cities in the country in two thousand fourteen\nVersus their murder count the two thousand sixteen and all twenty cities had more murders and two dozen fourteenth than in two thousand sixteen\nAnd Eighteen of them had fewer

and\nI just can't wait till he comes on but before we bring him on let's talk a little bit about fast thing because it's also going to be about nutrition and fasting and how to live longer and how to do that and then kind of go through the fasting history\n[noise] well I think the first mentioned in a fast thing is in the Old Testament the book of Daniel which came up with the Daniel Fast which many religious congregations due periodically\nYeah they do they called the Daniel diet day you'll\nDie on writing Daniel sucked as a hunter [laughter] he had made excuses to you know what I didn't kill anything today we're going to do this thing called fasting all the good honors or over there and watch it on barbecue we don't do fast barbecue\n[laughter] I'm not sure that this a real good hunter became farmers [laughter] All right so let's talk about fasting as it is been with your practice\n[noise] well I think fasting is been a I'm part of we we we fast and I was talking to picture day we have day night cycles we of you know growing and leptin working opposition\n... main our listeners don't nobody grilling locked in our so ... well that absolute\nInsulin you know you eat your body puts out insulin or when you're not eating are you in the fasting state then you put out\nA book or gone to keep your butcher so you know there's hormones that are in opposition there's muscle groups that are in opposition biceps Lexus triceps extends so you know nature has this way of having office equal and opposite components to something\nYou know with nutrition it's the same you know you should eat and then and then you should know then you should not right and you know just like there's day night cycles and things and the problem is uh\nWe've gotten to where a lot of people grazed and they're not ever and reading a ring of truth fasting state uh and so they don't get that you know ancient man sun goes down wasn't a good time to be all wandering the forest you have probably not staged bill and didn't eat\nSays all the good animals come out at night right\nNow studies have shown that prolong fasting uh affects our telomeres Senate beneficial way so people that have been starvation mode their telomeres stay longer and don't shortness quickly\nThat's not a good reason to fast for we caught and but\nI think that a lot of uh current fasting schedules including intermittent fasting do affect telomeres Senate beneficial way again for our listeners telomeres are the part of the DNA that controls cell replication and when they stay long you live longer when they go short you don't live with flunk\nSo All right I Want to ask you a question do you ever fast\nEvery day for what you say when your sleep ... beyond that it's okay to prolong betterment fast and yes you do that do you do the diet we've done these died of the fasting mimicking dies yeah there's that long ago but our gas coming ... been there done that but\nGood role I Can't wait until he until he can kinda talk through your experience going through what he says to do you know there is an interesting thing I I'm I go to church the lady who started eating only eight hours a day\nRookie by the council of graduate dot org and [noise]\nTo be shorter day young America dot com more gold aid for for a well one hundred\nWe are talking about how longevity and your nutrition\nHow FAST Team plays that role in longevity and coming up we have Balter long ago he may be amazing longevity specialists and he'll be joining us from Italy\nStarting a disturbance or mortality probably say first grasp the concept of that time what more do this or more than that we have an article it's coming out of the University of Carolina and what this article deals with is just showing what does the underlying causes for you to be could be linked to a specific protein\nIn L. A. R. P. twelve that protects against obesity and insulin resistance in the study showed that folks who are deficient in this protein were higher risk for developing obesity and this is a protein is produced\nBy gut bacteria certain factors or titan or be back to nine years go by certain gut bacteria produce the protein which than binds with the receptor and reduces the risk of developing OPEC so\nThere may be a you know again obesity multi factorial is not always as simple as I overeat or sometimes there can be a\nBiochemical bio physiological even got biome issues that contribute to it so that\nProbably more and more so than not I would assume well why don't we ask our gas cars they have all too long ago and he is actually on the phone from Italy to be at the gym professor and gerontology and professor in biological science he's also the director at the U. S. C. longevity Institute\nYou have probably seen around here very well publishes a book out the longevity diet\nAnd I were still like to have you on a small ...\nAnd I think do you want to comment on what Dr Anderson is that in the four we get in\nThe bacteria that affecting there'll be the uh [noise]\nAnd um yeah so um there's some reports or from the past it as something that's something that is you know\nAnd I'm In a very interesting of course the\nDiet can affect the what's called the microbiology of the bacteria in microorganisms that live in the ... and are engaged microorganisms cannot govern uh who get seen and was processes\nAnd um but they also seem surprisingly to have a get control many many different functions including\nUses them for example uh but I also have an effect on the nervous system and in this case a potentially and the um the function of the end of crime\nOr that that speaks a lot to what are you know some of the questions by the way I'm going to be seen you the conference in California you're in November and a new one of the questions and I'll put it out now is a when you modify the die with the fasting mimicking diets um does that\nHas been ... been studied how does that modify one Scott bio\nWell we're doing that right now\nAnd so that's um that's one of our next publications and I I I can go too much about it but let's say that that um as a big impact on the I'm I'm the micro biome\nI Would think so I'm just curious what got you into this uh this field or why is this so important to you\nWell I I've been doing this since I I think that was in Texas studying in as the notion of Texas and the music student and and I just talked to a union lunch I mean it was such an extraordinary field that I I'm\nNow this is really you didn't take the course them how to conduct a marching band [laughter]\nYeah that's right that's correct it really they don't want me to do that and um I told them there was\nNo way there was going to do that [laughter]\nA Shaw told me that you have to find something else to do that and I I\nJust wanted to do um I just had to be in the back of my mind because I switched to just biochemistry ice sheet to buy the department's for the purpose of study and he saw this I was very clear on what I wanted to do\nTo universal disease right aging affects everybody right [laughter]\nYeah I just felt that it was surprising that a ... really I mean there's lots of people were working at it but it was really unknown field you know back then I'm and I'm In and it was just surprised that people are focusing in on people that had to eat it and not\nOn the fact that most of the car when you're older\nI'm In saw yeah I thought that was a fantastic science a challenge but also an increase\nYou for medicine what year was that volunteer\nIn Nineteen eighty\nYou still had a bird or I mean you actually were way ahead of the curve did did you have colleagues or other people on that in science and medicine like kind of shaking their head wondering why why you thought this was so important\n[noise] actually these when all the way over my and my uh you know way and we pretty much had to hide the fact that we're working on aging everybody thought it was\nDumb [laughter] which is surprising right now it's almost like surprising\nTo say but uh yeah we we we will say something else he would never say working any\nIt was a view is going to be buried in a field and you can change but uh but making all the way to assure in undergraduate or\nA man to graduate years but also UCLA make each year\nIt was just like a ... the um some some uh feel that that was not that interesting or or something he was so complex and a and a certainty that\nNo one took issue with\nSomeone now it's like all their age so I you know I Know we're going to have to go to a break and so I Want to get started on this topic I might have to cut you off in the longevity die you base your recommendations on five pillars longevity maybe you can give us the first one before we got to break\nFor the first one is certainly a research my six set ourselves focused on aging and loans and help the longevity\nSo taking the basic sciences than the you know what you find out in the research lab and so using that as one of the pillars to support or not just diet is is a form of age management but as a way to prevent disease or disease prevention\nBut not not just about diet but about dry about Jean about drugs so it's\nGoing to lead to say I ... and three months later it'd be great but um it's much much much more important to say the fighting is beach in for three months and then I did for the next Thirty years easiest person go live long and healthy\nAh and that's a that's something that you can only guy from basic research right now because you can't do a human\nWe're beginning to think about that but certainly in most cases I don't really like human clinical trials longevity and I'm sure you have to realize they pretty well if I Do a fasting mimicking diets\nAre going to make a mouse live longer and healthier\nHoliday that hold that thought no direct we got to go to a break when we come back

didn't even know when he was talking about half the time he said the sides of the trench were too steep and it was level the cave\nIn all he and I have discussed that but I've been digging in this kind of rock and grab all for Thirty years and you develop a feeling for what you can and can't do with it the trenches perfectly All right ... agrees with me and you know I wouldn't endanger the men and I\nTold you he was crazy and now he's young muse excitable conscientious but not really crazy oh bother you always like everything he's also a first\nClass assistant I'm lucky to or I don't overdo it and he most certainly doesn't want me out of the way that there is some sort of plot isn't there oh I\nI really don't think so Carolyn that's you're not completely sure I Am\n[noise]\nGerald convinced me at last that he and I should talk seriously about our succession of accidents\nThey simply could not be plain bad luck you said an unknown person was trying to bring our work to a halt he pointed out that since Ahmed and I had nearly been killed by the rock slide our enemy was his word would stop at nothing that you're always urging I posted special guards around my tend to be sure that no one would eavesdrop\nAnd he met inside to discuss our situation\nWhen you get right down to a doctor Lambert your daughter Caroline and the only person here who can't be assessed really Gerald if you're going to pick on Iran now you agree that we should talk reluctant leaving so you agreed\nNow Carolyn didn't get here till after the so called accident so she has a suspect's you by the way what me\nReally oh yeah she's she's quite from about it [laughter] well you tell her\nThat I wouldn't plot against you till after you've actually found the pharaohs to once you've done all the hard work then I'll get rid of you and take over why don't you speak to her yourself 'cause she's avoiding the or that won't last long what is she really think my motive is\nPretty much just what you said that you'd like to take over the big\nLet's pose that does look like a possibility\nOkay I'm a suspect\nNow what about um out of the question he was with me when the rocks fell but he wasn't hurt was well no but also that word when consider him the boss not you know don't forget we allow Ahmed to distribute their pay I don't see your point I only mean that he's got a whole crew of willing accomplishes all\nRight I'm as a second on the list now let's consider for what he's even less likely suspect them on it and he'd need accomplices to he couldn't have carried off the tools all by himself\nAnd the work and don't even like him as far as I can tell no he acts pretty superior most of the time oh he's an extremely intelligent man well educated in Egypt that puts him in a special classes also comparatively well paid I imagine\nWhich means that he could hire accomplices don't fall I think but now let's put his name don't know who else is there more ... our own you're right I hate [laughter] we actually don't know much about how to do it you\nKnow not really he's floods nephew he's a nearly finished school seems to like visiting the big but I Can't remember when he was here and when he wasn't new like a nine spare many case that my list of suspects more ... the least likely kids afraid of his own shadow\n[noise] what about motives [noise] considering Ahmed first he'd be out of a job if we shut down so I Can't imagine why\nJust before the rocks lied he and I were talking about uh that's not important I don't know what did he say when they mentioned the scare open you never told me that\nWas hardly seem necessary what is the only thing\nOther than tons of gravel then we have dug up so far\nThe scale of core exactly the scare of it and I think\nThe key to the whole plot but it's nothing Jerry it's plaster it's even badly made probably a clumsy attempt by an apprentice you all are you and I know that because we're looking at it\nAs American archaeologists are you mean someone who doesn't know what it really is might think it was enormously valuable or enormously important I don't know that's interesting um it appears to think it's important\nYou said so that's just my point\nSome Egyptians might very well see all sorts of religious or political significance in it things that you and I would never dream of I suppose we take the

the brink electrically Dr Michael [noise]\nOne of the nice things about doing the show is you're you're always learning\nA couple of things and we just learned\nNever has never been settled in Thirteen almost fourteen years on the show nobody's ever said that\nIt's not as if the guest didn't know it\nDidn't have enough sense to reveal its [laughter] or\nThe the maybe the opportunity may maybe I give them the benefit should give them the benefit of the doubt but Royce you're two things here\nThat are critical one\nAnd this stems from the story that reporting on yesterday about the ... the the the FDA now has now done an analysis and found over eight hundred products with pharmaceutical a elements in the ... in the in the supplements which turns their supplements into quasar drugs I guess\nAnd I was asking right about that he's not shocked he said in China it is common to mix herbal compounds with aspirin or some other pharmaceutical\nTo get the effect\nAnd then he mentioned in Germany the second thing we learned was that in Germany they will mix and match\nThe a verbal compounds with the drugs to give the drug in the morning give a herbal compound\nIn the afternoon and then the drug at night they'll do that for a while then I'll switch it around to wean the patient off the drug\nI never knew that and that's why we that's why we do the show [laughter] um and I I find that all intriguing a\nRoy walking back what that protocol is used in Germany or do you ... can you would you advocate for that or do you find that a legitimate protocol\nYeah it's a legitimate protocol additional clarification that the drugs that typically mixed in herbal formula is only in Asia that that doesn't only in Asia right in Asia so most of those products are coming from Asia [noise]\nShows that pill that's out now illegal to do with the United states and obviously people just you know breaking the law and they do become approved drugs they're no longer with us as soon as you put a pharmaceutical been something\nIt's a drug to dry rate OK Dorian FDA has the authority to take that off the market as they should [laughter] but it is a legitimate protocol but here's the thing and uh and studies at work done in China\nThey actually tree are people so if you have ... you know cardiovascular disease or central hypertension depending on where you are the tree our scale they might ... you would just lifestyle modification\nExercise diet stress reduction things like that they the second tier is to do the lifestyle plus the herbs for third tier is to do lifestyle\n... non verbal drugs like dire Reddick for high ... high protected says never talk category 'cause that's\nWhen you go to medication and most of the time and eighty percent of the cases you can actually deal with for example cardiovascular disease as need orders taught us many years ago simply through lifestyle herbal remedies eighty percent\nOr and as far as the Chinese research is a concern don't need to ever use drugs they can just start with verbal product for the lifestyle so to me that he so while it is it legitimate\nProtocol to integrate herbs with\nConventional medications many times you don't need it\nWhile eight eight seven seven eight nine seven eight to five five eight seven seven eight nine seven talked talked a chatting with joy Upton from planetary ... and the protocol to be clear\nThere were two two separate issues here one the mixing of drugs with a ...\nAnd in China and to the protocol in Germany where they give the drug in the morning a an herbal compound and in a more in the afternoon and then the drug at night and there'll be a problem that switch it around\nA did get to wean the patient off that sounds that sounds clever to me um and it\nWas the goal Michael's and there's all above reducing the harm that typically associated with conventional medication yeah\nThis is interesting uh\nI find it so intriguing and I know in Germany\nThe er and I don't know what the government agency is called but I Know that I've learned over the years and my reading them from guest that the government scrutinized as\nThese herbal um products closely in fact as I was I learned\nThat the government will even go out to where they're growing them and they want everything uniform they just this oil and all of that I mean I understand it very closely monitored is that true\nIt's it's relatively true and all the herbal products on the job market have to be made by what I call ...\nStandard yeah well the German farming appear outlines what quality material\nHas to go into the herbal products what dosage you'd have to\nBe how it has to be tested so it is much more stringent than here the rules are still in place here but the companies actually have the ability to make their own standards where most of the world do half the fall of what it called like a male standards\nI understand the reality of herbal products safety is the theme of of what we want to talk about today with you a and you were mentioning in your notes to me regulations ensuring herbal products safety what are those regulations Roy here in the country\nWell the first one is the dietary supplement to help with education I mean that's what governor dietary will the torch includes herbal products and\nI didn't learn from the perspective of the ... or something for help with education I verbal supplement or a sub category it all supplements nutritional amino acids whatever their sub\nCategory of food\nAnd inherently by definition foods must be safe before they're marketing so you cannot and they don't have the authority to toxic verbal or traditional supplementing radio\nIn the marketing back to the Arab League against the law so that the most overarching regulation and that says that before you ever put something out of the market it must be quote unquote and food and say\nOkay so when we come back we'll explore that and that sort of dispel the notion and the myth\nThere are no regulations over these dietary supplements\nIs categorically unequivocally\nBalls they are regulated as Roy just described to come back you're listening to let's talk

are more potential positive interactions that can occur with conventional medications and negative that's one thing you said and one and\nThat's actually something that never discuss only the only ever see negative interactions discuss nuts\nSo the concept of using an herbal medicine can Josh what the cardiovascular medication that if you take it for a long time they have actually a negative

become you know the ... facto spokesman for the league\nWhen asked about the old occasion said he didn't see it\nWhich is always that's that's the best go to answer\nJust making it worse and putting yourself in a in a corner just just do all the bronze you just say you didn't see it just lie and I'm kidding I never condone letting lying but that's [laughter]\nThat's essentially what what he's saying he didn't want to get involved in it so we're waiting we're waiting to see what comes down today the rockets actually have to play back to back there here in LA they played the Lakers last night and they're going to play the clippers tonight this has become kind of a new thing in the NBA they used to not do what they used to kind of spread it out\nBut now they're trying to take advantage of cut down the travel a little bit so\nThey'll have you'll see now more and more teams will play the Lakers and then the clippers back to back for whatever that's worth and we've got the rams the only undefeated team left or the NFL\nGoing for seven to no later today\nOn the road against the forty niners and as as much as this is like a a a blow out on paper right and you figure it's pretty much a gimme for the rams because the the forty niners are so bad believe it or not despite the loss of Jimmy ... below andme MacKinnon the running back to the side of the off season\nBelieve it or not over the last two games back to back weeks the forty niners and they're often with seeds you better have actually gone gone over four hundred yards in both games\nSo it's not like they're just you know three and out and subtly fulfilled tries but they almost almost pulled out that when Monday Night at limbo against the pack so this is a rivalry game it's uh divisional game and maybe it will be closer than people think well see ah the rams kind of\nWant to say that led up but they were they were kind of in it last week for a while in Denver against the Broncos and just kind of played down to the competition before making stops similar to Seattle I mean that the defense the rams defense in Seattle give up some really big runs got the Seahawks running game going but\nAs the good teams do when they need to make a stop when they need the big play they did and they did it have to get the win same kind of thing last week in Denver we'll see if ah the rams come out firing today up north by\nThe bay All right so we've got an action packed show coming up at the bottom of the hour Josh alber from pro football talk dot com is going to join us a lot going on in the NFL as you can imagine and\nWe've got the bears and the patriots coming up at the top of the out from soldier field and this is Ron Ron ... story just it just kind of came out of nowhere\nOr not only did Rob Gronkowski not travel with the team he's already been ruled out for today he's not going to show up he's not going to play and this ah came on the heels of of reports and it just makes you wonder if if ... self leaked it out because he's he's stayed at home but reports\nThat came out there were there you know ... on a busy Saturday for college football\nYou checking checking the stories yesterday reports that Rob Gronkowski is unlikely to be back with the patriots next season and so when you have something like that that just kinda comes out of nowhere on week seven\nI mean this after the patriots kind of read did his deal and you know the tough thing about Rob Gronkowski yet the patriots\nRe did his deal a little bit before the season started but the bulk of the the extra money that that he's able to make\nIs based on incentives and play time so if he misses you know some considerable time here with his back and ankle issue is probably not going to get that extra cash so you know maybe maybe he's upset about that maybe\nHe just feels like a the patriots do value him the way that they should and he feels like maybe if he hits the market\nOr or gets another opportunity a a a different team would regard him higher and maybe pay him more\nI don't know we'll see but just I I always get kind of fishy when things like that kind of leak out of nowhere especially you know week seven in the NFL so that's it that's one storyline um\nIn case you to know the the trade deadline for the NFL as a week from Tuesday and they're all kinds of little nuggets that came out today reports that the cowboys are looking to acquire a Mari Cooper from the raiders but I don't think they want to give up the first round pick that John and rude and in the raiders want in return\nOut everybody

back lifted his arm up with the ball and when all the way back and brought the ball across the goal line as he was pulling backwards but\nAfter replay they ruled that his shoulder\nHit the ground right before his arm and more importantly is handled the ball cross the plane and so it's boring and inches forth in about a little over six inches ... goal thirty five seconds left\nOr the chargers after they saw the titans formation called a timeout so they're breaking the huddle right now for the end goal and we'll see mark is Mario to just keeps it and do the you know the Tom Brady right up to\nAnd we'll see the titans can do to know who's going to pass it and it is a catch for a touchdown so now the question becomes\nDoes uh my ... go for the tie or does he go for two and the wind thirty one second thoughts I think they're going to go for two I think they are going to go for two so I I misspoke I thought that\n... and the titans would go for the time and then tried in overtime but considering\nI didn't get teams more and more they were going to see the trend teams [laughter] want to get a void overtime if if at all possible I mean you have to get there right you don't want to lose the game you'd rather have at least go to overtime and try to win and lose the game and regulation\nBut the way that the overtime is gone for so many teams it's not been good so they are going to go for two\nThe wind here in London and still it's going to leave about\nAbout twenty eight seconds left or so for the chargers and you have to wonder will that be enough time for Philip Rivers and that ... to maybe getting fuel go range to what it is a flag down incomplete pass I'm a to point try the question is\nWho was the flag again was it again the penalty a defense of penalty for the chargers or against the titans province of interference we're going to find out\nA momentarily so I Know we're a technically we're not supposed to do play by play it is against the chargers wild so

O. R. H. I. M. S. dot com slash hope today and get started for just five dollars while supplies last\nIf if a bit short handed Vikings defense then or the confidence is just going to keep rising it that that the jets were you know right on the money with the way they they handle things in the draft\nAnd for the Vikings you know it it's it's sort of felt like they you know they they fell on their face right out of the day but the last two weeks it's it's look a lot better um the injuries are our concern but it's a win today would certainly you know again it be three in a row for them to and\nAs you said a big road when for a team that looks like they're rounding into form and and should be much better in the second half their\nYou know really looking forward to that one also I think ... maybe at a different level but clearly a statement game as well Josh\nThe eagles and the Panthers in Philly or this this panther team they still I don't know it just seems like something's missing I Know that they've they've had some wins came up short last week in Washington but it seems like there's still something not right with them and of course the eagles were trying to get things going coming up the big went over the giants\n[noise] yeah I I think the eagles there are a lot like the Vikings in terms of uh you know teams that that were ... you know obviously one ... one big last year and\nNeeded their time to take the take shape now the you know the eagles seems to be getting a little healthier while the the Vikings are more injuries but I I think that the eagles looked\nReally good last week they had ten more days now to work out a any kings and get get a better idea of where where they want to go up and ... and I think the Panthers or or the ... you know the opposite direction offensively it's still looks like they're\nThey're stuck and and they go from week to week not knowing what kind of offensive football team they want to be and I think until they sort that out it's going to be tough for them to win consistently but they do they do have the talent to win while they're figuring that out and that'll you know the defense all have to carry the day though I think until the ... it's really gets better sense of itself\nYeah it's kind of a surprise too don't you think Josh considering that everybody thought the north Turner was going to come in and kind of make everything right and smooth and everything was going to go great but like you said we tweak you you just don't know what's gonna happen\nYeah and and I I think you know I I think that north Turner it's kind of it's kind of been that way as last couple of stops and and\nThere are a week's worth of stuff works but it doesn't he he does there isn't that sort of okay here's a plan B and here's something else we can do they they pretty much come right out you you know what they're doing if you stop it they're going to come and try and do it again and ah that hasn't really proven to be the best opposite strategy in in the current NFL\nJosh helper pro football talk dot com with us here on NBC Sports radio I think\nJosh clearly that the biggest disappointment in the emcee would have to be the jags or feels like they're kind of this is like a kind of a fork in the road moment either they're going to kind of bottom out and bounce back and kind of get things right or they're going to go off a cliff here a big game today and home against the Texans Texans\nI hadn't realized that I Know they've they've had the whenever the cowboys but they've they've actually won three in a row after the on three start so they're getting it together yeah they\nThey have a ... last week against the bills they got pretty well gifted or a win with Nathan Peter man but um [laughter] they all count\nThey'll [laughter] same in the standings I'm\nI'm interested to see the show in ... and ... you know all this talk about how how banged up he really is and if the jaguars defense which is the has the pieces through you know get after him if if they can rattle him early that could you know could pave the way for the jacks do have a much more comfortable game but if they have to rely on on Blake portals again\nAh you know it's been rough and it it looks like two years ago bored holes and and that if if that continues then it's hard to see the jaguars you know putting the pieces back together just because they you know they they\nBring me they don't run the ball well enough for a team that wants to be run first to uh to survive off on somebody like that\nAll right John ... yeah last couple of more or less you do hear a big lake came seem to Baltimore the ravens the only team that Drew Brees has yet to be\nUm you know we know about the saints and and what they're doing a pencil lead the the ravens look good time you know they had the big win in Pittsburgh I'm at Saturday Night game then they they they ... times offensively uh what do you think of this one today\nAre a good I think another one of those like what you're saying with the Vikings and jets a pretty good bellwether game for these two teams it's a\nYou know the the saints coming off the by and you know they they got all the Drew Brees while the first round of Drew Brees record stuff right out of the way are first and second round uh so he you know he's probably gonna throw these five hundred touchdown\nUm what else he does though and you know the ravens last week at eleven fact I don't think they're going to get eleven socks again but the defense can certainly hang\nWith a team like the same if ah\nIf they can stop the run I think that's going to be the the biggest thing for them it's you know you know brief will make some place in the air but if if the saints are able to run the ball with ...\nI I think if they're really going to pressure the the ravens to have to make place or they're offensively and I think that's still a a hit or miss proposition Joe Fox has been better this season but it it's still I think I hit or miss proposition if you ask them to put up points to win again\nAll right and tonight the Sunday night game on NBC another one for the chiefs flexed in back in arrowhead to take on the bangles or I you know I think the chiefs back home in Kansas City that means more explosive plays for the ... and\nYou know this bangles team after that last last week Joshua in Pittsburgh or at home against the Steelers just kind of seems like a microcosm of just this this run with any old than Martin Louis they just\nCan't can't get the big when when they need to get it um do do you give them a chance tonight\nYeah because\nI I think the ... you know their their offices explosive enough with Nixon and green and [noise] ah Tyler Boyd or to John Ross they they they're explosive enough to make plays uh Cincinnati up and simply\nI I just I I think that you know their defense is is good but I I think after last week any doubt that the the ... the chiefs are going to find a way to get points against anyone at at any point of the game is a pretty well answered so I I think that that that's the reason I\nThe chances I think they can put the points back up on a on a shaky cheaply but that said I I Would take the cheats the night I I think probably in a fairly comfortable doing\nAll right and Leslie Josh you the trade deadline is coming up a week from Tuesday or still no word of Pittsburgh Olivia bill are ruining as as you guys put up a pro football talked about Tom says he doesn't expect them to trade levy on bill\nBut we still haven't heard from everybody thought it was going to be here this week this past week hasn't shown up yet or if you will see some action here coming up\nI think they will definitely be action I I Do not ultimately think the bell betrayed it because I I just think that from a compensation standpoint for for the for the acquiring team a with no guarantee that you get him beyond that you know this would change of a running back on a contender were to blur out if they feel this week at\nA party that though I think it's a it's a lot to give up a to ask for a player who may be on your team for six\nYeah All right

home from the hospital in everybody's fine in April\nThat event is than behind us in any worries are threats or anything we would have had about that is behind us right\nUm well I mean there's the

hiccups and when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now it's about a Seventy seven thousand okay\nSo let's say you save up twenty five thousand dollars between now and then to use it in twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your told him when he make over and take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it at the at those a student loan you will of lost no ground\nOkay unless you go baby spending crazy during the next few months\nWe had a lot of stuff like this is our second child how can you had a

Talking about by by because you've had some friends do that or they just like oh dropped twenty grand to get ready for\nYou know on a pound human being I mean they just go nuts and so if you'll just

it on baby a than is necessary for by by survival\nAnd uh we uh throw it at the dead one by being mommy come home we pushed play again the pause comes off\nAnd we get out of debt as fast as we can but in the meantime we just created all your loses a little bit of interest on that money between now and the time the babies delivered that's all you lose it's not a big deal\nTerm and he said they blame the talking about oh a permanent insurance not portfolio base\nPermanent insurance which is what you have to\nDo it they'll bad shall we still didn't get the term\nI don't know he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey [laughter] because they Ramsey doesn't it\nInvestments real clearing the lesson you heard me yeah when I never tell you under any circumstances to use life insurance has an investment vehicle one hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo what do you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nI Would say you need a new financial advisor that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial adviser you have a life insurance salesman\nOkay they're selling you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do it switched to four hundred thousand just term H. and then that money when you were because it was like three hundred dollars a month which I Do a lot yeah um and just go ahead and open up our by Roth are IRA and start getting money into that\n... mutual funds okay that's exactly what you learn in class wasn't yeah so you already knew what she said he didn't like which tells me one of the things either this guy's a liar or he's ignoring\nRight [laughter]\nHe's a family friend who's in the [noise] um actually one of our friends that apparently gave and our number ... than for as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which it is I mean I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I have never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nNight last thing it on our term policy um on your class he said you know twenty or Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy what then can we were eighty with hand\n[laughter]\nOkay why don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much this guy's overcharged you for everything you sold your\nCar and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\nHey that sounds like well Oregon ... around in the end of this week\n[noise] All right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically [noise] um\nThe people who sell investment based or whole life or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance\nNot happy with me they don't like me\nAnd so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nCrap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing\nWhen you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been on a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die\nWith cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a better rate of return and when you die they keep it all so bad savings account it's bad investment broker\nThe pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nAnd that's what Dave Ramsey has always had for twenty five years here on the air upset and for twenty five years is alive owned myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment\nInsurance of any kind ever and I did get a horrible northwestern mutual\nWhole wife grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany there was a guy my wife knew from college came around us out one right after we got married and we bought this crap from\nHim I had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was\nAnd got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy anything other than\nFifteen to twenty year\nTerm life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker that shop several companies and get you the best possible deal\nOr their car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind of let her broker shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of Neal and that's why we've endorsed for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from slander and I don't own Zander insurance on around any of it that show that while this always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeffers done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason he done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price own term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple and takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again yet again and again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance out by the way a broker you know like even with your car insurance jump on the email with to get what they are usually a north local providers for your for what we called PNC property in casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance\nYou can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business a captive agent can sell for one company like a state for a major\nForeign
