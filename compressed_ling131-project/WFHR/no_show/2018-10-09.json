make sure the becomes the record holder there is no question Sean Payton and company know how close the is and not that they have to go out of their way to get through two hundred and one yard I mean

this guy is every bit of special he may play the game a different way but as I\nCaught a store or the quarterback position and that guy that played very similarly I truly appreciate how he plays with

was very competitive and let's get some thoughts on some numbers and just a second but free is we just heard and break the record right\nThere and a touchdown pass of sixty two yards of all things yeah what a great way or the kind of center if we're what an exclamation point on that record with a with a huge shut down fast but\nBut yeah I I just had a chance to talk to you before the game and I tell you what I just I Love the guy and it was fun to be able to just share my appreciation in person with him\nJust for the way he plays the game is that\nYou know I play the game for a long time and I respect a lot of guys and and how they do it and how they've done it over the years but you guys ever spent more than than Drew Brees and you guys that that I enjoy watching more than here because of the way he plays the game\nOne thing too about breeze and we mentioned there's a couple of times in the broadcast here's a six consecutive game without an interception it's the longest streak of his career\nOr he is now and he throws a lot as we know tonight he was more moderate because it's such a commanding lead and everything was working but he is now gone two hundred and thirty two consecutive passes without a pick\nAnd that's impressive either because one of the things over the years with through as we know that he hasn't always been on the best teams and a lot of times they had to out score people to win games I mean they even lost a couple of games this year again this year or when they squirt forty point so\nHe's been used to having to make every play for this team and one thing I Love about the unit that they put together as they've got\nYou know those guys coming out of the backfield that really make Druze job easier and take some pressure off of him in the play action has become such a vital part of this off and that we never saw before and so now drew isn't having to make every play or the plays that he's having to make her a little bit easier\nAnd now you're seeing the totality of who Drew Brees is where he can just play football and allow the game to come to him and you're seeing unbelievable stats over there\nFor a guy that's been incredible for a long time\nHe's thirty nine as we mentioned he is played Eighteen years in the NFL or out of Perdue and drafted by the chargers in ah went through free agency went through a very serious debilitating shoulder injury videos got back and obviously thrive problem you've got the perfect match with the head coach\nIn Sean Payton I mean you do the toilet takes Brady is forty one\nBreezes thirty nine I mean there's nothing to see the breeze can't play another couple of years at a very high level\nNot not at all I mean you go down there and watch him in a in a routine that he has any attention to detail in the way he takes care of himself I mean all of that stuff you know you're mentioning all that stuff and it's just amazing 'cause you think about the history of our game and how things could have been so different\nIf he you know whatever leaves the San Diego at the time or Miami was about to sign him and then he didn't pass the physical and he comes here in science and then you know a whole new chapter in our great game was written it and it's just you know it's crazy you know so much of it is a\nYou know timing is everything in the right people together him and Sean Payton have been\nA perfect marriage a perfect fit I'm\n... and we've all been able to uh to benefit from it all of us that are fans to have a chance to witness I'm\nYou know ... you have to enjoy it you appreciate it um and you hang onto it as long as you can so I'm I'm hoping that we get to see at least a couple more years of Drew Brees and Tom Brady because I don't know if we'll ever see a another thing like it\nSo breezes been here since two thousand six it's two thousand Eighteen is we all know is that this long stretch the same coach\nThe same all fans are different parts and I and I think that maybe as we wind up this conversation on this historic night the NFL we look that he is gone from like one generation of team to the next generation I mean look how young some of these kids are that he is now\nBeing surrounded by but there was a time where there this team was it a bit of a trough and and there wasn't a whole lot around Drew Brees to excel yet he navigate it this way through that from the super bowl year than that they they bought a little bit now they've come back up and they appear to be as strong as ever\nFor I don't think you can overstate that either is that you know when you get to the point where your Fifteen sixteen years older than the guys you're playing and they're looking at you and your the old man and you don't understand the technology or you don't always understand the music\nTo be able to connect with those guys and leave those guys that have a relationship with those guys I'm I I don't think you could overstate how important that is and yeah it's work ethic and its respect in its understanding what he did\nBut it's also his commitment to the organization and being here connecting with those guys and he's done it for a long time and you can talk to the oldest guy\nOn this roster or the guy that's been within the longest and the youngest and they all say the same thing about him and I just think that speaks to as much as anything the character of demand even more than the player and self\nDrew Brees passes Peyton Manning is the NFL record for career passing your two throws three touchdowns tonight over three hundred and sixty

weeks we have to unwritten teams to Kansas City and the Los Angeles rams\nWell yeah and you know those two teams are playing extremely well and you're seeing in this often civic explosive year are the two teams with the best officers are the only two teams in the league they have a two game lead\nIn their division and I think that's the other thing that jumps out to me as you look at all the other divisions in football and there's either a tie it to lead or one game lead and so there's a lot to be determined yet teams are still trying to figure themselves out\nOn the agency side we talk about the chiefs and then I look at the ravens who took a loss to the browns yesterday I thought they were one of the most balance teams\nDidn't get there often go in New England we saw them last Thursday night you start to feel like they're kind of rounding in to form a little bit and then you go over to the the NFC side and\nI mean Green Bay didn't look very good yesterday I mean Chicago is sitting on the top of that division we saw New Orleans tonight we know they're explosive and in Carolina\nPlaying some pretty good football but um you know it's going to be interesting because I think there's a lot to be determined yet\nWe haven't really seen who these teams are going to be outside of those couple of teams you mentioned at the top and so ah just like just like every year every game is important and it's going to be fun down the stretch as these team starts shaping into you know who's going to be the teams to beat a you know come playoff time does\nIt feel to you like New England

you look at the team a couple of weeks ago we were asking oh man this time and have enough weapons\nOn this team and now that I look at it I mean now it's almost like he's got so many different kinds

I watch Alabama for\nAnd they're off in a second to none there often is just absolutely disgusting and you look at what has occurred with through a tiger by law he has got to be far and away right now the eyes and favorite\nShow have you seen his statistics this year and what he's done he never plays a fourth quarter Eighteen touchdown\nReception yet in six games it's kind of sick\nAny completing Seventy five percent of his past is I think it is fair to say in great McIlroy was actually on the broadcast and he said look I mean he's the best quarterback saving his hat and macaroni he's the guy that they've been at it as well and I think he's clearly a better prospect in Asia and the care and was\n... and ... ... she's depressive but don't underestimate what he has the skill positions he has probably two running backs were going to be first round picks to\nDamien Harris is one of the most under appreciated players in Alabama's recent memory he's going to be the first ... back in history that three straight passing yards seasons\nNot G.

Cooper Calvin Ridley it's now Jerry Judy was averaging Sean twenty four point three yards a catch ... touchdowns on twenty three reception Henry rugs the third jailing wattle\nDivine pay Smith these guys are ridiculous Alabama offensive Jonah Williams will be the first left tackle\nProbably taken into traps Alabama has no holes\nDefensively there are some concerns\nThe secondary was Israel itself on digs his brother they did and he's he's one or two maybe may have been the best quarterback yeah\nBut you have on Trayvon digs yeah by the way I think wasn't even a quarterback in college and high school and he was an athlete they didn't play like Bodie as wide receiver recruit as well but they're not great on the defensive side of the football now they're not bad don't get me wrong\nBut they have witnessed that second or he's really young they lost all four guys I Believe from last year so you know you lose what mark you lose a Irani Harrison you'll lose a Marlene Humphrey\nTop draft pick his Patrick fitzpatrick\nI mean use to make a make I mean you're going to have you know you you you lost the high draft picks there there used to it and there are schools but that's what it is the fact she explained to my girl friend how it works there\nAnd I was talking to my neighbors were walking to go watch football yesterday we're talking about Alabama's asked me what happened in college football we're talking about bam and I think ... is head and shoulders the best team in college football right now\nAnd they probably won't get tested until he played Georgia in the S. E. C. championship game so you don't think they'll get tested again sales you know I don't I I think she's been kind of fraudulent I I think Alice you will not be able to score on a ... and I don't think bam as defense is great the problem is it's not as if she was a good quarterback\nBoroughs not he's not going to be throwing the football and you can't run on Alabama really\nSo I think look when you look at Arkansas and Arkansas put up on thirty one points on bam a\nLet's not forget that it was like forty two to whatever and half time in ... you know I think ... and ... no matter how much they save and tries to motivate you I think that becomes a point when you up so much that you just kind of want the clock to keep running right if it was a close game I bet you bam as defense plays better\nBut I look at it you know we're nit picking here weaknesses for the best team in the country\nKind of figure out is there a way for them to lose in the way for them to lose their defense but here's the problem even if you can score some points on their defense you're not out scoring the fence that's the issue here so Alabama has a battle a bad defensive night Sean\nAnd they give up forty points I Would bet you the mortgage that the officers still puts up fifty\nLook no one's beat Alabama right oh it's my question is when will to have to play a fourth quarter to have to play a fourth

protected you guys are the number one helmet in terms of safety according to the Virginia tech studies which is obviously the industry standard so how do people go about kind of getting them and how do you mark it down to the youngsters\nYou know we have we have to we have to tell a story should different audiences and the collegiate ranks we talk to the equipment managers they are very influential ah for these universities on what their players wear a ... at the high school level it's the coaches at the youth level if the parents\nAnd each of these groups of people we we need to talk to them in a different way if we start telling a pop Warner player parents you\nKnow how great and how awesome their kids going to look in our new home but that's not really going to resonate with them and what they're going to want to know is exactly what\nIs a five star helmet on the Virginia tech star system and and with this F. seven LTV it's not only number one it shattered the record I mean it's a point it's a zero point seven five star score the previous number one how much was one point nine to to draw a comparison of you know football comparison\nEric Dickerson single season rushing record is Twenty one oh five right\nThis helmet would rush for three thousand three hundred and Ninety are wild season [noise] um [noise] and so we talked to the parents about the the performance of the helmet or the impact that George and you know we tell them that despite what they may have heard there's no such thing as a concussion proof that\n[noise] but what we can do is say our helmet absorbs more impact than any other helmet on the field that's been proven we've we've put a lot of focus on set\nThat is about the single most important thing to any helmet that player where's whether he's eight years older thirty eight years old is that that element sets foreign and so we talk about that to the parents we talk about coaches were like you want to keep your guys on the field right you want to win football games\nSo you got to keep your guys in the field so you want to put them in the best performing helmets that you can and that you can afford and again at the college ranks you talk to their quiver managers and it's all about again keeping those guys on the field so that they can win football games\nThat when you you know and and when you talk about you know these helmet school into the players and the first thing they do they walk across the room and they look at themselves in and tell me because you've been doing this a long time Lynn\nTen years ago or so to the players care about rankings and they care about the safety compared to today how many players to ask you about the Virginia tech studies how many players they ask you in terms of protecting me what is this do differently what does he have seven LT do different compared to the competitors\nHe's got a question you get a heck of a lot more today from players and you did back in the day\nExponentially Dan is not even close to ten years ago um I think it would be safe to say that at most half of the guys in the NFL even knew what helmet they were wearing\nUm there was no helmet ratings at that time we all manufacturer helmets and we still do to what's called the knocks the standard which is a pass fail for\nA helmet to be certified to be used in the NFL and college and high school and pop Warner and has to pass the standard ten years ago that was that\nNow we have the Virginia tech star system we have other helmet rating systems the NFL has done their own helmet testing and so these guys are very much more educated on um on on what it is they're putting on their heads and and it's really encouraging to see that we love to see that we love to hear we loved those questions\nBecause it means these guys are taking an interest\nIn their health and in their safety and then we can talk to them and and and when we get a chance to tell them our story about the CPU cushioning and in the F seven in the case of the tectonic plates the movable place on on the outside of a helmet\nI think it allows them to say yeah you know what that makes a lot of sense so that's the helmet I Want aware and we're being really successful or in the NFL we've got over fifty percent of the skill guys in the league wearing our helmets on and I think a lot of it has to do with the interests of the increased interest these guys have in what they're actually wary\nChat with everybody from shut helmets going back many are going to be enforced and NBC Sports radio look the

his or I'm Scott said reversed over time you're on NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com is a Monday evening into Tuesday Morning yes plenty of baseball to discuss the red Sox pound the Yankees sixteen to one that the only division series that has yet to be decided\nOr the other division series are all wrapped up and just waiting the winner of Red Sox Yankees now we will have a league championship series set but\nThe story here is Monday Night football and Drew Brees and the New Orleans saints handled the Redskins forty three Nineteen but it was true breezes performance on Monday Night which everyone expected to happen the saints wanted him to have this record\nAt home and that's exactly what he did national audience in front of the home crowd at the Mercedes Benz superdome\nHe throws for three hundred and sixty three yards three touchdowns and passes Peyton Manning was overstepping the one thousand nine hundred forty yards that was Manning's milestone Drew Brees past that and is now the all time leading pastor\nIn NFL history\nThere was a time where Drew Brees was not guaranteed to even be an NFL quarterback\nHere's a guy who was undersized who wasn't highly recruited out of high school who goes to ... do get drafted in the second round and it's not a guarantee to play for the chargers who had the flu to be at the time\nHe takes over for flu to even get benched for poor performance and flew to regain the starring role\nAnd then after they drafted well treated for Philip Rivers you know they drafted pay they drafted Eli Manning and then the whole trade for Philip Rivers\nDrew Brees then goes on and has a career and then suffers a career ending shoulder injury\nAnd\nWhen I say career ending I say career ended because everyone thought this guy was done a three hundred and sixty degree chair of his labor him and his rotator cuff all in his throwing shoulder\n\nThe chargers as what happens\nIn the NFL said breeze it's been nice knowing you but we drafted Philip Rivers and we're going to hand the reins over to him so you know what we don't think that you're going to come back and we're not gonna pay you so good luck\nOut of all the teams in the NFL only two teams\nTalked to Drew Brees and free agency only two teams\nGave Drew Brees an offer\nThe New Orleans saints with their first year head coach Sean Payton and the Miami Dolphins\nThe Miami Dolphins though after going over the medical records decided Drew Brees was too much of a risk\nWith that three hundred and sixty degree labor ... and his rotator cuff damage\nAnd so they pulled out of their offer\nLeaving the New Orleans saints and first your head coach Sean Payton as the only team\nTo offer breeze they'd contract sixty years sixty million dollars ten million guaranteed which seems kinda ridiculous now in the landscape of what you get now and what drew breaches even gotten out of breath and goes to New Orleans\nAnd\nPaired up with him pretty talented players including a\nMarcus polston and breeze and coast inform a dynamic duo and then all of a sudden after one year in New Orleans Drew Brees would they co real high four thousand four\nHundred and Eighteen passing yards and this thing's reached the NFC championship game just a year after finishing three and Thirteen\nAnd Drew Brees Walter Payton man of the year for all the work he did on and off the field helping New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina\n\nFrom there the legend of Drew Brees grew as she became the second player in NFL history to throw for over five thousand yards in a season\nSomething that he would have something that he would do five times\nIn his tenure in New Orleans no no no other quarterback has done it even more than once Drew Brees there's been nine five thousand yard seasons in NFL history for a quarterback Drew Brees did it five times Brady manning Marino and Matthew Stafford did it one time each\nThat's it\nDrew Brees led the New Orleans saints their first ever Super Bowl in franchise history becomes the super bowl MVP\nAnd continues to dominate and set records wide receivers breaking thousand yards ... ah seasons\nThe passing yards the passing touchdowns do realize that Drew Brees has thrown dumped he stole more than one touchdown pass\nRight\nHe's thrown more than one touchdown pass and he's the let's see I Want to break this down for Eighteen your career right\nHe has had thirty two games in which she did not throw a touchdown pass in Eighteen years\nSixty nine games and what you did a one Seventy games in which you through two fifty games in which he chewed through three Twenty one games in which he threw for eight games in which you through five or six touchdown game and a seven touchdown game in his career\n\nRecord after record after record completion percentage that's another record that he holds best completion percentage of all time in a single season to have the career completion percentage\nAnd now the orders Seventy one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight he has four hundred and Ninety nine touchdowns that's one shy of Tom Brady is forth all the time\nIn the touchdowns and maybe maybe if he plays long enough and I don't know how many he's going to how many more years he's going to play\nTo know is what happened on the first one\nTrick on but um [noise]\nUh I don't think it could have happened fashion a bit and um\nHave been a moment where my teammates on the field the office of ... um [noise]\nGreater than I ever heard of a lesser\nNow a lotta people handed out their congratulations uh

Matt Weiner\nNo I I I added that part [laughter] he didn't which posted and say that Jay Jay watch weeded out incredible\nPeyton Manning actually or would they make these little tribute a little video here um for just a fragile a breeze ... this was the record right as Peyton Manning um had\nIt and then Drew Brees now passed it and so this was Peyton Manning's message to Drew Brees\nWhy you're wrong\nOr which one\nPressure yours okay trust to have touched on record right\nHe got it right down to what [noise]\nDrew for a thousand days I've held the record for all time passing yards in federal I got to tell you it's been the greatest a thousand days of my life\nAnd thanks to you\nOver now and you ruin that permitted so thank you very much or nothing left to work for two except slicing my tomatoes making dinner for my family putting together this wedge salad [noise]\nAlso but the servers and congratulations for the touchdown record because as you can see I'm very busy I don't have time to keep doing these videos for you congratulating but in all seriousness drew congratulations on this record\nYou and I come a long way since this picture back in two thousand and when you were in college and I was in my third year in the NFL so way to go proud of you walk the rest of the way\nThat was a nice cute little message there\nFrom Peyton Manning congratulating Drew Brees where he says I still have the touchdown record and the guys I actually know he's probably going to beat that to a [laughter] ... responding to the congratulations that he got not just from Peyton Manning but also from Brett Farr\nPatriot paying fashion it's a ... he he always is very creative for a you know I appreciate spoke with far you know two weeks ago um\nAfter the completion record after we did that in his lab and\nChecks from fame and Archie Cooper and spoke last week it was really got U.S forces in the whole family I'm so that was a really class\nYeah a very good um relationship between all those guys are you know especially with breeze being a obviously synonymous with the saints and Archie synonymous with the saints Archie is not the greatest quarterback wave the saints no more [laughter] I think everyone knows that\nSean Payton the head coach says you know not just for the record but they want to win this game for Drew Brees\nFrom that moment happens in the game and it's happening around here before the fourth quarter when you're winning but when it happens right in the\nMiddle of the contest you want to make sure doesn't impact your team's emotions relative to winning the game and the comment I'd made prior to the game when talking with the team was like hey you know our job is to win this game along with a bill that milestone that'll be accomplished and it makes it more special and I think that's true\nOh come on this was an easy game for them that we talked about this last night and we gave your pick for the game\nThe Redskins didn't have a chance to have a chance and this came from the minute the game started they did not have a chance\nAnd they're just not playing good football but even ... it's it's it's strange when you think about it the fact that the Redskins were coming off by they had extra time to prepare for this game and that's the effort that they showed and Jay grew and says it's on him\nI'm not up here to anybody they played poorly think overall I think our whole team of play for it and that's a reflection of myself I think I think everybody and matlock room or hopefully will say they need to play better and I absolutely understand that the coach is on the staff at the coach better hang up the only way we can look at\nMoving forward with Caroline and coming up we're two and two and a bright outlook were still right there in the will continue to be but we have to give thanks fixed\nAnd will now the New Orleans saints are sitting here at four in one and they look like the team that they were last year\nAnd a team that last year was a Minnesota Miracle away from getting to the NFC title game remember\nIt was that ridiculous Hail Mary touched down at the end of the game that gave the Vikings to victory over the ... or else the saints would have been in the NFC championship game and who knows what would have happened between them in the Philadelphia Eagles and maybe we're sitting here talking about the saints\nAs defending Super Bowl champions but that wasn't the case last year this year they are for in one right now the second best record in the NFC behind the L. A. ramps eight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three\nFour six it suits you I think Drew Brees considering that his career was almost over and that no team wanted him after his shoulder injury\nUh I think Drew Brees is the greatest under dog story\nIn NFL history and maybe even in all of a sports when you consider where he came from when you consider the expectations that we're\nNot there really because of his height and because of his abilities how he has overcome that how he overcame the injury\nAnd the fact that no one wants to him and when it's all said and done he's gonna finished his career top five greatest quarterback to ever play this game that to me it's amazing\nCan you think of another under dog story like that in all sports in terms of a player who is a first ballot hall of famer arguably on the mount Rushmore at his position or her position\nBut wasn't expected to amount to anything\nAnd I can't say amount to anything but because that's that's that's wrong but was not certainly not expected to be where they are right now eight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six students do 'cause I Can't think of it\nYou know I'm trying to think of guys that um well I guess you can throw Tom Brady right you know Tom Brady a sixth round draft pick could barely get on the field at Michigan\nWhere where he is\nThe least Drew Brees the second round bet\nBrady was six Rebecca [noise]\nI just had that injury that was supposed to end his career\nLook the major league baseball post

always I'm sure we'll talk tomorrow night after that game or the red Sox they were the better team all season long hundred and eight victories best team in major league baseball and they were favored to win this series but after losing that game to in the way in which they lost\nAt home the Yankees stealing a home field advantage the red Sox just stole it back and now all they have to do is when one out of the next two games and they have the luxury of playing a potential game five at Fenway Park I Would also give our quarter credit for this\nHe went to pour cello in relief appearance right knowing that he would bump up ... of all the and start of all the in this game three in the stadium a place where he's comfortable pitching because he played for the Yankees he knows what it's like the pitch in that ballpark and\nHe's got the stuff that would give the Yankees fans you see a lot of people are bothered by the analytics crazed taking over baseball and I get it because I get to sign a traditional traditional says well even though I have kind of\nMade my way over to the dark side of analytics but\nThese managers in general managers and an analytic staff they go over every thing's stats that we don't even think about like ... and things like that and they know that hey\nThe Yankees have a difficult time with pitches over a certain mile per hour that have a certain spin rate\nAims ... of all he was a bad match up for the Yankees and corn knew that\nAnd he made the adjustment just like the Yankees knew that Louis Severino would be a bad match up for the Oakland A's net wild card game\nThat's the reason why ... started that game because the Oakland A's I think that was that they had the worst batting average in major league baseball on pitches over Ninety eight miles per hour\nAnd Severino average is over Ninety eight miles per hour Ninety seven and a half whatever it was\nAnd so that's why they weren't what's I've read on that wild card game and it weren't whoever and the red Sox had a similar stat line against the against you know they they knew what was going on with Nathan you've already going up against the Yankees that there was a very smart move\nBy our Flora let's here from manager Alex Cora as he talked about that game for\nMe was to er that's you know he's preview in game for not want to talk about the victory first and ... and you've all day\nThe fish and great stuff from the get go using their past one different spots and um [noise] mix it up breaking balls and split or um he has been great of a ... and the whole season and that was good to see tonight\nAnd how about ...\n... is a good player last year was a tough one for him as far as being healthy and and the whole thing that went on with them but I'm In a one healthy he he can help you out and I'm too and I was a great night for him\nRight now let's hear from you on a game for\nMe it was tough today coming here uh one one the only thing we we know is that you know if we don't win tomorrow we have a game five that's the only thing we we gain today but um we get a chance to come here and uh put a good game and see what happens you know um my nobody trusts the sea\nWe trust Rick no veteran guys that they've done it for a few years you should be fun\nAnd how about let's hear from Nathan you've all day on how special it was to win this game\nA special moment for me I I don't think it's really quite settled in yet I'm\nTo be able to pitch the way I did and then you know for us as far as many runs as we did in ... a big game for us tonight we needed to win this one I'm going into tomorrow and hopefully we'll be able to clinch here tomorrow and move on to the next round\nAnd you know you want to talk about the underdog stories needs and your body to elbow surgeries and not many people expected them to get back on the mound and be as effective as he was let alone be on the hill as the wedding picture in a post season game and be as effective as he was why was he so effective against the Yankees\nFor like ... where it will just get a sports runs early which made it easier for me to pitch 'em like my fastball my cutter were really affected tonight and uh you know I was just trying to use their aggressiveness\nAgainst them and I'm trying to get some quick else\nWhat about the atmosphere Yankee Stadium\nOne of the stuff a woman up before the game to the crowd was pretty relentless down then open area um [noise]\nI think once once you\nGet going and you get that first of all the way you're able to settle down and it's just another game and you out there and you're trying to attack the hitters and a host effective I felt like from the first pitch on and were able to get some quick outs and you know get back to the dugout\nAnd ask for ... cold what a career milestone he will remember this for the rest of his life\nGuy yeah this this one I'll Remember for a long time Johnny ... obviously you don't go into the game\nYou know expecting to make history or do anything like that but let alone score you know sixteen runs against you know good New York Yankee team so it was a good night overall for everyone and like I said you know this is this is what I remember for a long time and hopefully we can carry carry this over into a into tomorrow\nFirst player in baseball history\nTo hit for the cycle in a playoff game that shift on believable now there was some drama for the New York Yankees because there were reports that Louis ... who was not good in stark had\nTo get yanked early did not execute gave up runs there was a report that Louis Severino showed up late to his warm up\nRon Darling who was on the CBS broadcast said that Louis Severino did not get to the bullpen\nUntil eight minutes before first pitch\nWe will

L. C.

the end all cs last year obviously they did it because they ...\nYeah last year they weren't it because they want to the world series last year two years ago or they lost to the ...\nRight so yeah third straight year there in the house yes\nGetting the job done they were a couple of years ago to I guess um they lost the cardinals a couple of years back but that was Don mattingley not Dave Robert says the manager of the uh of the Dodgers back them but this has been some run now for the LA Dodgers\nDog ... going in game one in Milwaukee against the brewers brewers are such a great story though what is your next don't you want to see the brewers go to the world series no [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise] ah come on put your friend them aside don't you want to see the brewers make it\nNo\nFair enough [noise] ah in the AFC has this will be the Astros awaiting the winner of the Yankees and the red Sox so we could have a rematch a of last year as a I'll see as the Yankees and ash rose but it's going to take a lot for the Yankees to come back or they're down two games to one against the red Sox and\nAnd they just got absolutely demolished sixteen to one sixty and to want to hear some records for you just in case you want to hear these again\nIt is the Fifteen margin the largest wind by roads even postseason history largest loss for the Yankees in their postseason history most runs ever given up by Yankee team\nIn their postseason history and ... the first player in baseball history to hit from the cycle in a post season game\nCame forward will be on Tuesday evening but as I mentioned uh two other series concluded on Monday and the Dodgers just they continue to impress but we knew\nWhat this Dodgers team was going to be\nOnce they acquired many Machado\nHe gives them such link in that line up forget about the fact that he is one of the best players in all major league baseball but you stiff came in the middle of a lineup that already includes Justin\nTurner and Cody Ballenger\nMax months he was having a career year ... jock Peterson back at the top of the line up doing his thing\nAll of a sudden ... as soon as they made that trade this line up got so deep and truly is the best part of it's an American legal on a plane for nationally deem\nTowards this didn't America neglect\n'cause I think probably this is an American league team beat up max monthly as you're designated hitter\nAnd then you can put code coding Ballenger at first base in this way you would have probably Taylor play in the outfield you allow people to be tailor um you tailor Peterson and ...\nWith you know maybe ... get the day here or there are ... you know comes in off the bench than you'd have that one's your back at first and ... there's a lot of ways that they robbers can manage the thing is the Dodgers were to get back to the world series\nBut this team is scary good\nAnd I don't know if the brewers are going to be doing a lot of this bullpen and we know how good their bullpen is but this line up might be too much for the whole bull painting idea to handle because it's like we talked about last week when the AIDS decided to do it\nWhen you go with a starter which is the traditional way to\nDo it that guy either has already doesn't have it in your banking on that guy to have it\nAnd let's say has it for for ... that's a freight he has them for five or more even better [noise] but when you go with a bullpen day and you put an opener in there and you only plan for that guy to go to an ex\nNow you are relying on ideally at the bare minimum if that guy is only going to winning then you're going to have pictures gold one inning after that\nYou're talking about seven pictures six or seven pictures and your banking on\nAll of them to be lights out and that's a very difficult thing to do to very difficult thing to ask I get it I get\nThe numbers show you that when facing a line up for the first time are facing a batter for the first time the batting averages are down on base percentages down\nOkay but if a starter has it if a starter is just in the group you're only banking on one guy to be like ... out\nInstead of six guys three lights up because let's say one of those six\nHas an off day\nThe one inning that could be the blow up in it and it cost you a game so I'm not\nBut a lot of managers around baseball are and maybe that's what the brewers are going to do in game one against the Dodgers and the Dodgers are going to go with Clinton worship in game one against the brewers that should be a phone service to watch which begins on friday and in the American league\nThe Astros kind of have been the foreign gotten team which is crazy to say because they're the defending World Series champions ... with the red Sox having is great of a season as they head\nAnd with the Astros kind of going through this slump because they were not healthy right I mean let's let's call for what it what it is they had injuries throughout the season\nAnd a lot of people might have forgotten about how good miss she was\nBut they are the best team in major league baseball is great of a season as the red Sox have had you look at Garrett coal Dallas Geico Justin for Windsor\nThose three guys are lights out through and there's been an a a different animal just in just a different animal when\nHe uh ... when he went to visit the actress and there's a really interesting that that when you consider how great these teams were throughout the season in terms of their run differential\nThat's ten o'clock no one's trick or treating a ten PM

going to be the top costume for this year twenty eighth team like the ... I think is going to be a Donald Trump\n\nYou think so I mean ... that was like last year you think this year there's going to be Trump costumes I mean I'm sure they've gotten better right\nMm\nI don't I don't know I mean you think any like superheroes or anything you know\nAnd it's like that maybe like\nBlack Panther or something or or what have I mean what that's costume I don't know what that task to will look like\n\nI don't know it's like ... the black panther African ... no that's it no have you you didn't see Black Panther I see white panther but there's no like the the panther you write her neighbor hero yeah you where is it yeah\nI don't know I'm trying to think that what is this year's going to be because you know every year there's like a big popular um Halloween costume like what is the twenty Eighteen or I Would think yeah the black panther probably is going to be a big one\nUm I don't know I don't know what else could be ...\nWhat was really popular in twenty eight ...\nYou mentioned the president's OK store Trump Black Panther ... political right you can do political um political costumes like try to make a a funny political statement right like what that would be that\n... you don't turn Eighteen was that a lot of political stuff there was no we don't have to get into exactly what it was but there's was one of the political year twenty eighth team still is political year\nUh I bet you a lot of kids going to be dressed up as sport like characters what is that right for tonight is the uh you know the the video games and all the kids are playing I have no idea what that is\nAll the video game all the kids are playing the sport right that's that's that's like the biggest video game right now\nFor things like a lot of foreign I cared for its night it's like a game with a number like bored I where you can know Fort like apple ... remember getting remember remember golden eye\nForensics before we go around and battle mode and and try to kill you to kill each other no\nI'm looking at our own and what kind of childhood that you have a we didn't play anything God big working right now as for sure\nIt's not because it's out now talking to\nOh I'm going to say that uh this year's top\nCostumes will be something more of all related like super heroes you know Black Panther a popular one I think you'll see some Fortnite characters I think you'll see\n'em maybe some like things from TV shows\nPeople dress like as a western like Westworld so this basically in a shoot 'em up game kind of like call of duty\nDeaths saying yes to exactly what it is to exactly what it is um let's see I'm trying to think that there can be ...\nWhat about like ... like an old costume I don't know what the world to try to try to figure this out what could be a good Halloween costume for twenty eight team the most popular Halloween costume for twenty Eighteen\n... what are you laughing at now I'm just looking at huh I'm looking up this sport night thing oh yeah yeah\nYou never seen the Fortnite dancers no it's all these kids are doing these dances now there's damn man who has a big ...

the passing touchdowns do realize that Drew Brees has thrown dumped he's still more than one touchdown pass\nRight\nHe's thrown more than one touchdown pass and he's the let's say I want to break this down for Eighteen your career right\nHe has had thirty two games in which she did not throw a touchdown pass in Eighteen years\nSixty nine games and what you did a one Seventy games in which you through two fifty games in which he chewed through three Twenty one games in which he threw for eight games in which you through five or six touchdown game and a seven touchdown game in his career\n\nRecord after record after record completion percentage that's another record that he holds best completion percentage of all time in a single season he's going to have the career completion\nPercentage and now the orders Seventy one thousand nine hundred and sixty he has four hundred and Ninety nine touchdowns that's one shy of Tom Brady his fourth all time\nIn the touchdowns and maybe maybe if he plays long enough and I don't know how many he's going to how many more years he's going to play but he is forty touchdown shy\nOf Peyton Manning's all time record forty touchdowns he can play one more season and accomplish that because by the end of this season and then next year we're talking about Drew Brees if he plays one more year he could have every single record\nAt the quarterback position\nThis guy is a first ballot hall of famer a career that almost never happened a career that should have been cut short due to injury\nDefy all the votes this guy's six feet tall he's not prototypical quarterback body and it Drew Brees him bodies the New Orleans saints franchise you almost forget that he played for the chargers cars from breezes and\nTo mess with the New Orleans saints now he was a huge part of that organization revitalizing that city after Hurricane Katrina and taking an organization and it was down in the dumps the Ames people wearing paper bags over their heads and now proud to be in New Orleans Saints fan because of Drew Brees\nThis guy might be the greatest under dog story in the history of the NFL\nAnd maybe in all of sports when you consider where he is going to finish as top five greatest quarterbacks ever play this game well I guess you can throw Tom Brady right you know Tom Berea sticks around drastic\nCould barely get on the field at Michigan\nBrady not expected to be where where he is and\nAt least Drew Brees was the second round pick\nBrown pick but again Drew Brees had that injury that was supposed to end his career\nAnd I didn't in fact he got better after the surgery was over\nSo congratulations to Drew Brees and honor that is truly deserving for him eight five five three two three four NBC it's eight

HR cares\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nGot to start off with congratulations for Drew Brees here got it continues to play it in a ridiculously high level Drew Brees\nIn the first time passing for two hundred and fifty yards as the things with the twenty six Thirteen hole lead over Washington with a two hundred and fifty yards actually when he crossed two hundred and one yards passing\nHe became the all time leader and pass yards passing Peyton Manning who finished his career Seventy one thousand one hundred Ninety Drew Brees was like the astronaut who goes to the moon for the first time he was the first person to ever cross Seventy two thousand yards passing in his career it was amazing usually think about how we started his career\nWasn't like Drew Brees just over four or five thousand yards a season in San Diego\nMeans Drew Brees was the guy that ends up with the same people thought he was kind of her memory couldn't pass the Miami Dolphins medical Saban wanted him couldn't pass their medical instead they signed Dante colpepper\nHe goes to New Orleans and the rest is history but amazingly at thirty nine years old you'll be forty on January fifteenth Drew Brees did not throw for four thousand yards in a season\nUntil two thousand and six his first year in New Orleans at the age of twenty seven\nThinking about that even for over ... yards fees and Julius twenty seven\nWell since then things have changed he has never thrown for less than forty three hundred yards in a season in fact Drew Brees that's passed for over five thousand yards five times in his career\nBut that's why look at this number and I'm not that impressed\nI hate to do this because it's his day to shine\nBut I Need to put in reality what this number actually means\nDo you think it's coincidence that Brett Farr was the first one to cross Seventy thousand yards\nPeyton Manning a few years after that cross Seventy thousand yards Drew Brees now has crossed Seventy thousand yards and now he's cross Seventy two thousand yards\nReality is the NFL today is conducive to throng for a lot of yards there was about seven quarterbacks pays for five thousand plus yours right now doctors quarterbacks pays for fifty five hundred yards right now is your brain Drew Brees of two thousand eleven record\nBut here's why to me as impressive a statistic as these yards are I'm not going to crack open an expensive bottle of champagne and celebrate tonight one because I'm cheap\nAnd expensive bottle of champagne I Do have a bunch of cheap bottle of champagne like you know fourteen bucks something like that not bad taste good\nThey're just not like you know John ... owner Kris dollar those expensive over priced ones going go that all the\nYuppies like to buy liquor stores you know a sustained basis spades was about eight grand I right now you get the the magnum it's like fifty on their own first [laughter] you're drinking the Andres for seven Ninety nine a bottle of champagne taste with beer party that my friend [laughter] share paid tastes like budget that's pretty much when it comes down to I agree a hundred percent\nBut Sean think about Drew Brees and water you've had in his favor all those years your number Thirteen in New Orleans but even when he played in San Diego think about it in San Diego he's\nPlaying in a warm weather environment for eight games right\nAnd also playing other teams not Kansas city's not warm Denver's not really warm\nIn Oakland whatever I mean that's not that cold it's not like thirty twenty degrees snowfall is not ridiculous like that usually\nSo in San Diego at least half his games or in a very nice warm environment a lot easier to play in that\nSince coming to New Orleans games a year or an adult\nBut it's not just say games here Atlanta on the road in a dome at nine games in a dome a year you're playing Tampa Bay one game nice warm cozy environment there that's ten games right Carolina milder temperatures in Charlotte North Carolina it's eleven games I\nMean it's not as if the\nDivisional games that Drew Brees had to play or in snow in blizzard in windy conditions there not\nSo at least eleven of sixteen games every year are in very friendly and cozy environments nine being in dumps that helps\nThat's why the me what Tom Brady is able to accomplish playing in Boston having to play in New York he gets the play Miami once a year Buffalo's stinks especially going to go there in December forget it\nYou know Peyton Manning got the plane of domain games a year and so he went to Denver so to me Tom Brady is the most impressive many Brett Farr is impressive to haven't had to play in Green Bay\nBut the reality is as incredible uh Seventy two thousand yards are factor in the time period that Drew Brees is playing it I mean come on in Thirteen Years Heathrow for sixty thousand yards\nWhat do you think Dan Marino who is the only got every five thousand yards by the way when you think about Dan Marino was five thousand yards the season he threw for that many yards business wants incredible about that statistic\nGuys were barely touching four thousand yards when Dan Marino got the five done like cows ski memorandum magic man for the Packers got the four thousand yards and people like why it's unbelievable okay\nDan Marino when he got five thousand yards he was as if Wayne Gretzky got to two hundred points and Ninety two goals that year when the record high for points I think it was a hundred and sixty seven he's shattered the total\nDan Marino shattered the record I mean it wasn't even close now guys are passed by within a hundred yards you know if Drew Brees loses the record this year it's not going to be by somebody somebody hitting six thousand yards it's gonna be like fifty five hundred or fifty four Ninety and they beat up by fourteen\nSo it's a nice statistic but the most important statistic that Drew Brees has but it's just not quite good enough to where you put them in the same boat as manning who I mean man and given one multiple rings to ... won five to four vote we won one but\nI think there's always limitations are far right when we talk about far unless you're a die hard Packers fan and you just have Brett Farr glasses he went and wrangler jeans you do realize that Brett Farr and have a lot a lot of faults over three hundred interceptions made some dumped throws that cost them important playoff games and that's when it comes down to\nSo it's just a case where when you really look at Drew Brees than this statistic I'm not saying put an ashtray excited that's not what I'm saying here\nBut what I Am saying is the reality is you have to see exactly how he was able to accomplish the skull about what's going to be impressive is this true reason will get to eighty thousand yards\nYou don't think he's got eight thousand more yards in um well here's what's amazing he's going to throw for another three thousand plus yards this year barring injury right he's going to be at Seventy five thousand yards at the end of this year\nAt the end of next year he's gonna be in that Seventy eight eighty thousand range do you think keeps slowing down we talked about ... you know Tom Brady is amazing at\nMy folks got me a little radio in Nineteen forty and\nWas the best Christmas present\nWas eleven years old when I

[noise] here's a guy that is supposedly the quote unquote sees [noise]\nMember at the halfway point of the season the all star break Severino was a front runner for the American league MBP was fourteen and to\nPut a sub too we are a about one point nine eight [noise] he has\nBeen awful the second half of the season and for all these people out there these baseball quote unquote experts who are trumpeting his wildcard performance against the ... last week where Louis Severino at Yankee Stadium couldn't get out of the fifth inning\nHe went for innings which by the way it doesn't even qualify you for the decision\nSo Louie Severino who's Nineteen game winner with over two hundred fried got this year\nGoes for ... all these more on our saying wow that's a gutsy performance from Louis Severino no you know it's got the\nSeventy two thirds Warner and run to walk the nine strike at bats gutsy getting pulled in the fifth inning with two runners on without registering it out that's not gutsy\nIt's gutsy for like thirty seven year old FISA bath you with bad knees right it's got to feel like a forty five year old Jamie Moyer pitching okay that's gutsy when you're twenty four years old and you're Nineteen and eat on the season that's not ... not a great outing\nSo he follows up before any gutsy outing that he had today with the absolute speaker can't get out of the fourth inning first of all Arab boon for even sending them out in the fourth inning is utterly idiotic\nThe analytics of Aaron Boone I'm Still trying to figure out what exactly that means I don't actually see where computers argues an adult analytics or use to make these decisions let me tell you how decisions are made when we flew in Louis ... is hit hard through three innings\nAnd the red Sox are not getting fooled by ... swinging a missing much and he's not finding the strikes do much only forty one throw strikes in Seventy pitches\nDeanna let me tell you to bring him out the fourth inning as if he's going to settle down that no you settled down in the second inning he didn't sell down the second inning eating settled down the third inning when they hit the ball hard you don't bring him out\nFor that for setting but I did and he got burned and we certainly know is quickly becoming David Price three innings seven had six are run by the way he's got a long time to become David Price for two reasons one price is so bad\nHe never won a postseason starting frankly he should never started posting the game ever again\nThat's going to go down as one of the worst contract in baseball history regardless of what he does the regular season because Boston doesn't care about the regular season they care about can you beat the Yankees and the one in the postseason let me answer that for you David Price no one no can't beat the Yankees can't pitching the regular season\nAnd I watched the post game show on PBS with Gary Sheffield and Jimmy Rollins and Pedro Martinez and like the host dude whatever his name is right I watch that I\nAm I'm watching Sheffield and I'm like you guys a cheater like the guys that steroid user and you put them up on a panel with Jimmy Rollins in with Pedro Martinez like ever got busted for anything that you put Gary Sheffield up there so I'm watching with my girlfriend right and I'm joking and laughed\nSays I just kind of throwing their rights so chef there was like yeah when I play I Do this again used steroids you know that you had a quick that we use their rights but he's actually a good point I was watching Pedro talking about price and he's like everything David Price does thrown out the window and do everything differently because it's not working\nAnd then Gary Sheffield made a good point like look\nAll his pitches or at the same speed right now is breaking pitch you the same feeling this political fastball\nI can time that like it's the reason they're breaking ball works just because you're throwing a hitter off balance right you're tracking a PR move it's the same to me the same but yet the pitch comes in that miles a slower set 'em up just coming into the same speed you just\nYou know you prepare for fast bought a break and come to this phase me who cares\nBelow reset Reno had a chance that I should be the anti David Price Severino by the way they last year's wild card game lasted a whole two thirds of admitting before he got pulled given up three rounds Yankees came back beat the twins pitched a little bit better I Believe against Houston but it wasn't like a light out seven innings no runs ... kind of performance wasn't like that\nNo matter the hero to know about your ... by the way it's like five in one with a one for you are a or something like that in the postseason I mean he's like that\nBut I have to worry if you're Severino here for Yankee fan because the questions that starred do you pitch Severino in the post season they have to but if he had somehow they're getting destroyed your Lebanon one in Boston runners on it ugly\nBut if the Yankees could win game for with the ... game by you believe to knock on full rest perhaps getting that start you hope it's not based on that go back to Boston to win\nThat game although this is turning losing this game\nSeverino is not going to get lit up by the Houston Astros met office [noise] who has the advantage there\nThe guy who's a little like a Roman candle and and then in the eighties firework\nWho's got net cringes from all the hit that he has to keep watching behind him\nWhat a disgrace Severino was and I\nWe hope you don't go back and junior his comments before the game and the ramifications that next enforcement NBC's portrayed it [noise]\nThe only\nThat what you have a drop your NBC Sports radio updating\nIs

talking about ... great now\nBack in juniors hundred percent accurate here\nHe managed on I mean I hate to say I've watched him and I don't care if he shows glimpses your great quarterbacks underway in the hall of fame don't show glimpses anymore you're not watching glimpses of Drew Brees is great and if you don't watch Tom Brady glimpses right\nYou watch glimpses Peyton Manning's last year when he stunk you watched glimpses is Brett Farr struggled through a final NFL season you see glimpses with Eli Manning that's not a good sign you I done\nAnd you do wonder you know you are marrying why ... why you're going to be fun to go back and junior over the top backing juniors fast\nHold out that computers could run by quarterbacks beat the fees and scored a touchdown we've seen it it is great I Wish you a frog damn on those types of routes we're not seeing\nThat's not exactly a vow of confidence to quarterback Eli Manning when he says uh I don't know if the giants have a problem a quarterback\nHere's the thing about it though as writers oh del Beck and junior years with what he says you can't save is does he not understand that he's not some role rookie right now who doesn't understand how to deal with the media at this level\nHe went to LSU which is as big time college football is you're going to find anywhere maybe not quite us the which shows the LA market for so many years until the NFL came back last year and they're still treated like NFL players that us the I mean the I don't know I got as much media coverage as Philip Rivers are Jared golf\nAnd Alice you your immediate Drew Brees and then the quarterback Joe borough of LSU those are the guys people talk about breezes great borough sticks but still you get the picture total back him junior had media members\nCovering LSU there there that he had thing outside of the states in the state of Louisiana you come to New York\nYou're not a rookie anymore this is your number five right at this point you should know how to deal with at this point your team leader at this point your own backyard junior one of the most looked up to people in the locker room\nYou're young players that locker mono back in junior is not the quote unquote young player anymore you can't be the one\nTalking controversial e you can't\nYou have to be the one trying to bridge a team together that's what bothered me about it so take a lesson to jump back in junior disgusting this issue after the game because he made himself the story to\nHe made himself the story of the giants rather than the game because he made these comments sold out back and junior having to answer questions about his interview that aired Sunday Morning\nHe actually fix this is what's amazing and take a listen he actually thinks that his comments help to bring the team together listen\nTo have to watch the kicked off for the rest of the the only worse as soon as the director the return short field ... and it still goes through there for us what I'm\nSaying they put it together then they came out with them when I'm and I'm proud of where we stand or even on it for\nThis thing to do is is going to be monumental for season in my eyes\nYou know it comes from sings justice for the messages that\nSometimes comes off the wrong way no words can be portrayed in any kind of life and all of the conversations between us was the way that we respond as to what was said\nThat he was into easy after what was said and then that's what I see them coming here and fight scene and\nEnergy hold us the great whatever word you want to use for that we have today and we came up short\nBut I'm proud of this team and this is the team that we're going to be for the rest of the season so I said if it's if it's offensive to to get us going\nLike I said\nBothers me about what he says they're these words can be misconstrued there's no misconstrued and what he said\nLike what do you mean misconstrued you're you're not being complementary to anybody in these comments right you did say out scheme that the shot at the coaching they're the ones that come up with a scheme you didn't exactly step up and Becky like manning when you could have\nThere is no misconstrue in what you said you're just backpedaling now because people are mad we hear the report that patch armor was so upset he called them into the office like you got to apologize to you got to get in front of the team and and apologize for this\nBut the problem is back him junior is he's a deep up and he plays the diva position and football which is wide receiver and he is a guy that puts himself in front of the team the way that Antonio Brown does the same thing in Pittsburgh Antonio Brown complains right he complains about his own production\nIt's not about your production spent as a team win or lose but I'm telling you brown complains about his production back him junior is complaining about his role\nLike why do you have young players in the NFL today I mentioned like a Sam darn older a Baker may feel guys like that to understand like you take responsibility right\nIf they say oh you had a great game you say no we often wine block for me and they gave me an opportunity you have a great game why these Twenty one year old kids are twenty two year old kids seem to understand that and here's oh dealt Beck and junior as selfish of players are going to find not getting it and here's one needs to happen\nIn New York Giants you got to have a strike system here okay how many strikes that want to dial back and junior\nYou know the whole doubts until this year you know he's made comments in the past\nHe's incident on the field of Josh Norman member that a couple of years ago where it again it was about him write him and his vendetta with Josh Norman it wasn't about am I helping or hurting the team right now me being stupid out there with Norman and getting beat it into it by Josh Norman\nThis is a big deal this is a guy that doesn't seem to understand his role on the team in terms of\nRoom and that's serious because at some point a guy like him becomes a team captain\nRight guys who are star players were veterans get to where the on their chest I'm not putting of sea on his chest because he's not a leader leaders don't talk smack about other leaders on the team idealized and don't call out publicly the coaching staff and their schemes you're not a leader you don't put a CNN jet to strike against him there\nBe other strike is he's too busy thinking about himself and I think things like this divide a locker and they don't bring 'em together ... manning I Know you kind of tried to laugh it off and him and hard about it but the fact is if you're you're you're upset by this Eliza proud guy here's a guy saying pretty much yeah I don't know if he's still got it or not\nYou're the New York giants here's the problem you can't trade ... back in junior it's easy to sit here and they just trade them get rid of him he's a cancer the locker room\nYeah easy enough and you know what I told your browser cancer in his locker room that you know live feeds his coaches speech afterwards like a moron right but you're not going to trade Antonio Brown because he's that good the judge or stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to dial back and junior here's a solution you put up with it\nYou have no choice but to put up with it\nBut as I said you don't give him the accolades that you give other veterans you don't make him a team captain you don't give him that respect because you are in that respect and right now there's no reason to respect do do back and junior that lock her up\nAnd you know what are you I suck it up and be a man you got to do something about this this guy he's talking about you guys talking about kind of your inability these days\nHe managed to me it's more of a leader if he gets out any calls out oh del back him junior maybe it's not the healthiest thing for the locker room but you can allow this to die down without a response from you if you're up proud football player\nFor crying out loud you have to use that computer does have a single ring on his fingers so who's got more you\nKnow what that locker room who's got more credit\nYou might need to show why he wears that the you know dealt shouldn't wear that see\nThat's what needs to happen in that John Locke group but any of this talk about oh don't needs to go inside the trading you're out of your mind you don't find a talent like go back in junior and he's not quite the problem with like a Terrell Owens or Randy Moss yet to get to that level will have this conversation at that point\nRocket a hard place for the New York giants\nSpeaking the giants there is something that occurred in that game leading up to the field goal by ... you know where the NFL to me my toddler talks about officiating it tell you what I think about this officiating it give you the perfect example of why the NFL has a serious

[noise]\nIt is our number is still really want to continue real quick we have a lot to get into the NFL anyway after an interesting week number five but just the whole thing with the ... river on situation is\nLook there's no way you can honestly do a replay of a place so close in thirty seconds you cannot there has to be a stoppage and play the officials need to stop the play because they have the only right to do so within two minutes\nAnd they didn't do it and I think what the NFL's trying to do is just trying to back its officials and they're trying to back the officials to make them look good because people know that the officials are under the microscope\nAnd in fact I don't trust the NFL on this I don't trust our ... there's no way in hell in thirty seconds they could do a thorough review of that play because it took a hell of a lot longer than thirty seconds to review the Carlos Hyde play so answer me this why is it\nThat football goes out of its way to ensure the validity of a first down or not in the Oakland Raiders Cleveland Browns game but in the Carolina Panthers New York giants game they do not make sure that they get that play accurately called on a on a porn thirty one\nImportant players Christian McCaffrey has stopped the Panthers go for it on for that or do they attempt a field goal at that point what do you do because guess what the clock would they would have to have a runoff some sort right because you can't stop the clock\nCare new can't spite the ball on a fourth and one good Graham Graham gonna run out there quickly I mean it changes the entire complexity that game at that point if you had just for accuracy sake review that play because I'm convinced sitting here hours later\nMore than a decade later Christian McCaffrey did not get that first down\nSo don't call me stupid\nAnd tell me that they reviewed it because it's impossible that they reviewed it if you're not going to stop the clock you cannot accurately review it and if you're a giants\nAnd you're you want to harp on that point you have every right to be upset at the NFL the way that might toddling it a forty one Seventeen when he's living with the officiating fishing terrible right now\nAnd I know it's highlighted by the fact that you have these robbing the pastor penalties that are so ridiculous and you have all these quarterbacks throwing for ... yard age you have guys like Joe Flaco is an average quarterback wants to get a look at like a star I mean it it's it's to watch it really is\nI just I ... that that left a bad taste in my mouth how I thought the Carolina Panthers got a break and the giants really got screwed and every time I see these call Sean do you know what I say my head you ready for this one Saturday's are better than Sundays\nOkay but you know what every year every team there's always the miss call there this is not a new narrative that happens all the time I don't know why people are just flipping out over I'll tell you why like a time when it happens every year\nBut I'll tell you why people can flip out and should flip out in today's technical and technological day and age where we have replay and we have the ability to to to to get real way last year with Jesse James touchdown they took away no but that's different 'cause that's like a rules issue I mean that's the catch is not a catch issue\nWhat I'm saying is that what he'll do result teams getting screwed yes that happens every year yes but the difference is when you have the ability to stop a clock and actually review will play in the course of a close game that's going to be determined by a field goal or not\nYou know damn well be sure you got the call right considering all the flack the NFL took from that Cleveland Oakland game went on friday we had to come out and admit they may be at another one miles Garrett strips act or Derrick car it would've been in for a touchdown but they blew the whistle they claim they blew the whistle dead and they didn't and in fact it was a second\nFumble not an end to for progress nonsense that they called you right it's every year but that's the problem it's not getting any better it seems to get worse it was getting better I'd be like you know what give him a break their better they're not they're worse and this is why oh we need a fulltime officials when he fulltime official none of the whole talk they got fulltime officials\nSure they'd be better technology should make it better right they haven't that's the sad thing about it and that's why people are upset and they have a right to be upset All right I Want to talk about being upset if you're a Dallas Cowboys fan the fact that Jason Garrett still has a job has to be upsetting\nMe chasing Garrett is a terrible coach he is he's a terrible coach if you're no better than ... made except for one year you're terrible coach\nBecause it's not like the NFC East has been awesome the last ten years right has really been awesome the Redskins except for one year I've been close to the garbage than good right\nThe New York giants didn't make the playoffs for five straight years right they're no good\nHe goes yeah they had a Super Bowl run but\nChip Kelly was a terrible coach for a couple of years right I mean it's not like the FCC has been is\nAwesome dominating division and yet here the Dallas Cowboys no better than average Jason ... is the epitome of average you look it up and the dishes a picture of Jason can you please stop clapping after every play you ever see that he stands\nThere the look on his face and he's like yeah oh a fumble [noise] we're getting next time guys [noise] comply yeah I get your Mr nice guy but I have routine little much\nQuit quit the you know the whole clapping all that and it's just nonsense to me it's unreal\nSo Jason Garret\nWho rarely will get ripped by his own head you know by Jerry Jones and rightfully so I mean Jerry Jones is the reason why adjacent Garrett just seemingly like that foreign Jason he can't get fired\nBecause he just seemingly can't get fired what ends up happening is\nIn overtime against Houston also terribly coached by the way by below Brian I'm watching the game yesterday and I'm explaining to my daughter and she thought it was really cool it's just it's Texas versus Texas I'm like you're right Dallas and Houston and then he had a Nick ... the brothers and she's like I Want to see the probably the only way you can they both play at different times\nAnd I was disappointed in the parents by the way they show the parents and\nInstead of wearing the half jerseys you know like the one half is your son for the Texans the other half is your son for the cowboys they're wearing like these big pain that had\nBoth sons I don't know where the jurors eat that have both of them on it that's the cool thing I always like when the parents where the half and half jerseys to represent both sides and you know who their brother in law is right\nAh I ... really correct so many parents aren't going to have family yeah but the parents aren't going around that is kind of interesting all for you to believe siblings are in ... in a professional football yeah\nWhat rank well not siblings but like I write my growth for the parents your sons and your son in law yeah\nFrank those that's got to be no my shoulders above their us sailors number two

... to the fence and he defended his team in and that's what happened in Brooklyn right\nDana whites come out and he said this is terrible and blah blah blah I don't condone this now than about estate athletic commission is filing formal complaints against both Habib encounter look you know what data dinner whites full of it\nYeah it's ugly but exactly what UFC once and here's why whoever looks to us he was like a clean sport okay whoever looks at us see as a sport that doesn't have crazy people involved\nThe violence is accepted UFC more than any other sport right boxing you have ... here you can kick somebody in the face you can meet him in the face there's more blood in the in the end of a fight in the eye to eye on them usually the boxing ring\nAnd it's like W W E but not fake sorry Nick not scripted sorry Nick\nAnd people love what happens outside a ring in the WWE right how fun is it when they fight outside the ring and there's you know guys come running out of the locker area that's all part of the stick\nYou know what as violent as this was the people are put in danger because you have trained killers I mean how big can kill you kind of can kill you jumping into the crowd throwing hay makers and just you know grabbing people or whatever\nIt actually plays right into the U.S seeing how people view the sport\nItself blood sport there's craziness involved the drama of Habib encounter in Brooklyn and the bad blood between both fighting games was one of the reasons why this was just a hype fight\nBesides the great fighters that were there the undefeated Habib could kind of knock him off his mental goody come back from two years of absence from the octagon and and dominate this guy\nThe bad blood spilled over people love drama\nSaw Dana White says this is terrible for us it is a terrible representation and I'm disappointed in you know there may just may not be running for however long it is you don't think they are closed doors like man look at all the publicity that's getting consider myself somewhat intelligent here\nI can read through the BS\nDinner white come can't come out and condoned the violence and say that's great because he's in a position of power he's got to deal with the athletic commissions and all that\nBut I Would guarantee you that data wife's looking at this going this makes us more money remember us he got so last year four billion dollars to a Chinese end to the right four billion dollars they don't white pocket a hell of a lot of money and he's still the face of the organization\nIf you want to recoup four billion dollars to make a profit you need things like this\nBecause you don't think that at some point there may be a rematch and this is not going to be highlighted the fact of the bad blood of course it will\nBut here's the problem I have with this\nYou can watch commentators talking about what happened right there for any already come out and say oh I agreed with a beep or jumping out into the octagon and attacking people in the crowd and that's great and all that do they think it was great for the ... you know the mouse in the palace\nThey think it's great when athletes get involved with fans and just because you're you're attacking another fighters camp and his trainer\nDoing Dan is right\nYou're putting people in jeopardy because they're just normal citizens who are not trained killers sitting there the ring girls were right there as well\nYou can't condone violent acts taken outside of the ring the violence is acceptable within the confines of the octagon is not acceptable outside of it and I heard some ... ... you know commentators today on TV talking about how oh they understand that they thought it was great Bob ... no it's not\nIs a great for promoting the sport sadly yes\nYou know bad news is good news at times to write a bad image can help your image of times this plays right into Europe seized image I mean I kind of expected nothing less right\nSo now they're doing this big show their whole there was holding the two million dollars that Habib gets countering got paid out as three million\nThere's charges you know a complains being filed and about a state of the commission maybe you have ... going to suspend a beep for a little bit I encounter is probably the clear though there is pictures of him throwing the first punch to a guy that I guess came at him or something\nBut it's going to play into that storyline Sean and in the end it's gonna it's gonna help put the sport needs the sport has been hurting without Conor McGregor for two years not only does he come out\nOf the interesting thing about that well you you could go on my face because he was hurting was hurting\nConnor comes back which is usually the sport and now you have had a drama of what was huge for the sport before that incident was Habib just dominating Connor yes and they he was the new star he's the new star he was the marketable star coming out of this so I don't necessarily think you have seen needed\nA beep to jump into the crowd to create more of a bus for the rematch he did it inside octagon he'd eat he dominated Connor and his ground game is is second to none in and you see that's why Tony first and\nWho else was on it was on the on the car and he's tried to fight hubby for like four or five times out and it just never as has happened that's the fight all the ... I was listening to some commentary today specified everyone wants to say they want to see Conor against somebody began\nThey don't don't want to see Tony ... and they think will give me a better fight but we know money talks with McConnell needs a when he he even when he needs to go and fight and win and then maybe the ... the the rematch will happen but he wants to an immediate response\nYeah he's not I don't want to see that and I don't see he shouldn't get it he needs to fight when and then we'll see\nWhat Tony Tony first and should get the first Congress or by somebody else ... she'll fight hub even maybe Connor if he wins his white winner by the winter maybe that's what we're going to happen is Connor probably against ... third time or\nWhat I Want to see Nate Diaz fight a beep right that's what I see I don't know if that's but here's the thing Congress as good a fighters using the octagon Sean\nConnery popularity is really everything else\nHis personality right his personalities what sells what has made Conor McGregor more than ... feet when\nLike Ron already right it's yeah it's you know a ... I think the problem with our deepest their popularity is as good a fighters we've ever seen an octagon well I wouldn't go that far but twenty seven or no dominating nominate but let's see um face Tony first but here's the thing but here's the thing he's not much of a personality outside the octagon\nThat's changing now does this help change that does well rides well\nHell of it helps them but\nHow about those those are the his camp jumping into the ring to beat up Connor I mean that's what I Try to kill us I mean both sides I think they're worse than Habib going after Conor McGregor is jujitsu coach doing Dennis\nI think it's worse I don't because one was inside the octagon one was outside your body more piano in harm's way outside the octagon neither is something you can put Dennis deserved it I mean he was talking smack even after the fight yeah which is I don't get that either like you just use the trainer like shut up\nBut I I get there's bad blood in his beef and all that but\nHe just got your butts handed to you like but it's amazing to like habibi was calm and don't let Connor get to them but I guess maybe the odds are amazing how we got to him but he was still able to concentrate and focus and and beat him right you know your minds me of that that is amazing in in these abilities is technical abilities\nHe's us these version of lumber checked on boxing\nBeloved checker is such a technical just destroy your out there right I I don't know if you've seen them fight but he just he was everything right\nAnd to me well they're both by the way from Soviet right will be published robs Connor with with across to yeah in that fight that's surprising that I think the second round yeah I Know of at all because Connor was the better punch you're going in\nBut I mean we just got into the ground once you get to get somebody to ... just throws his weight on top of yeah ... yeah ... into the ground unbelievable I I I thought I thought they would call the fighting second round kind of was getting pummeled yeah\nBut he came back in the third round and then for throwing a twenty third round they may not have held his own looking for three hours just ugly yeah naka he's somebody at the at the tap out here no choice but that point I was amazed at the top I Know that right\nYeah I mean he was he had no choice if I were to get into the college football is while you're shot him in college football what a week and it was more undefeated teams have been now ousted from the ranks do we believe in Texas\nI woke up or tuna should use the F ... by the way

Harris is going to be the future back next year and he's probably in a rush for a bunch of yards and probably make himself a first round pick is while he was a just a few years back the top recruiting the nation they're receiving ...\nRemember Smith father but he went to Notre Dame ... Smith the tight end her swift junior is ridiculous\nDuty is in the next you know he's been next guy from Julio Jones tomorrow recuperate at Calvin Ridley it's now Jerry Judy is averaging Sean twenty four point three yards to catch and they touch downs on twenty three reception Henry rugs the third Jay Lynn Wardle\nDivine pacemaker these guys are ridiculous Alabama offense Jonah Williams will be the first left tackle probably taking them to drop out of office has no holes\nDefensive there are some concerns the secondary was created Israel itself on digs his brother they did he sees one or two maybe may have been the best quarterback yeah\nAvon Trayvon digs yeah by the way I think wasn't even a cornerback in ... in high school I think he was an athlete and even play like both his wide receiver recruited as well but they're not great on the defensive side of football now there is not bad don't get me wrong but they have weakness that second or he's really young they lost\nFour guys I Believe from last year so you know you you lose what Mara you lose a Irani Harrison you lose a hump Marlin Humphrey top draft pick\nFitzpatrick fitzpatrick I mean you lose a make a mistake I mean you're going to have you know you you ... you lost the high draft picks there there used to it at our schools but that's what it is the fact she explains my girlfriend how it works there\nAnd I was talking to my neighbors were walking to go watch football yesterday we're talking about Alabama's asked me what happened in college football retirement up bam and I think ... is head and shoulders the best team in college football right now\nAnd they probably won't get tested and so he played Georgia in the FCC championship game so you don't think they'll get tested again sales you know I don't I I think she's been kind of fraudulent I think Alice you will not be able to score on a ... and I don't think bam as defense is great the problem is it's not as if she was a good quarterback\nBoroughs not he's not going to be throwing the football and you can't run on Alabama really so I think look when you get Arkansas and Arkansas put up what thirty one points on bam a\nLet's not forget that it was like forty two to whatever and half time in ... you know I think ... and ... no matter how much they have been tries to motivate you I think that becomes a point where the up so much that you just kind of want the clock to keep running right if it was a close game I bet you're banned the defense plays better\nBut I look at it you know we're nit picking here weaknesses for the best team in the country kind of figure out is there a way for them to lose\nIn a way for them to lose their defense but here's the problem even if you can score some points on their defense you're not out scoring the fence that's the issue here so Alabama has a battle a bad defensive night Sean and they give up forty points I Would bet you the mortgage that they are still puts up fifty\nLook no one's beat Alabama

people we we need to talk to them in a different way if we start telling a pop Warner player parents you know how great and how awesome their kids going to look in our new home but\nThat's not really going to resonate with them and what they're going to want to know is exactly what you said a word is the ... is a five star helmet on the Virginia tech star system and\nWith this have seven TV it's

that\nUm [noise] but what we can do is say our helmet absorbs more impact than any other helmet on the field it's been proven we've we've put a lot of focus on that\nThat is about the single most important thing to any helmet that player where's whether he's eight years older thirty eight years old is that that element sets foreign and so we talk about that to the parents we talk about coaches were like ... you want to keep your guys on the field right you want to win football games\nSo you got to keep your guys on the field so you want to put them in the best performing helmets that you can and that you can afford and again at the college ranks you talk to the equipment managers and it's all about again keeping those guys on the field so that they can win football games\nThat when you you know and and when you talk about you know introduce nice helmets linked to the players and the first thing they do the walk across the room and they look at themselves in it tell me because

many players they ask you in terms of protecting me one is this do differently what does he have seven LT do different compared to the competitors is that a question you get a heck of a lot more today from players and he did back in the day\n... financial aid and it's not even close to ten years ago um I think it would be safe to say that at most tap or the guy in the NFL even knew what helmet they were wearing\nUm there was no helmet ratings at that time we all manufacturer helmets and we still do to what's called the knock the standard which is a pass fail\nFor a helmet to be certified to be used in the NFL and college and high school and pop Warner and it has to pass the standard\nTen years ago that was that now we have the Virginia tech star system we have other helmet rating system the NFL is done their own helmet testing and so these guys are very much more educated on um\nOn on what it is they're putting on their heads and and it's really encouraging to see that we love to see that we love to hear we love to have those questions\nBecause I mean these guys are taking an interest\nIn their health and in their safety and then we can talk to them and and and when we get a

Court justice Brett Kavanaugh shows up for work this morning day one of the new job and the sooner or later although I don't think the docket this term includes any but sooner or later the Supreme Court will again have to tackle thorny issues surrounding the second amendment we thought we'd take a look\nAt the directed which that might go with Dave workman's senior editor at the gun magazine dot com and that liberty park press he's also a communications director for the citizens committee for the right to keep and bear arms\nAre there any particular\nA Second Amendment issues that you could expect to see it coming up before the Supreme Court in the not too distant future\nWhile there are a couple of cases down in California that I think are trend wind their way up through the courts as we know the the the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in San Francisco the most liberal court in the United states and it's also the mole show return\nAnd I think there is there a couple of a good case down there are I Believe there is also going to be a new challenge to the Jersey a concealed carry a scheme that they have going back there\nAnd maybe Maryland will come up to a there are several states with very restrictive concealed carry statutes and with the more conservative more are constitutionally oriented Supreme Court I think some of those laws are going to come under what we call strict scrutiny and we'll see how woolly fair\n[noise] one of the more important gun control issues to come up before the courts in recent years is a D.C versus Heller that is to say a look at the district of Columbia's gun control law I Want to quote what a appellate court judge Kavanaugh had to say seven years ago a quote\nIn disapproving D.C.'s ban on handguns in approving a ban on machine guns and in approving longstanding regulations such as concealed carry and felon in possession laws\nHeller established that the scope of the second Amendment rights and plus the constitutionality of gun bans and regulations is determined by reference to text history and tradition unquote been judge Brett Kavanaugh your thoughts on how this will carry forward into of cases before the Supreme Court\nWell I think that gives us a hint of four or eight and justice Kavanaugh is going to come down on Second Amendment issues he understands that are all rights can be regulated to some degree but\nThey're not government regulated privileges and certainly the second amendment is not a government regulated privilege it is a\nFundamental constitutionally protected right and I think from for reading what he said in that historic descent I thought it was ... you get the impression that he is going to come down\nOn the side of the individual right to bear arms even outside the home a with a permit they they they were really forced by the courts to create a concealed carry system in the district of Columbia District but\nAgain it's not above being challenged again in the courts and that may be a case that comes before the high court to eventually\nAnd has been a while since we've had a major Second Amendment issue before the Supreme Court despite the fact that there have been any number of uh uh such cases bubbling around out there which may be symptomatic of a larger condition at the Supreme Court and that is a reluctance to touch hot potatoes I've never understood that\nI was then why Congress doesn't like to even though it's their constitutional duty to do so but they're afraid of a reelection if they vote on some controversial issue that's a chicken but a understandable with the Supreme Court they're there for life\nWhy should they shy away from such issues\nI think historically as we saw with retired Justice John Paul Stevens [noise]\nAh there are some liberal justices who have been on the court really didn't want to take on the second amendment murmur Sanford limits and wrote that great piece or some years ago called the embarrassing Second Amendment\nYou know there's there's a lot to that sentiment it's embarrassing but to a lot of these liberal\nThe jurors who think God you know we're stuck with the second amendment I Wish we could just tell the world that this applies only to the militia well we've gone beyond that that horses left the barn\nProtection individual right and now they're going to have to deal with that yeah and I think with the justice cabin on the high court we probably stand up pretty good chance of dealing with it\n[noise] uh and then again there's always the worry many conservatives feel\nThat we will have another quote conservative justice unquote who doesn't prove to be a idiot logically pure seems the Democratic presidents have picked a idiot logical clones probably more reliably than have Republicans us not forget the Justice Stevens was a ah Gerry Ford pick\n... Gerry Ford was what some people might call a rhino Republican in name only I I never met Jerry Ford\nGay and you know we'll we'll just let the history decide what kind of a prison it was\nA I think with Campbell although we've got a pretty good idea that he is going to stick pretty close to the second amendment admitted that time that it was written in what it means today\nAnd you know I think we're looking at a uh some good times I think for the second amendment because as my friend Alan Gottlieb but the second amendment foundation has said many times it's time to make the second amendment

DEF CON five or something to that extent though we're as ... as far as tensions go inside Green Bay\n[noise] I mean look you're still talking about some very accomplished individual people who've been together for a long time um guys who operate 'em at an extremely professional level\nSo I don't think the buildings going to be on fire or anything like that but I I also don't know that this is going to get completely fix on the fly and add a macro level they're going to have some decisions to make\n'em three months from now you know and and do I see Mike mccarthy doing another one year sort of bandied deal I I wouldn't if I were him\nAnd are they going to reopen and make this a three or four year bond and you know say that this is definitely the guy in the fence to maximize the prime of what you know what's left of the prime of Aaron Rodgers career which\nYou know maybe that's five years I mean I I don't know guys or play until they're forty three now so who knows how long that it is although you know obviously injuries have a way of mitigating anything so you know I think that's\nThat's where it's it's headed and when you're paying a player as much as you are now paying Aaron Rodgers and the expectations are that high um\nYou know I mean you guys live there you tell me do people feel like this is you know what a Packers ... should be and obviously injuries are mitigating factors and all that\nBut you know Iran Rogers and you're looking around the weak the weak and you're watching some of these other games and you're seeing some of the ... things that are shown McVeigh doing that at any reads doing that you know some of these other officers even some of this stuff they're doing to try to prop up ...\nIn Chicago with an offshoot of that sort of Andy Reid Alex Smith Patrick my own stuff [noise]\nYou know are they at the vanguard of our fence of football and do they need even more of a rethink than than what they've done in the past I mean that that those are kind of decisions that mark Murphy and the board are going to have to make because I I mean I again I I live in Baltimore at the same thing here John Harbaugh took a one year extension\nYou know so he's he's in the same boat\nLike he's not doing that again it's like they either have to read up and put the ring back on his finger\nOr he's going to say I'm fine playing out the lame duck here\n'cause I Know they'll be something for me and then they got to decide well that doesn't really make sense for us so maybe we just go get a new coach with our new young GM air to Costa you know you guys got the young GM there you know sick whenever nine months ago but I I I think you'd have to be naive not to start looking\nBig picture and seeing where it's going\nAaron Rodgers has had some comments publicly that have been back and we've seen it before\nUm but this off in the tourist leave for the last few years gets up to slow starts yeah and they always blame it on well this is the first time really playing together we don't play in the pre season I\nYou know I I and and Brian ... brought up a point a little bit earlier you said well look there's only a few teams that are dominant ... everybody's in the same boat so it's frustrating as it is because you know you have one of the top quarterbacks and all the football and you feel you should be firing on all cylinders\nShould you just chalk it up to wait to see what the second half brings before you start making decisions or did you look at it as ms team the Tories when he gets off to a slow start and they could be a dominant team if it wasn't for this horse crap that they play in the pre season or don't play in the pre season\n[noise] and now I [noise] more and more teams are not playing in the pre season and I'll say the team that took it to me to a degree that I'd never seen it before it was the ramps\nAnd who's playing better off into football right now in the NFL than the rams ... been there not\nAnd especially since ... went down and Peters is playing on one leg um they don't have that Russia's yeah they've got suing Donald but they're they're winning on our fence and\nGolf didn't play a lick and girly didn't play a lick\nAnd cooks didn't play a lick and the starting off of line didn't play a lick I was at the first preseason game and nobody played in that I watched it last preceding it and nobody played in that and I I was around that team for a week in the pre season spent a lot of time around showing McVeigh they were trading here in Baltimore\nAnd you know it was like we went through the walk me through the cost benefit analysis and you know he's like basically I don't want us to my left tackle is is a little older and I don't want to risk anything with him and I've never seen anything with him that I'm not playing girly and I'm not playing and golf and if I'm not playing those student you know what I mean why my plane cooks and all these other guys we gave big money to\nFake they're flying through undefeated so you know I don't know chicken or the egg ... there was one leading to the other what what works for some teams doesn't work for others but the trend seems to be going in the direction of just avoid injury at all cost\nSo how real are how deep I guess is the\nUh the lasting effects of getting rid of a bill to the quarterbacks coach rerun Rogers and getting rid of June emails is that something that you believe that he's\nKind of hoarding against McCarthy new organization or is this just we're making too much out of this is just a dysfunctional weapons right now with the bank to quarterback that just needs a week of a by week after they get past this Monday Night game and then we'll be right with the world\nAnd I don't know if I was holding a against but it's it's part of the thought process you know and we we you know do we have a running back we can count on and and have we gotten better and wide receiver or or have we know and\nIt's it's personality scheme it says it's his own performance at his own health all that\nIs involved in it I don't know how I could parse out this more than that you know from the people I talk to it just how they got to this point is\nNot sitting well with a lot of people and ... will they fix it and the second half will you know his knee getting a little better week the week and a few guys coming back from concussions and otherwise you know will they be able to put it together I mean maybe but you know\nIt also has it looks you know before all that stuff now that it it it it was going to get to your points that came out of the ... the gate like gangbusters I mean they they managed to win that one with the bears but it's it's been you know hit or miss it's been hard to sustain anything and um\n\nToo by the Wisconsin laborers
