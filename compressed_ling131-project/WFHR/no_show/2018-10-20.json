forty yard line all the way to the forty four pick up a Fifteen first and I'm sure we talked\nAbout how the world that they can get outside if they can get some free that's the same play they ran the last three yards I burst down this time they got a call ... he was able to get Fifteen are just less bylines right front of the bill that first cat loyal to their ... or\nYou know come to the line of scrimmage put one white out that building on the bottom of the screen\nTook it under center they don't take them head on straight up the middle of the Siamese Nelson does have that as he gets out real quick here for five yard to the forty nine yard line they they are now and then five just shy of midfield strike I couldn't really quick\nAt that time by eight and ... you know a ... in the back you up and just the the die by the pool that can get five almost five and a half yards good first don't play for the world\nYou know how many times have you seen a coach taken time out and they got nothing out here like why did you wait to tighten what might have taken the five yard penalty but that time was a great time out like a great time out sucking down now five yards to go fake the little hand off they'll fix or to the near side line this I'm put down that proximate field and get to the forty eight is\nGetting the forty seven that was also on the carry on from that time as the uh the

defensively by Pittsfield him because he had he had space out in the outside their and hard to hear who was able to get them and actually knock on the ... backwards to get them out of balance out after ... only six or seven yards will be second down at 'em long three I Would say for the world\nWinner this ball game to face either Allman Bancroft or will be you know they own I'm working can

well but when he defends well and they still get forward four and a half yard you go oh gee [laughter] that was that was a good move good quick by merit to get into the second level if something does happen\nTo back behind hurting your crawls under center this time he'll take off your role to the right side just a little quick after the flat and Fox all taken across midfielder forty five and they'll market down and just shy of the forty hours line that way it appears the life\nBy that time just a little a little option to the right housing or doesn't have moved to his right Fox right into

dealing with Craig coming over from the safety and that ball with someone outside a hunter will never got the cut completed and we'll still stuck inside so it's just overthrown\nIncomplete\nUpdate third down and just the scores more than ten yards to go\nWe've got just a select for nine minutes remaining here is the first half of actually [noise] they won't split wide off left and right I ... for me this time behind\nHurting here and we've got a flag on the line you know as we got off side that I Believe we're going to be called royals are clapping but yet they point to that point in the hills so one of the players wind up over the ball and\nI'm probably put the hand down so they don't understand the backup ...\nOnly against Panthers that our first and only the ball you know we have that face to face mask and also another uh another penalty families to major bellies going somewhere else so far out of the\nFirst one against pits or swimming in itself so the third down just a little bit more than Fifteen yards to the ball\nBack now at the thirty eight yard line of the Panthers or they'll change the formation this time and go with the two white off left and right single set back that marriage behind hurting our who's in a shotgun formation those three step dropped always under some direct role to the right looking down field going to let it\nWide open up a forty hard line they knocked out of bounds after thirty the reception me like hunter grim and settle down for the panther\nSon's thirty one yards on that path grandma and a third town and Fifteen and tell you whether any of that and he was just too wide open a crazy up and trying to get to him from the free safety position but a hundred grand bound to see him on the right side at the corner and a\nWhile but it seems like when the Panthers spread to feel like that you do a very good job of running somebody free whether it's long or underneath all first down in royal territory after thirty yard\nLine ... take fan goes off left tackle he's taking ... them across the twenty five down to the Twenty one and the the headlines on going to agree with him I haven't heard of the ... early came the royal I'm ahead there ball right\nThe reason that he was able to get up yards is because they were pulling away from it and they gave us up from the great clay I Believe that play was made by a man Alison for the oil goes off on a defensive lineman linebacker he took that ball grab it he was pulling it along\nWith a with a merit and pulled out of them and that's just a game but it ends up being a fumble around assumption turn over\nYou know they almost had to call it a formal because they didn't blow the whistle yep and when they didn't blow the whistle a play wasn't that you kind of had the feeling they're gonna have to say it was up on the ball at the Twenty one yard line now all but some soon\nAs they get their first turnover of the ball game traveling at fourteen to seven and now we've got to whistle outside of some sort of play\nOff by me so we'll\nPut it back to the sixteen yard line\nEverybody up and down the line looking at the headlines when wanting to find out which of them was the person that was offsite and or something coaches asking the judge and decide who ... what was that about\nHe goes I don't know I didn't throw flick [laughter] quite that way over there twenty two and a stoppage of the block here to order number to cut the justice\nElement and he said basically a battle even turnovers will be the key to the game and so part of the functions a little bit on the short end up both of those but the turnover situation and one of the one\nMan in motion to the bottom stream they go over the counter towards the top and a lot of them do and they're going

him probably about ten yards down the field you know follow that they can you hold forever on a personal fouls in deep and the a pedophile\nSecondary I'm not sure what happened there are people kept blocking after the player or whatever but uh\nThe royals are walking backwards so\n\nThe market all the way back to the\nTwenty five yard line twenty six so I'll make it so that's another Fifteen yard penalty against the royals they've had\nThree to four major penalties in this game ready to pour him suddenly for Seventy I think that place or that the forty seven year I'd like to know their back on a thirty six or the fans are going to preserve a little clock here with twenty two point four seconds to go they're going to take your time\nUm so there was always kind of an affinity for the university and um when I started to transfer I ended up working system or basketball camps what the market staff um just to make some money in the summer job\nUm and then from there I got pulled into some some skirmishes in the evenings and um I found myself just being in the gym um a lot\nAnd then um before going to the end of July I'm Brian ... who is a tremendous player Marquette Anna's sitting at the time I'm basically asked me if I'd be interested in walking on to the to the team for the following year\nUm and so he gave me I'm essentially the next sixty days to to get in shape and to really come back to school um you know ready to compete for a spot and\nUm so I actually came back to Marshfield and I spent um\nYou know several hours a day at 'em that are learning that lady of

don't know about what that is like to be a walk on ballplayer but what does that procedure like for a young man who decides to walk gone without a scholarship in a program like more cap\nSo it was interesting for me because I'm you know quote it Brian ... hadn't hadn't talked me about the possibility but um there wasn't a guaranteed spot for me by any means so um when I went back to school um I was a true for different workouts with um the coaching staff\nAnd I'm the first one\nWas absolutely brutal um you know coach Tom Green I'm Out on the sideline and watched\nAnd history assistant coaches draw ran us to drills um and it was about two and a half hours of just um you just get higher they breed um but they wanted to see kind of um what type of a competitor I was and um you know whether I Would I Would quit and when when things got tough um\nAnd I just persevered and um you know I had three more workouts that were similar to that um after the first one\nUm and then finally after the the fourth one um\nThey came up to me and told me to write a letter\nAnd um basically just explaining like why aren't the heart of the program and it was easy for me to right now to be honest with you because that was part of really map brain and for me not just you know on that are playing college basketball playing division one math and bomb them\nKnocking on the right in that letter that playing our tax dollars extra special to me and a lot more I mean I think a lot of the other and can never mind for a spot\nIn the letter that within a couple of days later in his office I'm kind of explained the expectation is one of the things he told me was simply that he was going to coach me like anyone else on the team\nAnd that you know in fact Asians were me for me where his expectations for for ... senior who was there all American ... Steve Novak or would go on to play in the NBA and eleven seasons down\nMeal that type of standard even though I wasn't on scholarship that was pretty cool thing\nThat's Marshfield John Will come once again his book is entitled to walk on we're a year and is available to Amazon dot com will return to pitch to build high school and more W why a football playoff action when Randy Paul and Dave Miller following these messages pioneer bank\nIn the service since Nineteen with offices in central Wisconsin Ryan or bankers offer financial products and services relevancy what every day whether you want to open a new jacking rule where you're ... or ...\nOr savings member of the ice the injured in your mind your bank lenders offered their expertise where you were important lending decisions to buy more refinance your home which is the family vehicles and expand your agribusiness working long term financing where you are commercially its way into your bank equal housing Leonard stopping them either seven Comey locations or visit them on line in my mind your bank dot com which is good luck to argue routines and to these games [noise]\n\nThing we were listening to Wisconsin badger football all season long right here on W.

all that much Travis was that you get a lot of laps side scores here\nBut these small towns where where they just live and breathe football once they get deeper into these levels were going to see some ethics battles in division seven that's for sure\nWe will into scores that we want to pass on that have gone final back and forth exciting games plummet beat port Washington Twenty one twenty

I Do know that are being very close to to that location and going through at the ... several hundred times in my life um and why should I get a couple of weeks ago there was no cell service in Ithaca\nFor us so I I'm guessing that it's hard to get scores out from Ithaca because it's in the middle of nowhere and there is no cell service at least from us are you in that I have well\nMaybe I can dig through my my my phone rolodex because I've done it the ... in state baseball for a uh a couple of years and always have a good connection with them and I'm sure a lot of those baseball guys are also football guys so we'll try to rally and get that\nFinal to you I'm so they're all seven divisions I it took us about three breaks in between everything to get all those scores but again we've got two hundred and twenty four\nTeams playing individually one through seven and so that's a hundred and twelve games that they were trying to get through and we know that every game and every score is important now so you want to get get through all those but but again Travis now that you've digested all the files that we have\nBesides the offsets what kind of sticks out here what kind of jumps out\nWhile we have the seven seeds over to see is that we mentioned in there were five of them tonight it turns out\nSussex Hamilton over Madison memorial sparred over Ashland be walking over McFarland nuclear Monticello over pretty sheen darling to an over ... those were seven seeds over to seeds will run down a full list of other upsets\nA little bit later on in football friday night\nBut one team that did not get upset tonight held on to win pretty handily in division for\nOne of these Somerset Spartans making a return trip to the playoffs they force feed their home game dominating win and Bruce Larson the head coach from Somerset joins us now coach got to feel good to not only get back into the play offs but to pick up that W right away it convincingly in the first game\nYeah where are we played wild and I are quarterback was armed and uh we have all these days of our option and gold and uh things work well with the grid effects\nSo you play great defense and you had things go on the right way uh what is what is it allows you guys this year to get things turned around after a couple of years of some struggles are you finished pretty highly in the middle border there now looking pretty good heading into the playoffs what's what's allowed you to get things had it in the right direction again\nThat's why it's really well and people and a nice little back and we're taking care of the football when I turn it over\nYou know it was just like silver playing pretty steady do fence with dirt ill or things are really ...\nWe're talking with Bruce Larson the head coach Somerset who's squad beat the electric triple a tonight forty six to six on football friday night\nCoach um I I'm guessing the folks in Somerset we're kind of spoiled with all the success that you've had over the years it was already barking or is there any ... you know people ever just saying hey what what's going on or or would they were you at least pleading patience with them to that this was mentioned we get back on track\nNow this group or going to go through that stuff their school for some years are going to be better than others and\nYour kids are all our replay at art or out just to make it plays it needed to make at the time and uh you know was a lot of effort is just a couple of years we were quite as Dale couldn't [noise] uh you know by the way through\nTalking with Bruce Larson head coach at Somerset a forty six to six Victor over Gail after ... tonight\nAnd as I'm guessing you already saw St Croix central gotta dominating forty to not be weight over Adams friendship so that's your next match up St Croix central a team that you lost two earlier this year in the middle border conference what's your take on a rematch against the Panthers\nThough there are a great deal I mean they've got everything they've got a great quarterback got a great pulled back ... back there playing great that's a ... you can play a game and\nI'm like it's good enough but uh we play them a lot you know each other pretty well in a tribute to\nBruce when you're placing quite central and you're getting rain your prepping for them and practicing for them can you mimic what they do on our fence or do you just try to worry about yourself\nThat Iran Iran right under the same stuff right\nSo this is the same as players out [laughter] so I mean ...\n... you know I end up on a regular guys over although that's them recalls and\nBruce we wish you luck in your in your rematch with St Croix central and tonight congratulations on getting the W. four summers that\nAll right Dr guys bags\nYou as Well Bruce Larson head coach at Somerset ... advance yeah um [laughter]\nI Want to hear from from the coach himself because those those options is Travis they're they're pretty much identical so\nIt should be I don't want to say easy but sometimes teams struggle trying to mimic in practice something they don't see a whole lot Somerset in St Croix central they know what's coming and they can pretty much line up at least practice and know that the same thing is coming on friday night\nMight know what's coming what the players will look like what you can simulate especially with your starting group going against your backups on this team is the strength the physicality the a deficiency that St Croix central is going to to run their off and sweat the power that they're going to have with Ryan Larson what he can do to hammer away\nJust looked at the film ought to get a little bit\nOf garlic didn't want I thought oh anyway they\nThey have and I'm looking at you know we uh we had three kids play it off that are just the pet and we have to sit there and the parents now that are playing off and that kind of funny to see it that the different makeup we have at this time of year than we did was there that I'm sure they did the same thing as you grow up\nBut it all and next year Travis ... will be playing all over the last well it's kind of exciting\nJohn ... joining us the head coach of the Lancaster flying arrows on football friday night or John if if you're a kid growing up in Lancaster you you probably know and you hear about and you absorb what Lancaster football is all about but once they get into your myths and and they get they get in the high school\nDo you give them a little reminder you give them a little ... kind of like like a prepared speech to just kind of talk about the tradition and talk about expectations of being a flying euro football player\nYou know and I probably do it the wrong way that I I feel bad for that because if they don't have that there's something wrong and of course there's always something wrong with yourself there is a college but you know\nWe've built kind of a monster here and it's it's a it's a fine line there but you know when we're trying to get ourselves to be winning I remember that every you know amazing how the people would come out and celebrate the weight and then\nI remember our first car for a championship back in\nBack in the day and and we had one in a copper chairmanship lick essay they brought in a fire trucks were captured championship and only one around the town that features a boy or what we have a square John it you know all those things and\nYou know these kids here way that I feel sorry we just bought a copper chapter about it but

divisions four five six seven and eight men football and again we'll start to look ahead start to peek ahead at some of the match ups lurking in level to [noise]\nLook take a look at in review some of the\nBigger upsets that we saw tonight I'm not going to count finds over force there was a number of those and that's a coin flip a lot of times who gets that foresee who gets the five seed although I Will say that arrowhead dominating Verona as much as they did\nIt is an eye opener it was I think and I said it I thought it was a little surprised arrowhead despite winning six in a row got five seed in that group in sixty three Twenty one and\nThey put it on her own and I was at that game to start the second half it was twenty eight fourteen and a half time and then arrowhead erupted in the second half\nAnd that was a little chip on the shoulder you think I think so I think there's a little chip on the shoulder and that program in general because it hasn't been\nWhere people expect people in that community expect arrowhead to be the last few years it wasn't there the first three weeks when they started on three that's for sure but they've got it turned around too much tail it too much dumped too much talent on the coaching staff experience on the coaching staff for them\nAnd the right direction we were talking earlier travel about a potential rematch that a lot of folks are talking about and maybe hoping that it happens and that would be Kimberly and find a way\nBut you're talking about arrowhead right here and that brings up their next game against find a life that will be ... next friday night not an easy game for finding here certainly they cannot look ahead to any Kimberly match up because here comes arrowhead\nThat's a tough second round game second level game against eight five seed ... cardinals to have to get a red hot arrowhead team to the upset that we are will\nConsider upsets though sevens are six is winning there was no eight seeds that one by the way but in division one ... beat number to Madison memorial thirty five Twenty one and it was until we had three of these games number seven sparred over number two Ashland thirty six to eight\nNumber six Hartford over number three west and east at thirty to twenty two number six walk a show of West over number three will not forty one twenty six\nDivision three we had a couple people walk it goes on the road to McFarland the second seat in previously undefeated twenty two to Twenty one copper strength showing their in a number of these other games as well and then see more beat New London Nineteen to seven\nIn a big conference rematch indigent for it was Bob them with all over west Salem six over at three in Lodi got past like mills Seventeen to fourteen\nDivision five there was this one but it was a surprise number seven nuclear Monticello beats them or to purchase sheen twenty eight twenty four\nDarlene in division ... as a seven over a two number six Auburn Dale be number three ... and individually seven and this was a significant I opener\nFenton scales mound\nNumber six feet over Fall River number three ... thirty five to seven Benton scales mountain as one of the last team to get in the playoffs after finishing under five hundred and conference play but very impressive to beat the co champions and the trail with south\nUs gives me Troy small Fall River so those are the the more significant upsets that we saw tonight in level one of the playoffs and you've\nTalked about a rematch is that that are looming now not future ones in levels three or four that a lot of people aren't dissipating are hoping happens but these are now re matches that will happen\nNext friday night and one of them in division to the Brookfield school's going to go ahead again Travis this is like a yearly ritual where they play twice a year Brookfield central oh one C. they'd be self Milwaukee Brooke east to foresee they'd be Burlington they'll meet at Central next friday night round to\nThis is in fact for straight years that these teams will meet in the playoffs in addition to the regular season and coach John Kennedy from Brookfield central talk to us about it a number of times that this is really unique situation many times when you have multiple school\nHigh communities multiple schools in one town it's difficult to have a couple of those or one of those are both of those be very competitive a lot of times it's one team is really good the other teams really bad\nFor Brookfield to have two teams that are planted elite levels we're back to back years those teams were in the state finals in division two is very unique speaks greatly to that community and so those football programs\nBrookfield central beat Brookfield these earlier this year but\nThere is no sure things in the playoffs there was a few years ago where Brookfield these\nAre upset Brookfield central in the playoffs I think central was a one year east was either a four or five so it can happen especially in these crushed home games where there's a lot of familiarity and there's a lot of intensity and energy so that is going to be one of the great game to watch in level too\nYou're talking to a virtual central alum so so I Know I Know what this is all about I Know what each central it in any sport uh in division for Travis interesting match up here second seated when accounting will face number three seed writes Tom that'll be ... when a ... that's that's a really interesting match between those two teams\nWhen it was the champions of the central conference than some close calls to get that done it so that will be a tough match up against the rights comes out of a very balanced in competitive northeastern Catholic\nSo those are some of the match ups and again we we've just gotten through the first four divisions will will scroll through the brackets and divisions five six and seven\nLet you know what some of the intriguing match ups for next friday look like one level to tease it up state why the only be a hundred and twelve teams play next week and then we cut that field and a half once again that's how it works in the playoffs folks survive in

involving top forty five against top twenty five [noise] intriguing ones so why should Michigan at Michigan State [noise]\nNorth Carolina state of Clemson two teams that are combined\nEleven and all but not a lot of people given the state any respect in this game clients is almost an Eighteen point favorite here\nRegardless the fact that I have a quarterback that is you know think about it I mean Ryan's family is a guy people look at it as a legitimate NFL prospect Mississippi State at LSU Mississippi states quickly on their way out of the top twenty five\nYou look at the other match up this one's fun I like Oregon Washington state\nHere's the problem though that match up\nWashington state knocks off Oregon kissed any chance of the pack twelve team going to the college football playoff we bring in our body\nEvery single week he joins is pretty few tech college football news dot com Pete before we get into some of these big matchups last weekend was just wacky for top ten teams out a bunch of undefeated teams were knocked out Pete your thoughts on what we witnessed in week number seven\nWhere it's weekend I can remember I mean I've been doing to your friend for over Twenty years there have been some crazy week for you that you're always going to be upset and there's so many games that just by sheer numbers there's always going to be something crazy happening but it was like every single game as something weird that was out of the norm\nAnd even the teams that you know one and it just you know be at Ohio State they were a little bit rocky for a while there are you seeing it was just some sort of bizarre scenario everywhere\nAnd it all shakes out and turns out to be great for Notre Dame because you know if you're one of these guys do you think you have a shot or like you mentioned the pack twelve before you needed Georgia out of their\nGeorgia to pretty much have one last before and SEC championship a unique the SEC is sort of start knocking itself out and the old cliche well everything kind of always works out well last week kind of did\nThey did do question about it and really you know some of these games are big surprises I Do want to get to Penn State here because I have a lot of friends who are Penn State's fans and they're not playing the game of well I thought they'd be good this year I I honestly\nReally be a serious national championship contenders this year I'm hearing that for more than one person to me I'm like you weren't speaking that until that first lost Ohio State is is a big disappointment season for James Franklin that they've already been sampled it to last is potentially could end the year with three or four\nYeah you know that's asking saying a lot you lose the Ohio State that's not\nYou know you can't really fault that and it was it was the last to Michigan State issues states pretty good so you know of course it's a it's a program that wants to get into the national title picture and certainly up there on the list with them you talk about really grow Wisconsin and us see maybe over the last two years of being the best program that back in the college football playoff\nA but it's it they're going to be find it was a little bit of rebuilding here is recruiting his tail up they've got a ton of young talent\nAll right so you're not going to win the national championship this year they're still going to go to a big bowl game and now let's see what they do against Wisconsin they still going to deal with Michigan pretty soon they still got some big games coming up it will be there still okay\nBe let's talk about Michigan on the road at Michigan State it's again that's really kinda haunted\nJim Harbaugh on these three years he's wanting to against Michigan State including that that would be game a few years back where the punter couldn't hold on to the ball and obviously that turn the tide that went to Michigan State missions are seven and a half point favorite on the road they haven't played great on the road this year look they lost a Notre Dame\nBy the way a very good team that's bringing Winbush and they only beat northwestern by three and they had to come back in that game any worries for you in terms of Michigan as hot as they are winning six straight games for straight in the Big Ten that they go on the road to Michigan State East Lansing that it could be a let down here\nOh cool lucked out that it took me a let down it's going to be that the the acts of this a rivalry that kicks in because you know when you've got these two teams\nAnd Michigan State their style is to tie in there where it's great against the Penn State's in Iowa State in Michigan because they can slow it down market up and come through in tight games\nMichigan state's grid that market Tony oh it's great it that problem is that keeps northwestern in the game you know it keeps\nUtah State and the game but it keeps their bed teams around so it's not the problem is it's supposed to be really windy in the mid west\nSo be at the Iowa will know Maryland gay and it's supposed to have like forty mile an hour wind or to Michigan Michigan State whether could play a factor in this it played a factor last year where students in the rain chicken and a half time no one could do anything\nSo it depends on what you can do or the keys or more you get the first half and who can handle the it's better but yeah there's a poll or it's from Michigan goes quick\nChat with a buddy ... news dot com and they should have checked it out on Twitter at ... I get by U. T. A. K. Iran going deep to enforcement NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com with this game at Michigan State and it being obviously a massive rivalry it's going to be a heck of a lot of fun\nIn terms of Michigan okay what is the biggest weakness right now on that team when you look at that team what is it that one thing you look as they say that's the Achilles heel for the Wolverine because of how well they played recently\n[noise] it would be nice if the path a little more explosion shape Paterson has been great uh current events in grades they've they've got the often told me if you just had a little more pop to this thing that defense is amazing\nIt would be nice if they could just come out in rural right away kind of like they did against Wisconsin and do that every week and it just not bogged down I actually took away from like the northwestern game a positive that that you take a close call game that\nYou do tend to tend to lose in the past and they were able to come away with the women they didn't quite out there a game\nSo there isn't all that there isn't one area that is just going to be like really painful for this team because they're they're better than Michigan State just about every area\nPilates go all the way west to the are packed twelve\nPullman, Washington Martin Stadium gardener men chew the fifth year transfer has been fantastic for Washington state leads college football a lot of passing categories\nIn Oregon loses at Washington state who are favored in this match up does that signify the end or if they even had a chance at this at this point in terms of the conference Pete of getting into the final four\n[noise] from store to Washington state nobody\nKind of talking about them but they're pretty good I mean many issues been checked Catholic defenses that are right they they are tough game against us the which they couldn't get through I think Washington state when there's I there's too many okay teams Oregon is a good luck to go through the twelve and wall and\nIt just not going to happen so uh I don't think you are going to see a pact or close to the uh to the college football playoff I still think Washington is going to end up winning it\nOkay gang so chances are they'll never be an emergency ever ever again this is not just in case let's talk about a plant okay so who's going to do what anyone uh yeah OK perfect we'll figure it out as we go so who is going to grab to go back\nGo bag it is a bag reading at hand that it's still the things we really really needed an emergency yesterday when I have to worry about it that a\nGood point [noise] so are we all know who to call if something happens then right\nI'd have to ... can and and I tried to call a view that grant doesn't it\nI don't know have a dead battery and Julie will be on the phone with ...

I went with its work because of that but\nI was shocked me Miami an underdog at home and this game I bought it the minimum you're going off may pick maybe that's all the same point but not the case in Vegas whites alliance and again I think going to win it for no other reason because Stafford against off while everybody was the dolphin\nThat ugly but it's been affected their horns\nWho I'd just like my first girlfriend Wendy absolutely I'm telling you man ... she's not listening don't worry about it well see I don't honestly care anymore she pissed me off to bed anyway as we are not here to talk about that though the patriots and the bears\nBears undefeated a home patriots handle on a game away from home we remember that ... but oh wait a minute they they beat the chiefs are the patriots kind of an up and down type team\nBears last last week again they shouldn't have they're gonna be chomping at the New England a three point favorite\nI think it's a really good game book fairs as you mentioned that law in Miami has got to leave this hour to their mouth I Would expect that you have to come up owing very hard very well my question is Chicago or they're scoring ... points for twenty two\nYou're going to score teams are going to support it it can have a Tom Brady Drew Brees ... they're going to a point and so\nNew England probably going to score twenty four twenty seven in this game you ... you have to play well confirm this score more than that against the dollar tech has now I don't think the path of the person all the time for a week they beat the forty point doing it uh\nI think New England finds a way I just don't trust ... that being said it's a it's a type of game\nWhere there's been forced to turn over maybe get a nice return they could certainly when I mean the talent there I just don't know ... up the pac\nMan burger and some than sounded like Tom's with us and NBC Sports radio do games that I really like jump off the page to me and the second half of the day seems that the ratings change or a better team saints undefeated on the road though I mean going to take on the ravens Baltimore is yet the favorites\nAre in this contest so simply because it's in Baltimore and me to an end points it's gotta be because of that\nYes no question I Love the saints in this game look I get it with Baltimore really good defense but\nI I just talked about this is Tony fell I'm taking the offices all day long I don't care I respect for more I think Baltimore the playoff team from Baltimore struggle score and everybody's very high on Baltimore 'cause it just I was Twenty one to nothing and I get that was the titans aren't any good\nNo they're not who who quarterbacks are signs that somebody who shouldn't be at this point I was a yeah Marcus Mario college right I played at the University of Oregon\nAnd that's why there is that you\nFeel about that yeah I'm ... ... you know what\nI don't I look at the raven I don't trust them off as the way I noticed that there are good but again they think they're going to the point to end the saints are coming off a by week matter to pass this game\nAnd everybody remembers what they saw that Baltimore wax Tennessee or a couple of weeks ago both lost twelve nine to Cleveland yeah so this seems to me are the better team I don't care that they're on the road there's gold differently than they were years ago and it was superdome or bust that franchise I think they find a way to want on the ...\nYeah I Do I I agree as well too and I'm not this one your Sunday night match up on you got a little ball ginger and Andy Dalton going against the cheese looking to rebound playing there an airhead which I think of something they can do but the bangles teenagers the bangles lose no foreign three they seem a lot better than that\nHere the Bengals have played well I've been impressed by him they come to the same little banged up missing their top corner than art there was some other pieces including a vibrant art center Billy price or the question I have in this game is can handle more more of an lowest and Andy Dalton beat the tandem advantage to read at all\nAnd I don't think it can not in this thought this game was in Cincinnati it would be more of a coin cook for me\nBoth teams coming off of loss I go home with the trees are going to give up thirty points because that's just what the chiefs do but if you file for going to score thirty eight points I think sometimes in the game I think it's a compelling game I think it's exciting\nBut I think ultimately Cincinnati might feel a little here a narrative she probably won't\nAnd this so I'm sure the ... owns read combination of all of the scope position players around those guys\nAre I I just don't trust the bangles in fact the quick nugget in St Louis took over this team and two thousand three they fully Seventeen prime time road games there one in sixteen and those\nCan you go so they have a propensity to lose sight to other teams at the news and lose a lot\nGiants in ... into your Monday Night game I mean you can honestly stay stay late at work\nOr in miss it goes both teams are under achieving and not talk to a soccer fan and they said the one thing that looking forward to this game is finally they needed the chick fillet cause it's normally clothes on Sundays during the week or so you know the shakes lays open inside the stadium and that's that's that's about all you can say that as ms giants and he's been a train wreck for a while\nThe joys of terrible and you know we saw Thursday night the cardinals basically quit midway through gain in Denver wall last Thursday night we saw the giants just flat out quite against eagle\nThe giants were busy fighting equipment on the sideline they had no interest in going on the field manning doesn't throw the ball anything more than three feet now\nA ... I think the falcons banged up and then they have all the ... getting all the way I was literally the last forty points out the giants are do given up\nThere and you know mentioned earlier the will not agree look hard on the court will ... ... ah not a great look when your team in there for six weeks into the year is basically Cookeville white hot\nYeah I mean you can say would you like is that going Barkley is on pace to pick themselves up twelve touchdowns on year he's on pace for about uh\nYard seizes on average and five per I liked that but you know when you're going to burn this kid out too because you can't throw the ball and open up things as well to he was never an for ...

a crazy amount of energy the dog out native I'm now a lot of fun [noise]\nIt's gone on your slipping in sliding out there and hit the ball over the yard and picking up wins buttons what'd you say that baseball right you got to be short memory and tomorrow this game on friday will mean absolutely\nNothing but for right now the brewers fans have\nTo be feeling pretty good at least about the momentum and that's why you play for a home field advantage they force game seven back and the great state of Wisconsin as we welcome you to our number to the program it's the Bush leaves it as NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio\nBC sports radio mobile apps it was great council skipper for the Abreu crew talking about planning a total of four in the first inning\nAnd his team after falling behind that one nothing I mean never looked back Dodgers able to get a run back and the fifth and he will die by that time too little too late I'm In Milwaukee and scored five on answered runs between the first and\nThe second inning now to hit the Dodgers by an eleven do five tally but the biggest thing I often look for the games with in the game All right I mean many Machado got booed something fears like you wouldn't believe and rightfully so I mean the kids have punk gay great baseball player I'll give you that but uh I mean there are some\nCalls that you say it could have gone out of their way and some certain pitchers he's not going to get the benefit of that man they were on him\nWhen he was at the plate and when the ball was hit to them as well it's kind of like when you watch a college hoops game and the ball touches this guy touches that guy's hands yeah it was the same type of scenario more wait and see a ... number seven is going to hold in store as a mug shot on this game was over for and\nHe had a couple of Punjab says well I'm Sorry you can't tell me that uh he was the same player that we saw out in Los Angeles simply he was not I was actually watching the game at a sports bar a prior to and\nYou know I I I Will\nTip my cap to a couple a couple Dodger fans they man that was that was a punk move what he did but still there was a table full of I'm just saying oh he didn't\nHe didn't try to take that guy's leg out what are you talking about you know a trip to I mean just finding every excuse in the book you could for those guys so I basically um you know went out to their car and snapped a Dodger flags they had off their windows and just left motherhood that's how I Do think say five five three two three four NBC is the number to\nShine in uh this is not your typical sports talk radio show we don't break down the box scores and the stats for you to go a little bar stools sports talk and you know what are you talking about your buddies you're driving down the road so you want to get in on that action you're more than welcome to if you can get by our call screener Nick\nWe sail on an ethnic you've been good today I'm not going to give you a hard time about your your team a game seven or you've got to be a little bit nervous man going into a going into Saturday and this one\nI'm a little nervous yeah but but but walk up your I mean he's probably one of our best pitchers behind her side some would say even better than ...\nRight but there is such a certain thing about\nUh the moments he I Know that it's not just like I said going out there in in pitching and racking those numbers up against San Diego high is not the same thing as as the brewers are the ... and ... and and I'm telling you man after what you saw with with the red Sox and how they just made it look easy against the Astros who won over a hundred games\nYou know I understand what does it look a yellow lights\nUp a he's a kid too and in and he's not performing to correct what he was\nDoing in the regular season so I'm well aware of of the possibility of bealer\nStated I talked to are you can get to find cancer just by so I mean Christian yellow just great Caesar's partially getting a little bit of raced and why why it just because of\nWhat he's not hitting the ball hitting the ball you know he's striking out every time up there they're just not finding you know those holes out there so this reminded me\nOf the game seven of\nThe series last year the world series yeah yeah and it is around ... over early yeah after the Dodgers corner on cocaine okay and then boom took off there and then one thing that's crazy too is why the hell robbers and take out reuse is beyond me though who knows who knows yeah uh I tell you this\nIs Josh ... kids a monster is left handed go she says he's gonna he's gonna pitch and he's gonna go home and I'm watching ... swing and go out of their shoes in the postseason seven innings he punched out twelve no walks\nAnd uh he hasn't pensions Tuesday so and baseball and the postseason Tuesday when they talk about Sarah it's like an eternity so we'll see I mean you certainly got the ... to\nBe able to make it happen in I was hoping that account so goes into his book and a little deeper and then we'll be in good shape he had the fat out for pictures\nNow you're in in much better shape the area and Robert said everybody's going to be available except in general you and I mean ... ... can be as well too but I really do you want to go that route I mean really yeah 'cause if you do wind up getting there I mean good luck in\nGame one he can't have the pressure oh not that good luck in game on too if you got to find a way to using because these guys away they go out and do need you know a little bit of rest to be able to make things happening but nonetheless it's been it's been a much more compelling series than the American league help out\nA a ... man he even screwed up\nEvening yeah yeah I mean what you mean as not hitting the ball and I know this is right up this defensive player a path ball allowed a have just a ... year I had a couple of that game and write and loud Aguilar who is a not not the fleet is the floor\nAble to go on the brewers pero that's what it is ... is only going to all the bird yeah and I think that's what it is okay hands I think it could be it or or or who knows maybe he's about to get cut\nWe should wait and see him by the end of this one here so\nUh that's Nick ... with us on the the wheels are still talking Dodger baseball and and he also talks\nA wrestling right whether it's a WWF WWE or whether it's a ... pie you know you were to whatever it is man he's he's there to talk talk about it the the junkyard dog the iron Sheikh you name it man Nick is all over a five five three two three four and B.

good and\nIf you look at that and you put it against the backdrop of\nA career in which you know multiple teams have had him on the roster and then they didn't want him on the roster you figure you

very surprising going forward he's going to start again this week probably next Thursday against the Houston Texans\nWhat I Would say to you that we're going to see now is at some point there's gonna be a regression demean\nMeaning you're gonna get not Ninety five quarterback grading broadcasts Wyler not three\nTouchdowns rock house while are not necessarily a five hundred and forty one yards of often ... but you're going to get something much less which will get us to where he's the guy that he's always been\nBut let's say he can keep this going I I Can't help but wonder Armando whether or not\nAdam gage will continue to ride with broadcast water until Ryan tannahill is quote unquote one hundred percent and we've seen that from time to time\nKenya won't be a hundred percent until ... while there does indeed regress to the mean and then hey pantyhose given us a better chance to win an Oscar Wilde but I feel like gay I think the smart players continue to play offs Wyler as long as he's playing well and\nIf Canada hills healthy well he's not really help because he's not a hundred percent he's only Ninety eight percent\nSo your banking on us while are playing well longer than it takes for tannahill to get healthy\nNo no I'm not saying that's going to happen but in the unlikely event that it would do you think gay students ethos while they're out there until the moment where he realizes it's time to flip back to tend to help\nMe yeah I was obviously if ... plays like he did last Sunday and he does that stack games after game after game doing that they're not going back to Ryan tannahill right away is going to be right and you're not a hundred percent yet\nYeah uh no not yet not yet not yet but at my side and I don't have a crystal ball I don't know what's gonna happen\nMy thought is that period of time where broadcasts Wyler plays like last Sunday is not going to be very long and so call me a skeptic\n'em by definition that's what that is skepticism but I just don't think he can maintain that a\nCause and consistent quarterback play\nIs a lot harder to attain than stellar quarterback play you can be seller for one day and that's amazing but consistent over multiple games or a season very few people do that\nIs it there's something to be said though for the fact that off father had his career bottom out the failed season with the Houston Texans then he'll get a shot at them next Thursday night which adds a little spice to a game that otherwise may not\nBut both teams can be over five hundred going into that game\nAnd you look at what happened last year he was on the grounds roster that ultimately would would go when lesson he wasn't deemed to be good enough to even make it onto a roster that wasn't able to win a single game\nMean for him any chance he plays now you just go out and let it rent because it's all it's all free money at this point it's all found doughnuts for him at this point\nBecause he thought it was over in the rest of us thought it was over\nThe phone or ... yeah um it was\nLook this is a great story for broadcast why are there is no doubt about it\nIs an improbable thing that he is doing it it feels good kind of

the dolphins injury report is Ryan tannahill not playing or are they going to start Dan Marino is mark duper mark Clinton coming back and being forced to play wide receiver ... what am I missing with this\n... can be brought godfather\nUh okay there I mean is that the main reason just goes tannahill\nI think it has to be the same reaction either I felt alliance and my God how old am I Am here\nI can write a lesson I enjoy it lost of San Francisco is going on out but it gets okay Detroit who won\nAnd some people say well they'd be creme de or Green Bay has been yeah yesterday here to this point um I don't know what can they can alliance you know you can just talk about the buccaneers the lines are very much the same way that very weird they're all they're down they play good games they play terrible games\nYou know I picked the games every week I did Detroit simply because off while or I Know he played organs verify his ... says he's not going to play well consistently so um I I went with it because of that but\nI was shocked they use me Miami and and the dog at home and this game I bought it from minimum eagle went off or maybe pick maybe that's all the same point but not the case that they just ... and the games I think the lines of winter for no other reason Stafford against ... but it was the dolphins\nUgly but it's been affected their foreign to\nDislike my first girlfriend windy absolutely I'm telling you mentioned ...

I was Twenty one to nothing and I get that was the titans aren't any good\nNo they're not who who quarterbacks are signs that somebody who shouldn't be at this point I was ... yeah Marcus Mario college race I played at the University of Oregon\nAnd that's why you\nFeel about that yeah I'm ... ... you know what I don't I look at the reason I don't trust them off and simply I noticed that there are good but again the same token as for the points in the ... to ... and the saints are coming off a by week matter to pass this game and\nEverybody remembers what they saw that Baltimore wax Tennessee or a couple of weeks ago both lost twelve nine to Cleveland yeah so if it does seem to me are the better team I don't care that they are on the road there's gold differently than they were years ago and it was superdome or posture that franchise I think they find a way that went on the ...\nYeah I Do I agree as well too and I'm not just when you're Sunday night match up on you got a

three they seem a lot better than that\nHit the veils and played well I've been impressed by him they come to this day in little banged up they're missing a top corner that are there was some other pieces including a Giovanni Bernard center building Christ or the question I have in this game is can tandem Marvin lowest an Andy Dalton beat the tandem of anti or eat at home\nAnd I don't think it can not miss thought this game was in Cincinnati it would be more of the coin cook for me both\nTeams coming off a last minute to go home or she's going to give up thirty points because that's what the chiefs to file for them to score thirty eight point uh I I think sometimes in the game I think it's a compelling game at the exciting\nBut I think ultimately Cincinnati might kill we'll hear a

great baseball player I'll give you that but um you learn some\nCalls that you say could have gone out of the way and some certain pitches he's not going to get the benefit of men they were on him when he was at the plate and when the ball was hit to them as well it's kinda like when you watch a college hoops game and the ball touches this guy touches that guy's hands yeah it was the same type\nOf scenario will wait and see a ... number seven is going to hold in store as a child on this game was over for and he had a couple of Punjab says well I'm Sorry you can't tell me that uh he was the same player that we saw out in Los Angeles simply he was not\nI was actually watching the game at a sports bar a prior to and\nYou know I I I Will\nTip my cap to a couple a couple of Dodger fans

I Know that it's not just like I said going out there in in pitching and racking those numbers up against San Diego high is not the same thing as as the brewers are the ... and ... and I'm telling you man after what you saw with with the red Sox and how they just made it look easy against the Astros who won over a hundred games you\nKnow I understand because the at look at Yale it's\nA he's a kid

way they go out and do need you know a little bit of rest to uh\nBe able to make things happening but nonetheless it's been it's been a much more compelling series than the American league how about\nA a ... man he even screwed up this evening\nYeah yeah I mean but what do you mean is not hitting the ball and on the defensive player a path bomb allowed or have just a ... year I had a couple of the game and write loud Aguilar who's ah not not the fleet us to fly\nAble to go on the brewers pero that's what it is is running out all the bird yeah I think that's what it is okay I think it

C. isn't over yet we\nCan talk some baseball it wasn't like I said in a great game for the Dodgers all around I mean they do their best point of the night when they scored in the first thing that's it they conjured up only five base knocks\nAnd you look at the fact that um you know they gave up for right away and it's it's the pleading\nTo you it's it's ... to you to have a one nothing lead and

play and ah with the exception I think of one pre season games um you know he was he was not very good and\nIf you look at that and you put it against the backdrop of\nA career in which you know multiple teams have\nHad him on the roster and then they didn't want him on the roster you figure you know this is not going to be a good experience just stressing a guy into starting a Simon against

it's the most in teen history and the other four\nWere done under Dan Marino so it's Dan Marino Dan Marino Dan Marino Dan Marino oh yeah and ... and ... so\nThat was very surprising going forward he's going to start again this week probably next Thursday against the Houston Texans\nWhat I Would say to you that we're gonna see now is at some point they're going to be a regression demean meaning you're gonna get\nNot Ninety five quarterback grading broadcasts Wyler not three\nTouchdowns rock off while are not necessarily a five hundred and forty one yards of often broadcasts Wyler but you're going to get something much less which will get us to where he's the guy that he's always been\nBut let's say he can keep this going I I Can't help but wonder Armando whether or not\nAdam gage will continue to ride with broad costs water until Ryan tannahill is quote unquote one hundred percent we've seen that from time to time\nKenya won't be a hundred percent until ... while there does indeed regress to the mean and then hey pantyhose given us a better chance to win an Oscar Wilde but I feel like gay I think the smart players continue to play offs Wyler as long as he's playing well and\nIf tannahill healthy well he's not really healthy 'cause he's not a hundred percent he's only Ninety eight percent\nSo your banking on us while are playing well longer than it takes for tannahill to get healthy\nNo no I'm not saying that's going to happen but in the unlikely event that it would do you think gay student while they're out there until the moment where he realizes it's time to flip back to tend to help\nMe yeah I I obviously if ... plays like he did last Sunday and he does that stack games after game after game doing that they're not going back to Ryan tannahill right away is going to be right and you're not a hundred percent yet\nYeah uh no not yet not yet not yet\nBut my thought and I don't have a crystal ball I don't know what's gonna happen\nMy thought is that period of time where broadcasts Wyler plays like last Sunday is not going to be very long and so call me a skeptic\n'em by definition that's what that is skepticism but I just don't think he can maintain that a\nCause and consistent quarterback play\nIs a lot harder to attain than stellar quarterback play you can be seller for one day and that's amazing but consistent over multiple games over a season very few people do that\nIsn't that something to be said though for the fact that off father had his career bottom out the failed season with the Houston Texans and he'll get a shot at them next Thursday night which adds a little spice to a game that otherwise may not have all that much lesser but both teams can be over five hundred going into that game\nAnd you look at what happened last year he was on the browns roster that ultimately would would go when lesson he wasn't deemed to be good enough to even make it onto a roster that wasn't able to win a single game\nMe for him any chance he plays now you just go out and let it rent because it's all it's all free money at this point it's all found doughnuts for him at this point\nBecause he thought it was over in the rest of us thought it was over\nThe phone or yum [laughter] yeah um it was\nLook this is a great story for broadcast why are there is no doubt about it\nIt's an improbable thing that he is doing is it still feels good kind of situation um you know the guy cast aside by multiple bad teams suddenly get this chance and he's a star it's amazing that card\nBut again [laughter]\nI don't want a raid on his parade but I just have to tell you brought over fast\nThat ends in a couple of weeks he's gonna be over for a oh this isn't going to be something that\nUh we're going to the four five six seven eight nine more games is just not\nWhat he has been in his career and I think if you ask even the Miami Dolphins in there if if you put truth serum into the entire organization if you send them don't at least with truth

F. T. barn where we have for screens and one is bigger than the other three\nAnd that one is all we dedicated the NFL football always whenever NFL football is on its always dedicated NFL football Broncos card was got relegated to screen too because it was time to say in the Bronx\nAnd LeBron lost the brunt of what I didn't watch all of it I\nWasn't a football game ended\nEverything got shut down it was time to come to bed you know because of this obligation I have every morning at five twenty I Am when the alarm goes off but yes we watched the first quarter and a half\nOf Lakers trailblazers the main screen instead of the final quarter or so of brokers Carter's way it was it was horrible what did you get the shakes\nNo no because I was disgusted I Would have watched anything I Would put on ... on screen one by that point it was horrible as we said earlier this week and as I tweeted last night fairly early on in the process\nThe Broncos set up the car does we're going to kick their ass and the cardinals set in response and we're going to let\nThem it was never competitive\nThere was one drive when it was fourteen nothing there was one Dr where the cardinals were moving toward a potential score and on third and fourth day for it to the end zone from around the twenty or the twenty five which is dumb get the first down for crying out loud so they get a feel golds fourteen three\nAnd then it just continued from there it was bad it was very bad Josh Rosen\nThe rookie quarterback in his fourth start Twenty one for thirty nine a hundred and Ninety four yards a touchdown three interceptions to form bowls six X.\nAny injured a toll on the final secular game von Miller Rosen hauled off which I guess could mean now they have extra time for the next game but it could mean\nA return of sand Bradford from street clothes see they started putting sand Bradford in St closed because he gets a nice chunk of cash every time he is on the active roster\nSo if he's there in uniform on the sidelines not playing he gets a lot more money than he does want he's standing there and the latest cardinals sideline attire\nSteve works coaching the cardinal said after the game he thinks that Josh Rose and we'll be okay\nAnd we'll also acknowledged that rose and probably should have been out of the game at that point but see the the only option to Rosen is Mike blend in which explains why Rosen\n[laughter] on the game\nAnd there were a lot of stars playing deep into this one case came to my wife he's still out there and I think he was still out there because the last thing the Broncos want to do is put check Kelly on the field and have a play well [laughter] right I'm sure that we had that conversation earlier this week as it relates to Eli Manning\nChristians actually thinks that the giants cut Davis ... so there wouldn't be a viable number two on the roster now I understand there been occasions where you have a starting quarterback who doesn't have a competitive backup the backup is there to support the starter and you're not pushing the starter\nThe idea that you cut the ... you gave up a third or fourth round pick on is a little bit much though\nBut in Denver they have a guy who is capturing the imagination and the fans especially because case keen them hasn't been [noise]\nYou don't want to put them again\nIn the event that it plays well and then people think of that the next time the Broncos struggled and they're presumably will be a next time I Do have to give them credit though they did on a short week\nAfter losing to the rams falling to two and four they did exactly\nWhat von Miller said they would do and it was so impressive [noise] you know it's kinda like the student who struggles through\nA couple of quarters is it do they do quarters\nNine weeks I remember is that we ... we did every now and school in like grade school and high school we didn't every night we got report card every nine weeks you struggled through a couple of nine weeks that you know a to point three a seat marks out here and all of a sudden all of a sudden you're bringing home straight days and the responses vote why how're you doing this all along\nThat's my question for the Broncos if you're capable of that kind of dominance\nWhere's it been all season why does it take\nThe GM of the team calling the defense very soft why does it take open speculation about the coach being fired seven games into a second season\nWhy can't you muster that will weaken and week out and that's a reflection on the couch and not playing Arizona every [laughter] yeah hey hey hey Roger Goodell is there a way that we could play the cardinals every week [laughter]\nWould that be possible and look\nI feel bad for the cardinals although somebody gotta lose the games right if there's going to be a rams there's got to be a cardinals that's how it works you can't have a team that is six to know without a team that that the other end of the spectrum\nThere's always got to be one team that has a disproportionate amount of losses if you're gonna have one team that has a disproportionate amount of wins how it works but my God how fast the cardinals have fallen\nI Can't think of another franchise that it's falling farther or faster now the raiders of falling fast but they never really got very far they've got to a wild card game they lost\nThat set like one blip on the radar screen in Fifteen Years they've they've gone back to where they were the aberration isn't now the aberration was the playoff season\nFor the cardinals they were putting together year after year of competitive play and they got to the NFC championship game\nAnd since then the whole franchises imploded and it's sad this is the low point well maybe it gets even lower I don't know\nBut forty five to ten lost at home where the Broncos fan\nOut numbered the cardinals fans\nSaw a shot of Michael bit while the owner of the team last night and I notice he didn't have a moustache and I thought either shape it or maybe it all just fell out this season [laughter] do you rise or must pass your moustache I mean stress can cause a lot of crazy

little bit like you know how things happen a pro football talk dot com as the five plus one part-time writers [noise] called dibs on which stories were going to take a very simple process akin to a fly ball in the outfield somebody calls\nAnd every once in a while a couple of the outfielders run into each other but we do\nPart somebody calls it the right to store and then move on now as we're crafting content of our own it's rare that we actually sit down and study in detail the things that others have written\nI had the occasion to do it from time to time because those stories become topics of things we discuss here on this program case in point I saw the train Williams was going to write the Jerry Jones denies talk with Jason Garrett extension\nI didn't realize until studying the copy of the article Shereen wrote that Jerry Jones has actually refuting\nAn item that was tweeted by an employee of the media operation that he owns he owns and operates Dallas Cowboys dot com when people he's hired to write for the media outlet the Jerry Jones owns floated the idea of Jason Garrett\nGetting an extension this would be the equivalent well I'm not going to go down that path because there's no good way of coming back from it let me just say this\nJeff solvent who writes for the Dallas Cowboys Web site tweeted in response to fans comment that it sounds like another extension could be signed soon Jason Garrett's not going anywhere and then\nThey went back and forth the person who it raised the point about Garrett I don't believe that per second Jeff Solomon says I have no reason to lie Jeff solving says I talk to the right people you know and then solve an added man six days a week top three coach in the league just struggles have been on game day I don't think Jeb solving the gonna be Dallas Cowboys dot com much longer hey Jeff\nGet your resume and order Jerry Jones appearing Tuesday and one of five three the fan in Dallas was asked about Jeff solvent of Dallas Cowboys dot com suggesting that Jason Garrett will be getting a contract extension\nOr we're just going to pull it out there as far as the knowledge responds indicate\nThat I'm thinking about it whether it's going to be there just is not something that would exist at all\nSo Jerry Jones is accusing the media operation that he owns and operates are spreading fake news and I know that it wasn't part of Dallas Cowboys dot com but this is one of the Dallas Cowboys dot com employees and from time to time\nI point out that the people who take a pay check signed by Roger Goodell or by one of the owners of the various teams they're necessarily compromised and\nI got to give Jeff credit Jeff's not compromised he may be unemployed but he's definitely not compromised we'll see how the cowboys handle this one well see if Jeff is still\nWell see if he gets a contract extension of feeling Jeff will not be getting a contract extension just a gut feeling that that's not happening why he's a good writer Mike you just struggled with words\nYeah six days a week he's a top three writer he struggles a bit when it's time to actually read his column\n[laughter]\nAll right Nick both uh I don't know how much he struggled with his decision to that they're there\nAnd this is a no brainer and showy and Nick both among the best young businessmen and football because\nThey understand it is a business that's the first rule of being a good business person understanding that what you are engaged in is business that before you can ever make good business decisions you have to acknowledge\nThat this is a business not a sport not a game we get paid to play a game no you don't you're paid to put your\nHealth and well being on the line so others can make a boat load of money\nThat's what you're paid to do\nIt's not a game to the Scrooge ... ducts of the world\nAnd the college level they do a better job of convincing the masses that it is a game that there's some sort of purity to it and don't we own our realized that that is just a load of BS\nThat is all part of of this spit polish that gets people to show up and pay a ton of money\nFor season tickets and all the other stuff you have to buy on top of that to get the good season tickets I mean the tickets for one thing at least they don't come up with this weird fiction like the PS sell at the college level they they at least we'll pick their pocket while looking in your face and telling you were picking your pocket\nBut you you got to tell you this feeling that fee and he got paid for this and that and it's just money after money after money and and it's easy to justify it used to be even easier to justify because there was all tax deductible I don't think it is any more but\nIt's easy to justify because you are self help in the school who are you really helping helping helping all the people who are making a big salary who can make a salary the players don't make a salary\nAnd I'm so sick and they get a free education yeah most of them don't want it most of them are only there to major in football they're there because they can't go to the NFL they're there because they have no options they're there because they have to be they don't want to be and when they are they're they don't get the opportunity to take full advantage of the education\nRemember the Robert Smith thing it's been a long time ago now but he actually God Forbid wanted to have a real education at Ohio State and against steered away from it\nBecause it conflicts with all the hours that they have to spend

nobody thought he'd be able to do that that he's able to do so I don't think that's out of the question at all\n[noise] and there's something fascinating about the cowboys this year because so much of the storyline is often it's often it's often than every week the NFL bumps it's just about all the points being scored a touchdown and the passing statistics\nAnd here the cowboys with a middle not even middle of the pack in comparison to everyone else they're back in the pack because everyone else is so good\nBut they have the defense and in some point\nLate and a year post season I think a defense is going to be a difference maker\nAnd I feel like this cowboys team if they can navigate their way to the top division they become a very dangerous team in the NFC postseason field because when you know when the ... you know the rams went whenever they play in the playoffs they're going to be nervous they're going to be tied and when you rely upon execution off as it doesn't take much\nTo screw up the timing to screw up the performance and if you're relying upon a great defense and often said it's just good enough\nDoesn't that make the cowboys are viable contender to beat some of these better NFC team that they played them in the postseason\nI think so and and it's amazing this football team how much they turned around and you think about just a few years ago with you know the Marco Murray or even a zinc you Eliot and Tony Romo and does Bryant Jason ... at all the all stars they had\nAll those guys aside from his big Eliot are gone and this is a team that remade itself and and not a better way on often but certainly in a better way on the fence and\nNow they're best players are all on defense you know and if they get Sean laid back this week like they think they will their front seven it's as good as anybody in football and to me that is amazing transformation that they've gone through because they haven't had a good defense says the market is a weird last many years ago to go to Denver\nAnd they they really really made that the fence and and it's good if they can keep those guys\nAre out of the league suspension program on the front for and and then on the you know at the linebacker position keep those guys healthy ah this is a really really good defense despite the lack of a really playing making safety or they can they get\nDavid and that keeps you in the game you know you can stop teamed up and you're going to be in every football game and and they had even he goes back to the season\nOpener yes they lost the Carolina but it was sixteen days they couldn't score points their defense kept him and the football game and and I think you're going to say that my report they're good at being games I'm not saying they're going to win\nA ... they're going to go on to the to the rest away and finish Thirteen and three that's not going to happen but I Do think they're going to be in every game and I think they're going to upset some of these bigger name teams like you said that they play that they're not going to be favored again\nThere was a strange story this week a guy who writes for the Dallas Cowboys website owned and operated by Jerry Jones and the cowboys suggested that a contract extension is coming for coach Jason Garrett prompting Jerry Jones to contradict\nHis own employee of the website the cowboys own and operate saying that\nThere is no contract extension for Jason Garrett coming why didn't Jerry feel ... it just I don't it just the odd that you would publicly say you're not thinking about are there is no truth to any room and that you may give your coach a new contract it just seems like something that really\nDoesn't fit for a team that is trying to string wins together\nYeah you know first of all it didn't make it a common sense tells you they're not given Jaycee Garrett contracts and he's a he has a contract to twenty Nineteen\nAnd he needs to have a playoff season if not a playoff when this year to keep his job I think everybody knows that including chasing scared I don't know if that's any kind of surprised so\nYou know the tweet I'm not sure that you know just all but I'm not sure ... quite like it came out\nA but it certainly came out as is hey you know in coming days we're going to have a contract extension last night and it happened and and Jerry ... God love him for for those of us in the media because he'll say whatever's on it fine\nAnd I just think he felt compelled to ask the question to respond to that question then\nHe didn't outright say you know we're not we're not talking contractors statute with Jason but he said I've never talked about that with with just all of and blah blah blah blah blah and now Jeff and Jerry ... who have a good relationship but\nUm I have no doubt that that Jacey Garrett has not get a contract extension and yeah Jerry probably shouldn't have said anything about it uh and and let that ride as it were\nThe great quote wasn't just I don't talk to about it it was the least of all just helping him out of it [laughter]\nIf there was no one else alive on the face of the earth they solve and that's when I talked to him about a ... year contractor sentient archery thanks as always for your time and we look forward to talking again real soon\nTake flight ...

here I mean I I think I'm saying you're pretty awesome I just think that ah with some of the guys that are in front of them that we'll get to\nTheir just a little more physically gifted and talented but I'm not this or that and trying to disrespect this guy at least I mean he's awesome he certainly is I guess my big thing would be you know ability to do thing after the catch you might not be quite as up to some of the other guys we see here later but there is no weakness Adam dealings game\nI'm not again not to I like all these guys that's why I got him here listed a number eight is a great route runner like you said\nHe's a he's got good sized he's got tremendous hands\nI Would just argue that he's not the guy that's going to catch a six yards slant and run by the whole defense for Seventy yard touchdown either that would just be my only thing they're\nGot fifty eight catches through six games on pay check on ... and record he also leads the league and receiving yard yeah seven\nTwelve a number seven you've gotten my Kevin through the Tampa Bay buccaneers he's the guy that doesn't get appreciated the way he should I think he could be even higher on this list I don't know why he does get more praise maybe he's not a big enough market maybe he's not a big enough personality but\nChris I mean this guy's a special talent he's done some things in his career I think you hit like four straight thousand years he's our guard ever do that he's done some special things and he's still got plenty of years to\nPlay yeah he is a total mismatch nightmare you're writing flies under the radar\nHe's six five and you know two hundred and twenty pounds and he ran for three seven here's a guy that you know on a weekly basis defenses pay attention to where my Kevin's is because they know they can't leave their corners one on one with him all game long he will abused them he he's a special talent like you said Mike\nYeah he's got four straight thousand yard seasons and he's on pace for another one this year four hundred and eighty four yards through five games are a number six on the list the Andre Hopkins hard to argue with that one and you could argue all these guys you could argue that could be higher but then you see the nice name and it's like okay I get why is where he is AJ green it five\nThis is going to get Antonio Brown it for right Tony oh brown and the guy on the cover him at the ... the guy that many believe is the best in the NFL that's a tough one to put him all the way it number four yeah it it's\nTough when you get down here in it and listen I Know these are these are you know this is why we're having a conversation and people might disagree and all that Antonio Brown's amazing I mean he's definitely one of the best receivers than football\nThere's really again not a lot of weakness to his football game either great route runner can make plays happen after the catch for his size he's an unbelievable fifty fifty ball catcher so uh yes I mean again I Am not trying to down grade this guy he's amazing I just think\nThe three guys we're going to talk about in front of them are a hair better right now\nAnd here's the thing about it and turn your brown and I don't want to take away from his game at all and this gets back to the chicken in the argument we hear from time to time and the right to quarterbacks and receivers\nBut in those clips if you're watching I it'd be the U.S and\nYou never saw Antonio Brown do anything other than this right that you might you know I think yeah he doesn't have to lunch she doesn't have to reach back he doesn't have to die like we saw feeling divest the ball is always delivered between the eight and the for like Joe Montana all we did with Jerry right and it's like there's burger needs to get some of that credit exactly right thank\nYou I'm Glad you said that because ... ... people act like it's like chopped liver thrown Antonio Brown sometimes and he's making it all happened like then bought those burgers an all time great\nCome on get right back from junior playing with a guy who could be recorded in the past is one of the all time greats especially this relates to Superbowl performances manning slipping some an auto back from juniors production slipping you've got him at number three I'm sure that had to be very difficult for you to put on I was like oh here near a number three yeah that hurt\nMy solid really did but I I think my biggest thing for moving into three is I still don't think he's totally\nThe hundred percent explosives self\nOf Elba held back in June or that we saw before he dislocated and broke his ankle last year he getting there he's very close he's certainly amazing and I think it's that would be better if he had a quarterback throw the ball down the field to them but yeah I I think that he's not totally himself right now and that's why I got 'em at three\n... and this leads to something that we discussed on friday show you weren't here for this and I don't think we've had this discussion but when I went back from junior left the field of early during the game against the eagles the excuse was he was the hydrated and my response is\nAnd it's something that can be prevented you properly hydrate you take the precautions and and when I think of that\nAnd I think of his ankle and not being where it needs to be I I just wonder did each check every box in his rehab did he do everything he needed to do is he a guy who will take care of all the little things are just he just try to rely upon natural God given ability and I\nHadn't thought of that until I saw that dehydration excuse me I think there is no excuse for dehydration is it possible that he didn't do everything he needed to do to get his ankle and his leg back to where it used to be before he broke\nI don't think so I mean he we saw a just an off season a workout videos in doing that kind of stuff and everything again I'll go back to what I've ever heard about um the guy is passionate about his work and his craft I mean he works at it so I don't think that says you all a point this out to Mike\n... I've ease at halftime go on a lot more than people realize that and it's mostly the freaky as players on your football team like LeBron James cramping up in the spurs finals a few years ago it because they have no body fat some of these freaks of nature as I say respectfully some of these great out our at least but yes\nThere are there ripped a dirt extremely explosive they have like three percent body fat and not lens them to being prone to cramping it's one of the weaknesses of a you know being a cheetah let's say right Cheetos can't sprint all day long they have to sprint and take a break off and that's kind of the\nBecause well I'm Glad you enjoyed it but I think it's that had back in time the\nSure they'd be careful getting a\nI'm going to return the kayak\nIraq how about a T\nGoing to find a new country being you lock your first survey\n[noise]\n\n\nGoing to talk for a\nWays\nPro football talk time what's your middle some grievances my middle name is Christopher Davis isn't that quite a coincidence [laughter] well the shocking Michael Christopher Davis area [laughter]\nOurs you know that's what it is All right it's somebody you know I'll tell you off the James\nBeard off the air so I can say to everybody on the air now get it over with okay James\nIt's time for you to aired grievances including but not limited to my middle name\nBut yes okay All right the first of all I'm going to go to is um\nYou know a guy who I have a lot of respect for first of all I'd like to state that all off the air where you know but yeah I Do respect all due respect but uh I'm In my first grievances with Troy Vincent\nOr as VP of football operations in the NFL you know his comments about you know the Bruins speaks he's making excuses on the Tom Brady play\nA course where if you watch football on Sunday night there is a play where Tom Brady steps up in the pocket\nHe's about to be hit by ... speaks any kind of pump the brakes and speaks has a hold of them and let's go you know Troy Vincent ... you know stating the company line that you know oh no that's not why and you know Troy over the next player it shouldn't be calling out players like this and\nYou know first of all ... what's ... he's I don't think he's like lying about anything he's lying I think it'd be missed the ... have been like Tom Brady is awesome and he just broke a my tackle hold on it my grievance\nAnd okay I have agreements about you know you do so we'll go there and a second but you know even his coat off that well we've seen Tom Brady step up in the pocket for years and years yes we had\nBut we can count on the number ... on our hands the amount of time he's run through arm tackles okay so you know stopped traffic one in ... yeah there's one\nBut stop trying yeah we thought Sunday night yeah go because the guy let go I mean he's the guy is six for two hundred and eighty pounds he could've thrown into the ground he doesn't know everybody's scared and my point is this Mike\nIt goes on every week we only talk about it because this was on Sunday Night Football and this was Tom Brady I could show you apply the week before with Jerry he was the markets Mario to he's going to backup Marcus Mario pumped it and pulled it down he didn't know so we let go and then markets Mario ran\nAround the edge and throw the ball down the field so what's going on weekly so do for an ... player and I understand he works for the league to call out other players from making excuses I just got to think that was a little bit so I'm Sorry\nKing was on the show yesterday and we talk specifically about that play and Peter Kings' assessment is that the breed and speaks excuses not gonna fly in the film room because if you look carefully at what speech did he\nJust missed him he didn't he didn't have him wrapped up and just let go and say don't fly me he just missed him and the problem is when guys make bad place now there's going to be a temptation to say oh oh oh oh I was trying to get a roughing the passer penalty it's too easy to\nAnd that's what happened here he just flat out missed him you don't want to admit that a forty one year old man\nRan away from you so you say oh I was trying not to break him it's obvious that is what he was doing Chris now just Troy Vincent ... does he do himself any favors by calling the guy out I don't know but I think Troy is accurate that we're going to see and we did see in this case the guy using that robbing the pastor sensitivity as an excuse for making about\nWe see it every week it happens every week but we didn't see it Sunday night I Know what I'm saying we see it every week we're defenders let guys go the quarterback of course they're scared are you kidding me I mean come on what does everybody up what are they afraid afraid of penalties like like a duck clay Matthews got\nI mean you can't touch the quarterback now but then you become a hero you're doing commercials for call of duty if you do that I mean I think no they didn't think it was not going to get any commercials for call of duty he's not clay Matthew's with head and shoulders hair and I you know one of the better players and football a few years back so\nNo really speaks to let go because he was scared in that situation of okay I think what Tom Brady pump that he thought oh I think he's thrown it let me not just drag him to the ground and hurt our football team I I'm not buying that and I see it on a weekly basis and I\n... I mean I got Tom Brady is the man we know that I mean we know we stepped up in the pocket of you hate him oh you're full of it shut your mouth [laughter]\nAll right let me say this TJ ... told me this after the week five win over the falcon right always supported the Steelers linebackers coach made this point yesterday\nThat you just just go hit the quarterback get him down or a about the consequences later and watch said there's too much inconsistency among the Seventeen referees out I have to worry about it so just go make the play I agree with somebody somebody needs to tell breed an speaks and Jerry huge everyone else that same thing just to make the play and worry about it later\nTeach them good technique trust they're going to use it make the play and move on her and I got to move on you took one in mind 'cause my grievance was the mirror image of yours I'm sick of hearing these excuses about not making tackles make the damp tackle and then we'll worry about whether or not it was a ... effect now it's my\nLeg and no grievance we come up with something new let's go\nHey here's my grievance I I Am and I'm ... and you know I I learned this yesterday and I struggle with\nIs because I don't want to be a complete and total jerk although that may be my nature I Try to fight fight back against her from time to time you're ... you can total jerk thank you go ahead someone needs to have the talk with Nathan paid him and not not the birds and the beast talk but the talk that it's time to move on with your life that\nThat your time as a player at the NFL has ended at least for now maybe you can go to the lives of American football or wait a year for the XFL go to Canada or something at home his craft\nBut as of right now Nathan Peter ... is not fit to be a quarterback in the national football league in every team sees it except the Buffalo Bills who\nContinue to insist on number one keeping on the roster number to putting on the field from time to time now I Hope they see the light and go with Eric Anderson this weekend was Josh Allen our two to three weeks but\nI don't know what more they need to see Chris before they acknowledge that Peter ... is just not good enough or they are they waiting for him to just kind of fumbling the dark\nFor the light switch and all of a sudden he's going to figure it out I don't know how many of these these bad game that the franchise has to suffer through before they realized that Peter man is just not the answer\nI I hear your Mike and I'm a I think that's what they're trying to do right now I really\nDo I mean we're hearing that dark Anderson\nIs going to be the start or you know there was a a source report yesterday right that said\nThe bills feel if they started Nathan Peter men that they would lose a lot of I mean did ding ding ding ding of course they would the players will be like you're starting Nathan Peter ... again ... more to come here on the best of pro football talk live on NBC's

through the full practice according to the injury report that the dolphins filed by friday or he was having trouble but he's still practiced on a limited basis\nAnd um you know they listed him is questionable after he had an entire week of you know struggles\nBut they just were practicing him by Saturday evening it was pretty clear that uh there was a significant no problem with Ryan tannahill and I think what the league is looking at is the fact that\nThey left them as questionable as he was getting worse during the week they didn't change his status from questionable to doubtful on Saturday as some teams do when things get bad and the league is looking at that\nReport came out or you know Sunday Morning that\nBrian tannahill is very very you know questionable if not doubtful to play this\nGame and it\nRaised an issue with the NFL because of the fact that one reports are saying that he is doubtful to play the game before the game and their injury report says that he's questionable you know there there is something that they're they're going to look out there\nAnd I think the first evidence that I noticed Armando came when the betting line started to move dramatically in favor of the Chicago Bears\nAnd that means somebody knew something and that's why that injury report is there yes a certain amount of it is competitive balance among the teams but\nIt's about having integrity of the game and it's about having no parents of inside information there clearly was inside information here of course the irony is everybody who bet the bears thinking that they were an easy winner ended up being dead wrong because of\nFraud Tobar fast so let's follow up there that brought costs Wyler\nHow surprised were you by the way he performed in is this something that given his mastery of the off chance he can continue\n[laughter] I was very surprised when the simple fact that I saw in practice\nDuring training camp and those were not impressive in Middle East I also saw him play and ah with the exception I think of one pre season games um you know he was he was not very good and\nIf you look at that and you put it against the backdrop of\nA career in which you know multiple teams have had him on the roster and then they didn't want him on the roster you figure you know this is not going to be a good experience just stressing a guy into a starting\nA Simon against a very good bears the fact that a potential defensive and the peace candidate in ... Mac\nAnd yet there was any through for three hundred Navy Yard you had the two interceptions\nBut he also had three touchdowns in his dolphins racks out five hundred and forty one yard which was not just the most this year but it's the most in teen history and the other four\nWere done under Dan Marino so it's Dan Marino Dan Marino Dan Marino Dan Marino oh yeah and ... and ... so\nThat was very surprising going forward and he's going to start again this week probably next Thursday against the Houston Texans\nWhat I Would say to you that we're gonna see now is at some point there's gonna be a regression\nDemean meaning you're gonna get\nNot Ninety five quarterback grading broadcasts Wyler not three touchdowns ... not necessarily a five hundred and forty one yards of often broadcasts Wyler but you're going to get something much less which will get us to where\nHe's the guy that he's always been\nBut let's say he can keep this going I Can't help but wonder Armando whether or not Adam gage will continue to ride with broad costs water until Ryan tannahill is quote unquote one hundred percent we've seen that from time to time ten it won't\nUntil ... does indeed regress to the mean and then hey pantyhose given us a better chance to win an Oscar Wilde but I feel like gay I think the smart players continue to play offs Wyler as long as he's playing well and if tannahill healthy well he's not really healthy 'cause he's not a hundred percent he's only Ninety eight percent\nSo your banking on us while are playing well longer than it takes for tannahill to get healthy\nNo no I'm not saying that's going to happen but in the unlikely event that it would do you think gay student while they're out there until the moment where he realizes it's time to flip back to thin out\nYeah I I obviously if prop ... plays like he did last Sunday and he does that stack games after game after game doing that they're not going back there Ryan tannahill right away it's gonna be right and you're not a hundred percent yet\nYeah uh no not yet not yet not yet\nBut my thought and I don't have a crystal ball I don't know what's gonna happen\nMy thought is that period of time where broadcasts Wyler plays like last Sunday is not going to be very long and so called me a skeptic\n'em by definition that's what that is skepticism but I just don't think he can maintain that a\nCause and consistent quarterback play\nIs a lot harder to attain than stellar quarterback play you can be seller for one day and that's amazing but consistent over multiple games or a season very few people do that\nIsn't that something to be said though for the fact that ... had his career bottom out the failed season with the Houston Texans then he'll get a shot at them next Thursday night which adds a little spice to a game that otherwise may not have all that much faster but both teams can be over five hundred going into that game\nAnd you look at what happened last year he was on the browns roster that ultimately would would do when the lesson he wasn't deemed to be good enough to even make it onto a roster that wasn't able to win a single game\nMeans for him any chance he plays now you just go out and let it rent because it's all it's all free money at this point it's all found doughnuts for him at this point\nBecause he thought it was over in the rest of us thought it was over\nThe phone or yum [laughter] yeah um it was\nLook this is a great story for broadcast why are there is no doubt about it\nIs an improbable thing that he is doing it it feels good kind of situation um you know the guy cast aside by multiple bad teens suddenly get this chance and while you start it's amazing that\nBut again [laughter] [laughter] I don't want to rain on his parade but I just have to tell you brought over fast that ends in a couple of weeks\nHe's gonna be over ... thing going to be something that\nUh we're gonna see four five six seven eight nine more games is just not\nWhat he has been in his career and I think if you ask even the Miami Dolphins in there if if you put truth serum into the entire organization if you send them to do one at least with truth serum\n[laughter] I think they would say hey you know what we're very happy\nAbout last Sunday but we don't know that this can continue until January\nLast thirty seconds the dolphins are foreign to are they a viable playoff contender\nSlowly they're if the season and the day they're not in the play offs but\nYou know what they've got to win a bowl games coming up on Sunday at home against Detroit and then a

Q. could increase by eight percent of the sharp college boy like me who was senior class president two years in a row nose at any IQ increase we can get is pretty darn good\nSo really mind said as like a mental inclination it's a frame of mind is how you see the world it's how you filter what happens to you so by that is really everything we do see it here are two people were let's take political organization to people see an event that happened\nTo send the presidency what person may be a liberal see something completely different than what the conservative sees although at the same basic of it and that's all about mindset my daughter went to University of Colorado at I call it the people's\nBe the best tennis player who was ever lived he really does it get caught up too much and the law says he has in fact he just really enjoys the game so much you just think that's part of things but he'll end up\nBeing number one of the world for weeks they built that other ... job back Earl Grey commentator number one of the world for a hundred and Seventy weeks ... backup gross said he never really enjoy playing his father forced him to play and he only did it because it was a great way to make a lot of money I actually saw back row I took my five year old daughter\nTo see a job back row play chip McCotter's that during an exhibition match my daughter saw job back through a racket at the park or a ... little Stacy said dad I don't want to become a\nProfessional tennis player I'm tired of the ...\nThe way we become a results focus mindset is two things which are very very complex when I make it real real easy that will what his contacts re casting I write about this a lot of the book did you ever see Charlie Wilson's war no I did on\nFor a movie with Tom Hanks he was a congressman who was trying to support the shot at the end in Afghanistan and they were able to kick the rushes out if they pick Afghanistan during the Nineteen eighties and Charlie Wilson was partnered with the CIA agent at the CIA agent was his best friend ...\nWas the guy and he was bragging about how easily able to get the F rushes out of aghast at at I used to actually proud of us what we did at Philip Seymour Hoffman said let me tell you story there's a story about this kid at Afghanistan they've got a horse and people were so thrilled about\nThat and one very fascinating gr Russo will see well fortunately he fell off the horse he broke his leg that's really bad\nAnd the girls said we'll see how they said well get up because they felt like it can't be drafted the Taliban could get up and they said we'll see so the horse that it was very fortunate Catholic or they did for half will see so the bottom line with us when you contest recast we don't think of anything\nIs gored or bad with the best they all went to this focus on the goal and be very ... assistant at disciplined\nIt'll take care of motion that the second thing we do is something called content\nRecast tick so context as the things that happen around as simply insulate ourselves stick with a discipline financial plant but the content recast as important to except Pearl but it's the arguably the best buy all of this ever he's Israeli but\n'cause I don't think so he was playing at every Fisher hall hall in\nNew York and of course he has crutches and it takes to almost five minutes to get out to the orchestra he's sitting in front and one day during a concert at the conductor and the conductor started playing for the first few bars the string on his ... broken sound like gunfire he stopped and people didn't know what to do they thought well he's got a ... as a violin\nThey'd need to take our break maybe they need to get a new violin at all he did was closed his eyes for about thirty seconds and they signal to conduct or\nTo start again what he did was he changed the tuning three could pose he played just beautifully with only four strikes and afterward during a little speech he said you know it's really amazing how much music you can make with what you have left and that's how we get past the market goes down it doesn't matter we look at it as being a long term thing we context\nRecast we have a temporary dip a lot of ... we context\nRecast but we look at everything as part of a mosaic and which we just have to stay the course and keep doing what we're doing and not make really stupid decisions for example what if people totally out of the market where they tried to time the market well you would have missed march night two thousand I ... up by Jim you\nProbably know more than I Do about this but a two hundred and twenty percent since March night two thousand nineteenth what if we went all in during the wrong time\nSaying we are just kind of two thousand nine\nTwo thousand I by mistake yes you're right ... ...\nYeah All right so the key is staying the course and you know I Know on as a financial advisor I feel like I'm a psychologist because I'm constantly dealing with the emotions of my clients and the thing is it's really easy for me to be on emotional ... money that is not mine but even as a financial advisor knowing all the right things I find my mind pulling me to\nMaybe do things that I wouldn't advise my clients to do what do you call that\nWell that's just the emotional part of the day we talked about last time why smart people make\nMistakes or the money would they react to weather vagaries or how big in the market that's why people can't invest on their own\nThat's why every advisor out there really has to be as much psychologist as they do have to be advisor because you're the one that told me many times to this is a long term process of which were trying to hit a gold the future and if we can just keep ourselves cop and not be emotional about things that\nWould be able to do much better one of my favorite boxers is about ... Ali ever see in a fight oh yeah well what you do know about ... Ali as he was facing Sunday list another ring or the very early part of his career at what she was known as\nCassius Clay or Sunday list it was four inches taller had a three inch longer outreach and cash was getting polarized by a stronger faster\nBigger guy or the bell rang they went down the his end of the rank and he had a secret but the ... financial is it a set of cash to get out there ... you're going to beat up\nJust do one more around these I quit I'm not going to go out there is over I mean actually started taking the gloves off with a bell rang and as soon as that happened is secret weapon Angela Dundee took his chair out which by the couldn't sit down\nGame and they ended up back which they had to take one step forward this illicit side thread a white tower which meant they threw the fight caches one later became Mohammed Ali or the rest is history so a lot of this is just going around is taking motions out at the Pentagon your financial advisor to do what's right for you because you're so emotional and you're so passionate about\nThings that you need to have the mindset\nOf results focus goal of the future\nAnd sort of what's happening right now which is the ...\nSo how do people change their mind set from six to being more of that results orientated and keeping their eye on the projects\nYeah a couple of really good technique stuff for one is set one three five you're a despot goals and never to focus on the outcomes anniversary and this is a big one\nThis is the most important one this is called media rewards immediate reward so every time something happens that\nBasically major discipline so for example one of the hardest thing for people to do is due for one K. and desperate so you put six thousand dollars in or maybe you're older and you can put Eighteen thousand dollars at at every month you do that the ... for doing it if you treat yourself to a weekend you're with your wife you go on a retreat you go to a to a play a\nMovie but you have to do what's called it an immediate reward for every investment decision you make the next thing is we have to focus on outcomes or what\nThings are going to feel like so on the one had oh when you're putting money away for a best buy or your dollar cost averaging into things on the one he had this painful it doesn't feel good but we have to not think about gee I Want to have\nTen thousand dollars a month coming out when I retired including Social Security but I Am actually experiencing living above a quarter and Portugal I'm experiencing can be with my grandkids I'm experiencing being able to take a cruise so it's one thing having the goal and not having the emotions behind it but the other thing to having the emotions behind the outcome\nSo experience of what life is gonna be like instead of just a number or a concept out there\nWill make a huge difference a toothpick immediate rewards and experience of the outcome\nAnd that's where really working with the professional you know because it's it's really like working with the coach I mean a lot of us that are in the financial services world you know that's really what most of our role is we're not in the back room making the day to day trades that's what money managers do but your typical financial professional is going to help you\n... you know help guide you on the path give you some examples like what you're talking about and help them keep their eye on the\nPrize and keep going study also I find myself a lot of times I live in the Midwest and we're pretty conservative when it comes to spending and ... say cheap you know one thing I find myself doing too with clients is they get this mindset of saving for the future and the future never gets there and they don't treat themselves to\nThe rewards of being a successful saver and making it to retirement what do you say to those folks\nSuccessful people that are unsuccessful savers have a fix bites at the thinking about what they're losing right now instead of what they were working at the future so they're looking at a media to punish but instead of deferred rewards and that's why we have to reward ourselves consistently for making any\nContributions to our ... qualify plant or buddy that we're putting it and then we have to reward ourselves for staying on that plan as well so that reward thing is a really big deal\nNow I don't think you got my questions so what about for folks that are saving for that rainy day and have a real hard time because they get to retirement they've been saving saving saving saving they've done a good job they've been successful at it but now they're at the promised land there in retirement they want to start drawing money out but\nThey can't they're afraid to draw they're still in that savings mindset what do you say to folks like that to help them enjoy retirement if they safely cat\nThat's a very good point because they have a mind set of saving constantly for they have to change their mind set to something else so force or the government help us with that right they call it are these horses take that money out but if they obviously have you noticed that they need the money they're going to use it they don't see that they can use it for Iraq has other things but that takes a different mindset also so that takes at other\nForm of outcome so we have to look at what they what life to be like\nThey have to set new goals and that's really difficult to either one of our coach is what sets it's when you retire here that retired enough that you're retired ... so they have to kind of sport ... volunteering maybe a new company do topics at Exeter here that takes a closer to what they want to be passionate about us well\nThat's a that's a big thing I talk to everybody they're so excited about getting to that retirement and telling the boss of take this job and shove it that they haven't thought about what they're going to do next and I see a lot of people\nRetire without having that plan of what they're retiring to end in six to eight months they're bored they're depressed you need to know what the next phase of life is and that's where that planning is so important from a psychological standpoint just as much as it is from a financial standpoint so thanks again carry for joining us thanks you\nGet these expressed Enron depending on the science there or their broker dealer and should not consume directly or indirectly it's an offer to buy or sell anything Katie mentioned hearing individual circumstances Harry investing project to risk including lots of things on that note strategy and sharp happened against law\nAnd Dr biggest why don't we start here by talking about you know why is this deficiency such an epidemic despite all the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country\nAre the fishing and vitamin D\nThe fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone that should be there and it's not there\nAnd just to show that back in the seventies joined when he started getting cable network that of course with the Internet and we're not going outside and most of us get no vitamin D from the time\nWhat makes your fast smelled the three formula a much better choice\nOh Chris first of all I put five thousand units of vitamin D three per serving in each tablet actually feels a different second I use the right type of vitamin D and my formula\nAnd I've worked with in advance team of scientists and they're using that technology to put it in this vast dissolving Mel for immediate absorption and quick results that you can feel\nNow is your fast Mel vitamin D three formula manufactured here in the U.S Dr ...\nAbsolutely my formulas manufactured right here in the usa critics in fact\nWe have a facility that is a C. G. M. P. certified while which means current good manufacturing practices and this is an FDA mandated set of rules that we follow as a matter of fact just recently after he came in and did an infection and they said hey guys keep up the good work\nNow you mentioned earlier that there's a strong connection between vitamin D and diabetes talk a little bit about how your fast smelled the three formula could help folks that are dealing with diabetes or even at risk of getting diabetes\nWell diabetes is a huge problem and in type two diabetic what we find is that there's plenty of insulin and the bodies but the insulin is not recognized by the south and vitamin D three does is that the that problem and it seems to fix it now\nThey've studied vitamin D three and prove this insulin sure by sixty percent\nAnd the comparison the most popular diabetic drug improve the Thirteen percent\nWow now let me ask you this doctor bank is how can you fast smelled the three formula help boost your immune system\nMight of India's respond well for two hundred different chemicals that your immune cells could do to fight off bacteria and viruses here among us to both having any type\nI Would start right now taking one of my vitamin D three miles every day\nAnd one of the nice things about this is that the size of your immune system being better\nYou'll find your energy better you'll find less and less arthritic type pain more mobility flexibility better muscle strength and if you're someone who is concerned about falling it'll have better balance and a better sense of walking which is so important is that\nSo and and how do you take a doctor biggest\nYou can take it in the morning you could take it at night you don't need water and put it in your mouth and you know may be called the thirtieth gone\nWow and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results of basing\nLet me tell you my own story so over the summer I didn't take as much you might be true as actually traveling and I ran out of it do what happened to me that you know basically pain free but all of a sudden I started having pain in my hand I Know what is this this is weird but then I realized that I run a hundred\n... formula and I went off of it for several weeks and the minute I started going on and it took about seven maybe eight days the pain went away\nWow crazy isn't it\nThat's how you know somebody's working right if you stop and the health issues come back\nWell there's your answer\nThat's the best that anyone can listen to especially if you're on the fence\nHugo I Wonder if this is really for me and what I Would do it the next time you give up the number to have people orders is go ahead and order it I Know you mentioned that the risk tree opera and go ahead and try yourself and stay on it for five six weeks and then if you're still doubt it then go off of it and see if anything gets worse\nAnd again folks don't want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr ... says vitamin D three formula there's this special toll free number for you to call it's one eight hundred for seven six five four one for\nThem as we've been talking about Dr ... vitamin D three formula is a fast dissolving melt that's available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid results in by getting Dr ... vitamin D three into your body\nYou're going to have bolstered immune system improved balance stronger muscles\nAnd fewer aches and pains and keep in mind folks Dr ... gives his arranged a very special offers only available to you listeners so when you do call me surely mentioned this program and you'll get a risk free trial of Dr ... vitamin D three\nAgain this is only available to your listeners and only if you call this toll free number\nIt's one of eight hundred\nFor seven six five four one four plus if you'd call right now you qualify for an extra free supply with the order to keep yourself or share with a family member or friend\nBut you must call now because this special radio off or is not available in stores or on line so the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor seven six five four one for\nAnd keep in mind you have absolutely nothing to lose here because Dr ... vitamin D three formula is guaranteed to be safe and effective or your money back and when you do call and order you'll not be enrolled in any of those monthly subscription programs is is a one time order folks so the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor seven six five four one for I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for seven six five four one for [noise]\nSo what do you think folks are you one of the Seventy percent of people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements\nJoining us today is our good friend Dr Michael Pincus and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula and Dr biggest what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems in the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly it's not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nThe same criticism multifaceted problem where one for\nNot getting enough vitamin D three in our system ... vitamin D three is responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body\nControlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to muscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and honestly it surprised me because in medical school we learned that ... view as necessary for the ball and we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right and for the first twenty something years I practice I never\nI just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands of the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary is not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary and it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D or from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women who were studied and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy was\nDue to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading\nStudy you know I I kind of pot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the deck some shifts\nIn the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful ... young raise and and they're developing skin cancer but that I read on and it said most of the victim we're office workers like clerks and people in hangers an inside and I went oh my God\nIt was a link going back to the vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone string ... three formula help with that\nCritical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially\nHere seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down\nFor us it's kind of a clause in us that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then it's a lack of flexibility that you start to stiffen up and you feel it at night especially if they're in bed all in from side to side you wake up with your knees hurt in your legs are restless your shoulders hurt\nThat sets this sat in the end that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three and my formula so if you're someone
