... I might get that phone collection but out here and now the knowledge mhm [noise] and I've already received a lot of like settlements in the mail mhm last like Atta federal king hundred dollar bill that they're there\nFor ... than a hundred for a friend of mine was telling me that that thousands of dollars that we're getting mhm that I have to pay taxes on that at the end of the year and I was just wondering if you click true\nThat is true definitely given us except on a mortgage on your home is uh\nAnd they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that they forgave oh okay so what's your household income\n[noise] um [noise] it it's very very highly about forty five thousand here\nOkay so let's say let's say you're at ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight okay so it's still a good deal what's your yeah your I have about two hundred dollars per thousand for that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but and the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so\nYeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have and in addition to that now if you had a large returning coming because you're over withholding\nWell then in that case so you're just going to lower your return because you need to change your withholding anyway\nSo good question thank you

kind of wondering why genome ... was going to get to START I mentioned the fact that uh the brewers are five and only games that he is pitched this year since coming over to Milwaukee but when you look at his postseason ER ray at six point five seven over three postseason starts\nGoing all the way back to a game three that two thousand sixteen division series with the Dodgers beat him up pretty good and four and a third [noise] um so quake counseled yanks him after two weddings we brand and wonder if in the game\nRight now and I'm Kirk shop a continues to do a really nice job you saw a lot of couple of base runners but again no runs the Dodgers find themselves up in this one we are the bottom of the third one nothing nobody on and nobody out\nGoing to get a little bit into this whole Jimmy Buffett situation we've been talking about it over the last couple of days and it still remains a story in part a because Jimmy is not present with the basketball team\nWho happens to be in Milwaukee tonight for the final preseason game uh before they start to regular season now if you're not real\nTuned in as to what's going on butler who said that a ... interview we did with Rachel Nichols on Jeopardy ESPN sort of four days after the season he notified Tom to ever do that he wanted I wanted a trade\nNothing happened um and apparently all kinds of hell broke loose he joined the team for the first time in pre season for practice a and verbally assaulted if you will\nUm members of the team but coaching staff the general manager and I'm and basically according reports took a bunch of third the third team or a put together a team and just ran everybody out of the gym and then left early [laughter]\nThe team called our practice the following day Jimmy out of a player is only meeting in which he said listen this is the deal on the leader ah I'm going to work hard and until this gets done I'm here so let's play so we all thought he would uh joined the team correct uh that isn't the case today he is not with\nThe uh the ... the um Minneapolis timber wolves Minnesota timber wolves I should say he was asked to stay home as a matter of fact\nTo work on his conditioning I'm saying wait a second\nThis guy he was a competitive animal rolled into the gym for the first time I took a bunch of Thirteen players of beat the hell out of your starters needs to stay home and work\nOn his conditioning\nThat's absolutely nuts\nDo have a very long tenure in Minnesota I'll chimed in today on butler said a it's a blank storm up there\nI think both sides are a little delusional\nJimmy thinks he's worth a little bit more than what he is he's a very good player but I don't see 'em on the Iran through a bronze level but if they're a plus he's definitely an a or a minus\nYou went on to say I don't know if he had the power to come out in force trade like this I don't know if Jimmy has enough juice to be that and ... and I think that's what this has come down to\nLike I said at the other day first of all it was there was a playoff game and I know they made it on the final game of the year last year but it's a playoff team\nThey sign Carl Anthony towns to long term deal they signed into Williams to long term deal\nIs Jimmy Butler better than those two guys absolutely\nJimmy wanted them to sell off some some assets to remove some salary so that they could pay him what he thought he was worth it was like listen if I'm working harder and I'm Better than these guys out to be making as much if not more money than these guys they offer them like a force\nNot good enough not good enough and then all hell breaks loose and he wants out [noise] see I think this is about money because then the Rachel Nichols interview\nOn ESPN she asked point blank can this be fixed and he said yeah it can be fixed I don't think it'll be fixed but yeah it can be fixed and he's pointed the finger at the young guys Andrew weekends and Carl Anthony towns they just don't work hard enough\nThey're all about ... they don't care about winning they don't know what it's like to grind to make winning the most important thing in your life during the basketball season\nAnd of course there have been multiple reports out there that he demeans these young guys doesn't want to play with them and I listen to some Carl Anthony towns interviews today as they got prepare to take on the books\nHe's so damned tired of had an answering these questions it's ridiculous I'm sure he doesn't like Jimmy in a way he's been treated by Jimmy but I said the other day and the scrimmage\nWas going to be bad mouth and me I'm a I'm going to take a form ventilate across the said\nListen I respect he was a player but you're going to talk to me like that this is this is what's gonna happen and these young kids are willing\nTo do that yet I think that's that's been part of the problem to be honest with you a today\nTom ... was asked about\nThe situation would be butler and he says that remain quote unquote fluid\nLeaving the window open for a return\nThe regular season debut by the way it will be on Wednesday in San Antonio and\nThere was a ask about Jimmy Butler today on multiple occasions and he danced around a lot of questions but he was asked about Butler's leadership role and here was his answer\nBut there's a lot of different ways to to find leadership you know the biggest job of a leader in my eyes as to unite and inspired and it's okay to front that's not an issue I think the way you can front that is important but if you do consulting don't beat down\nAnd show that the the big thing is to you lift people up you know you make other people better\nI get it all sounds good\nBut I guarantee you there have been some of the best coaches and the leaders that I've ever been around in my life that we are not always uplifting they kick your writing a book they would demeaning you they will embarrass you\nTo try to motivate you to get more out of you I don't know maybe that's what you mean butler is doing maybe maybe the way he's gone about\nThis with some of these young players has alienated these players\nBut let's face it there are better basketball team with Jimmy butter right I don't think there's any question about that but his tips pointed out today this is not about just one guy this is about a basketball team take a listen\nThis is a team sport is not an individual sport show when you look at every great player in this league for most they don't start off being raped players there's a rush into it and so that's what everyone has to understand and it's all about the team the team has got to come first\nAll right [noise] so you can you could certainly say in this instance that you know if this is about to be bothered by the team Jimmy ... Jimmy ... pay doing wants to win but he wants to get paid\nAt their best to\nBecome the best call the Army National guard at one eight hundred six three Seventy six hundred [noise]\nCan we can walk to school at the corner we stopped like count again team forty one thirty one I mean\nWe took a left right or whoever you garden\nMusical is coming from the car\nAnd he's a smart kid but so distracted\nSo many other than\nSuddenly he realized he forgot his homework again I\nLeft my homework on the table\nTo schools that we have to die\nWhen you can see learning and attention issues from their side\nYou can be on their side that's why there's understood that or a free online resource for the parents of the one in five kids with learning and attention issues get personalize recommendations practical tips daily access to experts in more to go for misunderstanding to understood dot org raunchy by understood in the ad council\n[noise]\n\nYou know if you're reaching for\nEverybody and it's quite a shock you sounded a third fine way with the strike out of my ... but ah it was kind of a comedy of errors\nOr you are it's a wine shot at the second baseman new catches it but it's catcher interference is uh the Dodgers catcher Randolph ... hits\nThe bat a value are so he gets the base and we get a sack fly from press that scores I Believe it's Cain and then a tall [noise] boots the ball that comes in France\nOff the runners advanced or no more damage though right now the brewers have gotten a laid back it's two one after three any say five five three two three four in D.C if you'd like to join the conversation want an update you with a couple of injury situations\nI'm In the national football league and we can start with Aaron Rodgers who apparently suffered a setback early in the week\nAnd it was that back to last week uh being in a week [noise] they've got to be in rehab [noise] group again today a lot of work and with native and uh just open or you got there tomorrow in\nThis building friday [noise] and in practice Saturday and then they get to go way back to where I was to try\nTo eat fish taco friday Kansas City apparently in Green Bay it's built Good Friday um [noise] the the the decision that and I don't know that it's worrisome\nBut last week Aaron Rodgers went to a a smaller knee brace\nThan the one he had been wearing and then of course he's had to set back so there's some concern now as to whether or not he might have to go to bed bigger knee brace which is more cumbersome\nBut at this point in time um you know you got to protect your quarterback and given the fact that you've got the forty niners coming into town no Jimmy gr Rob Lowe you've got CJ bet third at the quarterback position or they should win this game going back some of the wide receivers are starting to get healthy again ...\nAllison a is back at practice et cetera and out of the concussion protocol so my guess is that shouldn't be\nToo much of an issue you would just like\nAaron to continue to play\nAt least over the next two weeks without without suffering any setbacks I mean he he had a sprained M. C. L. but he also had a bone bruise there those take four to six weeks depending on how bad that spring was so I'll we'll find out how this is all going to play out he's going to play it's not going to be an issue question really is how do how mobile will they be\nAnd how big and cumbersome all that ... are also um boy if you're a Carolina Panthers fan and and and particularly by the way\nCan't do you got to be really fired up\nIs that he's been playing for the ... for the uh the better part of the season without grey goes\nFractured his foot again you remember last year he he missed a bunch of time he ended up with a fractured foot they went in there they put a screw in their took him forever to come back well he ... his right foot back in week one and uh he's returned to practice in recent weeks and\nThe Panthers had you know put on the counter weeks six we hope he's backed by week six that would be the best situation\nFor him well apparently because the screws inserted a in that spot last year the fractures roughly the same place but the screws helped\nYou know kind of hold the thing together so apparently his recovery has been\nA much faster he went through practice or on Wednesday and Thursday ran around look good no problem with a foot wrong or their their head coaches was that if this guy doesn't have any setbacks he's going to play now that's why is that big well first of all north turn of the office of coordinator there has a history of\nGetting the ball was tied it's All right you can go back to\nSay no to check in the super bowl years with a Troy Aikman in Dallas you go with Antonio Gates in San Diego he's a master at a out of the play action of getting the ball to ... and by the way went three consecutive seasons where he went over a thousand yards as a tied in\nA he has a trust and communication with Cam Newton or that there's like\nNo other I saw some video about a firm camera later today on by my dog is bag just happy and I mean this guy is through the roof that he's going to have his security blanket back a great goals and so I obviously I like the Panthers I pick the Panthers to win this week there in Washington to take on the two and two red skins\nUm but this is big news I mean if you're a if you're a Carolina fan\nUm yes this is a this is good news indeed a meanwhile\nNot that it's an injury well I guess it is an interview situation although he believes it's going to be All right uh we mentioned adjacent Peters the starting left tackle for the Philadelphia Eagles and one thirty for Thirteen last night had a biceps injury apparently to torn by sets he's thirty six years old\nHe's been tampered with injuries over the last couple of years\nYou're pulling unless you're curling something which off its climate should be doing they should be punching using their triceps more than their biceps uh Jason Peters says he's gonna be ready to go for the Philadelphia Eagles which is really good news lane Johnson the other tackled that make through the whole game of the high ankle spring\nOr they've got to buy a week now so some time off so we'll see how they go with that but um it by the way\nHe says he and play with a torn biceps my guess is he'll be affected by that tone growing by myself so\nUh something to keep an eye on the right as we mentioned Milwaukee up to one where\nAnd uh let's see Dodgers have won out nobody on\nThe five five three for three or four NBC the numbers join the conversation last up to talk about in the NBA this'll Jimmy ... situation during the season right around the corner I'm looking forward to talking about ... the bottom line is for children serious like semi ... channel\nHe'll join us snacks and not only will squeeze cafe books of course you\nDon't go anywhere that's actually under ... this is NBC Sports radio\n[noise] [noise]\nYou in BC sports radio with\nStarting Milwaukee object pigs that'll be good either Miller Park the brewers are hosting game want to be and I'll see us against the Dodgers and they are now leading two to one of the top of the Ford mainly Machado let off the top of the second was a solo homerun Gillette but the brewers here back in title and the bottom of the third reliever Brandon would rip\nJust the third reliever in postseason history did a whole money took Clinton cursed shot with a moon shot the center and then the brewers loaded the bases\nBut we're only able to get to stay in Paris sec why to put them on top so it's to toward brewers where the Dodgers batting in the top of the Ford also in Milwaukee\nThe bugs are hosting the world is no Jimmy Butler he's back in Minnesota and the bugs are a big in the second quarter sixty to thirty three the Greek freak out sixteen college football over twenty three South Florida trailing it's also Seventeen potentially the third\nNBC Sports radio\n[noise]\nHey I'm Andy if you don't know me it's probably because I'm not famous but I did start screaming company called Harris the idea for Harry's came out of a frustrating experience I had buying razor blades most brands were overpriced over designed and out of touch at Harry's or approaches simple here's our secret\nWe make sharp terrible blades and sell them at honest prices for as low as two dollars each we care about quality so much that we do some crazy things like by WorldCom chairman blade factory obsessing over every detail means we're confident in offering a hundred percent quality guarantee millions have guys have already made the switch to aries so thank you if you're one of them\nAnd if you're not we hope you give us a try with the special offer get Harry starter set with a five bleed razor waited handle shaved Joe and the travel cover all for just three bucks plus free shipping\nYou know that would surprise because Tamms is doing well as the GM president whatever as well as the head coach\nSo you know and seeing all this I think Jimmy Butler wanted to force the issue beyond as he's gotten in front of a situation\nI wouldn't be surprised there is a team like Sacramento gets in the mix but arguably it might work out in Miami you know I just hit the Fort Wayne wages possibly coast side in it and they have an image end up there so I I wouldn't be surprised\nBut I'm the biggest thing that I started telling about this whole situation as I said so many parents\nIf you look at the list of teams that he picked reportedly had kept space right and they had you know there are ... we never heard the Lakers her all ... teams that means that it didn't it a day\nYou know do they have a chance to baby when all is just sort of saying well okay we get him and now you've got to attract another top tier free agent to come along so I'm not I I maybe ends up in Miami but at this John shit I I just think I feel bad for the Minnesota Tim ... because there is no way of the world you could shoot 'em up for the first gay at all\nHardly before we move on others a report out there by a dream or ... been apparently justice Winslow ... of the heat assigned a three year extension worth about thirty nine million dollars is any way or any way these two stories to be butler and the heat of injustice Winslow do you think they're connected or no\nI think maybe as a possibility to ... you know he could be added to the debate said you know on on on the surface I mean you know what are they going to do in terms of now does that mean that they move forward\nAcquiring a you know Jimmy Butler but then on the flip side of that you look at that and say hey maybe this is one of those situations where you have\nThe Minnesota chemicals one in a young player like wind solar return and have some sort of contractual control over him and rather than having to revisit this situation and a couple of years moving forward so maybe\nYou know if you look at it closer and closer he could possibly be another piece to this whole Jimmy ... the deal and uh they try to figure out a way to get this done before the season kicks off next week\nAnd we're talking with a good friend journal brown from the bottom line sports show there are serious like send me a VHS when you're under center refined five three two three four NBC so everything's going to get started this week in the NBA I'm from a storyline standpoint what is the most intriguing thing that you're looking forward to seeing play out in the NBA\n[laughter] well I mean the biggest thing is you know if you let's look out the eastern conference I think you know everybody has really on the paper said that the Boston Celtics are pretty much all that\nFinal but I mean now you hear stories about Gordon Hayward having ... minutes manage in each condemning what a bad problem so that something that's really going to be telling\nThe Washington Wizards you know how will they should have a healthy adapt you know having a guy like why our into that mix how well they jail and\nAnd get things going Toronto Raptors you have a ... there and nobody's really talk too much about that can they be that team that really gets in that poll and really takes that stat\nAnd and runs away with that division of course we know about Philadelphia but\nI think it really does change there in Milwaukee\nYou know we're still waiting for the Milwaukee deceived Jackie what will they become you know we've heard so many great things about this but do they have a sort of Robin that's in place you know they thought it would be Eric Bledsoe to be that individual to go along and play sort of the um the co captain if you will\nAnd a dry shotgun with a guy like yeah and then I'll just stay out west\nYou know look Ron and seeing how the fact is how well he ... with a chain and I'm really what he can do with them and they're going to be under the spotlight\nA going forward and I think another one that sort of hidden we'd be actually Davis you know is it a situation where possibly get to run out you know somewhere close to all star break\nThat it starts to indicate the management that he's not going to sign back with em wants his deal is up and turned down the supermax or New Orleans put him on the market or balance trade a lot so a lot of stories on it to be very tally moving forward into the start of the season\nAlright listen I Can't wait to get outta here before I ask you about your Tampa Bay buccaneers coming off of the by he got a guy James Winston you know he's doing all the promos he's back a quarterback facing Atlanta team of division opponent as a horrible de France what are you expecting this weekend my friend\nYou know I think that obviously with the defense the way that they played mainly in the secondary you know a lot of things that have been pointed it might Smith and you know the defensive coordinator\nYou know it's just a question of how well can they hold up I mean you know last time I checked the I Know that you know who will Jones accountable you should do those guys you let it be out there the available to the quarterback Matt Ryan show with the defense band so suspect\nYou know the odd things will be able to put up numbers but it's just been a question as to defense could be able to hold\nAnd and and really allow this team to really go ahead and get a nice comfortable lead it puts a scandal way so it's still a work in progress but I I I Will say this is Jason Pierre Paul he's been playing really phenomenal and I take a ... a\nDefensive line coach is really going to do a lot of great things with that live once they get every body that healthy and get a little bit more time together so I'm just going to be interesting to see how they play it but I think it begins and ends with all with the defense\nThree ladies and gentlemen this guy's better the most part of our guests are we are on your own brown and host of the bottom line sport show we always talk about his book through the NFL season Gerald it's always it's always a pleasure my friend we appreciate when

little bit here because we're going to get into this a bit later on as well but the New York giants after that the ... of a Thursday night last\nJuly manning is just looked awful absolutely\nAwful the questions today for ... the head coach of the New York giants of course having to do with the with the lie manning and do you start to consider ... at this point take a listen to ... today his thoughts on Eli Manning\nA changing world you know well we believe in\nThe idea that say corn Barclay was a mistake I don't I don't I don't see the logic and that and I just told you that I Believe anyway\nThat's what ... is not a good head coach\nThat's why they've Gettleman is not a good GM and that's why the New York giants organization is pathetic right now\nThe reason they can switch from Eli Manning is there's just nobody the back of the many right now is a thirty year old journeyman name Alex Penny wise I Believe it started one game and nine years whatever it is\nThe quote unquote quarterback and re waiting is a bigger project and Josh Alan and that's Carl a letter from Richmond who is the fourth round pick with the giants will tell you is a project\nDrafting say Kwan Barkley in terms of pure talent was not an mistakes they won Barkley is probably the best player in the strapped\nBut St Paul Barclay doesn't play a position that you have to get the right guy yeah what I mean by that is there's plenty of good running backs out there and in terms of a drag you can get a pretty good running back later and later a trap we've seen it you're not getting fake one Barkley but you'll survive\nIf the New York giants right now had by the way which said while I'm Barkley there one in five where they got off off ants right\nWithout said well I'm Barkley they can be one in five with a guide off off in that much of a different set sake one Barclay made well absolutely none because at one in five and they say the whole point is if the New York giants were smart and they're not and they had drafted oh stay Sam ...\nThe option is there to make a move for me like you can't switch from the line now because there's nobody to switch to\nThere is no single quarterback on that roster that you can switch to right now from Eli Manning but if you had seemed Arnold on the roster you don't think giants fans would be screaming for Donald to start with number seven\nThe whole point is if you had trapped in a quarterback second overall like you should have and not a running back\nYou actually would have somebody to switch from considering how bad Eli Manning used in how Johnny use in terms of visibility\nThat's the whole point here so yeah they're not going to consider switching from you lined the fact is they can't because there's nobody to switch to and yeah

nine and it's crazy go nuts time for him to try to figure everything out in fact as I'm going through Twitter which is which is the best advice on nights like this yes to try to eat right Mike\nI it is it is we would not be getting the scores the way we are without Twitter\nRight right and and everybody around the state realizes\nThat get the scores in because the sooner you do the sooner\nYou know people like Travis Wilson can actually start sorting things out and W I ate can start sorting things out because\nThey have to know where the line is drawn for the seven divisions they have to know start to the group these teams together because it's based on proximity then and the seatings them will take place and we'll know the the full field all seven brackets all seven division brackets sometime tomorrow afternoon\nBut first things first you got to see who is all in\nAnd then which division they're going to be in and that's the big deal that unfolds here sometimes into the wee hours of the morning so the sooner you get your scores and folks sooner you can find out you don't have to make this late night\nHey Travis by the way we think there's a chance to get a joined us if he can get the math done I'd never get I Can't do math at all to get that done that I there's a chance he'll join us we'll probably posed to play out field on was port starting at some point tonight\nAnd if you're looking for any score if we don't mention it you can find it that was sports dot net Travis I Believe doing a Facebook Live he is as he is going through this yeah\nUm I mean you and I have face for radio so that's why we're doing it was actually um in fact you know I mentioned that Twitter is such a great tool and I'm like this when you want to try to get scores that might be significance to your team whether they get in er which division they get in Watertown football\nAnd and they tweet out you know a reminder that if you have scores so many other games tonight send them to at Travis W s an aunt or treat them with the hash tag W. I. S. F. B. but this is one that's on football the sooner we underscores the sooner we'll find out who's in which division yeah guys links\nAnd we just finished at our scoreboard 'cause I just found are less scored as you\nLook at you look at you\nWell we'll get to the score will get to the the latest scoreboard and again as might just mentioned if you don't hear us rattle off this because we are trying to bring you scores that means something as far as he the playoff picture or\nWhether or not that that help them with the common ... yeah yeah yeah so that that's the scoreboard that we're running through here tonight\nAnd so again if you don't hear that score a no worries Travis Wilson is updating on his website he's got his minions hard at work plugging in all these scores on the sports dot net scoreboard\nSo again if you don't hear it if you're saying well I Want to know if we tie for a conference championship or if if our guys want an outright or if we have a chance because we're on the bubble and what we do is based on what another team did to night that's when you go to sports dot net\nAnd that's what they show was powered by so that's where you go there and you try\nTo sort things out and then you can run through every score throughout the state checkout conference standings and again Travis Wilson that's the site the he'll have things broken down of the entire playoff field\nThat will happen sometime later this evening will know the two hundred and twenty four teams\nThat are in the postseason we will know where the division lines will be drawn so you'll be able to see which division your team is going to play and and you might be able to be able to kind of start predicting how our brackets going to unfold you kinda know then in that division who the top seeds might be\nSo if you're one of those teams and and you think you know where your team might fall as far as a division\nAnd then as far as the seed it might be able to think OK well these\nTo hurt along the way if we want to make our way to camp Randall in Madison\n... notes that want to talk about before we run through another scoreboard and again we're gonna try to talk to coaches along the way\nA ... as we mentioned they went to nine and no they are going to win tonight they ran the table they won the beat up a self in convincing fashion there'll be a top seed no doubt and again this third the season knocking off Kimberly and knocking that streak\nOr to sending that one uh aside when the longest winning streak at the time in the nation Boston finished the your age and won their first outright south central conference championship since two thousand congratulations of them\nDo sheen near the outright south west conference chance because they're going to win tonight west be a bully conference champs\nSo congratulations to them an avid spurred they are conference champs as well this season so just some of the tidbits along the way another conference champ\nHe's Edgar they took care of business tonight Edgar Edgar did they had a a big time match up with a mirror would title again Stratford another perennial power in that part of the state and in the state period and egg or one at twenty six to twenty\nAnd the veteran coach\nFrom agar joining us now on football friday night Jerry how are you tonight\nGood good\nI'll bet you are congratulations on winning the conference championship\nYou know people will see it as you all the time I'm sure they'll say it again yeah you guys have one that so many times you've won so many conference championship won so many state championships but this never gets old and it means something to have that title older yourselves doesn't it\n[noise] it was fun it was a it was a great game on a one of the classic their coaches a\nClimate where there may be as good as the playoff game we had to get really high school way back in the Knight is or what do you want to fight all play but um [noise]\nYeah it was exciting um [noise] they made it Ninety nine hour drive to record quarter Weiner farther and farther down about three or four times and and we got first Allen's band or\nAre they cater to probably carry the ball thirty five times more for who knows how many are that\nTwo hundred plus I have a gas and well and I'm tied at twenty twenty and then we drove down with ... seconds we are going to pick a field goal I think we at the um\nOh boy I think it was yesterday why are those are bad at Twenty one so ... Thirteen or that's working yard right after a couple of great catch a bike rack Hendrik um [noise]\nAnd anyway it was called a strike on South Carolina we decided to take all the time out to a kind of like a star kicker so then we decided we want our ...\nAnd ... and then throw it away if we had to because it was their power and so we ran and won at Enron they all got to a shelter and got a guy altered yet so I got a touchdown pass so um\n[noise] and then a I Believe they jumped off right but it kind of urgent kicks really want to but we didn't get it [laughter] but it was a that was quite the Spanish I'm very exciting game and the mud and cold and a lot of fans like ...\nYeah ... you're right coach I mean that is a classic one fish for you guys and congratulations on the championship\nYeah and I I was gonna say it's the talk of the ... of Edgar as they get a\nConference settled tonight I Love the fact you guys are so old school and I know in a high school level you still see there's a lot but you guys\nFigure averaging about two hundred thirty nine yards on the ground this year and you play very ... defense\nYou just keep it old school and simple and I still love seeing that in the world of big points and spread often says [noise]\nCan I ask because there is you know considerably bigger than ours so um\nI think that most of our callers fire scars tonight we're probably passes but that was pretty much by design because the match ups\nSo I'm going to read soon head coach of the Andrew squad that won a thriller tonight to win the ... conference championship twenty six twenty\nOver Stratford ... you've seen so many of your team's coach over the years and you\nHad to be at the times that you got to this point after week nine and you kind of knew whether or not they had a good strong playoff run in those teams to try to get you back to Madison what's your guts to say about this team that was you had to the post season\n[noise] obviously we've played a lot of a\nBigger schools and all throughout the year we started our ... Seventy five students sit\nSteven's point it's been a tough year for ... near the wind is still sneak in but they played fond du Lac there'll be a number one seed funding ran the table they are a V.

Scandinavia doing their thing over ... thirty one to Fifteen actual invested met for twenty eight to twelve so actually there's the outright crate northern champ [noise]\nAh let's see here in northern or lead fell the credits forty to thirty four so they are the small champ of the M.

C.\nTsering wasn't let her eight teams seven day are in the postseason north when pine sweet three lakes Phelps twenty eight to sixteen pines needed that when they get and they got it there in\n... and they were winter over strapped for twenty six to twenty and really a winner take all games for the ... championship Edgar gets that job than loyal be adults for tonight forty nine twenty two they are the champions of the\nClover would tolerate and lots of mucho important time the games and the all clear area of the cool the region northwest part of the state\nStarting with Chippewa falls in Hudson Boyd shy high was up against the wall cardinals if they fall the Hudson they're out of the post season a win puts them on the bubble and then likely puts them in\nA big win tonight for the cardinals and Chuck ... their longtime head coach Seventeen seven to fight all over the raiders Colby Stan Lee Boyd tonight thirty one Twenty one\nBack to the big rivers we go and my nominee beat Oakland memorial thirty five to Twenty one what that means is the old eggs are out of the post season uh wouldn't want to put them on the bubble and probably in ... now know old Clare memorial it was bloomer big over Hayworth tonight fifty six to twenty\nHayward what clinched victory\nThere on the bubble not what the last of the blue and Black Hawk still have to wait and see Alaska falls to home and tonight forty nine to fourteen\nThat means Holleman is the outright sham of the Mississippi Valley conference congratulations to them\nSt Croix central in Somerset Panthers one forty two to twenty four over Somerset\nThat gives them the outright middleborns championships summers that was trying to get the victory to share that title was saint ... central but it's all SCC and twenty Eighteen [noise]\nBig one between rice lake in superior superior knocked out of the post season with a loss of wouldn't want to put them on the bottle and probably in but rice lake\nKnocks them off completely warriors one thirty three to Twenty one so the defending state champs are back in with a strong finish in week nine and west P. N. baroque or play Brooklyn needed the victory to help them secure the post season and they don't get it because with the spoils that was a regular season victory tonight [noise]\nThirty five to twenty the final there and those are the final score is that we have on our week nine scoreboard state wide [noise]\nAgain we've kind of cherry pick\nSome of the games that\nWell they meant a lot either because a conference championship or simply put in you hurt us run through the score is simply put it meant that his team was in or out or on the bubble\nOnce again with sports that net that's your place to go if you don't hear the scores verbally tonight on your radio dial Travis Wilson is updating them so you can run through all the scores all the conferences see how the conferences stack up whether teams are sharing conference championships where they want an outright\nAnd again Travis Wilson while he's doing a Facebook Live he's also here recently\nUpdated to try to get the teams that are secure in the post season and then also once we know the two hundred and twenty four\nThat are in to the post season now you start to buying those pieces of the pie up into seven divisions and this is a big deal\nOn where your team gets slighted because some teams know going into even throughout the regular season they kind of know where they're going to go pay it's based on enrollment they know where they're going to fall division wise no matter how how things play out but if you're a teen with the enrollment ... you're right on that cut line\nThen it's a big deal and where your team is going to get slot it and you don't know until everybody's in the field once everybody gets into the field to twenty four then you start basically lining up the enrollments and you go from number one all the way down to two twenty four\nThen you start drawing lines thirty\nTeams and this is a big deal bike when you start drawing up the divisions because\nYou may think you're in one division but all of a sudden the domino effect slide you to another division and you may think you have a better chance in one division then at top heavy division that has better teams in it making your play off road a little bumps along the way shall we say so division placement is a big deal later tonight\nIt's really the thing that I think makes high school football in this state the most unique to me I have covered high school football in three states and this is the only state where you essentially don't know the division you're playing in or class depending on the state\nDivision you're playing until the post season starts it's just a very unique situation and let's say you're on that bubble for division two division three division three division for your like division three All right we get in division for oh we can win this whole thing I mean it's that you know two extra students in your class\nCan come down to a state title or just may be making a potential playoff run in it's just kind of a fascinating thing for a lot of these bubble teams\nYeah and and think of it this way if you're right on that ... and you're sweating that out tonight not only is it a fact\nThat you want to play in a division that you match up better but let's say you're fighting for being either the last team in the division one\nOr you're going to be the first team in division to why teams would say boy slightest division two we want to be one of the quote unquote bigger schools or be the biggest school enrollment why is at least\nIn division to rather than be somebody on the bottom and we're playing bigger team or the bottom of division one so if you understand the point there\nThat's why this is so important because some some people say oh football football you know it doesn't matter it doesn't\nMatter what sport where it makes an enormous it makes\nIt makes a huge difference in teams know and teams get it and teams don't have control over it they have control whether or not they get in the postseason that they can control\nBut what happens tonight now is what makes this whole evening that goes in sometimes into the wee hours really fascinating and why teams have dial in because if you're on that cut line\nThey want to know what teams they might run up against which teams might be a buzz saw for them as a make a run to the post season which teams they might be able to avoid based on the brackets\nThat's where the divisions come into play that's why this is such a big deal and that's why everybody will stay up late you know they'll percolate the coffee they'll get some popcorn\nThey'll finished watching the bird game and then they'll turn their attention\nTo how the division placement is going because we're going to have the two hundred twenty four teams\nProbably shortly probably with in the hour we'll have the two twenty four\nBut then where they fall where they're broken up where everybody goes and where those ... lines are\nThat's going to spill one team up a division still another team down and division that will be a big deal also case in point just to kind of show you how things fall and how it can be a domino effect Travis Wilson pointed out earlier tonight\nThat Milwaukee saw who plays in the city conference in Milwaukee obviously\nMilwaukee so even though they qualified for the playoffs tonight with their record Milwaukee there's already a made note or they have a known that they will choose not to be in the playoffs because they don't have the numbers\nThey it's it's not a fear factor but they just don't have the numbers to stack up and they I mean that's where you're born into player safety so they have already announced that they're\nThat they're not for putting the game but what they're doing is they're going to allow somebody else in that has better numbers to get in the playoffs field so Milwaukee south is out but somebody that didn't think they were going to be in all of a sudden they have new life tonight there'll be an all of a sudden that shifts\nThat hole playoff field because of one team\nAnd I don't know if you mentioned it but I think Travis city mentioned it's a last time and he talked about that hotline for the post season what is a division three division for probably the biggest one 'cause that's where you're getting into the small schools right so that's yeah that's where it really makes a difference\nNow it's a matter of well we kinda know which division will be in ... where do we go north or south ... ... you can you can start to see All right we're we're the buzz saw team's going to be that eventually we're going to have to play 'em but is it sooner rather than later\nYou know you and I talked about this off the air before the show started about us in Chile okay for the two best teams let's not meet 'til the state championship game around for because we can say we at least got around three of the four of the postseason\nYou can look at that at professional sports whatever you want we got beat in the first round but we were the two best teams that some I say\nYou're probably gonna have to play them eventually so why does it matter when you play them that is the way I have always looked at it and if he beat him early on you've already taken care of them in your road there's even easier I Know some people don't agree with that but\nThat's just the way I look at it I Know some people are looking at funded lacking Kimberly but they're going to be later in the postseason they should made it a state championships\nThe way should I say whatever you play and play and it doesn't matter if you focus form as much in round one is you do in in level five\nWell and and I know if if Travis was here he would he would echo the sentiments because we have talked about that\nIn fact we did start talking about that in week one in the game you mentioned Kimberly and find a way it was a great football game started the season it ended Kimberly is winning streak but guess what paper makers ran the table ever since shirt they finished eight one final like around the table from start to finish till they win the conference\nBut very good chance they're going to meet again in the playoffs and yeah what would it be great to have them in a state championship\nShirt but it's not it's it's not going to happen because they're going to have the meat because they're in the same neck of the woods ... a lot of the playoffs are based on geography as well\nAnd it is and virtually every state not just here\nBy the right right and so so you see these rematch is all the time and you see rematch that happen sometimes as early as the second round and you go well this isn't right that there should be laid around well\nIt doesn't matter where it is if you're going to make a run on the playoff run and you're gonna make her into a state championship if you claim that's as good as the state championship in treated as such yeah and when it and then you can coast after that\nSo that argument but it it it it's a it doesn't hold much water\nAnd I think there's some people that say All right look these games at state are televised they're a big deal state championship you shouldn't have\nA really good team playing just some team that got out of a week or part of the state I understand that because it's kind of the the big stage games for your sport in your state I Do understand that side of the argument\nBut I still say look every and I don't because every other state does that doesn't necessarily mean it's the right thing to do but it's really are descended team way up north down way south to play one football game and yet I school gets it's just hard to do\nIt it it's it's hard to do because it's it's tough on travel bans and already I mean I have already seen playoff pairing where it's impossible not to have long stretches of travel\nIs I mean you you can try as hard as you want but I mean as you get deeper and

like talking about the Ryan Bowen situation Sandy I think right now one of the guys to kind of originally on the door on things happening in college that\nMay not have been so kosher especially in North Carolina for shop McCain's former North Carolina Charlotte championships there can be a first round pick currency three player and author of plantation education exploitation of the modern day student athlete was shot in\nYour career with short your good player why do you think you weren't in the NBA today\nOr this was among sport was my best to be a decided to drive and other other realms and that would be a being an author as one you know I'm being able to write a\nA very informative books about something that I Lived through or something then on the other people or something that was the spores and basketball and I'm just grateful to your decision to have a word score for the\nFirst shot do you think that you vocalizing the\nUnderbelly of college athletics the dirty ... the academic improprieties hurt your MBA career in terms of continuing\nNot at all not at all I Believe like I said it was supposed to be close you know after for so many battles trying to understand why couldn't you they're allowing one like in different you know rumors and allegations yeah there\nI stopped fighting it just realized that you know or the other aspects of this was welcome to the war and um this is one of them so\nI don't need to reflect on it or something that I wasn't supposed to happen I think everything will call\nYou know it's interesting because I follow the debate of college athletics and the money that's brought in a shot in the fact that the players besides the scholarship aren't getting paid when universities are making tens of millions or in some cases hundreds of millions\nBut to me it's become kind of racial and what I mean by that is people talk about the exploitation of black athletes why does color matter industry shot why isn't it just athletes being exploited in college\nBecause of this that the status that go along with how the money is being generated goes to you know Seventy percent of the athlete in college or a black that play for a sports between\nBasketball and football Seventy percent and um six percent of those concrete total body the body part Groberg\nAn American students on campuses for athletics compared to academics are a huge astronomical so there there there has to be racial because a lot of the revenue driving schools have a majority of African American athlete on them\nBut but you know what you're right about that in terms of the the sheer numbers but\nMy my outlook is this so Seventy percent are black thirty percent or not but the rules that are in place by the NC double A. and by the way which I agree with you I think the rules are ridiculous in terms of how rich these schools get off of athletes but the fact is they're not separate rules in terms of governing white athletes are black athletes correct It's all athletes are getting screwed\nThat they were all athletes are definitely definitely all athletes are definitely has now and that was never to turn that the the color a system against anyone but there is a discrepancy in the black community when they're targeting a systems and everything to do with athletics\nStart with joy star players in your star players are which are\nNinety percent African American players and the players are being like myself and health care line of the folks are filtered through African American studies courses in the African American studies at the park because no one would question us\nGoing to learn our own heritage so they were able to cheat through us being able to just be in classes that we we we should already know about our history so this was just the system or cry when it comes down to it and the use of uncover system for\nThat when when you were in these African American studies courses with other athletes and you were Eighteen Nineteen years old the time young guys\nDo you think to yourself how they've cheapened what African American studies is\nDid that is that did that cross your mind then that it was being you know the filter system and what it meant for that or is that something that came out later like wait a minute it's a legit study they use that to be what we use to filter ourselves through I mean like think about that right I mean in terms of using that\nI'll be honest with you or my always my press was my thought process was thought process was or how is the best\nIs African American history us as Africa at us as as a black men and women are\nAmericans is his credit cater to slavery and all the justices in\nAnd all of the suffering in all of this uh we have to know enduring in break down doors and these walls that we had to ask what African Americans is is so when you're putting\nThe students through three again you're sitting in his class and you have mixed emotions listening to the ... story\nAnd you have mixed emotions about the classmates who you're going through the campus now when you're leaving African American studies corps learning about history and things that\nShouldn't be continue to be brought up in a negative light\nSo that we're not being talked a positive thing they're not doing anything like that it's just a horse that there's this guy and to give us grades for so we can keep on it'll just be able to get so that they can make billions of dollars that's the point of it\nYeah no you're right were shot in the camps for North Carolina star MBA first big author of plantation education exploitation of the modern modern day student avid you aren't going to eat the enforcement NBC Sports where the I've been following this\nRyan Bowen case I'm sure you've been following it as well and look I Believe all these major programs are dirtier than dirty I think these guys get paid I think it happens to sneaker companies are involved call me a skeptic I don't buy into legit recruiting that's just me were shot the fact is are you surprised that here we are months upon months later\nAnd really no serious heads rolled guys continue to bring in top five recruiting classes assistant coaches whose hands are dirty and they've been mentioned in this case they get head coaching job that you're surprised that it has been busted the door down more than college athletics especially basketball\nYeah I'm a I'm not surprised at all because I I'm not a big enough the names of picked down the door and the more you know I was a big enough named to bring enough light to have everyone starts to scatter\nAnd start to cover their tracks and made sure that they they don't have any evidence of anything else all all the programs are put on or North Carolina when they're in a very big Asian so now everyone is cover their tracks\nIt's about how we're going to make money when we all know what we're all doing\nSo now the agents or are in on it and now you can allow you know these kids that come out of high school and go straight to the pros or have agents and all that these are these that that they have to do they have to be there to cover their tracks or otherwise there's no money's would be made these days are just going to go straight to the pros\nNoticed signs get the facts\nSometimes at temple idea can be developed into something big back and

to be accurate game came on and off the at the Milwaukee\nBrewers hold on by the skin or they're the six five the Dodgers made it interesting down the stretch it was a [noise] six to one game heading to the eighth inning Dodgers get three runs and many Machado driving in a couple\nDodgers get a run in the ninth fitting in as well\nAs Taylor hits a triple a deep bright scoring ... Peterson runner on third with Justin Turner he strikes out against ... and that wraps it up but uh even in a when a lot of controversy for credit council\nSean how this geo Gonzales a real good starter got to start\nPitches two innings gives up the Machado home run it's the only hit he gives up I mean did walk about or to Billy pitch to weddings water comes in pictures to innings\nHater comes in and I hate or is the best guy in the bullpen he throws forty six pitches the most he's thrown all year throws three innings up for coming in and the fifth inning\nMe was this overused because to me I'm looking at this I'm thinking why is Josh eight or eight in the fifth inning beef throwing three innings\nAnd why did ... only go to a ... why didn't wardrobe who was absolutely dominant not just\nWith his bat hitting a home run off quaint and ... but he goes to innings doesn't allow a hit doesn't allow a walk strikes out for only throws twenty seven pitches in those two innings\nAnd yet I guess ... council by his little book has to go to the book and I guess his book says bringing Josh hater if you look in dollars go three you'll let water of those three you're bringing hater for two you can able for that nine doesn't that make more sense or at least what good does go on to list there's real trouble there\nAre a hundred percent agree with Joe ... dollars could give you another ... he's a starter I he could definitely put together and he wasn't terrible\nI don't understand though what [noise] what I don't\nGet is is like to me the whole point is\nWhy is it that we put a ... innings restriction on the starting pitcher okay now maybe you don't want to go a third time through the the the line up the way that uh you know of woods with Dave Robert she doesn't want what's what's go you know whatever three innings\nPart of the third time through the rotation okay pecking at least by your five innings right I I just don't understand this whole strategy of geo ...\nWho's a pretty good starters he's had some big years pitch well down the stretch from the trade deadline when he got shipped to Milwaukee made five good start for the brewers like why are you now looking at him as if he is a relief pitcher you know that doesn't make sense to me why are you looking at him as if he's a relief pitcher\nAlright what did he do in this game right\nHe uh you know first any yet the three guys out with the strike out strikes out the Taylor second second any gives a mug shot a home run in campgrounds out does walk Hernandez Belgium flies out ... grounds out the third and after that you just take him out because it gives up one run on one hits\nTotally ridiculous to me especially when you have a bullpen and you have a weapon what like Josh hater who you're going to need more than this game Josh later as of right now will not pitched more because there's no way up to throwing forty seven bitches and three innings tonight that he's going to pitch tomorrow and when you have what might we on the mound starting\nTo use the same strategy when you've used would refer to innings hater for three innings I mean are you not without now you can ask you started to give you more than two winning shot doesn't make an ounce of sense to me unless he intends to just completely use that as bullpen before the series shifts to Los Angeles\nYeah it it it's going to be one one that's my prediction because of the way council used his relief pitchers in this game one one going back to LA and that's not good for for Milwaukee because now the Dodgers have home field and that's what they want they want to steal one in Milwaukee\nAnd I'm predicting they're going to win game to tomorrow four o'clock eastern no way you don't want to give you more than any I don't even think will give you any who I think council could use it for an inning but who knows some ... you know I I I don't know\nDon't forget the formats to three to Sean so if the\nI did a game of peace technically this series may not come come back to walk you know I don't think the Dodgers when three games that are on home for total games in a row but the fact is with the two three two format\nYou kind of want to be up to nothing going the Los Angeles because\nIf it goes by games at home then you know you might come back to Milwaukee down three to\nYou don't want to send it on the road to Los Angeles where the Dodgers literally mathematically have a chance to win the series without coming back yeah I understand that you want to win game on you know and and you knock out her short early and that's great you get the best the best out of the way I get it\nBut this over managing to a point is just it's mind boggling to me it it really is mind boggling to me and the whole thing with ... I mean the more I think about it the more I think to myself\nI don't understand it I get look this isn't Sergio Romo getting the start the way that a Kevin Cash in Tampa Bay would do it right he would legitimately start a reliever to start the game you know that really was not going to give you more than a handful of innings 'cause he's\nYou know a starter I mean reliever\nGeo Gonzales has Eighteen hundred innings under his belt Eighteen hundred he's thirty three\nThis is a guy who was started three hundred and seven major league games and six postseason five postseason games\nComing into this one he's won almost a hundred and thirty major league games he's been a very good player\nThroughout his career one Twenty one games in one year and you're telling me that this guy can't be stretched out more than two innings or that he's capable of pitching to the line up one more time passed what eight batters totally unacceptable to me frankly ridiculous\nAnd for me you know look credit counselors lucky walked away it's a winning this one\nBut I and it's hard for me to root for a guy who over manages to this extent really is said to say it can't be ruined from Nick among the Dodger bandwagon with your nominee\nYou've added media until I got into a car so then I'm a former Milwaukee but Ron Paul right Scott ... from overtime joins us next going the dirty dozen picks week number

were overpriced over designed and out of touch at Harry's our approach is simple here's our secret\nWe make sharp terrible blades and sell them it honest prices for lower two dollars each we care about quality so much that we do some crazy things like by a world class German blade factory obsessing over every detail means we're confident in offering a hundred percent quality guarantee millions

waited handle shaved Joe and a travel cover all for just three bucks plus free shipping\nA dangerous position for West Virginia to be in Ames is actually a pretty difficult place to place it's actually in a nice atmosphere like we just mentioned that\nLSD was not a nice atmosphere so six and a half on the road for West Virginia even though they are the better team that I was states it is a scary trap atmosphere but here's what I'm more comfortable doing\nI think this game goes over the fifty six and a half in fact that number has gone up throughout the week because people understand that this is going to be a high scoring affair last week West Virginia should have had three or four more touchdowns will Greer turn the ball over four times set is very uncharacteristic\nOf the type of quarterback that he is I think he corrects those mistakes West Virginia and Iowa State in a shootout Steve ... over fifty six and a half [noise] All right my second college game this big tent one is talking to me\nAnd I'm Wondering why is Michigan uh ten point favorite over Wisconsin I said the big house I get it\nMichigan put up ... points against crappy teams so against the best team they play they put up not a lot now\nSeventeen points against the half decent team they played which was northwestern in half decent maybe fitting and it was at Northwestern rule what a tough place to fly Michigan put up twenty and barely won\nYou're telling me I think it was God's is overrated your Tommy Michigan ten points better than Wisconsin non not buying that 'cause I think Michigan is often is highly overrated I'm going with Johnson plucked end\nAt the big house and the Wolverine Scott your third college selection [noise]\nThis one very weird to me because Washington plays Oregon in Eugene\nAnd often stadium that crowd he saw how high they got up for that stand for game but this is a three thirty eastern time kickoff which means than it is a twelve thirty kick off\nFrom Austin stadium I don't think that that stadium's gonna be full when they kick off because I'm not sure the fans are going to get ready for a twelve thirty kicked on there I used to that in the past twelve\nAnd so therefore I Am not afraid of lame points with a road favorite I'm actually going to take the better team in this one and the better team is Washington this is a huge rivalry that a lot of people don't understand\nWashington versus Oregon is more of a rivalry in Washington Washington state Oregon Oregon State these schools are very close to each other the alumni base is very close because you got all the people working in Seattle and whatnot I think that this is a very important game for both schools I'll go with the better team in the Washington\nOught to be so I went to spread that won three and a half by Washington and a three and a half points favorites over for a job and All right my final college selection this one I go to the state of South Carolina\nGame Cox will must champ never been a big fan I like what jumbo fishers done at tax and paying them I like Kelly ...\nMaybe it's better than I thought I was born to I didn't expect you to turn this around and he has to appoint already and I think in a couple of years he'll be the guy in the DC west competing with the been\nZeroed favorite of South Carolina but it's not a big favorite two and a half points I think that paying them is better than three points over South Carolina and if that's the case how can I go against two and a half point spread take Texas saying um mind is two and a half\nOver South Carolina and those are our three college picks jaw at Scott and interesting weekend in the NFL is eleven games are decided by three points or less in terms of spread your first your first then about ... [noise]\nI'm going to go with the high spread and I'm going to take the bones or dog then the Broncos are at home hosting Los Angeles rams key word there Los Angeles\n[noise] rams\nThere's gonna be snow in Denver we're having our first snow day folks let's enjoy it the first snow game of the season about two to three inches expected in Denver so snow on the ground [noise]\nThe Denver Broncos mile high and you're giving me seven points the rams are the best team in the NFL but I'm going to take the whole motor dog\nThe snow\nAnd give me the Broncos plus\nThe [noise]\nI actually you know what\nI'm going to go with that game as well [noise]\nThe way that we disagreed with our first college peck\nUnderstand there's going to be snowing in Los Angeles ram\nYou got a girl you could run the get the Broncos to run the football with Lindsay and Freeman if he plays but the fact is I watch them bronco seem against the jets and the jets looked like Super Bowl winners case keen interest isn't good by the way you know to some of your case Kim Scott\nWhen he walks rent don't walk around like you know ... [noise]\nHe realized that\nShoulders up as he looks like a girl like known that gets the strangest thing that's when you watch to see the highlights watch case keep them on assignment he has no net [noise]\nI think the Broncos are hideous I think the rams are just that much better regardless of the conditions I Know the rams run defense has not been good in a dime against you talked about it but my goodness if there's any defensive coordinator that's going to make adjustments just wait until I'm going to high spend rams won is stepping over the Broncos your second and about ... [noise]\nThis is a I got some friends and courtesy of a good buddy RJ bell pregame dot com\nWhen you have an NFL team\nSince two thousand and two that is on the days for more of rest\nThey are sixty and twenty two against the spread the Chicago Bears have\nBone of [noise] and they had to Miami\nDrew Ryan tannahill three and a half points does not scare me the bears go in the Miami and they read the dolphin easily outlays are three and a half points with the ...\nI like that one man has ... Mac made a huge difference on that the ban so I'm going to do with the gene that we both grew first got and I understand the jets [noise]\nDon't seem to ever be able to win two games in a row for something tells me that is going to change and maybe it's because\nThey're facing McCall also not good\nAnd I know Andrew Luck and thrown for a lot of yard here and there are still a great last weekend do the cause of the whole just not a very good team I think the jets and resort back to the letter Williams Leonard Williams bank job as the crow well paying job [noise]\nI like what Darnell did I like his confidence level he's found ... give me the jets warm and a half point old favorites over look cold [noise] your final NFL pick Scott [noise]\nNow this is [noise]\nI'm gonna be bold here\nThe New England patriots hosting the bones defeated Kansas City in New England is eight\nThat is a big\nYeah everything will tell you that the patriots have no reason being three and a half point favorites against the Kansas City chiefs however\nAs my Greece from ESPN Boston points out\nSince two thousand and one [noise]\nPlaying at New England would they quarterback younger than twenty five years old [noise] genes are zero and twenty three\nYear old twins and twenty three losses since two thousand and one what does that mean that means that build bell checks complex deep into the teams are too confusing for a young quarterbacks that don't have too much NFL Experience I think the patriots who are getting healthier and\nJust look so good op ed somebody with ... which was Edelman Edelman back and with Josh Gordon getting more and more rapidly more and more snapped showing the show is they were running\nRats [noise] I'm taking the patriots and I'm laying these points to pass the chiefs of some they might football [noise] by\nMy final selection is the Jacksonville Jaguars coming up and ugly loss to well the chiefs\nPlay morals was awful everything about the game stumped for the jak\nI don't see them thinking back to back games the cowboys are just awful terribly coached terrible up and\nMark is Lawrence battling injuries I you know they had that a van ... kid who seems pretty good but Sean leaves out till October twenty first or something [noise] jaguars three point favorites in this one jaguars going to win this one double digits may will dominate the Dallas

by me going out and picking up management shot on the rich get richer offensively\nThey're going to be that good all the time but if you've gone back and listen to what I've said with the show I said all this simply means\nDuring the playoff time says the Dodgers little score a little bit more on this but instead of losing six to three or six to for like they were going to you add Machado when you're going to lose six to five and I'll be damned that's a score rehab in game one as they lose six defy because what they do not have\nDespite what others may think is starting pitching as we welcome you in again to NBC Sports radio now you can be a I don't know nuts for Clinton ... oh you want and beating in Atlanta Braves sub par team that won a very bad division\nIs not like playing the Milwaukee Brewers Clinton curse shy\nLooks more like the quaint and courage job that we have seen one or two good outings does not cure\nA career oppose season it was and he reverted what he is is the equivalent of you know the guy who is kind of going through rehab you you let them out or for the the first weekend or so he does okay that second weekend a couple of his buddies pick him up he goes out of TJ and he's done\nAnd that's really what it was his first shot fell off the I can pitch in postseason wagons something fears and we saw it out there on the field now his defense minor didn't play too great either however\nThat's not the reason and that's not the difference in the game he still gave up for runs in a very short outing\nThey Roberts decided to pull him so he can use him great they gave me a little bit more of that later on during the season and they're in a series which could be a short series if we continue to see what we have eight five five three two three four NBC\nIs the number not only that woody Mr wonder if those yard you know it's the first time ever that a starting left handed pitcher in the post season has taken another starting left handed pitcher in the postseason deep yeah couldn't believe that until I had heard that\nFrom a couple of very talented broadcasters on the drive in a lefty taken a lefty deep in a game yes south ... South Park and the post season\nSo ... has another reason to go down in history as the brewers are up one games to none and Dodger fans and Dodger apologies can look forward to and saying well Milwaukee used a lot of their bullpen\nThey could use a lot of their bullpen and bounce back tomorrow it doesn't mean they're depleted\nBy all means what it means is your best starting pitcher just went out and he showed up at\nSo who do you follow that up with an general you rich hell I don't know\nThen again that's why they play the game so I guess they have as good a chance of any but it really let's let's face it all this National League championship series is as for the right to get throttle most likely swept in the world series\nWas talking with a buddy the other day or the final four gets here you know what to say you always have half of the bracket that's really good that you got like North Carolina in ...\nRight you have like do in Kansas oh Jesus looking at ... whoever wins that oh God they got the winner of you know what you know this National League championship series is\nUh the Dodgers are like Marquette is what they are and the Milwaukee Brewers are like Louisville who the hell is going to pick Louisville um our cat winter to beat Duke\nCarolina winner right to be Kansas in Kentucky winter then again stranger things have happened just not in my forty six years on this earth eight five five three two three\nFour NBC is the number of special to those of you that are driving listening on serious acts and satellite radio channel to zero five\nMy favorite way to listen satellite radio as well you can take us with you nationwide coast to coast channel two oh five always stays the same\nWhether it's in a chili upstate New York or in a rainy Southern California love it too because it looks like Seattle outside my kind of weather outside as a trench will downpour but I had to make sure I took side streets here to work because they don't dare to get on the freeways with these crappy Southern California drivers eight five five\nThree two three four and B.

bell um why do I get the feeling that despite Cincinnati being appointed have favorite Cincinnati really needs to win this game to prove that you know the little brother can finally hang with big brother\nI don't question since I just wanted to stay in their home and as you mentioned bell storm out there the reports are open back after by week which is for Pittsburgh after his game\nThe dealers have been a big boy and his vision for which what feels like forever and so if you think all that's nice to be dissolved\nAnd you'd be coal Atlanta and everybody that that's great\nYou could

even if you are or Windsor ...\nAnd I think you don't want to look over the border to feel to find a way that if the bank or when the Bengals come coup and a half games out of Pittsburgh\nAnd all of a sudden you say these are tending to go to class and leave Pittsburgh really in a little bit whoever wins this game and in my opinion is the clear favorite going in the days and if you're the bangles there's so much psychological stuff that goes along with this cancer it's an enormous cocker\n... dot com or weekly contributors with us on NBC Sports radio ah I don't like the chargers even though there are three into San Diego\nAt Cleveland's near picked him to where the browns are actually a point favorite you know what that sounds about right to me I like Cleveland in Cleveland could have a couple more jobs than they do\nI conclude hunt as well I just never know what I'm getting with car\nI the chargers head games where they play like a Super Bowl the chargers also have games or you wonder how in God's green earth they're not calling for an area where the carnival over and they then they pay me dumb decisions on the sidelines like I don't believe in the browns because I don't put your taxes\nBut I Believe that the browns are a lot better I Believe that they can make those who are really the player and a sleek and I think that the census legitimate\nOr if the game was in Los Angeles I Would take LA but it's not it's in Cleveland ... matter ... bill mostly across the country they play in an earlier when the game I Do believe that kind of stuff I can get ... involved a lot\nI wouldn't be shocked starts with on the owners office out of this year and the chief around\nBut I don't trust the chargers in these types of game gains over the course sober career\nThey find some asinine widows and then everybody syndrome lucky and everybody rights at all when in reality it look as if it happens all the time so I'm lucky it's just not that good and the chargers book called talented and it's not always been consistent\n... with us on NBC Sports radio All right let's venture across the pond where it should be raining which I like it could favor my Seahawks taking on the raiders I mean two teams that are a combine three and seven uh right now and I say to see your honesty right where I thought they'd be\nOK the raiders are certainly a disappointment let's say you about this one\nI think you'll see hawks are going to win this game and they're going to win by a couple of scores I I was very impressed by Seattle that surrounds it off at the end of the day it looks as an orange shirt got away does matter but they\nThey played very well in that game and I expect Seattle I I like towels approach you get there early getting acclimated meanwhile the raiders or basic flying in there that they play the game I think that really benefits\nThe Seahawks I think they know what you're doing group has shown no go there you know he's going to hear and ultimately\nI sound better I woke up from a political carts point you know they can run off on the sea hawks defense is certainly the or in their past my God it is better or the raiders of the field I think Seattle is going to win the raiders paid a hundred million dollars for\nA guy that they do they turn the franchise round and thoroughly go even see for early returns have been very very under while\nOther games that I'm kinda torn either way to go on and you want to believe in the bears a dream one I don't know what I Want to think that Miami's a little bit better uh I'm going to go the dolphins at home\nOn this one I don't know man you I'm just thinking because the bears want to get out of that cold weather re random probably down in South beach right now doing stuff that they shouldn't be doing that they hope doesn't get put out there in the winter I mean that's the only reason I'm going to go with the my logic you like it\nHas its air or my my thought on that game and if I was a betting man I Would talk because I think the better\nI think there's often to for gold but also the everybody's going crazy over there it had a ... a week since he played the box a couple of weeks back and everybody remembers ... six bucks to have a law that was an impressive game\nIs an awful for the\nVast majority of his career before that I can never be able to see just can't throw a ball the ethical thing is one of the game on that land and we will be free you know the whole thing is a great quarterback and they're going to win Thirteen games\nI I just this is the core last game where he was like ten of thirty three\nAnd the bears were ten nine and ... All right facts meant for previous so I stay away from I pick the bears neutered defense is so good they might win the game as a child\nBut I I Would have thought that I think a lot of different directions\nHey you're Kansas City chiefs so we have a tweet\nLooks like Karen\nHas tweeted and ... says she's picking the patriots to meet the chief says Kansas City has to show me something I mean look come on and this could be like the opening game last you remember when you cheat split the beat down\nOn and mom sold on the chiefs I think the cheese are better than the rams are we loved Iran's to take a look at who the rams a beat I mean my God my Seahawks almost beat him and that's at flat out embarrassing man I like the chiefs to witness came despite the fact they're getting three and a half\nDo too and to be honest normally when it comes to Kansas City I'm pessimistic because I was Thirty years a lot of pain that that franchise filed for Central Park\nAnd I really I mean I I've been going on is going to score thirty five points I\nThought I I think Kansas City is a nightmare for like a New England defense is the slowest NFL they can't move they can't cover ... why they want to play the game and the phone booth and Kansas City there one thing about\nTheir fat they're fast everywhere\nAnd read is going to stretch them out horizontally construction out or he's gonna make noise but I have to cover all the field\nAnd the whole says the devastating one guy got no and in this game I don't care how knowing one place I don't go to the point man on not so does matter either seafood in ... I didn't have a huge game in Prague house he's got the game\nOf like it's going to matter because I I really think this is the kind of game where Kansas City my role forty five ... five hundred and fifty yards I I don't think ... and the ability to stop or as a right to the game a day or in a dominant position on CBS [laughter]\n... sided dot com has\nBeen our guest many we appreciate you for joining us and you know I'm kind of looking at some of these other games and then nothing I really feel like talking about so if I Do I think all I think all text you\nYour great local high school or just am Thirteen twenty that when you as a jar Wisconsin Rapids if it was twenty four hour information for\nCBS News update hurricane Michael's now blamed for at least sixteen death set it's fear that number will rise rescuers are searching for more victims in Florida's panhandle while people in Virginia and the Carolinas are dealing with flooding branded Bryant was that a swamp the trailer park and sell them village Virginia some of\nThe people that live here than ever start\nFor their home is CBS\nNews correspond injury can Duncan is in Florida\nHurricane Michael cutter destructive path through Panama City hundreds of utility workers are now you're ready to restore power\nWe were able to get out and drive around a little bit\nAs some of the damage we think we're just not only that but\nThe debris in this neighborhood stopped crews from reaching a gas line that ruptured during the height of the storm [noise] day wary residents literally held their breath or gas company repairman kept elite the IRS\nStorm victims will get a grace period before having to file some tax returns and payments CBS News update on\nThat here's your forecast from the weather I weather center clear skies overnight with Lowes around twenty that when one of the southwest around five miles per hour tomorrow tied around fifty chance for scattered showers tomorrow night low to\nDown to about thirty six over capsized temperatures well below average Sunday and Monday with high for the upper thirties to those oh forty is mixed precipitation ... times Sunday\nFrom the weather all the weather's better I mean the wrong with you Jennifer cheap skier\nI Want to change some things I Want to help our kids graduate from high school I Want more of my neighbors have changed when I see around the United way as creating real lasting\nChange where you live by focusing on the building blocks of a better life education income and I just kind of more miles on my side you advocate volunteer live United for more visits United Way of living and I did that on the United way and the outcome\n\n[noise]\n\nSports radio we [noise] mostly [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nOr you go that game and the third inning and the\nOr to go on and add a few more they lead this game six to one Dodgers made a game of good but fall six till five as gay one goes to Milwaukee in Milwaukee\nAnd the and I'll see as is often running as we await the A.

with mark my words the brewers are not not the Atlanta Braves you just don't know about Milwaukee because there are a small market team and they're in middle America there in the\nNation's dairy land which Wisconsin's awesome by the way if you've not had the chance to get there and eat the cheese curds I highly recommend a day five five\nThree two three four and be she is the number some people refer to Wisconsin is fly over land they do just fly over stage fly right over on your way from the east coast the west coast so they don't pay a whole lot of mind and same thing with Houston\nWho has a very good shot of beating the red Sox the mighty mighty Red Sox I can assure you know the way the red Sox kind of played and toying around the last month because they had this division wrapped up\nAnd now the Astros boiled away because they needed to wrap their division up there is more than a handful of Red Sox fans that aren't too comfortable with us than coming in especially in Justin

raiders are certainly a disappointing and let's say you got this one\nI think you'll see hawks are going to win this game and they're going to win by a couple of scores I I was very impressed by Seattle that surrounds the last ... says on washers got away just about ... ...\nThey played very well in that game and I respect Seattle I I like cows approach you get there early getting acclimated

going to fear and ultimately\nI sell better Wilson's a much better for the carts point you know they can run the ball from the sea hawks defensive ... an hour or near my God it is better or the

I think he's going to have a huge game in ... these kinds of the game\nIt's going to matter because I I really think this is the kind of game where Kansas City my role forty five point five hundred and fifty yards I I don't think ... and the ability to stop or has a right to the games are they are in the dominant position for the one the man\n... dot com has been our guest Matty we appreciate you for joining us and you know I'm kind of looking at some of these other games and then nothing I really feel like talking about so if I Do I think all I think all text you\nOkay so we'll do all that that's actually the one question I Need to know in in ten seconds here how bad is Washington meet Oregon tomorrow by I Know you're not a college football guy but you better give me a good number I'm not going to have you on any more\nMorning is am Thirteen twenty W ... char Wisconsin Rapids\nWeekday mornings at five AM CBS News updates the damage left by hurricane Michael in Mexico Beach Florida is overwhelming the storm was one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds shredded homes that have fourteen foot storm surge bulldozed everything in its path CBS News correspondent ... is there [noise]\nIt's not only clean up clean out at the top priority here in Mexico beach these crews are moving out of the way the blocking one of the main road in and out of the city and they're clearing it for foreigners and emergency crews and it's\nNot just Florida that got hit by Michael's rats I'm Jim Crow still in Greensboro North Carolina the trade damage from Michael is so massive utility companies are warning it could be early to mid next week\nBefore all of the power is restored across the southeast hundreds of thousands remain without electricity and Florida Alabama Georgia the Carolinas and Virginia\nHundreds of out of state utility crews have been brought in to help Michael is being blamed for sixteen deaths so far CBS News updates on\nMarriage or for gas from the weather I weather center Greenstein overnight with those around twenty that brings out of the five laps around five miles per hour Monteith around the chance for scattered showers tomorrow night blow to balance\nIt out there you go back over a campfire temperatures well below average from being on Monday with heights in the upper thirties forties make for the Haitian pop like time some guy\nFrom the weather our genes either center I'm wrong with you Jennifer for cheap ski\nAnd it may be hard to believe or people just like you were already saving money the the big dot org makes it easy they're simple savings plan\nTeaches you how to start saving without going overboard so you don't need to sell all your belongings and living a commune please don't read it along to all of us now you don't need to get a second job [noise]\nYou just feed the big\nDot org don't get left behind get tips and tools that feed the God or brought you by the American Institute of CPAs and the ad council\n[noise]\n\n\nAn NBC Sports radio we\nThrow away [noise]\n\nAnd I try\n\n\nThere you go that game\nAnd the third inning and the brewers would go on and add a few more they lead this game six to one Dodgers made a game of it but for six till five as gay one goes to Milwaukee in Milwaukee\nAnd the you know see as is often running as we await the A.

C. is the number some people refer to Wisconsin is fly over land they do just fly over stage fly right over on your way from the east coast of the west coast they don't pay a whole lot of mind and same\nThing with Houston who has a very good shot of beating the red Sox the mighty mighty Red Sox I can assure you know the way the red Sox kind of played and toying around the last month because they have this division wrapped up\nAnd now the Astros pulled away because they needed to wrap their division up there is more than a handful of red\nSox fans that aren't too comfortable with Houston coming in especially in Justin Vernon lander who's\nBeen better than Chris Sale in the postseason us farming known throughout his career he has I mean that's that's a fact she has not been bad the David Price as\nAnd backing up Justin Vernon either get Garret coal Dallas ... colors I mean Charlene Morton number five star for Houston\nCould be a number one starter for about eighty percent of the big leagues and the numbers little warning to Charlie morning yeah they got used to hang around Pittsburgh nobody cared about so let's go from another yeah market team to a different in that market team all they did is Dr\nLeft one location gone to another and he's got to be in the right situation to have the rights of coaching the right people around you a lot of different things that can make or break you\nCan derail you or have you where you need to be a five five three two three four and a B C ... game two of the Dodgers ... before we have in primetime game where the Astros at a Red Sox from\nFenway Park that come your way on Saturday and of course college football on the slate if you want to talk that will get more into the match ups here shortly as far as what stands out on paper I mean there is\nFor I think really good watch a ball games but to awesome games the strange thing is in college football\nYou like them staggered how hard is that right no not at all let's put them all the same time\nAnd if you're a college football fan you know it's time I'm referring to on Saturday that'd be three thirty eastern or you're eight o'clock primetime games you're three thirty eastern game\nYou have the Georgia Bulldogs taking on the LSU Tigers\nHeading down to the by you or Georgia is a seven point favorite in Baton Rouge parish and I like when I seen out of Georgia and their quarterback Jake from a man\n... kids what six in one I Believe to start or on the road this year of his games late at night there's something special about the magic down there and the air and LA shoe but it's not right smack dab in the middle of the day George Romney wins escape\nThen you have the a pact world champion to be determined up and Eugene between either Washington Oregon\nAs this game also a three thirty start time Washington a three and a half point favorite there's places is going to be allowed it's going to be proud Washington with the pro prospects in all time husky rushing leader miles gas\nSkin is Aaron fork at if you have not had a chance to watch them wares number two for Washington really a kid who took advantage of some other guys in front of them being hurt and the depth jar like hunter Bryant\nAnd folders made the most of his opportunity for head coach Chris Petersen Penn State and Michigan State Penn State's the two touchdowns favorite and it is at beaver stadium\nSo up there in happy valley I went to sleep on smarty no not a bad team three into those four but Thirteen points I don't know if I like that to Penn State doesn't rarely meet anybody\nBy Thirteen points less it's a much in fear or opponent which Michigan state's not they still have a lot of pride to be able to play for and as long as\nOf course they have mark Antonio's or had goats I like them Baylor in Texas also at three thirty and I was thinking\nI was just trying to watch the the Washington you dug game but it's it's going to be a sports bar day on Saturday to it's going to have to be a mid I'm and I'm going to go in there and get it early\nAnd I'm gonna have to tell these guys look I I Want one two three four all lined up now probably gonna be out numbered

the first question about ... you know I just it it's just like night and day from last year this year and I'm a I'm a proud of this team and I am so but I'm very proud to be a part of it\nBack to that issue of fight I mean one of the guys it's getting a lot of credit for the improved fight is the new GM John Dorsey and he's brought in players who have\nMore of that quality more of that fight have you noticed that some of the guys who have shown up because there's been significant turnover in the last year that those guys are bringing a different mindset in a different mentality this rubbing off on the players who are already there\nProbably of course you know uh but the new players that were were ... or ... workers you know they're they're they're doing a great job you know it was like a

I mean look here's the thing\nThe score was twenty four to six twenty had the fifty yard touchdown run to make it twenty four Thirteen I think that was it whenever it was whatever the score of the eagles at that point I thought you know what they could play a hundred and twenty minutes and the giants wouldn't score that many points even with say well I'm Barkley\nHow are you not it was thirty one to six when that happened it nevertheless it ... and then they didn't go for two what are they thinking there when you're down that far just keep going for two [laughter] take the show\nYeah that's true well I don't know how sure anything has with the giants at\nAnd and and look I I don't want to jump on patch or um or here but let me jump on a patch or just because he coordinated a Vikings off on a team that was driven largely by defense last year and the offense wasn't horrible\nAt that qualifies him for another chance to be a head coach how did he become like locked in as the guy with the giants because\nShouldn't your entire off sense be premised upon featuring say corn bark labor chance you can get hit two hundred and and uh twenty nine yards from scrimmage last night and I didn't get the impression that they were trying to feature him\nHe should be touching the ball on every play just say corn here sick one ticket sake one go throw the sake one split say corn out

and Peyton Manning in the same half of the same game and that sparked a debate earlier\nThis week that we revisited on Thursday it started on Wednesday with Chris Sims and spilled into the next day the idea of ... Drew Brees being a top ten guy and possibly a top\nFive guy and Peter here's my premise when I look at the all time great quarterbacks I combine statistical achievement with winning championships breeze has a Super Bowl titles ... Super Bowl and BP award and he holds\nEvery important record and eventually will have the last one which is passing touchdown he and he and Tom Brady may do it Steve Carlton Nolan Ryan type thing where they go back and forth with the all time touchdown record coming up here in a year or so\nBut I think ... are going to retire with all of those records he's had five five thousand yards passing seasons the rest of the NFL in Ninety nine years combined has four\nAnd I look at Drew Brees now if you put Peyton Manning Tom Brady Joe Montana John Elway and the top five no particular order and you leave a spot open either you can make a very strong argument\nThat Drew Brees as a top five guy I think he's definitely a top ten guy what are your thoughts on where it Drew Brees ranks all the time\nI think he's the top ten guy might but I I disagree\nWith you in in this regard the NFL wasn't invented Thirty years ago um you know\nI agree the NFL in ... years ago\nAnd [noise] yeah\nAnd I think that what happens when you when you look at things like this is that you start looking at numbers and you get drunk with the numbers basically\nAnd in my opinion obviously nobody is going to come close to to his numbers you know I was thinking about this the other day ... when I was ... you know basically really into football like my college years and and and and my high school years college years early\nOn in my professional career time passing\nHeritage record with forty seven thousand and three yards\nAnd every single year since then\nThat that that yard in direct Kurd has ... be done to look shrimp like so in other words what do the numbers really mean and I think you have to look at guys and how they dominated their era in my opinion\nI Would have Tom Brady number one I Would have auto Bram number two auto Graham played in the NFL for ten every played professional football six years in the NFL for years in the AFC which was basically an early AFL\nHe led his team to the championship game all ten seasons\nOne for passing titles and seven NFL and AFC championships\nIn my opinion and in those days guys left the game not because they couldn't play anymore but because they had other things to do in life pro football wasn't pro football you know so in my opinion do you have to do that low I put breezed in my top ten\nWhere he belongs and I think it would probably be some time it was somewhere around seven or eight [noise] uh but I think that he belongs I just think in my opinion even pay homage to the old days which is what I Would do in my top ten\nYeah and look I don't disagree with that concept that does make it hard to draw apples to apples comparison because of the changes to the game I guess John United says the name that would jump out at me as a guy that number one achieved significant things at a time when the passing rules weren't\nAs configured toward authentic explosion as they are today the fact that United says record\nOf I think it was forty eight or forty nine straight games with a touchdown pass lasted as long as it did\nIs is a testament to how hard it was to set it in the first place in in the days when you get the receiver all the way down the field until the ball was in the air you can slammed them into the dark you lay on top of him\nAnd John United still had touchdown passes in that many consecutive games and I'd love to see what a guy like tonight is would do in today's NFL but again I look at the stats I look at the numbers I look at how Drew Brees has been a a yard age and touchdown machine for so long and\nReasons why Drew Brees gets it gets less credit\nWhen we look at the all time list and maybe he should he the third best guy of his time and it's hard to view him as a top five guy all the time or even a top ten guy all the time when he's number three behind Tom Brady and Peyton Manning during the bulk of his career ... break we had more to come here on the best of pro football talk live on NBC Sports radio [noise]\nCash them morning magazine through friday there\n\nOne that was very drawn your NBC Sports radio update\nIn Milwaukee the players they get more to the national league championship series six five over the Dodgers\nDodgers actually led to this game one nothing from Milwaukee scored six on answer Dodgers came back with foreign answered of their own But Justin ... who had the golden some prayer oh is he struck out four times in an old for five performance that indeed you're gay Lorenzo came and while he was three for five\nBetting in the lead on the spot and Chris she she struck out three times going over for for the possible\nAnd el MVP seven pictures used in all of the big story brand new ... picture took Clayton ... deep\nAs Kurt shots of the loss for the Dodgers meanwhile the NHL was off and justice wins all the NBA he signs with the Miami Heat for three years it's M.

since ... allow people to go out and drop like a Baker may feel who's\nYou know probably six states moron and not be afraid to go after a short of quarterbacks I mean just says impacts around a league and what he's been able to do but once again my you know if it's weird to sit here and and see that Drew Brees that came in and use the costs interception and and the guy that was so serious and\nAnd just so focused he'll become I think like us like we talked about one of the top ... quarterback\nThe ball or if you were playing for the New York giants right now and ... back in ... junior walked in the locker room after that that debacle that we saw on Sunday and we all agreed if we don't agree completely on everything but one thing we all agreed on that was a bizarre\nWeird interview and he said things he shouldn't have said what would you say to him in the locker room if you were a plane safety for the giants right now\nThe one thing that I Would have done is first before he even to grab about eight or nine veteran players\nAnd we would have told them to the side and we would have women to a room and we would at an open discussion and that would include it that way included the manning that open discussion and wonder what gave him an opportunity to explain himself the one thing about it is I don't care who you are when you get surrounded by a bunch of different personalities and your teammates\nAnd we want to hold you accountable you had a brain that you've got to tell the truth he got his own up to what you said and if there is an issue we need to rectify that situation right there but\nYou know I Would have told them straight up if you've got a problem with me you know we can handle it\nYou know for the wave power the way you want to handle it because it's serious man you're going to work with somebody every single day you trust this guy is your brother that he has your back you don't want anyone going on interviews kind of back stabbing you and and talking about you know the team\nThe problem that I have with oh they'll what he said it was very very true but you don't do that because you isolate yourself as being better than everyone else especially when you coming off\nYou know get that sixty five million dollar contract anything that you say about your team it has to be inclusive of what you're thinking about yourself and ways that you can help and improve this team so to me\nYou know he he thinks that he's really motivated team at the end of the day he still lost you also football game and you lost a lot of respect the locker room I don't care what anybody says\nThe thing that the standard me the most twenties asked are you happy in New York he says that's a tough question you just signed a contract to stay in New York how is that a tough question and find a team made that's where I'm thinking wait a minute whoa whoa down do you really do you want to\nBe here or you wish you know what the that's the first thing I Want to resolve with him\n[noise] well I think we all know that he was about all day and you know it's always sitting here surprised that he's talking away talk\nYou know of course he puts out for them to say you know I'm\nA ... you know an all season I Will do everything I can hear you got to do everything you can and get paid but when adversity hit the first thing you want to do is do you want to point the finger at everyone else a true leader doesn't do that a true leader looked at himself versus say how can I improve how could become an asset to this team and and\nYou know I look at the leadership man when the giants they rate will win a Super Bowl has big strong personality like straight ahead and old seeing those guys\nBut they had tremendous leadership and everyone so busy kissing his butt in that locker room as opposed to holding them accountable say look man and letting the cause I'm getting in his face like do what's your problem and you need to\nYou know because I'm going to the coaches and coach I mean you know ... what are you going to do about the situation don't just sit here in front of the media but you need to hold this guy accountable we as players meet the whole this guy a accountable and in practice if he comes across the little give them a little\nBit higher [laughter]\nWe got a good one coming up on Sunday night the chiefs of five and go back to New England they won in New England last year to start the season surprised everyone they got a much better quarterback down Patrick bombs what do you think and the patriots have a couple of extra days to get ready for this one what do you think Bill Belichick does to try to take some of the steam out of the Kansas City often\nI don't know you know the mentality out there at times when you're facing a prolific all fences is kind of that then but don't break mentality\nThat I don't think that's going to be good enough because this is a big play offs and so I mean they have so many weapons the patriots have had problems defending tied and now they've got to deal with a unique skill set apart we kill\nThey got they got so many different games they have to deal with and I just don't think that this was something that bill can out scheme you know out scheme\nThe Kansas City chiefs because they have so much talent so I think they're going to have a hard time I'm just saying that there's also defensively I think there's going to be high scoring game and it turns out so which quarterback doesn't make the big mistake\nYou know reminds me a lot of the Peyton Manning Colts right where you you you just have to try to get into that blow out with them you're not going to shut them down and when when you were there that the defense was much better than it is now at least had a chance\nTo stop Peyton Manning from time to time but you know ... this is a far cry defensively from what you and title on the other guys were doing in New England I I think it makes it harder to uh to keep them under thirty or forty points\nYou you don't like and you bring up in just a interesting point because when we played against Peyton Manning those guys back in the day against those hot for for the officers you know what we do as yeah we had more tell it on our defense but we were forced to you guys the going ten or twelve fourteen plagiarize\nAnd once they get down and out the red zone to convert in a red zone and we had a really good read on the fact I Know that's what Bela check is really focusing on you're not going to be able to stop these guys were doing all the things that you know they want to do but\nFor someone to go ten twelve played lives and seeing the the young quarterback will not make a mistake to intercept just I think this past weekend and just seeing if he if he's going to make that Cuba state but if not then it's going to be a ... game it should be fun to watch\nShould be fun hey Rodney fun talking to you as always we'll see this weekend have very weak

Peter King what we're looking at is the coaches whose\nTenure depends on the outcome of the season whose tenure most depends on the outcome of the season you get the call the the ... coin toss in the air and then we'll make the ...\nHeads\nIt flips and it's in the air and now it's landed on towns hey it's not a rig today are\nHe has nothing to do with it but you should hate him anyway this is one of the rare occasions when I when the coin toss on a day when there is a clear number one guy who is already feeling the heat and had better turn it around soon or he may not be there after the by wake and that is Broncos coach\nVance Joseph I think John Elway the gym and the team\nSeriously considered firing Joseph after one season they had a lot of bad games last year a lot of ugly losses at one point I always said the team has gotten soft that's a direct reflection of the coach\nThis year they started to and they've lost three in a row they got the rams coming kind of actually I think they're going to beat the rams on Sunday but that doesn't mean Vance Joseph is gonna be the coach next year he needs to get on the right side of five hundred and stay there or he's going to be too and done with the Broncos\nUnlike any other coach his tenure most depends upon what happens the rest\nOf the way I\nTotally agree I Wish I had the first pick 'em because I Would have said the exact same thing and I agree with you I think the John Elway he's having some buyers' remorse now\nAh with Kyle Shanahan even though she and hands not going to have a good record in either of his first two years in San Francisco tease definitely more of a long term keep or at least right now than Vance Joseph ... all take Jason Garrett\nOr the cowboys are two and three oh you've got the ah owners saying I'm not going to second guess the coach and then he second guesses them I Believe after comma in the same sentence\nThat has to be quickest non second guess turned into a second guess in NFL ownership history Jerry Jones has another record to be very proud of\nBut that to me I think Jason Garrett he's gotta win nine in my opinion this here or to have a good chance I'm not saying I Will definitely be fired at eight but I think he's got to win nine to feel secure\nYeah I think he's got to be in the playoffs period or I think the Jerry Jones is getting closer and closer to the bottom that he reached back in two thousand two when he decided to go get Bill Parcells even if it meant handing the keys to par cells and Jones has been trying to build something on his own or at least be in position to claim credit for it\nAnd he likes the fact that Jason Garrett doesn't try to hog the spotlight he let Jerry be the guy I think the Jerry getting closer and closer to wanting a coach who will come in and take over and Jerry just gets out of the way\nBecause it's been twenty three years since the last time he got his hands on a fresh Lombardi trophy so I agree with you but I'm going to say it's even more important I think he's got to get to the play offs\nTo end up getting back for twenty Nineteen alright another guy and this one is fairly obvious it started off to an old for him just like it started off to do\nFor Vance Joseph in Denver that dark cutter and Tampa Bay he'd already be gone if Mark Davis the raiders owner hadn't trotted out a hundred million dollar contract for John group and that's where ... was going to go until Davis got him to go to the raiders and I think that a failure to make the playoffs affair to get on the right side of five hundred\nDark cutter is going to be gone from the buccaneers and he said it himself after that debacle against the bears should fire everyone including me well he's going to get his wish at some point between now and early January\n[noise] yeah I think uh my next pick is going to be Todd Bowles Mike I think that the the New York jets or you know have have basically kind of treading\nWater treading water overall after that first really good year with bowls\nAnd now that they've got this quarter back I don't even think that there is a number that Todd Bowles has to reach necessarily now he can't win six but I don't think there's necessarily a number or you got to get to the playoffs they have to end this season\nWith Sam Darnell than the last four or five weeks of this season looking like the no doubt\nQuarterback of a long term future for the jets not maybe too good games or to shaky games he's got to look really good and then they have to be able to say okay now that we've got a good coordinator in Bates we've\nGot an dynamic or you know off and potentially and we've got to suck blood head coach happen here the performance of the jets in this office is going to dictate the future Todd Bowles\nWe don't want to wear dynamics we've seen in recent years when a team gets a young\nQuarterback who shows franchise potential that doesn't necessarily secure the future of the coach Jeff Fisher got thrown out in LA when Jared golf with starting to show some promise when Seamus Winston had his first year lobbies Smith got fired at the end of it can ... and I got fired by the titans after the first year with Mario Mario to look the part I\nI just I if I see a sweet spot where and it won't be sweet for Todd Bowles Donald looks the part\nThat team it's five hundred and Christopher Johnson sees this as an opportunity to go out there and say I can make a significant upgrade because I can dangle that one thing that a coach wants and that is a franchise quarterback which enhances the chances of winning and I think that could make it very very dangerous\nBe in a spot where Donald looks great but the team isn't good enough and they could decide let's go find somebody else\nYeah I I my feeling\nAbout that and you know doesn't want to make a bold move\nEspecially because you tell me who's the next the guy who is Sean McVeigh dizzy higher John Phillip ... to come in to be the next Sean McVeigh or because that's Mike you know anybody who's got a young quarterback and they're only looking for one thing\nAnd that is showing McVeigh too that's it so you have to tell me who that guy is it might be ... um but but they're going to need to know right now that they're going to have an answer for this quarterback and and here's what I say\nIf Jeremy ... says the quarterback playing so well and they look good is an organization good as the team down the stretch I don't know why you'd make a change\n[noise] well and and that's really what it's going to come down to is there an upgrade out there that they think can take them to where they want to be especially as Tom Brady gets closer and closer to his inevitable retirement from the game\nPart in Cleveland huge

paint and you can join us for a survey\n[noise]\n\nGraduations Mueller is the one percent is that on\nMaybe see sports radio dot com\n\nFootball talk lived jak shock was one of the best quarterback from the NFL in twenty sixty two years later he is down at the bottom of all of the physical categories twenty fourth and yards was nine sixty one twenty ninth and yards per attempt\nPut six point six seven six point six seven not that long ago was pretty good now it gets you twenty ninth quarterback rating of eighty one point for that's twenty seventh completion percentage twenty eighth touchdown passes tied for twenty four it's what's going on with that Prescott trick hall of fame cowboys quarterback has a theory\nHe needs to be more accurate with the football I said for many years as long as I can ever remember when I'm asked hey what do you look for first in the quarterback the first thing I look for is accuracy\nBecause the rest of it doesn't matter doesn't matter how tough you are doesn't matter how smart you are what a great leader you are none of that stuff matters if you can't put the ball where you have to put it I've seen too many era throws in that regard and then there needs to be a little more anticipation weather's too deep safety is you're looking for somebody to take the middle of the field\nAnd that should be your first read if you have somebody who was taking the middle of the field versus those kind of looks I don't see great anticipation et cetera et cetera and Chris do you agree that accuracy is the end all be always the first thing is the only thing when it comes to quarterback\nPlay well it's certainly a huge factor yet so I mean uh I I Would say that towards the top of the list as far as evaluating quarterback play\nIn the pocket and and it's a clean pocket and you've got a place to throw the football I mean if you can't plays the place to football and the areas you'd like to as a quarterback\nAnd then you're in you're in big trouble and I I think it's a very fair assessment by Troy Aikman you know I think the first thing is you know he was duck Prescott was not as good in that two thousand sixteen is everybody else tried to make it out to be that was a historic running off and said did a lot of great things\nI think the league was kind of catching on to the run game and he got a lot of easy completion stopped that\nNow you know I think again you everyone gets the on the staff here where we're going to start a completion percentage\nUm [noise] you know the issue here but Troy Aikman ... at Troy Aikman is literally known for his accuracy throwing a football and to compare the stats from Nineteen Ninety two or Ninety three\nUh compared to now it's a it's different it's a different league altogether yes that is a huge issue with the Dallas Cowboys there's just too many throws on a weekly basis\nThat I'd go that should be a slam dunk NFL completion and he misses the throw all together and I do think at the point in Dallas where that has to be concerning now because this is becoming something consistent it's not like last year when we first saw we just that oh okay he's a little off there's issues here and there no I think between\nThe end of last year and what we've seen through the first five weeks this year there has to be adjustments to me to death Prescott throwing motion and his overall plan that position or he's in trouble and they might be looking for a quarter back at the end of the year how hard is it to make yourself more accurate or\nYou just naturally accurate or naturally an actor at or did you have to like work and work and work to become more accurate or less\nThan ... you know you have to work you have to work at it just like anything now some guys are gifted but more natural just God given ability that's when you hear me said the phrase is right by my he's a natural thrower right he's in that like you look at Baker may\nThrow the football exactly right and and you look at a guy like Baker may feel it just it doesn't matter what the ball the shape is whatever it is\nHe's the guy just can look you can grab it and pick it up and start firing\nAnd that's what I look for that Prescott not necessarily that all the way he has a nice motion\nBut yes there are little things that you have to stay on top of your mechanics\nTo improve your accuracy whether that's your foot work\nYou know the placement of your upper body and how you where you want to put your front shoulder towards the target all of those little things\nAnd that's what the great ones do I mean Tom Brady changes motion four years ago ... you've heard me say a million times Mike He throws the ball better now than he did it in two thousand eleven and twelve Drew Brees tinkers with this motion so\nI Do think doc is going to have to figure something out because it's just not good enough at this point\nAnd and you've mentioned changing the throwing motion I\nCannot be an easy thing to do I remember when Tim Tebow was entering the draft and there was all this talk about how he's changing his throwing motion because his his throwing motion was so bad and oh it's different it's different it's tighter he doesn't have the big wind up and then you go out and play and\nAnd years of muscle memory take over and you throw the ball like you all we did I Can't imagine how hard it would be to to change what his instinctive for a\nQuarterback yes you're right I I Would say Tam T. Bo is a different case just because he would be the guy that I Would say is not a natural thrower of any object he was being that I\nWould be a guy that I Would go which is really big and strong enough great athlete and they said play quarterback and he just made it happen because he was athletically gifted but I don't know if I Would put him in the natural throwing category\nA guy like deck press got has a net and enough natural throwing ability that you can tinker with some of the finer mechanics and not have to worry about reverting back I guess is what I'm saying like he's close

made the most strides since entering the NFL\nI'm\nJust a you know focusing on a block and I think for sure you know ah that that definitely progressed\nFrom last year and has been more consistent you know a ... have to find a way to uh be be a lot more consistent for my team and I I Believe I Would do so and I'm really excited for for the challenge ahead\nWhat are you noticing when you're out and about and the community from the folks in Cleveland the fans and they've been through a lot of bad football over the last Twenty years how different of an atmosphere or are you are experiencing when you go out\nUm it was a completely different atmosphere you know a A R fans you know where they trust the process you know a really good you got to keep a role in Oregon and I think we're a little bit okay\nAnd two two and a while you know a lot can happen to have been a lot of teams having around five hundred and five week then that end up doing great things what's the mindset in the locker room as to what you guys can be\n... you'll be anything we we want to be honest we uh our our my focus is just you know the idea was that week of a practice and you know again you know we we just want to take it one one of the time and a legal will be to sorry\nYou've played five games you've had three go to overtime you\nBasically played half of another game right at at what point does that that fatigue factor become an issue if you keep playing overtime games in pink keep adding minutes of football on top of the sixty minutes to play every week\n[laughter] ah [laughter] it was a man so we're not going to stop fighting until the backlog says zero zero zero zero\nSo it can go into five times and I believe our team will not quit and and that was what I was talking about in the first question about our our fight you know I just it it's just like night and day from last year this year and I'm a I'm a proud of this team and um I Am so but I'm very proud to be a part of it\nBack to that issue of fight I mean one of the guys it's getting a lot of credit for the improved fight in the new GM John Dorsey and he brought in players who have\nMore of that quality more of that fight have you noticed that some of the guys who have shown up because there's been significant turnover in the last year that those guys are bringing a different mindset in a different mentality this rubbing off on the players who are already there\nOf course you know uh but the new players that were were bad or or rookies you know they're they're they're doing a great job you know like uh\nThe mayor is Randall then the word you know there are those two players one one of them a veteran one's a rookie or you know they're they're just being a phenomenal you know I'm I'm I'm really excited to to be playing against him during practice every day you know 'cause they 'cause we we make each each other better\nDay in and day out so uh I uh I'm I'm just very excited for this your third\nYear in it you play a different position technically but it's the same concept with Jarvis Landry you're running past routes you you're watching him or what have you learned from him that has helped you as a football player\nSo many things you know when it comes to route running into a reading coverage is you know he's a very smart football player you know he uh [noise]\nHe he just takes so much time in his day just to study a focus on on on the little things and and he's such a great person you know a great answer a great actually just worked extremely hard every single day and uh I'm just really happy to be talking about next door for\nDavid it's been fun to watch were behind the browns all the way the folks in Cleveland deserve it and uh it's a great change from what you guys went through last year and we wish you all the best is the season goes forward talking again down the road\n... very much to talk to some political under\nAreas that you too David joke who Brown's tight end and it was it just it's a I Love a great story that people say what do you root for I refer a great story and it's hard not to see a great story unfolding in Cleveland is it a perfect story no\nBut it's a great story and and it does have different twists and turns in dynamics that you know I've talked about in the past today's about positivity I'm not going to get in any of the negative things about the positive\nWho are um you know changing the culture and I think if they contend for a playoff spot and right now they're right in the thick of it right now they they have as good a chance as anyone\nIn the AFC right now to emerge as one of the teams holding one of the sex pot you know we look at the chiefs they're going to have on the patriots are going to have one but we get down to\nSpot five and six wildcard let's say the Bengals run away with the division as it looks like they will win over the the ravens is going to mean a lot when it's time to figure out wild card berth and that ties gonna make it a lot easier to figure out who gets in and who doesn't you know when you throw in a few ties\nAnd all those permutations and mathematical formulas and calculations and\nAnd the best net record in common games and all that you don't have to worry about it the ties ties help break a lot of ties so we'll know where the brown stand but I think that's what makes this great story as if the browns can find a way to contend for the postseason even if they don't make it\nThe one thing I say you know all we want to win the super bowl that's every team's objected that's unrealistic the realistic objective is to be in contention every year after Thanksgiving you want to go through the month of December with your fan base engaged showing up at the games\nThat kids wanting jerseys of their favorite players as Christmas approaches and\n... and and maybe you get to the playoffs am more often than I Do but that's where you want to be in that conversation in December and the way it's setting up right now the browns very well may be and we'll find out how good the browns are charter show up this weekend charges the better team the one that they beat on Christmas Eve twenty sixteen they play the Steelers again\nAnd they've got the Texans so you don't get to work their way through the the the Bengals twice still they got the ravens again we'll find out how good is Brown's team is

Q. could increase by eight percent at even a sharp college boy like me who is senior class president\nTwo years in a row those at any acute grief we can get is pretty darn good\nSo really mind said as like a mental inclination it's a frame of mind is how you see the world it's how you filter what happens to you so mindset has really everything we do see it here are two people would let's take political organization to people see at a vet\nThat happens in the presidency one person may be a liberal see something completely different than what the conservative sees all the with the same basic of that and that's all about mindset my daughter went to University of Colorado and I call it the People's Republic\nReally wants to be the best tennis player who was ever lived he really does it get caught up too much and the law says he has in fact he just really enjoys the game ... she just think that's part of things but he'll end up\nBeing number one of the world for our weekly bills that

Stacy said dad I Want to become a\nProfessional tennis player I'm tired of trying to protect troops for free so the way we've become a results focus mindset is two things which are very very complex when I make it real real easy double what his contacts re casting I write about this a lot of the book did you ever see Charlie Wilson's war no I did on\nFor a movie with Tom Hanks he was a congressman who was trying to support the guy at the end in Afghanistan and they were able to kick the rushes out if they pick Afghanistan during the Nineteen eighties and Charlie Wilson was partnered\nWith the CIA agent at the CIA agent was his best friend ... was the guy and he was bragging about how easily able to get the F rushes out of aghast at at I used to actually proud of what we did at Philip Seymour Hoffman said let me tell you story\nThere's a story about this kid at Afghanistan they've got a horse and people were so thrilled about that and one very fast said gr Russo will see well fortunately he fell off the horse he broke his leg that's really bad\nAnd the girls said we'll see how they said well get up because they felt like they can't be drafted the Taliban could get up and they said we'll see so the horse or it was a very fortunate Catholic or what they did for half a world see so the bottom line with this when you contest recast we don't think of anything is good\nOr bad with the best thing to do this focus on the goal and be very consistent disciplined\nIt'll take your most of that the second thing we do is something called content recast so context as the things that happen around us certainly insulate ourselves stick with a discipline financial plan but the content recast as important to ... is the arguably the best violinist ever use a Israeli but do you ever heard one of his country\nHe was playing in every Fisher hall hall in New York I foresee us collectors and it takes almost five minutes to get out to the orchestra he's sitting in front and one day during a country out of the conductor and the conductor started playing for the first few bars the string of violent broke it sounded like gunfire he stopped\nAnd people didn't know what to do they thought well he's got a ... as a violin\nThey need to take our break maybe they need to get a new violin at all he did it was closed his eyes for about thirty\nSeconds and he signaled to the conductor just started to get what he did was he changed the tune it to wreak oppose he played just beautifully with only four strings and afterwards or and go to a little speech he said you know it's really amazing how much music you can make with what you have left and that's how we get bashed the market goes down it doesn't matter we look at it as being a long term thing\nWe context recast we have a temporary Depp Lou outlaw volatility we context\nRecast but we look at everything as part of a mosaic and which we just have to stay the course and keep doing what we're doing and not make really stupid decisions for example what if the people totally got mark what do they tried to time the market well you would have missed march night two thousand Nineteen and which of our cars up by Jim\nYou probably know more than I Do about this but a two hundred and twenty per cent since March back to those Nineteen what if we went all in during the wrong time\nSaying we are just nine of two thousand nine two thousand I by the state I guess you're right to do that from nine\nYeah All right so the key is staying the course and you know I Know I as a financial advisor I feel like I'm a psychologist 'cause I'm constantly dealing with the emotions of my clients and the thing is it's really easy for me to be an emotional ... money that is not mine but even as a financial advisor knowing all the right things I find my mind pulling me to\nMaybe do things that I wouldn't advise my clients to do what do you call that\nWell that's just the emotional part of that we talked about last time why smart people make mistakes of the money where they react to weather vagaries are happening in the market that's why people can't invest on their own\nThat's why every advisor out there really has to be as much psychologist as they do have to be advisor because you're the one that told me many times but this is a long term process of which were trying to hit a goal of the future and if we can just keep our shelf cop and not\nBe emotional about things that were able to do much better one of my favorite boxers is about ... Ali ever seen a fight where well\nWhat you don't know about Mohammed Ali is he was facing Sunday list into the ring or the very early purpose career and when she was known as Cassius Clay well Sunday list it was four inches taller had a ... and ... was getting polarized by a stronger faster\nBigger guy or the bell rang they went down the his end of the rank and he had a secret weapon M ... an angel is at a set of cash is good at their ... you're going to be to\nJust do one more around these I quit I'm not going to go out there is over I mean actually started taking the gloves off with a bell rang and as soon as that happened his secret up and Angela daddy took his chair out which by the could sit down game in the end up\nBack which they had to take one step forward this illicit side thread a white tower which meant they threw defied caches one later became Mohammed Ali or the rest is history so a lot of this is just going around it's taking that motions out at the Pentagon your financial advisor to do what's right\nFor you because you're so emotional and here so\nPassionate about things that you need to have the mindset\nOf results focus goal to the future\nAnd sort of what's happening right now which is the ...\nSo how do people change their mind set from six to be more of that results orientated and keeping their eye on the prize\nYeah a couple of really good technique separate one is set one three five your investment goals and ever to focus on the outcomes and about three and this is a big one this is the most important one this is called me to rewards a meteor reward so every time something\nHappens that basically major discipline so for example one of the hardest thing for people to do is either for ... investment so you put six thousand dollars in or maybe you're older you could put Eighteen thousand dollars at at every month that you do that you were ... yourself or do I get you treat yourself to a weekend you're with your wife you go on a retreat you go to a to a play a\nMovie but you have to do what's called an immediate reward for every investment decision you make the next thing is we have to focus on outcomes\nOr what things are going to feel like so on the ... when you're putting money away for invest about ... dollar cost averaging into things on the one he had this painful it doesn't feel good but we have to not think about gee I Want to have\nTen thousand dollars a month coming at one retired including Social Security but I Am actually experiencing living up up every quarter and portrayal I'm experiencing can be with my grandkids I'm experiencing being able to take a cruise so it's one thing having the goal and not have the emotions behind it but the other thing\nTo having the emotions behind the outcome so experience of what life is going to be like instead of just a number or a concept out there will make a huge difference to the immediate rewards and experience of the outcome\nAnd that's where really working with the professional you know because\nIt's it's really like working with the coach I mean a lot of us that are in the financial services world you know that's really what most of our role is we're not in the back room making the day to day trades that's what money managers do not your typical financial professional is going to help you write down those goals\nGuide you on the path give you some examples like what you're talking about and help them keep their eye on the\nPrize and keep going study also I find myself a lot of times I live in the Midwest and we're pretty conservative when it comes to spending and there I say cheap you know one thing I find myself doing too with clients is they get this mindset of saving for the future and the future never gets there and they don't treat themselves to\nThe rewards of being a successful saver and making it to retirement what do you say to those folks\nSuccessful people that are successful savers have a fix mindset they're thinking about what they're losing right now instead of what they were working at the future so they're looking at a media\nPunished but instead of deferred rewards and that's why I said we have to reward ourselves consistently for making any contributions to our four one K. qualify plant or buddy that we're putting it and then we have to reward ourselves for staying on that planet as well so that reward thing as a really big deal\nNow I don't think he got my questions so what about for folks that are saving for that rainy day and have a real hard time because they get to retirement they've been saving saving saving saving they've done a good job they've been successful at it but now they're at the promised land there in retirement they want to start drawing money out but they can't\nThey are afraid to draw they're still in that savings mindset what do you say to folks like that to help them enjoy retirement if they safely can't\nThat's a very good point because they have a mind set of save it constantly for they have to change their mind set to something else except for the government help us with that right they call it our days they forced us to take that money out but if they'd obviously you know this that they need the money they're going to use it they tell you that they can use it for their grandkids are the things that that takes a different mindset also so that takes up another form of outcomes\nThat we have to look at what they what life to be like\nThey have to set new goals and that's really difficult to either one of our coach is what sets it's when you retire here that retired and nothing you're retired ... so they have to kind of ... maybe I Do ... do tropics at Exeter here that takes a closer to what they want to be passionate about as well\nThat's a that's a big thing I talk to everybody they're so excited about getting to that retirement and telling the boss to take this job in Charlotte at they haven't thought about what they're going to do next and I see a lot of people retire without having that plan of what they're retiring too and in sixth date monster board they're depressed\nYou need to know what the next phase of life is and that's where that planning is so important from a psychological standpoint just as much as it is from a financial standpoint so thanks again carry for joining us\nExcept if he's expressed and not necessarily the opinion of science or their broker dealer to not shoot directly or indirectly it's an offer to buy or sell any ... mentioned hearing individual circumstances very investing project to rest including lots of principle invested no strategy sharp happened against law\nUm before we get into that Dr Janet I'm a I'm going to ask you I Know this is hard for you because this is this is the emotional but I think it's important for people to understand how you got to where you are today or why what what's driving and if you could share their story I'd sure well that\nWas part that a lot of personal pain and pain that my husband had years ago he had a severe I still arthritis throughout his body at the same time I had five from my house yeah right so I was really on a quest to find something all natural\nTo help him have a better quality of life for myself as well I mean I had to function and raised three children during that time ...\nBullet let's talk a little bit about what's in your glucose I mean yeah cream\nWell I did a lot of research on because I mean I knew how good it was\nSo I came across um the fact that Amy oil is a powerful natural anti inflammatory and can carry most any ingredient\nBright through your skin and deliver relief to your area of pain I took Amy oil\nAnd glucose ... I used ... which is an Indian herb that's an anti inflammatory okay from Elaine that's an enzyme known to be an anti inflammatory than natural organic solver\nThat is also just as important as glucose in Maine and rebuilding repairing our joints and so I put that altogether and ice cream that actually has\nNo odor it's grace plus it doesn't freeze the pain it doesn't burn the pain and death in irritate your skin cells in Fifteen minutes later you have for Italy\nAnd so that's why I'm here to share what I Know and show and a half\nRight has it right then I have this here by the way of folks both coasts mean cream comes in a plastic dispenser that has the pump top on it at\nThe top ... he'll need one to two pounds depending on the area okay I've painted ... that Santa Kerry in ... nation say you don't have to worry about it becoming rancid okay\nNow I'm In terms of this getting into your body then you're talking about a couple of things right here not not only relieving the pain but also maybe I'll read the rebuilding part so how does that work\nOnce you apply the cream to that area that you're going to target okay you get the information to go down in the body heal itself\nThe body heal itself presided you get at the raw materials that needs and giving you what she's made for your body to take over and do the job that was meant to do and that seal okay\nAnd this is safe enough and then you have to worry about I\nHave to worry about the thing that you're taking a drug for pain\nSlept with that at all none of these ...\nGoing to hit that okay so what what is then a a realistic expectation if somebody calls today and and wants to try your glucose mean cream what would you tell them\nI Would say within the first Fifteen minutes you know then I noticed that your pain is greatly reduced or even eliminate it okay and then over time either that or a bill to repair your joints with that information being taken down\nThat's going to restore flexibility and mobility and sleep I mean if you can sleep again that's for our bodies get all of our recoup protests regenerative ability to heal\nAnd then with that being taken care of all the things that you love to do you can start doing again traveling exercising so you can lose weight right socialize with family and friends you can be the life of the party\nYeah pain really changes who you are because of all these are the things you your can't do or it's very difficult to deal with in terms of of living a normal life for trying to live\nYour life you're right you're right live a normal life in your life has changed forever and get this thing taken care of and you can\nYeah and you've got people out there that are that are already getting great results\nHigher brought some more emails and letters he'd like to hear issue or okay um let's see criticizing from ... from California\nI Would love for you to know how happy I Am with your product by the lake they usually and pain from being overweight and on my feet all day at night I can hardly get to sleep from the pain I discovered by applying glucose me to the painful areas I'm able to get a good night's sleep thank you so much for making this possible\nHis one more Chris from Darlene from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania it's a miracle and uh tell that truly does take away the pain it works is nothing else I'd ever tried to work quickly and lemonade all of the pain\nSo to me when our lease or these you\nDo these kinds of responses unusual\nNow really are the usual really usual I mean I must say that it does my heart glad to hear these things because I Know what it's like to suffer and I know what it's like to get relief and every time you know I get one of these emails are these letters that just confirms that\nHundreds of thousands of people have is my great great results\nThat's great I also want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr Janet's extra strength glucose mean pain relief

experienced pain from time to time or maybe it's more serious more chronic\nHum and looking for a real solution here understanding that perhaps the pharmaceutical approaches is now we know is not the best approach at this point because there are so many side effects associated with a with these drugs out there right but looking at it from a natural standpoint\nJanice glucose mean cream maybe make

going to make the sausage first official rankings coming up two weeks from Tuesday\nOne of the reasons why this season for now understanding that the beauty of college football is there should be a few more upsets\nOn the horizon but if we're just going to have the mindset that it's all chalk all the time this year so much of that is a reflection\nOf the dominance of Alabama with the baseball

the Dodgers so you didn't have to last night if you can find it I understand what Fox's motivation is to put that game of Fox Sports one\nThey want you to be aware of the channel plus they want to

whichever version you want to go where you want to go to school and talk about the ban veto and Lou Gehrig\nIt just feels like a foregone conclusion not only that Alabama's going back to the playoffs but every time they are on the field it's just going to be a brutal detail because they've been amazingly transcended\nAnd a winning formula this year is not only continuity on the fence and we know

and finally got that postseason bracket we've been clamoring for for decades those of us who love the college game but I'm hearing more and more this year\nAt least can we go to six teams ever going to six let's go to a well here's the problem with that argument when the field is expanded and it will be I'm not naive you have any doubts in life about how things are going to play out\nFollowed the money but when it's expanded a team like Alabama or Clemson or Georgia or Ohio State all the teams you resent this year and I'm with ya I Love college football because of the chaos and because we can go through thermonuclear scenarios but\nThis is just intuitively accurate when the field is expanded it all our team like Alabama or Ohio State more margin for error because they could lose again maybe two games still sneak into\nA field of eight teams because think about a year ago Alabama didn't even when they're on division obviously the choice of the selection committee which I disagree with strenuously at the time was validated because the tide wanted also put the tide in the final four now that is not a hot take I realize Ohio State\nStill has to navigate the Big Ten\nAnd we'll see

ready for instance some super competitive games you've got it especially some on the board right now Notre Dame trying to play catch up to a lot of time left in the game for had their number and their roaring back trying to be perfect fighting Irish\nFighting for a spot in the college semi final game to try to vie for a national title we haven't seen that in a very very long time Ella you trying to

Fenway Park\nChris they'll get the start for more than a it could be an interesting game virtually under pitch so well and the division theories last year where they of course\nKnocked off used and knocked off a Boston\nBut this is a different team with a couple of new faces that he's going to face in that\nLine up this should be a super good theories my prediction and my predictions have been really lousy but I'm going to throw it out any way I feel like a magic April kind a day\nI think that they I think that this comes down to seven games and I think Boston when that I really like youth and and I wouldn't be stunned if they did I mean look I'm staying seven and I can point to factors of why Houston and I love AJ mentioned the way he's managed the team\nBut I think Boston is going to rocket I Do I think they're going to it's going to go to a seven they have the advantage there because they've got that home field advantage I think it does come into play and I think it does\nGo to seven games All right let's jump deep into the scoreboard if nothing else I'm definitely a highlight machine\nFor you because it's been quite a game\nIf I wasn't doing this for a living I Would be [noise] at some watering hole with some ... watching a few of the Pittsburgh\nOn top of Notre Dame fourteen twelve that's with twelve minutes and twenty some seconds to go in the game Pittsburgh has the ball right now at Notre Dame Eighteen or a four and five four and five for them it's crazy but um\n[noise] it's crazy but looking at Notre Dame and the wood Pittsburgh did they were smart they jumped out early they got that touchdown earlier Notre Dame was just chipping away at at settling for some kicks and at one point difference by the time they get to the house\nBut that that they're trying to do what they control new control the chained chains move down field et cetera and in book\nFor Notre Dame has been phenomenal with an interception a costly interception and he has the momentum swing thing that this game as tight as good Notre Dame with a crack perhaps in an opening for them to jump into that top for spot navy LSU\nOn top of Georgia sixteen nothing that's with one minute and twenty five seconds till they hit the halfway point I'm giving you the exact exact status on that\nAnd it's been all about Ellis you being able to capitalize on their own side and and

I talked to a couple of people about this game and what would have to happen and\nThen of course ... Iran wasn't shy about talking about how tough there the defense going to be for Georgia and what he expected to to see but that's part of the brilliance I think of the way he's trying to coach them up and\nThe tigers had a few games that they that they had a few games they almost lost within a few data game they almost won two there too and one in the FCC and it's just going to be a matter of sending them off of that defense because like I said you know you look at\nYou look at some of the games that they played and what was the one last to Florida what happened there\nIs that they started to peel it out at the end of it and couldn't get it back on [noise] but um\nBorough is tough and this team is tough but you look at curvy smart and and this is a match up of brains that's what it is it's a matchup of brains I think on both sides of this so let's see if Georgia tumbles if they do that's a huge when huge win\nFor or LSU as big as that all burn when was because they were able to nip Auburn just by a point and what was an incredible edge of your seat a victory\nAnd when you look at the FCC standings and there's LSU sitting pretty right behind Alabama because I don't see anyone nip in Alabama and imagine LSU goes through this\nAnd then if they hang on if they win then they got Mississippi State and then they move on to how much damage [laughter]\nAh but at least they're hosting it and are they seem to be the Alabama I just don't think\nBoy I just don't think anyone can knock off Alabama let's start back into the scoreboard for you\nTo give you some more up put some more meat on the bone games in progress and then some that wrapped up in Nebraska boy with a real heartbreak or are they are now though and six that even went over time against north western but\nWashington and Oregon they were tied at ten Washington breaks it open with a with a strike Seventeen nothing Jake Browning\nAnd takes a fourteen Ninety One\nPassing yards has seven teams ten at stake Washington\nComes in at seven and here they are in the pack twelve they know this is the heart of the order for them Oregon making it a game and this one I think is going to come down to the wire they have\nA two minutes or so then they're then they go into the locker room Michigan State Spartans don't care that they're playing Penn State they're trying to come back into this and the airlines trying to fend them off\nIf you've heard me at all maybe you haven't heard me if you if but if you have ...

the corner Barclay though people are excited about him even with the law to the Philadelphia Eagles on Thursday to keep kickoff rather weak six\nSo Eli Manning got knocked around intercepted I mean you name it it it happened to him and it's interesting what patch germ or had to say after the game he talked about um hey it's not for lack of effort nothing went wrong in that department right that\nThat's a little bit everybody will be a good team is going to force for more than what we're all here before they fought or lower their\nThey fought hard but they just law she lacked ivy eagle\nSo they put something on the conversation is warranted is this the end of Eli Manning or everything\nYou know that how many more years the manning have in him especially with the weaker offensive line and yeah you've got the study and take one Barkley who blew out numbers I mean he had just doesn't ... ... game\nThirteen carries a hundred and thirty yards a touchdown a fifty yards where he made he made the eagles looked like they had no clue what they were doing and tried to stop him he was awesome\nYou lie manning just a different different story when you know you had to have an urgent play you had to make something happen he couldn't make it happen and half the time and some of the cases it looked like who the throne you I'm not sure what's going on there so you have the rookie half back who's amazing and then you have the\nThe quarterback was pressure all pressured the whole time from the eagles they sat from four times hit him Thirteen and you know just it just was not working for a minute let's just led to that conversation about what is going on and then ... that comes junior\nAt one point in the game he had but he had but not a player he had had but a cooling fan during the second half\nHe was screaming on the sideline he was definitely eventually come down by thick one Barkley who's the rookie right he left for the locker room before the end of the first half patch termer said he was excused because of cramping now and the end they made an excuse for that but then the question became afterwards obey Jay what's going on why were yelling\nFrom and give

right so the giants you know they\nThey look like they don't look anything like they they've looked like in the past they've made the smart move I think in getting stay clawed Barclay no one can argue that especially coming off of the kind of gave me had but just in watching him week after week after week\nUm you know that that's the bottom line but you do have the questions about\nYou know you have questions about\nYou I'm Manny is it that he's lost too many steps is it that it can you blame it on injuries and can you blame it on what what what do you blame it on you blame it on that you know he's missing the mark the giants are facing a reality of\nOkay what's next and then the question will become about passing on quarterbacks do they have a quarterback for the future the answer they don't have a quarterback for the future [laughter] so um they are in that\nThey are in that we got to win a Dave Gettleman who the who the GM of this and ... know that the heat is definitely up on them and and listen to people like Eli Manning thirty seven he's won a couple of Super Bowls for them getting fake one Barclay to be able to to run the ball again a smart move\nBut who who do you have on the offensive line that can help him and aging offensive line and then\nWho steps in any way to spell manning I mean who was the quarterback of the future for the giants so there is a lot of
