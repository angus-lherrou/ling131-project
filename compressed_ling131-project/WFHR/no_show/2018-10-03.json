five five to ... to buy a AAA eight to five five shoot to Jim is with us here in Philadelphia Hi Jim how are you\nGood Dave thanks for having me on sure what's up [noise] um my wife and I work currently in baby steps to uh we started this time last year with about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in debt ah we've been on tenth and paid off our thousand dollars wow as of this month\nYes a\nSold my brand new pickup truck sold a race car um wow everything though we um we have and an interesting situation a we have one child and we're looking to expand our family however we're going to lead to um do they do I've I'm always go out and other\nSixty six thousand dollars left or the pay off all sold into a were making about a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year right now\nSo you did a hundred in a year but a lot of that was from selling stuff\nI'm pretty much a large ...\nWhat's the math telling you that it's got how long is he going to take you do this or the sixty\nUm [noise] if we if we continue on this course where how are you literally sold everything so the rest of it she's going to be working really are I think it's going to be probably about another year maybe a little bit more\nThat's what I was thinking that's what I like I'm On a cell that OK cool and so what is the pricing model of a Vietnam vet you guys are looking at\nUm well we actually met with a doctor a few months ago and we got a ballpark of about twenty thousand mhm I'm just you know we haven't\nFound anything or start any any processes yeah we're just so hard to shop around but twenty thousand or we're looking at a we've sort of go with other couples and all the cricket who's got around there um\nLet me give me a little inside okay this comes like a lot because babies are important\nFor me having kids is a big deal it's an emotional thing and it causes people to uh\nYou know to to change their financial directions and the to violate things and everything else so let me tell you I I absolutely know nothing about medical things I I'm a medical idiot okay but uh I have actually been involved in about this decision probably a hundred times over the years\nAnd what I Am hearing\nEven as late as last week a with a couple that we are coaching on this is that when they press and they fined several different pricing models and prices\nAnd you don't just accept the first opinion you get on how you go about this okay right in other words I heard the other day are thirty five thousand for one pricing model but that was like a guarantee as many times as you need to to do it till you get a baby right [noise] okay uh well that's not one we're going to do\nAnd then I heard the other end of the spectrum I'm hearing a you know a single tries as low as Seventy five hundred or to try\nYeah I don't know I don't know if if my wife my wife is a great grandmother I Know why are they will always say there was a it's a hundred and three but I don't know if that's even they're not\nNot like there was always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion purposes okay if you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy it for Ninety five thousand\nTo buy\nThat just being okay by it's not like you're getting the right great deals are where you just went wow that's the best deal ever ride this is\nFrom like to even get kicked out 'cause someone gated or should I leave or I should move or I should I go back ... and or\nWell where do I want to be long term or that you want to\nOwn um why she we kind of didn't want to own because we are I got a daughter she's four and my wife she that school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now mhm have you got everything in my\nArea it's like I say my wife great grandma's house and she'd been here her whole life so she likes it it's like about two and a half three acres\nMhm and um it's kind of in a country well part of Atlanta gotcha okay and how old are you to uh my\nWife she turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days but we both twenty now\nMhm and you got a a one child you said and how much do you have\nA we don't have any debt okay and what's your household income\nUh make uh every year but I'm trying to get in school but I had to kind of work with the center that was that much of a million miles um I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month and your wife doesn't work [noise]\nOkay that's pretty ... on your budget\nThis is very tight on your budget\nAnd we just found out about you not too long ago one of my friends from church he recommended me start with nature you know now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff on how to eat and we're already kinda you know trying to start it off a little better\nToo good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is the uh the relatives that are involved that would be the errors or this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren\nThat would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court you know to get a lawyer and go to pro bake court ... court would have to rule that the house could be sold hand would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done\nOkay I don't think you need that expense right now yeah don't\nWith all the blue the numbers you gave me and the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages paid I doubt they are going to get thrown out\nYeah 'cause that's what I was thinking should I feel kind of want to actually start even going into real estate because I Do construction and that's what I Do know I kind of this house is kind of it's not ... it's kind of beat up and fight the last few years she had like other relatives staying there kind of beating it up so I mean I don't know if it's like\nMaybe work more maybe you know what I'm saying maybe we can flip it and get another house\nSo you know Lipitor unless you become the owner of it\nYeah and and that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to you'd had icy interstate might learn anything they just hurry up and now my in the game or should I tell you what I Would\nDo if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from the south someday when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it\nYou're probably not gonna ever bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about okay\nSo uh what I Would do is pay the rent or pay that payment of rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't fret about becoming the owner today\nIt's inexpensive rent in the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah it's going to be a nice kind of be a really strenuous process with the courts to become the owner of this because we don't even know who the heirs are\nYeah well I don't I Know a couple of the day is this is not that many on 'em or that they actually even know about it like I said we've we've been here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried that I'm staying here paying their oil I just keep paying it\nIn because that's the one that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYet but I'm I'm just worried like can't nobody called me and me out because it's not in my name\nIs ... you out the people that own it can there are the heirs but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nAnd they're they're they're far away they're like in another state and\nBut they're not they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than a soda\nIf it was valuable now there'll be some sharks and them water circulating right but it's not got any because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it because some of that you're just going to walk off and leave it\nYeah 'cause 'cause I've already done paying eight and ... before they had some something you know and then they had because\nThat's my money whatever money you spend that make her happy is money has gone\nWhen you leave because there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing to probate court\nAnd get the deed transferred to your name and you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that and um\nAnd you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent\nTo replace you kind of like living\nAnd uh you know six hundred bucks rent and Atlanta is not a bad gig on two and a half acres\nSo I'm sitting there if I'm you for now\nIt's not hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyway still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and some day you're just going to move on\nQuite worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner then get ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months of pain in the ... court actions and you probably can work this through if you can gather up all the people you need to sign on it\nAnd that's what you're facing so it's an interesting situation but uh my guess is it's not worth any more than his old on it\nMy guess is probably fairly close on that if we thought his worth two hundred thousand box it was a relatives thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks a Ninety thousand was owed and they were going to get a hundred thousand their pocket when is old\nNo sharks would already been circling they'd have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get\nThe courts Lou it when you die without away all you have to go in and the judge has to you know authorized the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs\nAre just like it would in a wheel but it's just a lot bigger mess\nAnd do you can't get clean title to this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become the owner of it any other way than doing it properly and getting clean title because you won't be able to sell it if you don't get clean title [noise]\nSo that's how you do it if you decide to do it later but for today I Would treat it as cheap rent it's a rental house how much money would you spend on a rental house that you're going to move off and you don't home not [noise]\nNot any that's what you would do hope that helps man's thanks for calling in and this is the day Ramsey shower\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with

crazy people with their money thing and that was it was those shows those kind of show and um she and I ended up talking and the green room after that and she was the one she gave me some study\nAnd I read through the whole study I was amazed there was a huge correlation\nBetween extreme levels of financial control\nAnd domestic violence so if you have a friend who is not allowed to go to the grocery store by herself without her husband\nOr her boyfriend if you have a friend that is not allowed to touch money in any way because her husband her boyfriend is incomplete extreme control of every decision around the finances I'll give you a Ninety percent probability he's hitting her\nThat's how that's how strong this study correlation was I mean there's just because there's so many it's a it's all about control\nAnd it's all about bullying\nSo there's just the sicknesses involved there and it shows up in the money believe it or not and you can see it and and after doing that reading

NC double A.\nHas completed its investigation into Baylor's football program under our bras\nAnd found out that this is shocking\nOn overall quote lack of institutional control and quote\nAccording to Dallas Star Telegram a viles was the central figure in the NC double a investigation of the overall conduct of the program at the university\nThe NC double a reportedly informed the school of their decision about three weeks ago\nAnd they'd given them Ninety Days to respond to find it really Ninety Days why\nApparently Baylor had initially hoped\nTo avoid any serious punishment from UNC to Hawaii hoping to compare the sexual assaults on campus\nTo that of a un sees academic fraud case last year yeah because those are comparable right we've got a\nString of sexual assault committed by athletes and your university and you want to like in that\nTo the University of North Carolina's academic fraud case are you crazy\nSo six some of these people are just about money man it's a big big time football with money in the south is it not\nSo apparently in recent months evidence had shown that the handling of sexual assault cases the Baylor was not just an issue within the athletic department\nThat is not surprising either\nSo far Baylor\nHas self imposed a punishment\nIncluding ... scholarships and we're being told that at the NC double a it was reportedly asking Baylor to consider a band from post season play which Baylor football\nDoes not want to do by the way how do you spend I'm sure the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not born in the time the man hours to investigate [noise]\nOne of your universities Baylor\nAnd after finding out they have a lack of institutional control which I think we all could have told you given the evidence that was before us\nMonths and months ago when we talk about this last year as a matter of fact [noise]\nI mean I didn't need to\nBe told by the NC double A. that there was a lack of institutional crow control when right up you know what it was Ken Starr the athletic\nDirector or the president and ... and went right up the ladder it's crazy right\nNow I'm thinking to myself\nSo ... self imposed punishment that included a loss of scholarships but they don't want to consider a ban from postseason play who the hell cares what they want\nI mean I don't get this at all this is what bothers me about the NC double wide\nSo we're being told out but it's not all in the rearview mirror the ended up away also looking to the original pepper Hamilton an investigation was conducted back in two thousand and sixteen\nTodd depositions from former athletic director in my car and former board member Phil Stewart allege that the Baylor University had dysfunctional leadership\nSurprised I'm not and the findings were controlled by a few board members who want to deliver a specific outcome that allowed them to save face\nFrom the art ... by out\nBy ... by the way if if you are if you failed to remember\nThe university settled on a Fifteen million\nTo walked away with an additional twenty five million bucks\nFor my real here's a guy with a set over a program I don't give a damn what he said publicly I think the evidence is pretty clear [noise]\nThe set over a program\nThere was a powerhouse in college football\nThen allowed or turned a blind eye\nTo his players committing sexual assaults around the campus\nAnd according to some of the evidence we talked about on this very show\nThere were instances where local police campus police\nCoaches from staff including ...\nThat tried to convince women who came forward with these sexual assault claims to just let it go it's okay to carry this is not good for the anniversary sacrifice that for you thinking [laughter] so you're aware of this going on and that's what that's what you allow to\nIt's crazy just absolutely crazy [noise]\nUm so we'll see what happens um I I I wanted out loud and we were talking to a commercial break I like this to some control isn't that one of the things that you look for for the death penalty\nI mean the NC double a wants him to put a bold ban on for a year to hell with it\nToo once you slap the death penalty on these idiots down there let them do without football for a while All right\nI mean whether it's an academic or recruiting fraud for instance at SMU other than the death penalty years and years ago\nMrs sexual assault and it ran and ran right all the way up to the power and the powers that be at Baylor and what does that tell you told me I wouldn't want to be sending my kids are that's ...\nMeanwhile ... this is interesting how the NC double a who you know if you listen to the show for any period of time I I have a bit of an issue with\nThey showed a little heart and compassion I'm

me is not\nUnusual really isn't\nI mean when you get your butt handed to you like that come on people will know whisper or they're going to talk and people are going to make excuses\nWell apparently there's been drama between the former number one and his wife\nI'm I'm thinking to myself what's going on with Patrick read is one of the more interesting things that's happened at the Ryder Cup alright Reed who was Captain America with Jordan's beef or the Ryder Cup two years ago\nWas apparently the first one to point the finger on Monday saying that Jordan speech didn't want to play with him didn't like it didn't want to play with\nPut friendships above country and you know let's get the job done we got it done in two thousand and six I pick up really that's kinda strange and these guys all hang out together and everything else and he's got unprecedented by the way read was paired with Tiger Woods\nWealth Reid's comments got a got a response from an anonymous member of team usa alright this comes from the team itself who said the following to the New York post\nPatrick greed is full of blank\nBlind sided my ass he begged to play with tiger and quote\nIf you remember Patrick read idolizes Tiger Woods he's the guy that on Sundays where's the red shirt and black trousers just like tiger\nAnd it does not surprise me a bit\nThe given an opportunity to play with tiger given the runs that he made at the open championship tour championship [noise] um you know the way you play the last five six weeks of the of the season two months of the season having an opportunity to

and now they're apparently guys on the team they're calling them out\nNow his wife come to his defense on social media which is not surprising\nResponding to you know a bunch of people were criticizing her husband I get it [noise] I'm thinking [noise]\nI don't know just going to blow over anytime soon\nBecause what goes on in that room and the conversations that Patrick Reid has kept the gym furious about wanting to play with Tiger Woods or become well known among\nThe team itself and assistant captain cetera then all of a sudden you cannot point the finger goes toward speech he doesn't like me I Can't believe that he put you know friendships for foreign country [noise] really\nWow just to cover his own tracks are meanwhile\nThere was a report on the telegraph that are after being invited into the European locker room to enjoy the celebration that Europeans had\nFairly Dustin Johnson Brooks kept go head to be separated after nearly coming to blows out kept ... cents a ...

what were you saying let me uh\nAlex that uh you know whether it was Paulina Gretzky which is due to his wife are\nJenna Sims kept his girlfriend I don't mean maybe somebody said something about another girl and\n... all hell breaks loose when that happens right my boyfriend didn't hit the ball for an ... and I [noise]\nI think yeah I I Wish I could add more insight I just well but I don't yeah I had thought about that but I'm thinking why not yeah\nI don't know something went on and clearly it's see than to\n'em for whatever reason I mean\nI don't get why they're invited in the European locker him in the first place I guess they're all buddies on the tour by\nYou know why they're emotions boiled over at that moment\nAs opposed to been All right after losing or if this had been brewing your seeding underneath that it didn't happen sooner\nBut the catalyst being I don't know if they're related or not the catalyst being I don't know Patrick read saying something about the team underperforming I'm sure that's one of oceans boiled over\nYeah but I mean there have been those reports out there the last several weeks that a DJ Paulina\nGretzky have a kind of\nHit a rough

you're holding those guy he beat it is interesting what's going on with the jets I mean\nTend to Arnold has not been able to produce much\nFantasy output and all of the famous yeah but he's producing seems to be going to continue but what about uh thirty percent target chair ... who was their number one receiver last just kind of left him in the wilderness I think probably interested at this point is tropical if he doesn't seem to fit what they're doing and it it's really a disappointing situation for him\nAnd then from that free that did you brought up I he actually had a really promising game and he's been suffering some injuries and that's a concern\nBut we saw him serve as the number one running back and I came out for Morris was really a secondary option there would they how explosive he's been a better place you know fine I actually think that met three day could come out of this you know what you may grow up without their anymore he can come out of this being fined and I'm I'm definitely keeping him and I think that he could be a starting option this week\nWe're talking about good front room with someone who was our fantasy football expert in getting stuff over there to be six words and ruining rural let's move on to the bears do their office was a God this year or do you expect similar results moving forward from Mitchell in in in his position players\nWell probably not when they have to play a role and I felt defense\nThey\nWon't be as good as that will that will say is there there were some things you look at there and you say All right these are things we saw and they just happen to work out this week Taylor Gabriel it's a it's a name coming\nInto that week he had been coming into that game he's been getting a lot of target to get a Twenty one twenty two percent target chair heading into last week\nHe just wasn't getting used down the field he wasn't they weren't connecting down the field they connected on those big play them and we know from his time in Atlanta that he can make those kind of take place they happened to connect on him and we saw him have a big game\nSo you look at that you say All right maybe maybe that's something that we can repeat the rest of the way and foreign service yeah I mean it is promising that this wasn't a game and like Ryan ... hills and wait three in which he\nHe basically had some glorified handouts that perfect place he was pushing the ball down the field he made a couple of play down the field we've seen sophomore quarterbacks\nEspecially with new coaches I mean most notably Carson went Jared golf we've seen these software quarterbacks in recent years really make jumped perhaps this is the start of it the the real concern you have to risk he's on by this week so you're not going to get your utilize them might I I think that there's at least that chance here\nThat this off and start to kind of take off his plate certainly not what we saw I gets Tampa I start to take off on this\nSo Corey Davis Calvin Ridley John Brown\nOut Sean Jeffrey uh those wide receivers uh which we for performance is most likely to be sustainable over the rest of the season\nYou know I I well I think probably have to say outside Jeffrey because this is what he was the last week when he was number one wide receiver he would use that way and it first came back with obviously really promising from that respect but I I also need to point out from that same game Corey Dade is Corey Davis\nHas been getting a massive target chair a math is chair of the yard in that often coming into the week up it just wasn't working because markets Mariel to wasn't healthy and they were forced to start playing gathered it'd be too which is you know obviously not what you ever want to have to do markets burial to in that game was healthy was pushing the ball down the field\nHe had some receivers drop houses down the field that would've made his that wind look even better if that often with their new officers coaching staff it that often is starting to click it markets marry oh that is is getting back to full health\nThat could be a situation where it Corey Dade is kind of lives up to to his draft start from last year and he could be an outstanding a top twenty than the wide receiver so\nI Am certainly buying on Corey Dade is\nAll right let's let's finish up with this one who is some of the players out there that you're targeting on the way of aware of how to refer\nTo well I think the most interesting one is the key cutie the wide receiver for for the Houston Texans he you know it's kind of more of a you know the smallest guy that used them almost like a like a gadget player but we saw him in college years down the field only three of his target three of his team target\nAgain the Colts were more than ten yards down the field I I think that's going to change especially if will fall or as you look at that game you go well if this is that good as we're going to see from him this year it will hold out for a couple of weeks I don't think that that's the case so I think he needs to be at it at all leak\nObviously not Heinz the running backs the passing down back to the cold is very interesting coming off of a couple of good games in a row\nBut I think if you're looking for somebody that high up sites that I think you're looking at Ronald Jones you know you ought to get a terrible training camp he's been an active and tell that game and wait for but he started to kind of creep in on Peyton Barber now they have to buy a week is it possibly comes out of the pie week of the starter I think it is\nAnd so you can add in this week put him on your bed and kind of see how that situation shakes out and it might end up you might end up developing is like a a top twenty four kind of running\nAlright terrific stuff Raymond it's always good talking to you love the fantasy football information my friend and good luck with your uh Houston Astros\nThought thank you sir you got

action already what all over television\nI'm sitting there scratch my head [noise] by the way there's a lot of hair on his head thank goodness even though I'm forty still man I don't want to hear myself why is anybody excited about this NBA season\nLet me give you some perspective here were officially into major league baseball's postseason right honestly I've no idea who should be considered the favorite to win the world series you can make an argument for the Astros can make it\nRed Sox Yankees bats get hot with that bullpen they could win it right Cleveland that for starting pitchers who struck out over two hundred batters this year there weren't tested in the regular season playing the awful American League central if the Dodgers starting pitching does what they're supposed to do they can be dangerous right\nSo I don't know who's gonna win it the NFL what's the beauty of fell parity every weekend we sit their mouths agape wondering\nWho is going to be who and how did that team

Bills team\nWhat was it twenty two to nothing\nSo there is such unpredictability when it comes to the NFL that's the beauty of it who's a Super Bowl favorite right now I have no idea you can call me

entire first quarter of the season\nNow Anna falcons have a deadly all fans if they seem to get their defense back in order they can win it the rams are grains right I I don't know is going to win the super bowl that's the beauty of it let's turn our attention though to the NBA\nWhy are you still get the wire you so excited to root for your team to finishing second place\nBecause that's exactly what you do unless you are a true Golden State warriors fan or a fraudulent Golden State warriors framed who started liking that team four years ago\n... that's when it comes down to besides a warriors fan why isn't anybody excited for the upcoming NBA season to watch their team at best finishing second here in eastern conference the more you hope to get to the finals and not get swept by Golden State\nIf you're on rockets fan you help somebody named curry or do rent or both or Tom sooner whatever\nGets injured and maybe you have a chance besides that once the excitement\nIn the most predictable sport today in this country there's nothing unpredictable without the NBA the outcome is determined already in fact the outcome was determined the day after the yeah finals ended\nAnd if you think otherwise you're blind you cannot be excited for a basketball season where you are literally rooting for the runner up that's what happens\nAnd if the Golden State warriors don't win at all it is for one of two reasons one they've been beset by so many injuries that's why they lose or to they ... themselves and maybe the greatest upset in basketball history okay that's when it comes down to\nIf you've ever thought of it invincible team visit and by the way there's eighty two meaningless regular season games before we even get to the ... and the first round the house won't be fun when golden state's a one or two seats beaten up on a seven or eight see that's not going to be fun\nNot the fun only begins literally okay literally but western conference finals and we are like nine months away from that so you can sit\nHere and tell me man I'm so stoked the NBA season is getting underway this is awesome can't wait to show up at Madison Square garden or the staples center and seal my team can do oh man this is Austin abroad and the Lakers uniform\nYeah how about that kind of the fact LeBron James is it going to file for the first time after being there for eight straight years how about the fact LeBron James went to the western conference where he's got a bigger walls and the great wall of China blocking I'm told the Golden State warriors do realize if\nYou're an NBA fan that's going in your crazy I don't want your talking I realized that the hope of the league right now is that Kevin ... who's already having to address questions about free agency and I hear\nPeople talking about story it leaves the league opens up which means you completely understand the leader's calls right now but when it gets pretty determined it's over\nIt was showing last the mock yeah at least I can say one thing about you\nAnd that is you are like me are not excited for this upcoming NBA season because it's a predetermined outcome well that's true but I was going to play devil's advocate here I Do yes I can see the warning people have said that [laughter]\nAfter her come on that one [laughter] blue I Do ah let me let me tell you this is the Houston Rockets did they not go to seven games with the Golden State warriors without their starting point guard Chris Paul the last two\nAh yes and they were all day I'm not a competitive series and was that the Houston Rockets not have a chance to win that series\nThey did if they were health and that was shocking about a chance to up and the Golden State warriors the editing Anthony that's exactly why they don't have a chance [laughter]\nDo you really think the markets are cousins fits that Golden State system no no no right so then or even I honestly obviously to upgrade over ... muggy\nBut here's the funny thing about a half court player but here's the funny thing about clogged Elaine's I I don't really see the ...\nBut he's not going to play at least the first half January right so at that point the fact is they have so much time to figure out what he can do 'cause it's all about the post season and if Steve is really a great coach and not just a product of having one of the greatest teams ever assembled and it is this is a historically great team\nVisited a deeper team that Michael Jordan's bulls okay this is that deep a team as we've seen in history you probably have to go back to the

cardio self report it\nOn our find the out there was a lot more beep intention apparently with team usa at the disaster\nCalled the Ryder Cup in Paris it wasn't just Patrick greed being a little spoiled brat upset with Jordan speeds and by the way somebody ... somebody anonymously has come out refuted that\nPatrick greed claimed that it was all a you know Jordan speeds and he didn't want to play with him and apparently the saying he's full of it but that's not the only problem that apparently occurred how about this\nPublications reporting\nThat Dustin Johnson and Brooks kept guy who I worked out partners and apparently friends\nAdult occasions not once but twice first on the team flight going over and then at a Ryder Cup party during the event and Paulina Gretzky may have been at the center of it with Jen assumes kept his girlfriend a part of it as well\nThat it was very nasty at this Ryder Cup party and other attendees were done that that to happen and they have to be separate now people have refuted it but many sources claim that it occurred\nI Love it I absolutely love this because to me golfers are looked upon as just being a bunch of ... people\nThat gentleman's sport they tip their cap they yell for once in a while maybe they show some emotion on the course but\nI'll tell you what now there's other reports out of the southern England which is like the tablets\nClaims that Dustin Johnson believed that Brooks cats go was a little coke cozy with Paulina Gretzky wow how 'bout that that's the latest report literally just coming down\nThat kept may have been getting a little cozy with Paulina which upset Dustin Johnson that is insane they're supposed to be friends that's crazy\nOn them or is that Dustin polling or on the outs yes there that's been big rumor yeah I don't know if any of his true so yeah so that that makes sense that's crazy so kept it was like hey if they're on the outs maybe I'll get in you know they've been engaged for like five years and engage those two thousand Thirteen\nDust and you could afford a wedding by the way Paul any of that can afford to pay for a wedding it's Wayne Gretzky for crying out loud unless you that's what it is about like hey I'm not paying you pay your dad's Wayne Gretzky for crying out loud but you know your dad's paying nobody I Know it's\nProbably this we want the wedding in Edmonton no I Want the about what the wedding in the states no there to stand still probably but you need personality in GOP good and bad whereas ... he's not from Edmonton Wayne no he's from like ah Ontario right the Hamilton know something like that who knows\nSome candidates north of the border he's ... he's not from Edmonton no\nMy training outlet and became a glitzy by the way I mean ... mother's from LA right she's Janice Jones or actress I think actually the model\nThat she grew up but he Paulina grow up in California I Believe but here's the thing about it do we like that are golfers have personality I got a problem with Tiger Woods showing emotion on the course dropping four letter bombs in in in anger I never had a problem with that\nIn fact I liked the fact that there's

hitting on all cylinders but I Do say this isn't the off season\nI I my biggest question for Alabama was would mix save and be able to handle coaching a team or it basically whiz this year\nWe're going to score forty two points and ask the other team can you because that's how good they were offensively but that doesn't fit mix by he's always protected his defense\nHe liked the win games twenty four ten\nAnd now the fact that you score that many he could get into these big twelve shootout type games or he's not as comfortable it looks like he's looked at it decided this is who are going to be and he was gone with it at ... dynamite when they do it I I'd say that then\nThey lost a lot of players on defense but especially in the secondary all six players that started\nBut I I actually think they're better at corner certain fan and gigs Trayvon digs a step on big brother they're actually better corner than they were last year they're not as good at safety that they will not be able to handle\nThe uh the safety play they had a year ago but there are better corner and that that's a big goal by it I did what you did because when I go out there and watch them practice I went oh my God\nThese guys are six to their great [laughter]\nYou know Gary interesting you said there are six or seven teams that could play with Alabama so let's get right to Georgia that in terms of pure ability in terms of talent on the roster he's Georgia neck and neck with family or theory space between the two teams in your mind\nNot much they're extremely talented they're extremely deep uh in the game went to see what game that I was before tennis because there was Missouri\nAre in the first half I counted they play twenty four defensive players and the first half of that came out they play a front three and they went ten deep and their rotation to stay fresh\nAgainst true locked in the longest passed Lochte through that game was less than twenty five yards and that was to his tail back who ran the ball for that distance so they're they're extremely gifted\nThey're not as good a running team as they were a year ago I think they miss Isaiah when who was a very you know the number one draft pick for New England who is a very athletic offensive tackle now they're big\nThey're strong but they don't move as well and the offensive line and I really think they miss [laughter] I I was going to say this that they really miss Sony Michel okay then yeah and I think they do but I think I might have under sold Nick Chubb after watching him play this week for the crowds\nI mean I I kind of thought that he wasn't what he was before the the tree but I I may be wrong some they made this both their their gifted it running back\nThe reason I thought they missed Michelle the most is he was a two way back when he was in there he was as good a route runner Enron or at the same time all of their running backs now are a little bit one dimensional ... one guy catches the ball one guy runs the ball one guy who runs the ball wide\nUm here's my production with with Georgia\nThey don't run the ball as well they're going to be forced to go to the two quarterbacks system\nWhen they put Justin Fields in there they run the ball better because of his threat to keep the ball out of that extra man has made them better running the ball Kirby will not just go all passing with Jake from who pretty good quarterback he will want to keep running that ball\nAnd you know I'm not a big to quarterback advocate but I really think this might be the ear from I I really like some and feels will be able to handle it\nI think sometimes the the team will be able to handle it\nI don't know of Kirby and the press will\nBe all day and playing the two quarterback so you know that he's a he's a a really dynamic coach but he he's also\nSometimes he bristles at questions of you know the press has gone up\nSo bright how they handle that two quarterbacks dish in a situation could be something to watch but a ... they know they can play with Alabama and they're looking forward to play in Alabama so they definitely I think I told me all the next teams which one has the best shot\nGary do me a

couldn't be happier than to find out that way beyond bellies coming back to save me lazy about love James Caan or got off the such a great start\nIn his first game as a starter this year but since that James Carter is\nClearly been bottled up there's a lot of problems with the Pittsburgh Steelers and possibly levy on bell coming back will alleviate some of that here's the funny part about all this so what have you on a belt comes out and says I Love football I just want to play football\nThen why not come back now if you love football and you miss football want to play football so bad\nLast time I checked there's two games before the by week right this is going to be weak five there's going to be a week six game you have to buy a week and then we gate will be Cleveland so why not come back now we play the next two days you'll love it and miss it so much right\nHere's the other part about it I don't understand when it comes to lay beyond bell\nShow\nMissed four games you've given up eight hundred and thirty two thousand dollars per game a lot of money but yet you've now decided you're going to come back for the weekend game against Cleveland\nSo why are you going to give up the salaries a week number five a week number six\nBut you just started to come back we number eight and I'm not sure you get paid during your by we have no idea that work you probably do so why not just come back now with what those three checks we five six and seven you're talking do that's like two point five million dollars you got money to spare I guess\nIf you miss football love it's so much and you're willing to come back we number eight the better ideas just come back now because here's the issue\nYou're gonna end up play right this isn't going to be the James Harrison playbook of sit out the games come back the final six thick a hamstring injury not show up on the field at all and then you don't risk injury see that's not happening here lazy our bill will play is going to be risking injury\nAnd will do so at least let the eight nine ten eleven twelve Thirteen fourteen Fifteen ten games\nSo I have young bells going to play tennis\nSo if you're worried about risking injury per week number four and five five and six excuse me\nBut then why are you going to commit the plankton games really commit to playing games played games collect the pay checks have you got to tell the ACL or break a leg it's going to happen at some point right sitting out two more weeks will agree to play tennis games isn't exactly protecting your body\nFirst of all if he comes back this week they're not going to play him substantially week them or five at least you collect eight hundred and thirty two thousand dollars\nThere's no rhyme or reason if it's all about self preservation then why are you coming back it All right now why not commit to coming back week number ten or eleven you only have their\nCrews six six weeks of games to get the season towards your free agency Vincent\nJackson I think did literally the bare minimum the year he did the same thing why fewer levy on bill are you now after already sending out for weeks\nSaying you to sit out two and a half more why not just sit out all ten eleven weeks that you can before you have to come back if you are truly concerned about getting hurt\nIf the whole plan was to come back for a week number seven going into we've done very well I just sit out these games it only hurt you in the end you're the one that lost all this money you're the guy the last five million bucks or six million bucks stupid doesn't make it out to sense to me\nThis is like a half assed pulled out that's what this is either don't do it or go all the way that's how I look at it\nThis is like ... stopping and starting and stopping and starting like either just do it or don't do it stupid doesn't make sense and then if\nGod Forbid levy on bill has what happens ...

year in the wild card game lasted a third of an ending and has to be replaced against the Minnesota Twins got bailed out by is often says both that\nWell you could go really deep deep dive into the

P. was interviewing Aaron Boone and he said any kind of tried to trap and then he said so one of the benefits of starting Jay hype in the wild card game\nAnd the first answer from it was really good pitcher can answer it is so people thought maybe he's kind of giving some implication but why would you not start jab but he has been nothing but great for the Yankees in spring and then you can't look ahead to the red Sox and start thinking game one on one friday or Saturday the LDS\nYou can't overlook the Oakland A's of all teams\nI mean you can try but I mean they're legit team you know just one Ninety seven games with sheer luck\nSo I just I don't know maybe that's the bottom line for a for Aaron Boone is hey I'm overlooking Oakland I think well first of all look you know what here's the thing about it\nIf Louis Severino is really a semi still young what does he twenty four but he's really an ace well Shelly here you go you suck the last couple of months of the season going picture seven inning to a gym\nOkay do you want you did the first two months of the season where you are on hit a ball where every game it's eight innings three hits one walk in ten strike at a gym like that\nOnly run and then actually shut down the Oakland A's and upset Reno struggles any loses control and the slider knot sliding fastball dot triple digits you gotta get out of there 'cause he's incredibly hit a ball that point\nSo if you're a Yankee fan I I think you have to be a little worried here because most Yankee fans I don't believe have confidence in several you know not just because he pitched like crap down the stretch\nReally since the end of the all star break from the all star break but because the fact his lack of postseason success that ugly wild card game\nRight bottom line Shawn if your Aaron Boone who's your starter\nMust have your soccer right my start or J. happened over Lewis Severino I don't care what the numbers say that I don't have been their best stars since she\nWas acquired the ... in ... right I still would go to knock a based on last year he pitch wonderfully in the postseason he has the most experience I think in the post ... ... jobs that are on forever but pitching well at least\nI go talk at home I don't care what the split say and talk is earned run average at home is I think for yeah on the road I think it's on the three\nSo and that's what they're scared about I don't care because last year he pitched while at home in the playoffs so I'd go to the doctor because you can bring in separate or the backup to knock it to knock it has like three innings and he doesn't have a need brings that really don't have that he kept bringing knocking relief for several you\nYou can't bring into not going to leave Severino that Jay happiness postseason crazed pitched in three post seasons guys pitch Nineteen is bitch great nine two and a third innings twenty five hits ten walks Nineteen strike at three seven to ... got a one point eight one whip is not good\nNot in the last episode of two thousand and sixteen years I wanted wanted her to Seventy already in the postseason now to knock you mentioned last year and he had a great post season last year I mean he was far and away the best pitchers Yankees at last year\nTo knock a success in the postseason is\nReally good I mean twenty he's me for starts in the postseason he's too into the one point for for your ray\nWow twenty five innings only fourteen hits allowed six walks Twenty one strike out last year or two in one without pointing Ninety or re and three starts telling people out in ... last year I Will point six five\nSo he's not getting the nod instead it's going to be Louis Severino if you look at several Leno's postseason\nYou wonder just to think he just owes it to several you know 'cause the AIDS let's here's a here's several Reno's postseason numbers and that's for starts one in one of five point six three ER re sixteen innings Thirteen hits eight walks twelve strike out\nYou know what fifty fifty or fifty fifty chance who catches to knock him\nHe's All right with the jazz but you know what he but he was the worry though to knock his pitches they die if he's on\nRight that slider and he's like a ... major reason because they definitely want to start ... to catch the Yankees they don't want the bat I think they shouldn't but yeah but running back to the line up to where you just start Austin roll my patrol DACA yeah you're right I don't trust the interest catching the lead the major league by Mahler bats\nBalls and the only started like nineties over a hundred somewhat game that that\nGuy's a portrait behind the ... I don't care good his arm if you're gonna have to butcher behind the plate the Yankees do not need is often no they don't want to do you want to see this year that's a good point yeah what friends who was a better hitter you came to the Yankees August twenty six\nYou put it in a lie to put it often role money's an adequate hitter Sanchez is all or nothing these days yeah I really as bad a lot of

to this game\nSeth I'll tell you what though are the only thing you can really get into in regards to this game is ... really pulled after what eighty two pictures I Believe it was should have gotten more did do to you know maybe a little too early\nMaybe we're just you know picking hairs here but also the double switch getting a Charlie Black a bit out of the game as well a couple of innings or were you surprised by that\nThey're in love with double switch there I I understand it you know they're they're not thinking that we have a lead they just think they have a lead you know what I'm saying like the writer there they don't want to say we need to say black men in case we blow this [noise]\nSo I I I'm not I'm not disagreeing with you but I I understand why but black did that um my thought on it is\nI'm Free when was the was pushing a on a three days rest so you know he might have been gassed or I just think you have to ask 'em before we can judge that um [noise] I don't know I this game could go on for a long time and they're running out of players\nToo when you joined us tomorrow this gay might be going on still there's a chance yeah I told your producer Sean I said there's a chance you know if you really want me on I got to do it because the insurance shows going to be over by the\nWest and our Showtime what does this game could keep going and before you know visual players might be pitching as well it's been out over four hours into this one well let's move on to do to you know what to expect when it comes to the American league Louis Severino gets stored surprised by or booze decisions that\nAre easy second guess is the second us or I wouldn't have done it I didn't like it\nUm you know for me I Would have gone to naka or half and I understand the logic you don't want to throw a left or you can fill those writing letters so if you don't want to throw have because of that I buy it so that's why I go to knock her\nUm I think the rain has been\nFirst half he's been very inconsistent and I don't want to hear about electric stuff\nBut they had such a quick hook on him last year in the wild card games that are going to do the same thing so I think gives up ahead I mean they'll they'll have somebody up\nIt's going to be a battle of bull pen it's a weird thing because when you think of a of a of a winner take all type game you want you know the classic match ups you know what I mean I think that\nI Want to I Want to match up on something I can take my teeth and to kind of like what we saw it regularly tonight and uh you don't get that but\nThat's all right you know it'll be a lot a lot of uh pitching changes I you know I have a tradition you know are usually scored games when I go to games right and not think I'm filling out a scorecard smart and I\nKnow you'll go crazy trying to score your hands getting her from trying to fill out all the pictures and stuff like that and said you know it bothered me about the ... for that though [laughter] that's what got me said his like this to me it's like the the\nI don't even want to states is the mood but it's like All right my age I'm going to go with my eighth regardless the fact is obviously has much more postseason success\nThen Sabrina yeah I agree with you this is a move that easily you know the one that you can second guess now for Oakland they're doing the whole relieving Liam Hendricks gets the not he will pitch what an ending and what what's the expectation fires comes after that for three or four\n[noise] yeah I Would have gone with fires just the start out you know Bob Melvin tried to explain it didn't really make sense\nUm and it was weird because you know if you're going to go in that direction you know they've done that six times but it was always out of necessity I don't I don't necessarily understand what the necessity yes that that's right that's my only thing to know\nBut you know it's going to be strange game and I think that it'll be\nUm hopefully as as compelling you know\nThe the game the tie breaker yesterday the brewers cubs game was really compelling this a cubs Rockies game has been really compelling the Dodger rocky game I wasn't too impressed with and that's what I'm hoping for I guess I'm hoping for quality baseball 'cause all four of the division series look to be great\nAnd it's it's it's always great 'cause in my head when ... mentally I just I I Want five games from all of them but then once you see one team go up to oh I Want 'em over\nAt that point it's like I get the silver with our baseball inside is that the average joining us\nSo Dave Roberts has said he's rotation at least through the first couple of games and he said with an eye on game number five against the Atlanta Braves to claim cursed Yahoo's pitched every post season opener since two thousand nine for the Dodgers even though he would go on regular refs he goes game too because no chance he's going on three days rest this postseason\nGames Roberts wrong for looking ahead to a game five\nNo it's not a question of looking at five but I think he's doing is he's putting a crush on a position to succeed [noise]\nUm you know ... has struggled in three days rest and you know my I I don't know if you and I have ever had this conversation but I have a rule about three days rest if you want to throw a guy on three days rest you owe it to the picture to try it before you do it in the postseason\nYou might try something brand new in the in the play offs and the biggest stage and that's what they did with Clinton Kirsch up and I all I had said I remember the year that it was\nUh the Dodgers had a comfortable lead and my argument was very simply I said why can't you throw him on three days rest in late September in meaningless games\nIn and people are like oh how could you do that you risk an injury I could you and I'm thinking to myself well wait a second it's okay to risk an injury and have a guy be completely uncomfortable now\nBut you wouldn't try it in the regular season and I just think it's a lack of preparation in the post season the last thing you should be doing with any athlete is putting him in positions he's never been in before put people in positions to succeed and that's where I think the Roberts is thinking first of all he's been hurt this year\nSecond of all his innings aren't what they normally are I don't think he's got a rubber arm right now so if I'm going to do that I Need to have him for a potential elimination game ... what's the worst case scenario\nYou have to win one of those two games in Atlanta anyway so what's the difference if he puts his one or two\nBut the thing is though unfortunately blame herself morphs into another patron the postseason so you know ... we we talked about it oh my goodness I live on it right right David Price forget how good they are it's amazing to me speaking of\nDavid Price like of course he's not going to start game on what's your concern level though with Chris Sale with how we ended the season with his with his velocity noticeably down he is going to be the game on started an LDS for the red Sox\nI Am very concerned because there's no

year I mean come on such a\nIt's because they have to pay any way for two more years they might as well try to get something out of that means it's you know I I never like that you fire guy for being

six or seven teams that have a chance to beat up but hot quarterback in the college rules you catch a couple of fifty fifty balls\nThe you know a little one of those days are you where Alabama's not hitting on all cylinders but I Do say this in the off season\nI I my biggest question for Alabama was would mix tape and be able to handle coaching the team or it basically we as of this year\nWe're going to score forty two points and asked the other team can you because that's how good they were offensively but that doesn't fit mix he's always protected his defense he liked the win games twenty four ten\nAnd now the fact that you score that many he could get into these big twelve shootout type games or he's not as comfortable it looks like he just looked at it decided\nBut he and he was gone with it at ... dynamite when they do it I say this then\nThey lost a lot of players on the fence but especially in the secondary all six players that started but I I actually think they're better at corner certain fan and gigs Trayvon digs a step on big brother they're actually better corner than they were last year\nThey're not as good as safety that they will not be able to handle\nThe safety play they had a year ago but they're better corner and that that's a big goal by it I Do but you did because when I go out there and watch them practice I went oh my God these guys are six to\nAnd they're great [laughter] you know Gary interesting you said there are six or seven teams that could play with Alabama so let's get right to Georgia then in terms of pure ability in terms of talent on the roster he's Georgia neck and neck with family or they're a space between the two teams in your mind\nNot much they're extremely talented they're extremely deep\nUh in the game went to see what game that I watch before tennis we ... it was Missouri\nAre in the first half I counted they play twenty four defensive players and the first half of that came out they play a front three and they went ten deep and their rotation to stay fresh against true locked in the longest passed Lochte through that game was less than twenty five yards and that was to his tail back who ran the ball for that distance so\nThey're they're extremely gifted they're not as good a running team as they were a year ago I think they miss Isaiah when who was a very you know the number one draft pick for knowing on who is a very athletic offensive tackle now they're big\nThey're strong but they don't move as well and the confidence of line and I really think they miss [laughter] I I was going to say this that they really miss Sony Michel okay then yeah and I think they do\nBut I think I might have under sold Nick Chubb after watching him play this week for the browns\nI mean I I kind of thought that he wasn't what he was before the the injury but I I may be wrong some they may ... they're they're gifted at running back the reason I thought they miss Michelle the most is he was a two way back when he was in there he was as good a route runner Enron or at the same time\nAll of the running backs now are a little bit one dimensional ... one guy catches the ball one got run the ball one guy who runs the ball wide um\nHe was my prediction with with Georgia they don't run the ball as well they're going to be forced to go to the two quarterbacks system when they put Justin Fields in there they run the ball better because of his threat to keep the ball out of that extra man has made them better running the ball Kirby\nWill not just go all passing with Jake from who pretty good quarterback he won't wanna keep running that ball and you know I'm not a big to quarterback advocate but I really think this might be the ear if um I I I really like from and feels will be able to handle it\nI think sometimes it's the the the team will be able to handle it\nI don't know if Kirby and the press will be will pay and playing the two quarterbacks that he's a he's a a really dynamic coach but he he's also sometimes he bristles at questions of you know the process of Calais up\nSo bright how they handle that two quarterbacks dish in a situation could be something to watch but I'll let you listen they know they can play with Alabama\nAnd they're looking forward to play in Alabama so they definitely I think I if you told me all the next teams would you want to have the best shot I wouldn't say Georgia\nBigger surprise you just start the season Kentucky or LSU\nFor me it's going to be a shoo I thought Kentucky would be pretty solid you know I I I I really felt that this wasn't the team that had a lot of fourth and fifth year players\nUm you know they they have a team that is can depend on their running game they play good defense and I mean I just I just thought they'd be you know tough good team a and they are\nLSU the\nI tell you what I I just didn't think they would come this fast I really did now they have for NFL players on their defense that are really good defensive coach and David Miranda but ... says going to be a star in the NFL nobody even knows his name outside of the FCC\nInto white isn't Ruben foster type a linebacker ones like the wind as smart as can be one of the smartest quarterbacks I've ever seen all American corner and greedy Williams\nAnd grant they'll put their safety is a a Eric read type size guy for high draft choices and they blended well what the other players but you know finding a quarterback the way they have\nHas really changed them and what it's made them is I thought they'd really struggling wide receiver this year but what it's made them is because of his ability and I think confidence in the staff to throw the ball at any time\nThere receivers have stepped up their their the unsung heroes I never thought I'd say it you know 'cause I I thought that they'd be down this year but they're real\nUh you know I think they're the surprise of college football and I think you might have to say Joe girl was just

parents\nHere's correspondent we judge and traveling with the president in Mississippi\nIt really does call into question this ongoing refusal for the president to release his tax returns you know he could put all of its Tibet\nBy releasing his tax returns but he's like an ongoing bought it as a reason why he refuses to do that which breaks from decades of precedent set by his predecessors as we've seen so many former presidents do\nReporter Franco or don't as with McClatchy says it adds fuel to the Democrats fire for Democrats this is another example of the president not telling a truthful story about who he is CBS News update ... piper\nHere's your forecast from the weather I weather center scattered thunderstorms likely overnight otherwise over capsized loads of life around

wild card games that are geared overtime NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com normally a a big football day on the show and it's just still\nGoing to be a football day as well of course Landry are all NFL and college football insider joining us coming up a little later on in the program we'll do we talk or some football as we are a quarter of the way through the NFL seasons what's our biggest takeaways\nFrom that and then of course we gotta talk some college football like person I always do here on the program but let me keep you brush to what's going on in the national league wildcard game where they are still playing at the bottom of the thirteenth ending\nYeah bottom of the third teams the Rockies lead the cubs to one\nGame a has been basically what you think what you thought every wild card game was going to wind up being right [noise]\nYou know there are pictures getting the short leash or putting starters in in a normal relief appearance again being pause because of just strange things happening like\nA runner hugging the third baseman which which happened in this game\nA catcher getting hurt all swing a bat and just so many things going on in this game the cubs were trailing one nothing after just one and no one ever doubted with a sacrifice fly as Colorado to the early one nothing lead but then Jon Lester was great I thought they took them out too early but\nIt proved to be OK happier by as in the eighth inning wound up doubling a in a run into that tied the game and they would play into extra innings in the top of the thirteenth ending backup catcher Tony Walters facing Kyle Andrus\nA singled in front of her story and so that's where we are right now what is the bottom of the thirteenth ending with the cubs trail in the Rockies to toe one the winner will take on the Milwaukee Brewers\nIn the national league divisional series that will begin on Thursday eight five five three two three four NBC it's eight by five three two three four six to ...\nAnd this game featured two stars won a savvy veteran in Jon Lester who you absolutely trust in this situation and they post season game do or die game and the other side it was a cop Friedland a a young up and coming guy who had is pitching on short rest of the first time\nIn his professional career and ... and\nShe's a very nice job a very nice job in this game you know up and down the line up he he really didn't even want to talk about like Ben don't break I mean ... was dealing\nSolely dealing foreheads allowed through six and two thirds only walked one batter and then you take them out and you put it out of you know who it is a co watch watch picture this entire season and that's ultimately what happens no one gets wet up against Saddam you know\nBut hey the Colorado Rockies or bounce back they have now retired two outs there one out away from advancing to the division series against the Milwaukee Brewers\nAny American League that's going to begin on Wednesday and this is baseball and twenty eating\nThis is baseball and twenty team the Oakland A's or going within opener\nThat's right not a starter and opener and if you're not familiar with that term you probably haven't been paying close attention to baseball and when the team because teams have done this throughout the season where they go with a bullpen approach\nThe traditional starting pitcher is fading away\nThe a lot of teams this year decided to starting pitcher that has a traditional reliever\nNow look at what's your your own with a bunch of times for the race and that picture goes maybe one or two innings\nIn another picture and the the idea is to give the opposing team a different look every time there batters face a picture some know batter is facing a pitcher\nFor the second time throughout a lot of this is all saber metric study stats will show you\nThat throughout a first time seeing the pitcher the batting averages are one thing and the second time the batting averages are another thing and then the third time of course the batting averages completely increase and\nThe stats back that up\nStill teams most of the time will not allow a pitcher to face they line up three times\nBut now we're talking about let's not allow them to face the pitcher two times\nAnd that's where the idea of an Oprah comes in\nThe guy comes starts the game one or two innings out of the game next project comes in and in and out of the game next pitcher and ... you might use eight or nine pitchers\nAnd seems okay with that\nAnd that's what the Oakland A's or don't do on Wednesday against the New York Yankees I don't know if it'll backfire because what if one guy doesn't have it\nBut then again I think the New York Yankees even though they're starting Severino are going to go with a similar approach no I'm not saying Severino was going to go just won anything but I Do believe that there's something to it where maybe Seventy only goes\nTwo or three maybe three innings three maybe four innings I don't think he gets to the sixth inning I can tell you that much\nInto the final now in a ... in Chicago the Iraqis have defeated the cubs chew on in Thirteen innings Colorado will advance to take on the Milwaukee Brewers in the national league divisional series so the division series is set it is the A. N. out east against the NFL west\nThe Braves against the Dodgers you know central champion a brewers will take on the wildcard team from the west the Colorado Rockies I got to be honest\nAnd tell me what this means like I'm a bad guy sorry again I'm not I don't have a rooting interest right but for the sake of just um\nYou know for the sake of just being a baseball fan and and watching things play out I was kind of hoping that the Rockies would win because we just saw the brewers and cups\nAnd play the one game playoff and the brewers won\nI didn't want to watch what five more games of the brewers and cubs owners do the brewers for somebody else\nSo now they'll face the Rockies I think it worked out\nDoes that make me a bad guy no not at all I'm with you actually\nIt also means the battle of the Bruce\nCourse Bill Miller park\nAvenue that I did there\nThat that might be the most intelligent thing you've ever said on this program\nReally got did you read that somewhere no I I I made that up\nKnow you get in I did\nEight five five three two three four NBC eight five five three two three four six to do\nSo we as I'm watching the celebration here I'm of the Colorado Rockies you know I don't really like this [laughter]\nI really don't I mean I actually\nI guess so I guess it's okay\nI just feel like do you really celebrate like this winning a wild card game and then just getting the division series\nBecause I don't I I feel like you should just celebrate when you when I guess this is when maybe I'm being maybe I'm being anti fun\nI just think that the idea of seven different champagne celebrations just kind of gets over don't don't you think because these teams they they pop the champagne when they clinched the playoffs then they pop the champagne when they when the division and they pop the champagne when they when a playoff rounds and then another playoff rounds\nWe're talking about at what we're talking about teams that could have what division series tear playoffs division division series championships series World Series five different champagne celebrations\nBut hey if you get soundbites like we have from ... to me that's all good juicy your boy next you\nKnow I did wrong drunk with his shirt off dancing guarantee World Series victories\nHe said we're going back and we'll get a win [noise] wife or the party\nLife or the party he will will\nBecause he was holding two beers and acting like he was having a a a great time let's hear from ...\nTo hear that the reading of original wind up ... seats on what the scientists swing\nAnd then he proceeded do a little dance and then shower the reporter with beer\nThis sound like a sober now do you\nThink\nThat the original wearing their policies on science that ...\n[laughter] I promise you baby\nThat I'm good fun song in a Dodgers will take on the Atlanta Braves than the national league division jurors will begin on Thursday a Yankees\nAnd the Ajmi American League wildcard game coming up here on a Wednesday and I talked about how\nThese teams are going on as soon as the ... are going with an open or something that is non traditional in post season play when it's something Bob Melvin talked about and was asked who's going to pitch after ...\nYou know there are a lot of moving parts so I can tell you will have eleven pitchers will have fourteen position players oh it's going to go after Liam we're still kind of deciding who may be the last guy on the eleven pitchers so uh I'll probably would hold that at this point\nMhm William and drinks on getting the start\nJust the same as any other theme of the guys and whoever comes up comes up and the other guy that have to get I mean it doesn't really bother me too much who's going to be up with our did against them before because every games different obviously new ballpark different\nDifferent settings and everything like this but with the same I going to get as many as I can whether it be I mean I'm trying to convey I'm trying to go for six innings typically start at the center over the bullpen but we'll see how it goes\n\nWell we'll see how it goes\nI think that um\nThe Yankees are favored for a reason\nThink their lineup is better\nBecause now they're healthy and I think that they um I I think it's a lot different than this team is a lot different than what they look like way that they were struggling a over the past two months or so\nI Would favor the Yankees and this came over the Oakland A's eight five five three two or three or four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six it to to waiting on some post a game a reaction\nFrom the Colorado Rockies or who have just defeated the cubs in the wild card game and advance now to the division series against the Milwaukee Brewers Libya corps game similar course game next to the middle of course if you're yeah can I ask something\nYou can ask me something that embrace by hobby and Nolan\nThat had been interference it should have been if no one there or not or tried to fight through it and the fact that no one hour NATO kind of laughed\nAnd that's the reason why there was no interference call because all our NATO had to do and I've been in this situation before and what you hear him you're told just sell sell out just sell sell sell make it look like something even if you're even if you're wrong and there's nothing there like you got to sell it\nEven if there was no play at second base or there was no play at first base\nNo one ever doubt has got to pretend to try and make that play so unhappy are biased sticks\nHis hands out and tries to wrap 'em up like my dad I was just trying to avoid it collisions that I'm going to hug you and and and we're all smiles no no no no no no\nNo one hour and I got to try and get out of his crashed and try and throw the ball first I'll tell you what the best thing he could have done was\nEven if the runner was safe sale\nIt over to the first baseman Ted just throw it just throw it\nBecause then you can really claim\nThat you were trying to make the double play\nAnd then you get the engineering school didn't matter the God of the inning anyway in the Rockies won the game but had the Rockies\nLast year that would have been a point of contention\nMan you know\nSo many things happen in this game\nSo many things happen in this case\nThe cubs just failing to hit which they've done recently but even the run that out of you know gave up it was on an oath to count\nAnd he had not given up a hit on oh two capitals season's\nFirst season\nBut when it came down to the courts moments in the thirteenth ending it wasn't on heralded backup catcher named Tony Walters who came through\n[noise]\n[noise] to to talk for a third tours what he's\nTony Walter ...\nHow many people know who Tony Walters is\nWell\nNo one's going to forget in Colorado if they wind up having a a a season\nYou know a post season for the ages here\nWalter quick note on Tony\nHe hadn't had a kid has September back in I

playing like since I was a little league or not I never played little league but it was um a you've never played little league\nKnow because when I was that age we played I guess it was called the pony league maybe back then so like I was twelve years old and we were playing with leading and stealing and further bases yeah little league than\nThan little league will now they have the babe Ruth Lee as well right by played Babe Ruth but um I think it was the pony we back them which might have actually been ... my I think the pony we became the Cal Ripken league maybe\n... or I don't know I literally either I play regular part modern or what they called it but\nI Swear I played I played pony um\nPony league or that's what that's what I never did I literally\nDifferent rules man it's again it's a different organization yeah but baseball is leading off I I can eat off of it and I know ridiculous yeah so when I got that's when I was twelve years old we played we had um\nWe had ... I think it was like Seventy foot bases instead of what little league is like sixty I think yeah and then we move and then we also did I'm a yeah further pitching mound and we had leading and stealing and all that stuff yeah and little league it's hard to get anybody out the bases are so close\nYes anyway when I was saying was when I was a whenever I was we um we had the house leave like you know the the inhouse league\nRight and then obviously you have an all star team\nComprised from that house league that would go on to faced other towns\nThat's how it works in in all little organizations correct your lawyer with this process I I yeah okay so\n... the teams the three um best teams right or three best teams or whatever\nWe're um or two best teams\nCan kill coincidentally here where the red Sox\nRight in in this in my little league and the red Sox which I was not on and the Rockies which I was on\nAnd then we had a one kid who played he was the picture on the pirates\nThe entire all star team\nMade up of kids from the Rockies kids from the red Sox and the one kid from the pirates\nSo we called our all star team the Pittsburgh rock socks\nOh nice yes but we were we like to before we got that kid that played for the\nWhere the rock socks that was hurting so when I look at it has to Iraq sober I just think about the rock socks which was my fourteen year old or whatever a whole roll out what I Would order whatever age I was that all start seem that year in which the whole the whole all star team was just too was who was just sweaters from two teams\nThat league was not very spaced out of there that much it was not very spaced out\nEight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six to ... graduation instead of Colorado Rockies said just a just a tremendous job and now that will take on the Milwaukee Brewers I guess or they're too busy the showering themselves in champagne\nOr before we get anybody to the podium Seattle that island he said nothing I've come across yeah yeah I guess they're just they're they're getting drunk not not speaking\nAs of yet we'll get some more baseball though before we end the show a little preview of the Yankees\nAnd the eighties although I pretty much told you who I'm going with in the wild card game and does not because I'm a Yankee fan and no it's not because I Want to go to the division series which I Will the Yankees win but no I I Do think that they will have the advantage of being home and I do think they have the advantage with\nThe pitcher and their bullpen as well even though I think the training and for Reno and those guys have been fantastic for the old days\nYou can hit me up on Twitter at Scott's on their S.

NFL season\nThen of course we are in two weeks six of the college football season is welcoming Chris Landry Landry football dot com joins us each and every week here on the program and of course we are done with a quarter of the NFL season and I repeat myself every single night on\nThe show because I like to tell my audience that yes we break down the NFL season in the four corners sixteen games schedule\nFor quarters of four games so after the first quarter of the season my major takeaways won the rams are the best team in the NFL to Patrick homes might be the most valuable player and freebie Atlanta Falcons kept play a lick of defense\nFrom the first quarter of the season ah that's pretty good I I say that\nYou hit on a few things there um the rams are really a complete team I worry about the chiefs defense but poor motor homes is just phenomenal and what they're doing with them is great\nUm the patriots are are not dead and and I thought the dolphins would would maybe have a chance to do when they did and uh the the north might be worth watching now Pittsburgh is Doug themselves the whole uh Cincinnati Baltimore Cleveland being in that race\nI tell you another thing that I'm slowly watching there is a tough well coach football team out in Tennessee titans are pretty good it's gonna be the titans in Jacksonville know about and that division\nAnd then uh you know in in the NFC eagles off a little bit of a slow start\nThe bears yeah team to beat through the first quarter the season now the team to be they love the bass or in in the north and the saints do maybe they can play a little bit better defense you write the falcons of all nobody maybe for safe Carolina\nPlays any defense in the NFC South so I'm ... it's we're starting to get some clarity and I'm very curious to see what teams can stamp off the first quarter of the season and start to kind of build off of it\nThe other thing that jumps out at me as I just had a sense that you know what happened was doing in the first couple of weeks with full school and they're back to into and they are what I thought they were\nYeah they're going they're going back to James wins the no as well it's amazing that ends the south has become the big twelve or with the way they had no defense Chris and I get it and it has injuries there you're on defense but\nThey are averaging thirty points per game allowed you can't be a successful football team when they're giving up over thirty points per game known ... and ... ... they're blowing ... leans because they can't stop anybody\nOut at the exactly right I mean just the they just needed a clock to run out on Cincinnati because Cincinnati is long that apply laugh and that's exactly what happened they scored on the last ... plus some I think Dan Quinn is going to improve this day fence a little bit but I'm gonna tell you what's happening right now I'm seeing it on tape\nThey're getting gash in the middle they missed the un Jones they missed their to starting safety's\nPeople are attacking them in the middle of the field down the scene and they've got no answer they're going to have to completely adjuster coverage looks\nAnd they'll get better I don't think there will be good defensively but they'll get better they cannot keep you know continuing to lose games\nEven though they're scoring thirty points a game um but it's a problem now I'm very curious to see if the St start to play a little bit better defense I Know the giants off and says not a good litmus test but they played better um Drew Brees is playing well they get\nA mark Ingram back so that'll help their dates and so bad but the temple excuse me Atlanta's in a bad way right now and I still think it's gonna you know be Tampa likely finishing fourth I think the falcons we'll get back to respectability but\nAh I don't think that they're gonna come all the way that\nYou mentioned a Tennessee before and I agree I think we have to start paying attention to what the titans are doing it in my ramble deserves a ton of credit because\nHe is really changed the way that this tendency team plays because now they play with this attitude in this confidence like they know that they're going to stop you and you know even with markers Mario to hang up and you can barely hold the football and he's got that special outfitted glove on his and\nThey just know they're confident that they're going to stay in every game and I think that that's really a testament to what the head coach brings anytime I see an attitude change with the football team I always look at the coach\nYeah and let's keep in mind that you know he comes in\nAnd hit heritage inherited team that was not a complete rebuild I mean this was one of those cases where some of my mind folks they made the playoffs last year and the coach gets fired so it's not like the complete rebuild but it's an added to change it is an added to change the plane better today than there are more physical at the line of scrimmage both sides of the law under scrimmage\nAnd Mario to I think is a winner I think he's the guy that you can win with I don't think he's a great talent he certainly not like the young guys that we talk about you know mobile homes or charity golf for Carson wins or any of those but\nHe's a guy you can win around and I think Mike is taken that New England approach the general manager John Robertson has taken the knowing one for approach they both come from there um Jacksonville more talented team\nBut Tennessee is certainly a consistent physical football team and I think they're gonna gonna stay in this race with Jacksonville is I said that's a new team race and um you know Tennessee reminds me\nOf and they asked if the north the north ... when when Pittsburgh and Baltimore at that best ... that's ... Tennessee has thing and they could be in that division and kinda just fit right in with those ...\nI I Would agree with that they look like that type of team as well let's start with the New York giants are for a second Chris and uh I watch some film on them I'm Brian balding or did a great job of pinpointing one of these places where you I met him ... down to\nTo sterling shepherd on like a wide receiver screen it was like a third in ... when the or whatever the play was\nAnd he didn't even take a chance to throw it oh do Beck and juniors way and he was open on the route could've thrown down the hill and people say oh the giants happens of wine is so bad but what ball he did and when I watched that film Eli had clean pockets all game and the biggest thing that that disturbs me the most\nWatching that game Chris was the ... the states we talked about how they don't play defense they came into that game allowing over three hundred yards per game passing\nLarry Enright manning waited until the final two possessions of the game to throw a ball more than nine yards down the field I don't care if the guy's not open and you know what's going to be incomplete\nYou gotta throw the ball down the field to test the defense that is the worst in the NFL being thrown act\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think I'm\n... ... ... to put it bluntly just done have confidence in his all friends of mine and even when it's clean I think he's into some ...\nSome pressures and I don't think he has a great deal of confidence in his arm or to make some of those ... I think those things that I saw I'm the same thing I saw some opportunities to you've got to get the ball down the hill to some degree if you don't have a hard time ah being able to be successful with defenses that are come pressing\nTheir formations because you can stretch the field they're going to have to do that and maybe they're gonna have to do a little bit more in early downs\nPaves the following three to go to the future [noise]\nHey you have a nice house why don't I you didn't have any money buddy if only there was a way I could go back in time and fix that yeah\nSay something or the features put away a FEMA feel like a million bucks for free way to save the debate that aren't that data learn\nThis message across you by the American Institute of surfer accountants and the council do view petrified\nYou're struggling with your mortgage payments\nAre not knowing what to do\nYou do nothing but did you\nDo something you're far more likely to get the most positive about\nMaking Home Affordable it's a free government program called ... nine Ninety five to talk one on one with a housing expert about your options called eighty nine Ninety five or visit making Home Affordable to go to when he was treasury on on the council\nI'm a college student and could use advice about my student loan I had to leave school and go to work now I have to pay back student loans fringe agree I don't have fortunately I found assistant\nBack in college I figured they wouldn't let me more than I could easily pay back boy was I wrong thankfully I got the help I needed to pay back my loan and full\nSound familiar the good news is student loan repayment are available where the NFC the national foundation for credit counseling\nNon profit organization member officers nationwide that provide comprehensive financial reasons do low incomes and have these these sort of like consumer credit counselors provide one on one my natural and can you help me with valuing options were making student loan payments reducing\nInterests consolidation or even loan rehabilitation\nSeven for him to return to visit us online [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nYou\nCan always catch up on the ...\n[noise]\n\nI got all the time I got out and work here with Chris Landry Landry ball dot com as we continue the conversation was often at the oh now that's getting through a little college football Chris\nAnd the worst fears any Clemson fan king true in that game Chris you know when when when Kelley wind decide to leave that seem after being demoted the question was well what would happen if Trump rewards ever got hurt well he has to leave the game with a concussion and\nAll of a sudden you're down to your third string quarterback and let's just be fair the third string quarterback a glimpse into the string quarterback and a lot of countries out there I've got a book clubs and found themselves trailing their heads a squirrel late touchdown to salvage the victory\nAnd now I guess Lawrence is going to start this week but boy I felt like if that could he would've texted Kelly Brian at halftime and said hey you want to reconsider\n[laughter] yeah I I I think that um I I don't know I I think I Know you're kidding I I think he's\nA ... I don't think that would go over very well a lot from I think most people in the locker room while they support Kelly Brian I I think they look at it as say you know what I'm\nSaying they won't say there's probably but but I I've been around the block grants to know that don't know the guy is not with us She's decided not to be with us\nAh we love 'em for what he did but you know when you walk out on us you know walking back and I know you're just getting but but it the day you know what I kept thinking I was about ... ... ... we forget hundreds and transferred to pass off the ... Islami thinking\nI should have stayed there 'til I mean they got him in ...\nIs really let me tell you something about Kim writes nobody knows about him but the coaches they're told me because I saw him a little bit in high school tape and and you know there's just limited you could do there but the coaches told me in and you have these conversations in the spring and the summer and they told me to tell me about this they said you know this Christ this kid\nIs is it's got the it factor I mean this kid\nCan make place and he just balls out in the scout team and so let me tell you something hop out coming in on the third down a path you fall down pat and I mean he was dealing and so I listen good for them\nA lot of people have maybe criticize them for hey they weren't all that impressed the they they I thought they would you know kind of put the hammer down on on a on Syracuse because of what happened last year but\nI think forever Lawrence's injury had a lot to do with it and I think it was kind of a couple of things jump out at me\nConfidence offensive line is not dominating like I thought they would ... the defensive line doesn't dominate against the run I talked about James Franklin in this so I'm not picking on James it's it's maybe a similar issue with the apple\n... climb since teams don't play with the finish in the focus that you know you normally would like to see certainly no one is doing it like Alabama or knows that but you know they just\n... you know even with the issues that quarterback\nThat defense should have taken over the game a lot earlier now they didn't lay and they want it I think they deserve credit for bathing Syracuse um I I kind of question dino ... and that I think he's a he's gray to get news teams up kind of see a trend here but but\nHis teams struggle last year they struggled but they lost or done gee so I Want to see how Syracuse handles the rest of their business because I think they can win a lot of games the rest of the year but to me when I look at Clemson I'm thinking but they're not quite playing like a team that's ready for the play offs but they don't have to be yet\nSo let's see how much did you sit that defense could start to dominate and they all kinds of lines start to take over games because I think Lawrence can make in a place in the past and game form the way they can be that team they need to go and be OK they can't have missed out\nA warning last Clemson in my mind is out ... the ACC very weak is very weak and it's going to hurt them it's going to hurt them big time and the\nACC Championship game would've been a problem in fact I even tweeted it out now that it's over it's it's a moot point do you realize that if Syracuse had held on\nThat Syracuse would've had to lose twice a week yeah because they own the land members are in in I mean I'm telling you\nI mean it's not good North Carolina is not good global bad I mean you know now\nIn the state and I'd be see my point is is\nSyracuse I mean we were taught by Syracuse winning that that's how disasters that could have been but they are voted it\nWill shift pumps and takes care of business it's still a pretty weak schedule and I think if they can get that confidence built up and I know that they have the talent to play with anybody in the country but they've got some work to do and\nThey've got to be careful going forward you know wait this week the win in the state that can catch a hot to find family but again Florida State global I we talked about Boston College would get some early points against bc\nAnd then they're done young adult that's the trouble to is always a challenge so I think there's some things that some good football left and um what they are of all\nHis Chris Landry Landry

championship game like to a dead who knows where this touch the point is is you're in a position to where the prevalence stays healthy or ... you don't need to play it could still protect your rich or you're ... you're not\nTurning your back on your team you're with your team and you're helping them you still can preserve what you want\nBut you still could be there if the opening comes back because what do you want you want to play well guess what you might be the starting quarterback in the national playoffs this year before you know it we don't know what's coming around the corner last year at this time\nNo one including Nick Saban forecast that too was going to be low the guides are examining your game so you don't know\nThat's what bothers me in that I think that and I did a podcast that day and folks if if you if your car journalism to it if you're a I'm old school and I and I admit it but I went into a diatribe for about thirty minutes in the first part of my pod cast\n... on the line or football pie ... about how the regression of the team concept is taking place we're seeing in the NFL ended up being in college and I understand you need to look out for yourself and I think it's a capitalistic society and the ... I get all that but\nThis is the ultimate team game and I think we need to look at certain things about again maybe a ... fine playing in a game differently you got to have a more snaps hepatitis snaps and not just the parents in a game and I do think that\nPersonally I don't know how ... I think dabbled tried to hand within ... and I'm disappointed that Kelly didn't say I'm going to stick it out here coach and if I get a chance to go in and be the start again I Will uh if not\nThe I'll sit there and help the team and be part of the team and then because what what is it going to do what's he doing now it's not going to play any ... play with anybody the rest of the year though he could be helping his team he could be honest it could be doing and still get his year next year but\nYou know he felt like he's disrespected no young man you're not disrespected and you're going to learn in life that life's not fair and somebody's better than you somebody's going to be drought for a job and you're gonna have to learn how to suck it up and just continue to compete\nAnd I think we're sending bad messages out that a young man so anyway I don't want to go out you know the truth I mean look at what June hurts decided to stay\nIn the dead now you know in a commended for it should be and he got a standing ovation when he went into the game\nAnd and it just as you mentioned that you don't think people are savvy fifth game last week they know that right now again let's remind everybody ... got two years yeah so well now he's going to have one but he had two years to play with so he's still can transfer in December as a graduate and have another year left\nKelly is done at the end of this year so I get it but\nThis is a case where Jay Lynn decided it's a smart move for him because a he could be a factor he's playing every game he may get three hundred snacks this year when it's all said and done so it's going to be a factor into it he's going to be a great team made\nA and the other thing is I don't know and I don't blame you out there if you're not watching it I have to I have to and I enjoy watching it\nDan ... says done a great job with improving ... skills um hockey and I know it's not about the results in the completion but how much more comfortable is dropping back so my point is Danny notice the outstanding or tobacco yet Alabama I'm\nI think he's doing a great thing so he's developing so you get it jailing is developing skills as a quarterback under a great quarterbacks coach he's part of a winning team\nAnd he's contributing and who knows he may be the starter if two goes down or something happens [noise]\nUm and then he can go and transfer somewhere else now again he has that option with another year understand Kelly doesn't but Kelly could do there do everything else that jail is doing except playing the games unless they have to turn to Kelly 'cause I'm gonna tell you it forever large where to go down with an injury\nThen as much as they like Cameron Bryce they were going with Kelly back to Kelly bright so the point is is Kelly could have been the ...\nHaving to you know he can run Scott team let Bryce get number two rats still be part of the team and still not ruin he ... he could have done all that but he decided that I don't want to be a part of the team anymore that just bothers me and that maybe I'm wrong but that's just how I feel about it\nBefore we go Chris I leave you with the funniest thing that I saw on Twitter this week a Twitter account called college teammates which are posts um pictures of pro stars where they played on the same college team it's kinda cool a picture of an Alabama backfield\nWhere it says TJ yelled and I wouldn't come era Derek Henry and Kenyan drink out of Alabama in twenty Thirteen\nBest part about this picture they'll Chris\nI Would come areas not in it and how often come merits weeded out I'm not even in that pick brother was a picture of himself is Alabama Jersey number twenty eight are clearly not picture to pick up right layers and these are at that\nTime and he wanted to make the move because he saw he saw how good of a back to it was and he went to Tennessee I tell you though I don't want to pile on anyone and I know he's gone but I just can't help but say at\nCalvin ... couldn't get on the field for much down to Tennessee I mean in that I'm missing and it just it that does speak volumes to the problems that they had their with budget cuts awesome but uh [noise] uh no water by it they they just reload and boy\nIs Alabama content in the I'm telling you folks airplanes so many young guys are getting prepared and they're they're getting better and getting better and playing well improving I mean this is uh they certainly have set the standard yes it's a week's schedule but\nI don't know that anybody looks at it and says you know you can replace team ABC DNA and put you know X Y Z and\nAnd they'd still be rolling over people they're they're in a class amongst themselves and you know the thing about it is there in that category of\nYou know just like Ohio State Clemson Georgia or they can only be themselves the problem is there's Alabama didn't beat themselves Clemson tends to do it sometimes Ohio State does it uh Georgia hasn't done it but they kind of playing around with it other teams debate themselves\nAlabama doesn't seem to do it that's why there's such great separation there great but they play did their

head\nThe way there's a lot of hair on his head thank goodness even though I'm forty still man I don't want to hear myself why isn't anybody excited about this NBA season\nLet me give you some perspective here were officially intimate league baseballs postseason right\nHonestly I have no idea who should be considered the favorite to win the world series you make an argument for the Astros can make an argument for the red Sox Yankees bats get hot with that bullpen they could win it right\nCleveland that for starting pitchers who struck out over two hundred batters this year they weren't

there is such unpredictability when it comes to the NFL that's the beauty of it who's a Super Bowl favorite right now I have no idea you can call me up and make an argument for New England\nYou can

Golden State warriors friend who started liking that team four years ago\n... that's when it comes down to besides a warriors fan why isn't anybody excited for the upcoming NBA season to watch their team at best finishing second here in eastern conference steam water you hope to get to the finals and not get swept by Golden State\nIf you're on rockets fan you helped somebody named curry or do rent or both or Thompson or whatever\nGets injured and maybe you have a chance besides that once the excitement\nIt's the most predictable sport today in this country there's nothing unpredictable without the NBA the outcome is determined already in fact the outcome was determined the day after the finals ended\nAnd if you think otherwise you're both sides you cannot be excited for a basketball season where you are literally rooting for the runner up that's what happens\nAnd if the Golden State warriors don't win at all it is for one of two reasons one they've been beset by so many injuries that's why they lose or two they beat themselves and maybe the greatest upset in basketball history okay that's when it comes down to\nIf you've ever thought of it invincible team visit and by the way there's eighty two meaningless regular season games before we even get to the ... and the first round the playoffs won't be fun when golden state's a one or two seats beating up on a seven or eight seed that's not going to be fun\nNot the fun only begins literally okay ooh literally but western conference finals and we are like nine months away from that\nSo you can sit here and tell me man I'm so stoked the NBA season is getting underway this is awesome can't wait to show up at Madison Square garden or the staple center and feel my team can do oh man this is Austin abroad and the Lakers

the league opens up\nWhich means you completely understand the league's cause right now but when it gets pretty determined it's over but it was shown the mock yeah at least I can say one thing about you and that is you are like me are\nNot excited for this upcoming NBA season because it's a\nPredetermined outcome well that's true but I was going to play devil's advocate here I Do yes I can see the war and people have said that yeah [laughter] that's ever come on that one [laughter]\nBlue I Do ah let me let me tell you this is the Houston Rockets did they not go to seven games with the Golden State warriors without their starting point guard Chris Paul so last two\nAh yes and they were not that I'm not a competitive series and was that the Houston Rockets not have a chance to\nWin that series they did if they were out and that was shocking about a chance to up and the Golden State warriors the editing today that's exactly why they don't have a chance [laughter]\nDo you really think the markets are cousins fits that Golden State system no no no right so then or even I honestly don't obviously to upgrade over muggy\nBut here's the funny thing about half core player right

P. was interviewing Aaron Boone and he said any kind of tried to trap and then he said so one of the benefits of starting Jay hype in the wild card game\nAnd the first answer from brewers well he's a really good pitcher it's a good answer it is so people thought maybe he's kind of giving some implication but why would you not start jab the guy's been nothing but great for the Yankees in spring and then you can't look ahead to the red Sox and start thinking game one on one friday or Saturday the LDS\nYou can't overlook the Oakland A's of all teams\nI mean you can try but I mean they're legit team you don't just wouldn't Ninety seven games with sheer luck\nSo I just I don't know maybe that's the bottom line for a for Aaron Boone is hey I'm overlooking Oakland I think well first of all look you know what here's the thing about it\nThey Louis Severino is really an ace and he's still young what is your twenty four but if he's really an ace well Shelly here you go you suck the last couple of months of the season going pitch a seven inning to a gym\nGuy do what you did the first two months of the season where you are on hit a ball where every game it's eight innings three hits one walk in ten strike cats go have a gym like that\nCan only run and then actually shut down the Oakland A's and upset Reno struggles then he loses control and the slider knot sliding fastball dot triple digits you got to get out of there because he's incredibly hit a ball that point\nSo if you're a Yankee fan I I think you have to be a little worried here because most Yankee fans I don't believe have confidence in Severino not just because he pitched like crack down the stretch\nReally since the end of the all star break from the all star break but because the fact is lack of postseason success that ugly wild card game\nRight bottom line Shawn if your Aaron Boone who's your starter\nMuscle here soccer right my short or J. happen over Lewis every now and I don't care what the numbers say that I I Know Jay have been their best star oh since he\nWas acquired the ... right I still go to knock are based on last year he pitch wonderfully in the postseason he has the most experience I think in the post ... ... jobs that are on forever but pitching well at least\nI go to knock at home I don't care what the split say and talk is earn on average at home is I think for yeah on the road I think it's on the three\nSo and that's where the scared about I don't care because last year he pitched while at home in the playoffs so I'd go to the doctor because you can bring in separate or the backup to not have to knock it has like three innings and he doesn't have a need bringing several have that you can't bring to knocking relief for several you\nYou can't bring into not going to leave Severino that Jay happiness postseason crazed pitched in three posts seasons dies pitch Nineteen is bitch great nine two and a third innings twenty five hits Ken walks Nineteen strike at three seven to ... got a one point eight one whip is not good\nNot in the last episode of two thousand and sixteen years I wanted wanted her to Seventy or re in the postseason now to knock you mentioned last year and he had a great postseason last I mean he was far and away the best pitching the Yankees at last year the postseason to knock a success\nIt is really\nGood I mean twenty he's me for starts in the postseason he's two and two it's a one point for for ... ray wow twenty five innings only fourteen hits allowed six walks Twenty one strike at\nLast year or two in one with a point nine ER ray and three starts chemical out in ... last year had a we have a point six five\nSo he's not getting the nod instead it's going to be Louis Severino if you look at several Reno's postseason\nYou wonder just to think he just knows that this ever you know 'cause he's the eighth or let's here's a here's several Reno's postseason numbers and that's forced starts one in one of five point six three ER re sixteen innings Thirteen hits eight walks twelve strike outs you know what\nFifty fifty or fifty fifty chance who catches to knock him\nHe's All right but Sanchez but you know what he but here's the worry though to knock his pitches they die if\nHe's on right that slider of his anatomy to ... they definitely want to start ... to catch the Yankees doesn't want the bat I think they shouldn't but yeah but really I mean up back to the lined up to where you just start Austin roll my patrolling ... yeah you're right\nI don't trust the interest catching the lead the major league by ... balls and the only started like Ninety solar hundreds on my game that's it\nGuys a boat for behind the ...

hobby by as\nTrying to end the year he had by the way my goodness you talking about a guy who's like kind of show this skill right here and they're like okay he puts it altogether\nHe's going to be dangerous well guess what he put it all together and how the bias has been flat out ridiculous this year our baseball insider sets ever it obviously glued as well to this game\nSays I'll tell you what though are the only thing you can really get into in regards to this game is ... really pulled after what eighty two pitches I Believe it was should have gotten more ... you know maybe a little too early\nMaybe we're just you know picking hairs here but also the double switch getting Charlie Black out of the game as well a couple of innings and were you surprised by that\nThey are in love with double switch there I I understand that you know they're they're not thinking that we have a lead they just think they have a lead you know what I'm saying like that right there they don't want to say we need to say black men in case we blow this [noise]\nSo I I I'm not I'm not disagreeing with you but I I understand why but black to that um my thought on it is\nI'm Free when was uh was pushing a on a three days rest so you know he might have been gassed or I just think you have to ask and before we can judge that um [noise] I don't know I this game could go on for a long time and they're running out of players\nToo when you join us tomorrow this game might be going on still there's a chance yeah I I I I told your producer Sean I said there's a chance you know if you guys really want me on I got to do it because uh there's a chance to show is going to be over by the\nTime we have left with our show time left in this game could keep going and before you know position players might be pitching as well it's been out over four hours into this one well let's move on to do to you know what to expect when it comes to the American league Louis Severino get stored surprised by air booze decision stuff\n[noise] ah some easy second guess easy second guess uh I wouldn't have done it I didn't like it [noise]\nUm you know for me I Would have gone to ... or ... and I understood the logic you don't want to throw a lefty against all those ready hitters so if you don't want to throw have because of that I buy it so that's why I go to knock her\nUm I think Serena has been not as good as the first half he's been very inconsistent and I don't want to hear about electric stuff\nBut they had such a quick hook on him last year in the wild card games that are going to do the same thing so I think gives up ahead I mean they'll they'll have somebody up\nIt's going to be a battle of bull pen it's a weird thing because when you think of a of a of a winner take all type game you want you know the classic match ups you know what I mean I think back to\nI Want to I Want to match up for something I can take my teeth into kind of like what we saw it regularly tonight and uh you don't get that but\nThat's all right you know it will be a lot of lot of uh pitching changes I you know I have a tradition you know are usually score games when I go to games right and not think I'm going out to guard smart and I\nKnow you'll go crazy from a scorecard your hands getting her from trying to fill out all the pictures and stuff like that I said you know what bothered me about the whole ... for that though that that's what got me Saturday's like this to me is like the the\nI don't even want to state the seafood but it's like alright several of my age I'm going to go with my age regardless of back to knock is obviously has much more postseason success\nThen several you know I I agree with you and this is a move that easily you know the one that you can second guess now for Oakland they're doing the whole relieving Liam Hendricks gets the not he will pitch wanted anything and what what's the expectation fires comes after that for three or four\n[noise] yeah I Would have gone with fires just the start you know Bob Melvin tried to explain it didn't really make sense um and it was weird because you know if you're going to go in that direction you know they've done that six times but it was always out of necessity I don't I don't know\nYes that's right that's my only thing some now but you know it's going to be a strange game and I think that it will be um hopefully as as compelling you know the the game the tie breaker yesterday the brewers cubs game was really compelling this a cubs Rockies game has been really compelling the\nDodger rocky game I wasn't too impressed with and that's what I'm hoping for us I'm hoping for quality baseball 'cause all four of the division series looked to be great\nAnd it's it's it's always great because in my head mental mentally I just I I Want five games from all of them but then once you see one team go up to oh I Want them over [laughter]\nSay that points like I just get the filled with our baseball inside of set the average joining us so Dave Roberts has said he's rotation at least through the first couple of games and he said it was an eye on game number five against the Atlanta Braves because claim car show who's pitched every post season opener since two thousand nine to the Dodgers\nEven though he would go on regular refs he goes game too because\nNo chance he is going on three days rest this postseason\nRight David Roberts wrong for looking ahead to a game five\nNo it's not a question of looking to five but I think he's doing if he's putting a crush on a position to succeed [noise] um you know ... his struggle and three days rest and you know my I I don't know if you and I have ever had this conversation but I have a rule about three days rest\nIf you want to throw a guy on three days rest you owe it to the pitcher to try it before you do it in the postseason you might try something brand new in the in the play offs and the biggest stage and that's what they did with Clinton Kirsch up and I all I had said I remember the year that it was uh the Dodgers had a comfortable lead\nAnd my argument was very simply I said why can't you throw him on three days rest in late September in meaningless games\nIn and people are like oh how could you do that you risk an injury how could you and I'm thinking to myself well wait a second it's okay to risk an injury and have a guy be completely uncomfortable now\nBut you wouldn't try it and the regular season and I just think it's a lack of preparation in the postseason the last thing you should be doing with any athlete is putting them in positions he's never been in before put people in positions to succeed and that's where I think the Roberts is thinking first of all he's been hurt this year\nSecond of all his innings aren't what they normally are I don't think he's got a rubber arm right now so if I'm going to do that and I need to have him for potential elimination game ... what's the worst case scenario\nYou have to win one of those two games in Atlanta anyway so what's the difference if he puts his one or two\nBut the thing is though unfortunately Clinton herself morphed into another picture in the post season so you know we we talk about it oh my goodness I live on it and I write write her son David Price forget how good they are it's amazing to be speaking of\nDavid Price like of course he's not going to start game on what's your concern level though with Christian Bale with how we ended the season with his which is the last of the noticeably down he is going to be the game on started an LDS for the red Sox\nI'm very concerned 'cause there's no margin of error and the five year series the five game series is the great equalizer\nBefore you get behind the wheel sandwiches\nFor better yet

I Do but you did because when I was out there and watch them practice I went oh my God these guys are six to and they're great [laughter]\nYou know Gary interesting you said there are six or seven teams that could play with Alabama so let's get right to Georgia then in terms of pure ability in terms of talent on the roster he's Georgia neck and neck with family or they're a space between the two teams of your mind\nNot much they're extremely talented they're extremely deep uh in the game let's see what game that I was before tennis because it was Missouri\nAre in the first half I counted they play twenty four defensive players a first half of that came out they play a front three and they went ten deep and their rotation to stay fresh\nTrue locked in the long this past locks through that game was less than twenty five yards and that was to his tail back who ran the ball for that distance so they're\nThey're extremely gifted they're not as good a running team as they were a year ago I think they miss I say a wind who was a very you know the number one draft pick for knowing on who is a very athletic offensive tackle now the big theirs\nAs well and they often so blind and I really think they miss I I was going to say this that they really miss Sony Michel okay then yeah and I think they do but I think I might have under sold Nick Chubb after watching him play this week for the crowds\nI mean I I kind of thought that he wasn't what he was before the the injury but I I may be wrong some they made this both their their gifted at running back the\nReason I thought they miss Michelle the most is he was a two way back when he was in there he was as good a route runner Enron or at the same time all of the running backs now are a little bit one dimensional ... one guy catches the ball one got runs the ball one guy who runs the ball wide um\nHere's my prediction with with Georgia they don't run the ball as well they're going to be forced to go to the two quarterbacks system when they put Justin Fields in there they run the ball better because of his threat to keep the ball that extra man has made them better running the ball\nKirby will not just go all passing with Jake from who pretty good quarterback he will want to keep running that ball and you know I'm not a big to quarterback advocate but I really think this might be the ear from I I

they seemed to be better fed and they are less prone to disease\nUrban colonies survive longer than the country cousins they have a this research\nHave looked at wild caught bumble bee use in agriculture and the or like the cousins who are in urban environments every week the researchers counted the beep population and each five three times who wanted to have that job colonies in the city grew larger than those on the farm\nSo people who study and they're looking to be used for the past eight years or so they see changes in our farmland here's the most important part of this for everybody to take away it's nice kind of fun to tell the story about how the bees are healthier in urban areas but the reasons for is\nTheir reasons go directly back to insecticides pollutants\nIn the country coming from Monsanto and that ilk the sprays around up type product killing the bees we've heard that story before about how bees are dying right and left because of their exposure to this crap\nThat's put on there too and it's so ... self serving part of this is the farmers need to be more aware of this because without the bees they don't get ... get a crop yeah so you're you're you're kind of cutting off your left leg here using this stuff\nAnd that's what this study showed eighty years\nThey'll look over the since World War two especially farmland has had a problem with pollinating insects like bees and was because of the insecticides\nAs so what is beautiful country side is turning into a wasteland be wasteland anyway chemicals have been shown this low rates would be reproduction\nIncrease the prevalence of Paris I tend to be colonies\nSo is this is very important they they don't there's no spring in the city what are they going to spray is that a building\nUp in New York they spray for on mosquitoes but\nUm that's usually not where ... are are always around you know puddles and things like that they thrive so it's really not where bees are so in Central Park they don't spray it Central Park is actually surprisingly organic\nAnd all of New York city really is a very green city even though people don't think unless you live there\nBut on it so the bees are thriving and a lot of people has on the pollinator garden and heritage gardens that that's like a big trend right now that people are planting at home and a and a lot of people are planting specific plans to help the bees and to attract them\nYep as well we should be speaking of mosquitoes\nYoung mosquitoes who eat small pieces of plastic\nContaminating other members of the mosquito tribe but also other insects and mammals\nHere's another bit of research on what's going on we talk about bees or they're important people say mosquitoes they're not important but in this say in this case they are because they're indicative of what's going on in that sub a spectrum of life\nThat we don't pay a lot of attention to and so if the mosquito larvae by his coming along each these ... bits and pieces or micro plastic residue the plastic remains in the insects body into adulthood\nSo they're micro plastic could then be transferred to whatever might eat the mosquito birds come to mind\nResearchers say it's not a stretch to think that plastic could move up the food chain in that way so then you say a pheasant eats them mosquito and you shoot the president and eat it here getting the plastic uh-huh here but\nAlready getting plastic from fish right and I had a lot of stuff and that's already right documented the micro plastics and fish\nIt's it it changes the the the DNA of fish and it actually ruin it it disrupts their fertility and other fish can't actually that's why the fish population people talk about oh well just plastic straw that so much more than that\nContact lenses disposable contact lenses I was reading about that last week that ending up in in in the ocean and and and\nYou know they reflect the light coming through in the water and it looks like tiny fish and so the other fish are eating contact lenses now that that can't be die generally\nAnd so we're going to have to start really worrying about the population of fish because the plastic is ruining their their reproductive system so if they can't multiply then we're going to be really screwed it so much more than than just talking about draws\nA lot of yeah it is is way beyond straws\nMicro plastics in small latex beads are pretty much everywhere put a toothpaste now ... and you brush your teeth supposedly make some whiter no you don't want to that does it need to weigh the enamel either water for a while but you ruined your teeth it's\nMore than ... micro these have been banned I I think all throughout Europe they banned microbe leads a while ago but micro beads or in any type of ex fully aiding body wash that you would put in the shower or sometimes ... lotions and things like that\nThat's what the micro beads are used for and they're just so harmful to the environment I I don't buy anything that you need like a natural expelling grab them go go right to your kitchen scraps of olive oil grabs an avocado make a homemade mask or something and put a little

I'm a little concerned about that\nOkay so in fact given that situation a law enforcement plays an important role in helping keep people safe or helping to spread out the word what a given what you've heard what what ... what is the standard operating procedure if we're facing a potential whether emergency\nWell I you know we would we would proceed kind of in our normal manner you know they're um ah we're missile alerts that go through our dispatch for central dispatch area to to alert people as to what's happening\nAnd when the actual storm would happen we certainly would respond as necessary when when that would occur in a catastrophic case certainly emergency government would become involved than we would ah we would we would go into a more of\nA of a of a\nCrisis mode I guess like we like we would um certainly with everyone we in the in the past when we've had tornados such as a train or the ... and so on ah in in terms of of what our response would be\nA we see our ... our response is really dictated just in terms of watched you know the weather event that would occur would be you know if we can we have trench old downpours where it seems like buckets of rain or falling you know pretty minimal you try to\nThe um\nThe huge deal we we all have a few people go into the ditch shutting at first that day but nothing really like ... ... again kind of harkening back to the\nBad old days of of old one boy they were really going in the ditch back then um you know it it doesn't seem like it's quite as bad as to what it once was\nAnd uh this is the time of year too now with cranberry harvest and visitors coming into our area extra traffic in the countryside and also the ... has been reminding folks be aware of farm vehicles during harvest time you know\nGo racing through a a an area where there's a lot of farm vehicle traffic you know\nWe were just talking this morning about not necessarily the the farm traffic but just a general traffic or one of a former deputy of ours who now works up in ... county\nHad gone to ... and when he turned off of highway one Seventy three\nTo go towards warns on I'm coming from the W. they took him actually an hour to get from that point a to the to the crabs test which is a really long time considering it's a fairly short drive [noise] um so you know there is you know people\nUh you know there are there is traffic out there for events you know I think that event season by and large for um\nFor our area out big events are are over ... I think though that events continue all year round uh in in one way way or shape a so that's always a concern in in terms of the in terms of the farm traffic yeah let's give a farmer's a little bit of a break\nYou know they are they're working hard you know they're they're out they're kicking it they're trying to they're trying to do their best you know let's let's try not to cut them off or or let's try to let's try to peacefully coexist and they they got a job to do right now\nThat's extraordinarily important to them and uh let's let's cut him some slack and and uh and and help them a little bit and get a get get the harvest that [noise] if you're just\nJoining us on the morning magazine welcome as our monthly visit with what county sheriff Thomas records it's got a question for the sheriff you can call someone five four to four twenty six hundred um the Amish and buggy lighting laws about to take in fact and the state of Wisconsin and um\nHow um how old was the trend I heard some um Wisconsin radio network I heard some of your counterparts like in green Lake County or were some of the other Amish area so how they've been working to try and\nReach out to the Amish community to make sure that they know this laws about to go into effect just for their buggies and where ... in terms of the required lighting a what about here in ... county\nWe've been on the front of that for years we've been we've been meeting with the Amish I'm for I'm I'm trying to put a number two it\nI'm guessing four or five years maybe maybe that long or to to deal with these ... deal with these issues they are well informed of in terms of the law and a and we're ready to move forward when it\nCame so I ended up hopefully that will increase the safety for everybody that's certainly the goal\nAnd I I Know it I I Know that that I'm a ... issue became somewhat contentious and would county um for a number of reasons and uh I'm I'm just hoping that the resolution to it ah I I'm just hoping that there's an easier time they had\nPut in some of the big problems well one thing we can talk about is the scammers keep calling\nThey do get hit I got hit a last week one day okay let's talk about it yeah I uh ... uh basically uh an email message where uh where they where they said that they had done covered my\nWere they uncovered my password\nAnd my my phone actually became a camera according to the email and [laughter] and and I was allegedly photographed in compromising [laughter] oh yeah compromising positions and action\nUm of course that ah those those pictures and videos of me weren't going to be a destroyed if I sent the center of this email a bitcoin okay yeah sure\nI you know I kinda I kinda a chuckle about it that that's the second or that's the second or third one that I got along those same with that same premise so I'm beginning to get a little concerned about uh of what list [laughter]\nAs people are are getting these are our phone calls\nWith people claiming to be wrapping speedy what county sheriff's department and we can't get away yeah that's a dead give away the law enforcement agencies folks don't call you to tell you owe them money correct toward that they're holding someone from your family in jail\nAnd your telephone doesn't met your your your hand held phone your iPhone your your smartphone automatically turned into a camera I Know that they have an advanced that far it's not quite that bad yet so it's a\nUm you know always be on the alert for a you know everybody everybody is getting these you know it's not just a it's not just a couple\nYou I Would say that you know I think maybe our numbers are down a little bit so I think what we're doing is working but we're we're still occasionally getting people that are getting a victimized by by these callers scammers are they mostly elderly almost always almost always which\nNext to accept me of course [laughter] you know they're they're taking advantage of folks that don't understand the technology to like we've talked\nAbout many times a day but it's the best thing it's the worst thing from a and often times the same object is is that and I've often described a cell phone is like the greatest thing that's ever been invented and it's also the\nWorst thing that's ever been invented because with ah with all the positives the the the ability to communicate the ability to be able to get someone from literally anywhere\nUh to to contact them also comes the negatives with with scammers and ah people using it for for a darker reasons [noise] allowing they're allowing their darker angels to kinda dictate their their actions and are\nUsing it using it literally against people to uh take their money away and\nThe sad thing you know it's because\nYou know the phone is a great thing look at all the things that that it can do for us it can give us directions to drive to Minneapolis it can it can help us with scheduling it can ... the sky's the limit but some of the apps that that that you can get\nA but it also can be used for very divisive\nBullying you know it could be used for you know ... people bullying a you know the\nThe targeting on it when there's a while driving when they should be paid for it\nYou know yeah right in the hands free thing is is really the only way to this is really the only way to to go with any of that but um it's a good it's it's the best in the worst and we have to just accept that\nKind of ... what do you suggest that folks receive a first always say hang up but should they report it to your call nine one and report it so that you you you and the other departments and all that um the scam is operating in the area they can\nAnd then we make a you know will make will make notation that they did but it's never a bad idea when something like that happens to call now and in my case you know the one that I had received last week I didn't bother you know I just erased the email and that was that was kind of the end of it\nBut um you know if if you get if you get hit with something that is\nI'm particularly troubling to you uh give give central dispatch call and we'll make record of it in a um someone from our department will will review it certainly at Rio read read what what has sent to us from dispatch and and make notations\nI'm Wondering if things also and it bears repeating sounds too good to be true\nIt is the oil is is there is no there is no free macho because people have been getting a one of the latest ones oh you just won this but we need to know your bank account and if you know there's going to do that you know the exact nature of you if you actually somehow\nAre lucky enough that you hit the lottery or\nOne some prize or a you probably need to remember that you applied for it right uh and and be no one's ever going to ask you for money to give to send you money it just isn't that just isn't going to happen so those are those are the the really the gay boys on the dead give away on that\nDid all um you know all of a popular one now is is that the grandchild calling from some jail and you know in Mexico um\nAge you probably are going to know if you're if you're a grand kid is in Mexico on vacation or taking a trip or something I'm ... and just don't believe it at face value\nJust do you you can't accept that just as an on and on its face value and and move forward because I\nLaw enforcement agencies aren't going to call you and ask for money that's just not the way that the operation goal was the the sheriff's department is never going to call you and say I'm your grandson billions in jail\nUh some of the attacks that were laid on me during the primary of the sheriff's race because quite frankly they were bold faced lies\nAnd that that hurt a little bit because I I think that there are some people out there that are that maybe believe some of the garbage and and and thought that a thought that some of it might be true um uh it's\nYou know we work really really hard at the sheriff's department as last Thirteen Years and I've I've put everything into it to you I I didn't leave anything on the field I worked as hard as I could on this and and we've done um we've done some pretty amazing stuff in terms of of\nCorrecting the financial situation of the sheriff's department bringing it up to date you know changing things that hadn't been changed since\nThe Nineteen sixties and and providing a providing a modern\nI'm providing a modern law enforcement agency for for central Wisconsin and and I know that these I Know that these attacks are going to continue for for some reason apparently when you decide that you're not going to run anymore to that\nAnd begins I I Know that uh I Know that channel seven is planning on doing a a a kind of odd expos a type of thing and which again they don't\nUh they don't take all the factors into account and and and make things look\nI'm a make things look bad for for me personally so you know they're going to do that fine you know if they if they if that happens to me I'm going to put a a a rebuttal out for the next day or a day after that and I'm hoping that uh\nI'm hoping that a news outlets are will will pick that up in and take my side of the story I refused you I was offered by channel southern recently to going on here and do an interview\n'em for a for the story that they are planning on doing I I turned them down they wouldn't\nUh first of all what they what they claim that they're this story as the legitimate however I asked them okay then tell me what questions are going to ask me in case there's additional information that I Need to research to answer the questions they wouldn't first me the questions which is a which is a fairly standard ask\nIn that type of a media situation so I I told them\nWhat what what are they exposing as a ... there's they're just in that I uh that I haven't they're suggesting that I haven't worked enough hours the sheriff\nAnd um they're using a they're using very biased\nA very very biased numbers that are um don't reflect what the actual truth is that the actual the actual truth of the matter is that I've worked in the number of hours particularly earlier in my career I work ... far in excess of the number of hours that I Would be required to but\nIn the last several years I've worked\nThe number of hours that basically\nA person that's thirty seven year veteran of the sheriff's department would work when you factor in um time off sick time holiday is out of Kony travel\nUm meetings out of the Tony I'm a you know I was off on a couple of extended leaves for ah for knee surgery and and and heart surgery so I'm\n... I'm I'm anticipating the stories coming they've told me it's going to run some time in in the first half of the month\nMy suggestion of them is run it and I'll I'll I'll explain all explained the whole all explained it all to them I'm not going to give them the I'm not going to give that they're not going to give the TV stations the ah the opportunity to play gotcha questions with me though I Am not ground\nThat's just fundamentally unfair and I'm just not going to do it why are they doing it\nI Can't really figure out why I I don't really know I'm you know I'm not running for sheriff again um\nYou know I I Am I haven't broken any Tony rule\nI haven't broken knee Coney ordinance I haven't broken any state statute in terms of my time off I I don't think that it's a I don't think that as much of a story to be honest with you but to\nSee them be as it will you know if that if if they think that it will\nSensationalize uh the sheriff's race which is I I can which is the only reason that I can think that they're doing this just seemed garbage started in the primary again with a couple of the of the pet originally started in the primary with a couple of candidates [noise]\nAnd uh we're bringing this forward and I think this is just a a bit of an extension of\nThat okay so as you reflect on what's on your on your job beyond\nBeing disappointed about well and this and this is a blip ... this is a you know the the last six months or a blood PI or ... looking back at at at my career you know in in total um\nInsanely I'm In credibly proud of it I I think that\nYou know we've done things that no other sheriff's department have done in in all putting our department and in staffing it in bringing it into the into the twenty first century in terms of of our supervision model in terms of\nOf of how we staff things in terms of scheduling in terms of of bringing a high tech information in communication or into the squad cars you know\nThere were the squad cars of of two thousand five when I took over are a very would look very bear in in very unsophisticated if you would look at what they look like now\nYou know we've ah we've we've done things with our budget that have been very very positive and and and came in for years I've I've Returned over four million dollars to the to the county over ... over the course of my career\nI'm giving it back to them from my budget so that they would be able to use that for other for other sources [noise] now does that mean there are challenges ahead\nEven in our last budget the last one that we are just working on right now\nI'm video we we have a um we're anticipating that we're going to need more space for jail so I've I've made accommodations for that so that my\nUh my successor isn't going to have to immediately deal with what's going to be a hot button issue um I've kind of taken a a the the brunt of that and put a plan in place that would\nIncrease our our bed space by by um [noise]\nA leasing spaces in Adams County who have who have an abundance of space right now where we have a plan in place right now where we would get twenty five beds from I'm twenty five people that we would be able to hold them in Adams County in a very very similar marriage or how we do the Packer Coney transfers right now\nAnd we're going to be holding them for\nBasically awash maybe a little bit less of what it cost us to keep them in in ... county [noise]\nYou know other things that we've done you know electronic monitoring we brought that into we brought that into\nUm in two thousand seven I Believe we started that you know we've saved millions of dollars in terms of of money that we would have spent on on housing prisoners with uh with that program so we've done a lot of of of fiscally conservative things that have been\nExtremely beneficial to the to the to the taxpayers of Ford county we've also done some amazingly progressive things in terms of law enforcement itself you know we we\nBlew up and expanded um\nThings that we've talked about a lot high tech things you know using 'em using kinda CSI type of um information in in ... on on different types of crimes we've we've investigated crimes are up and down you know there was a\nOne of the one of the things that was was brought up in correctly in the primary was that we didn't do anything with a with cold cases well the truth of the matter is in literally all except for one of the cold cases we know who the person is that did that\nUh we've taken that information to the district attorney in the decision was made that that they weren't comfortable with charging them\nWe've solved cold cases we had a cold case involving an individual who sexually assaulted a young girl a I'm a basically kidnapped or from here in the industrial park took her to a a location I'm\nIn the town of ... and sexually and sexually assaulted her a which became a cold case we solved that a a a few years ago by use of a by use of DNA Analysis [noise]\nSo you know again\nYou know don't believe everything that you've heard because most of it and particularly most of it that you've heard in the\nYeah I'm In in the primary election I'm anticipating that you'll hear probably somewhat more in the in the general election here for sure of\nJust isn't true it's it's just it's candid information it's information that\nPeople are using to try to manipulate for a for political gain and I think that's shameful you know I think that's it's absolutely shameful because the the sheriff's department that the people have what Tony has is one that's that's a and quite frankly the best in the state\nAnd to have a characterize otherwise I I consider to be a\nKind of fighting words to be honest with you I don't know if you can tell that I got one of my soul to the men and women are working you betcha a you betcha you know if if you want to if you want to criticize me personally then criticize me but don't\nHigh school towards

first couple are in regards to the Packers Aaron Rodgers bill buy or sell is part to blame for the latest off at the struggles of\nCourse he is [noise] I don't think he's without blame a I mean he had a couple of minutes fires he is still kind of feeling himself up through\nThrough the knee injury um didn't play a whole lot in the pre season obviously so yeah I mean look you can talk about mark was about a scaling not coming back to a football you can talk about miss blocking assignments you can talk about pressure on the quarterback you can talk about drive past it's because he's had some of those as well\nBut there's also been a couple of passes that have come out from the quarterback that just having been Aaron Rodgers asking now whether it's the need that's bothering him and he can't plan correctly or follow through correctly I mean I don't know but you can't say that when you choose to miss or I shouldn't say choose to miss you can't say that when\nYou go to throw the football and you just miss on what would normally be a a a threading the needle\nThat you're not without one and let's be honest I mean there are times I miss it it's a double edged sword because him scrambling moving around holding a ball looking for something big happening down field\nThat has made him his money because he is one of the best at it [noise] but in essence\nWhen you've got a a need that you can't really be as mobile although this past weekend he was more mobile than I'd seen him in a while [noise] um [noise] when you got guys that are open for check down that can get your first

things because apparently when you kill 'em they they give off a steak and you can't vacuum up because they make your vacuum stinks so how do you got to get rid of stink bugs just just throwing it out there you got any kind of insight into stink bugs gimme gimme a show whether tweet or email or something\nBy joining us now are very young little stink bug not too bad segue shouldn't do that Paul ... is not as bad or on your job what Paul how are you doing it was right there for you I don't I Know it was it was a softball yeah it was the yeah [laughter] I'm I'm\nOther other than the other than that I'm doing just\nJust like a blender is really a perfect hey I'm so it comes to light and Joe brings it to the forefront that I Am a goal and Dan Phelps during the broadcast on Sunday talked about Aaron Rodgers not pointing fingers at the coaches and go out and execute and it's not us and blah blah blah\nAnd then kind of a backhanded way without naming names and dropping drops he kind of points to figure that go Jeremy is is there more to this than meets the eye or we've just making way too big a deal out of this\nWell no I mean it when that Aaron Rodgers and his new mega contract and when it's Mike mccarthy who has been running this team for more than a decade it's it's it's not nothing I mean it's it's it's there and it's not there because somebody\nYou know artificially created this story there because this is how Aaron Rodgers chose to vent is frustration after the game right so it's not like this is media created at valley that said you know just a fiction there at the question is that how big of a deal with it and I think the thing that I kind of think of it it's hard to give it like\nYou know I don't know about you like I Can't speak to this part of it but like if I Would imagine you work with the same person very closely for twelve years\nYou're gonna you're gonna be things that you can\nUnspoken we agree on it and things that you're just going to be more agitated by probably because close proximity you know and then in high emotion and high stress and\nUm and again their expectations in Iran expectations are so great and they should be they should be I Know we talked a little bit about this the other day but you I mean I look at this off and on paper and I say yeah I don't know how you could\nLook the way you looked on Sunday you were missing Randall Cobb and I think that that's\nA fairly substantial loss with is often because it takes out a veteran who can read Rogers very easily and they have an unspoken relationship where you can just say they're gonna you know\n... is going to know where a cop is Ninety nine percent of the time just like we always talked about what Rogers enjoyed emails and their unspoken bond that they just know where each other's going to be and then you put in a Catholic Marquez of all this county might be a very good player one day but doesn't have that chemistry was Roger so so we get into the bigger picture that's a good not nothing but\nI think you have to put it in context of like put put too highly competitive people\nTogether for twelve years you know have expectations in the spotlight all the time and I think this is going to be kind of what you get that I Would say and I don't know I don't think any of us follow any other NFL team as closely as we follow the Packers\nIt would seem bill and correct me if I'm wrong I mean like the the patriots last year had some really interesting drama between Brady and ballot check at great personal trainer ... that was kind of a weird story but it's for the most part I feel like you don't hear many of these types of stories\nOf among other NFL teams and I don't know that just because\nYou know the only places would really make sense would be like Drew Brees Sean Payton another guys you guys who've been together for so long just like Roger than McCarthy Brady and ballot checked you know as you've been together and it would it would be odd for like Sean McVeigh and shared golf to be doing this kind of stuff a because they're destroying people and be because they've only been together a few years so\nI don't I don't know ... it's something to watch it I think one thing would be that winning would cure all\nRight and that's that's the easiest thing to say that the factors go into Detroit they look really good that may be the forty niners they owned by week you know an ad for one and one\nGoing to be a lot easier for all this to kind of guy down over the by week but if they struggle to get off that simply and I don't know I mean I I don't know about you but I think Pakistan just kind of be raised on Sunday is the idea that drama Alison currently as of today still I was a concussion Randall cop still not practicing Jimmy Graham you know I think who would you would expect what place but it's still not\nOne hundred percent you could be looking at like Aaron Rodgers throwing to divide to Adams and the three rookies that they just drafted right you know and that\nIf that's the case you know there there'll be there'll be growing pains and there was this past Sunday so I think it's this is sort of be on the you know the monitor it was something to watch\nNot sure how big or small to be able to yet but it's the fact that it's already creeping up cropping up late September early October so early in the season it's you know it's something that we that so that one should be watching for especially if the team loses or doesn't perform offensively like they expected\nDoes this matchup coming into Detroit does bother you at all\nUm I\nI don't think highly of where the Detroit Lions are right now I don't I don't look at them and say that you know if there was like teams that you might consider a lock for the NFC playoff team that you might consider the bubble and teams that you consider a long shot\nDetroit it for me as a long shot\nNFC playoff team right now from what I've seen and\nAnd the NFL season is so long and things can change so quickly I Know there are probably a long shot NFC playoff type of team and when you play a team like that you you I think you'd like to assume that if you're considered or an upper echelon NFC team like I think the Packers in most regards are thought of as\nYou should go in and you should you know you should beat that team I think and and I think on the flip side of talking about how banged up the Packers often to their defense and yes no locus and obviously has a season ending situation but for all their\nActive roster their fifty three main guys right now they're decent has very healthy\nAnd and the like very very healthy and Kevin ... is going to cut back their child that was already back there's a lot of things in the last six quarters going back to the second half in Washington the Packers defunds has been like ... forget the first ten quarters of the year I think they're going after the first time caller did in the last six\nIf you only saw those last six quarters of the of the Packers defensively you'd say wow like Fifteen cents is so good I mean they help Alex Smith like by passing out in the second act in Washington I don't care if it's a rookie quarterback and Josh Allen holding any NFL off into the real point is\nSo hard to do um so I think overall I mean the matchup is\nOne you should win even on the road I'm In the often isn't going to be fully intact it would seem going into soccer but I think if you are the team that you think you are that you hope you are the Packers are you know in a ... even close to an upper echelon type NFC team you know this is the kind of gave you have to go on and when the matter what the circumstances in my\nI'm looking at the defense in the sense of vigor showdown or there's a lot of talk about his shut out but the believability factor still I think is very very\nOn his he I I don't know what to make of it I don't know I mean Joe asked me during the by herself say man what are we going to make a collar fact grow\nA federally not going to be the norm um I I wouldn't expect it to be if it is it would be a complete surprise to many of us\nA look I was just as yesterday what do you think of this deep and I don't know I I don't I still don't know what to make it to the French and usually by four games and you can kind of say well they are who you think they are but I don't know what I think they are because I don't have a\nTon of believe yet that that just my pet and changing systems and bringing it from different areas and scheme\nIs is is the real deal I I just I Want to see them when all the one on ones and become this more tenacious dominant attitude feel defense I Love your Alexander brings to the table 'cause he's kinda got that but you got to bring it up front you got to bring it with wind backing and you've got to bring pressure\n[laughter] yeah I Would say but they are trending in the right direction no right right right even even for you know a pessimist or are people who I Want to be cautiously optimistic about the event that I get it I mean after all these years of the Packers being\nAt their best for the most part a mid middle of the league type event that you know take something to believe but the fact that you bring up Dr Alexander\nI mean let's rewind three years ago when the Packers were hoping and I I think that's the best way to use it the hoping that you know dumb areas ran on quitting Raul are going to be the next guys and you never really saw anything actually make you believe that they were going to be it was like you know we've got to this guy how they're gonna have to reform\nThe early returns on gyre Alexander ... Jackson\nI Would think has to make every Pakistan feel\nLike Brian good accountants and for many reasons I think there's been cool and a lot a lot of good reasons just out not just including the draft already ... there's going to great job in building this roster\nBut now it looks like his first to pick in particular are are going to be really good and I think as we see more and more of an orange Berkes who I\nLie believe at some point once you kind of gets back to the you know he did this the first you can't year once he really gets back you might have a three for three in terms of the first draft pick this year being really big contributors on the defense and so I you know I I think the losing my location is is tough\nBut they had such death on the defensive line he now now that the model reason to get more that you know see a little bit more from my training as Adam I mean yeah those guys are a little bit of question marks in terms of what their careers are going to beat but\nIf that's your fourth and fifth events have lime and I still think you're doing a pretty darn good job and you're pretty healthy defense and then you know yeah I mean the collar fat girl thing and I did hear it then you buy and sell a cycle of course he he might not have to ... the rest of the season when I even if he didn't\nStaff top to bottom contributed and came up big ... and even when they struggle they made big pitches in big moments but just talk about the wherewithal and the kind of a tough one that nothing stuck with this group of pitchers\nAre the I mean that's a great group of guys and I'm from a starting starting a starting pitcher wise I Know\nI mean they all they all believe in the catchers and I mean they work together they work a lot um [noise]\nUh videos and are scattered reports so I think they always going into the game ready and I'm from there on I think they just trust their abilities and when they go to our bullpen and we got the best for playing the game I Believe and um when they come in a\nIt's it's definitely feel the tension because of how good they are and how effective they've been all year\nThe the things he has been good it's been up and down at times this season\nBut it seemed like big hits I mean you've got kids contributions from everybody gets cope with the home run a couple of weeks ago you get contributions obviously what we're Christian yellowish has done is just off the hook I mean the other day Orlando or see who's just struggled for the for the you know a season even though he's had much better than the second half for
