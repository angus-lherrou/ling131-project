ah the Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown who apparently is facing multiple lawsuits right now including some troubling allegations that he threw furniture and other items from the fourteenth floor balcony\nOf is for an apartment\nAnd apparently now the NFL is taking notice and be shut our friend over there for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nSo the NFL's keeping tabs on the litigation and Brian McCarthy told Bush said quote we are aware of and will continue to monitor the civil suits and quote\nNow both of these lawsuits are two of them arise from an incident that allegedly occurred back in April at the mansions alright which is a ... in sunny island Beach Florida\nNow one of these lawsuits sees compensation\nFor alleged damage it to be ten million dollar apartment\nThat apparently Antonio Brown read it for six months\nThe other states claims arising from browns\nAlleged tossing of uh the significant high off the fourteenth four\nOf these large items that apparently nearly hit a toddler and his grandfather\nAh this by the way from police report apparently a ... when Mr Brown got upset\nHe started throwing things out the apartment and the coffee table glass was broken along with a few other minor objects again that's according to a police report the also through sort of objects from the balcony into the pool area causing minor damage there as well\nA police didn't charge brown but the league can impose discipline on the on a player\nEven in the absence of absence of a criminal charges and brown apparently told the police that he was upset in part because someone had stolen a gun\nAnd eighty thousand dollars in cash from his apartment\nI mean that's what I've I've always got you know\nWant got guns but I mean I don't have gone through maybe Kay laying around my apartment for somebody just walking and steal\n'em anyways I'm so we'll see you know this this is kind of\nI don't know that we should be surprised by this to be honest with you\nI mean listen he is be smiling Madison Avenue darling who is getting all kinds of\nUm endorsement deals and commercial deals right great smile and everything else meanwhile\nHe's also the guy that last month right on ESPN reporter who had written a [noise] a\nA piece on browns' wipe away from football\nHe was also a guy that apparently a decided not show up to work on Monday because she was upset apparently wasn't getting the ball and they weren't winning 'em\nAgain it it seems for whatever reason by the way\nThese distractions as they like to call them in the national football league I mean this team can't get away from\nWhether it's way beyond bell or its Antonio Brown for one reason or another this like the third or fourth incident this season an already or he has been at the center of it\nAnd uh I I mean what do you do you're paid that guy sign him to an extension way before his deal was done it averages Seventeen million dollars a year\nAnd when he's right he's as good as it gets in the national football league or the Pittsburgh Steelers organization as a whole under the ruling family has been very intolerant [noise]\nDespite how good you are very intolerant\nOf ah X.\nPublic so we'll see what the NFL\nAnd what the Pittsburgh Steelers do moving forward I mean while\nThe state of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia Eagles are banged up in the backfield and I'm\nThe office of quarter Mike Rowe\nWas asked\nAbout the people that they have in the backfield that are likely to take over for Jay jai alright there's obviously a little while but discussions that have been going on that uh the Philadelphia Eagles have reached out to the Buffalo Bills\nTo gauge the interest of the bills trading with Sean McCoy ... thirty one year old running back was already spent one\nIn Philadelphia [noise]\nI listen you've got you got Corey comb it\nRemains there in Philadelphia He's been dealing with a cottage read it and plays singles snap for the Vikings are against the Vikings I said I should say a despite dressing for the game\nNow he says he's going to be ready to go\nWhen the team takes on the giants tomorrow we'll see you got windows small wood and Josh Adams that rounds out the group of available running backs because Darren ... um\nApparently still a ways to be medically clear by the team a Mike Rowe the offensive coordinators had this to say about running back he means he said I mean to sit here and say we won't miss J\nI think isn't fair Jay's an excellent running back but we've gotten these guys a lot of experience they played and

not go I think as many people thought it would\nSurely baller was combative outspoken even turning during practice with got late in the gym is saying you need me what the heck was that this boy miraculously Jimmy Butler sit down for\nA one on one interview with Rachel Nichols the jump on ESPN I mean what a data have cameras there and Rachel Nichols in attendance\nAnd he could have been planned right I mean Jimmy bowler shows up his first day of practice and ESPN happens to be there with Rachel Nichols water ... and then he happens to throw it see fit and throw everybody under the bus walk out of practice and go straight to Rachel Nichols again\nYou know what\nI'm not buying bridges today\nI've not\nBeen to me maybe it as a matter of timing but Jimmy Butler\nWho publicly doesn't ever really come out and do ballistic and not be the most ideal team and they were going to go over that aspect of Jimmy Butler's career starting in Chicago now Minnesota\nBut here's Jimmy Butler going all crazy in practice how we ever on a jury but we're going all old job back him junior before I never heard of it to this level on a day he happens to show up at practice there happens to be a one on one interview set up again\nPull me once shame on me fool me twice no fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me\nWhat I'm saying is this today Jimi butler showed exactly why\nI Would not trade for him jury butler today showed why if you're the Brooklyn that's the New York Knicks or the LA Clippers the three teams you apparently wants to go to why they would not make a move for Jimmy Butler because what Jimmy Butler did today was not only embarrass themselves in my mind\nBecause he's telling Scott laid you up and need me yet Jimmy ... is the one that wants to get out of town Scott late and Tom sibling or don't want to trade them in Glen Taylor the owners are saying yeah trade them do you want to make it off or call me direct\nBut when you're calling out the young players exactly the reason why there's apparently a problem in the Minnesota timber wolves locker room and you show it out there and practice\nEmbarrassing teammates\nIn essence what you're telling these teams of young players like the next the nuts and the clippers are you put me on a team of young players I'm going to call him out I think they're being lazy I'm gonna call 'em out is that what these teen needs hey is that a healthy dynamic in the locker room for Jimmy bowler\nThat's like throwing oxygen as a sport in a fire\nBut what upsets me about the whole Jimmy Butler thing is this well I think Jimmy ... looks like a clown\nMe makes call Anthony sounds looked like a clown he makes Carl Anthony towns look toothless he makes Carl Anthony towns\nOut to be somebody who is too afraid to say anything in one spot lives out of there then you'll rally the troops in the southern and no one wants to listen to him as if his message is hollow but\nThere's another aspect of this that really upsets me okay let me read you a ... year olds are asking is as good as they call them when they come to I mean he's Mr basketball okay\nAnd on Twitter ... and he talks about what happened is one of the road and I want to read it first then I'll tell you what I have a problem with quote\nA lot of Minnesota players left timber wolves practice today energized by Butler's performance mesmerized with him taking aim to the bench players in running the table on the regulars sources said at the end he marched out like if a might drop butler delivered a Tour de force\nWearing bowler beat of the the source considering he sat down with ESPN right after the practice\nWhich a stray from the horse's mouth of course first butler energize the players by the way he did he energized the team to more than forty eight wins last year\nDid he energized Minnesota to be a much better team with all that talent apparently he didn't do much energizing last year during the season but yet in one practice might drop Tour de force I'm not buying it\nWhy would any young player look at what he did today it'd be like man that's awesome yeah call out Carl Anthony towns and Andrew Reagan's yes ... yell at the GM yeah treat 'em all like crap oh man I Want to be with him that's the type of leader I Want on my team really\nMaybe that's why Minnesota just screwed up organization as one squad\n\nHere's what you'll be butler is doing Jimmy Butler's trying to be as annoying and root as possible so they trade\nButler wants out now because if he doesn't get out now in the season starts he loses tens of millions of dollars in IMAX deal if he gets shipped elsewhere during the season for if you have to sign as a free agent next to off these bats the problem Jimmy Butler wants to be annoying Jimmy Butler wants to be a cancer right now because Jimmy Butler wants out\nAnd you don't think it's going since Jimmy Butler vocalizing that the way he did today in practice\nThe day he SPN cameras in interviews are there you don't think that's a coincidence that Jimmy Butler did these antics today knowing full well it would get front page headlines considering he was sitting down the biggest mouthpiece out their ESPN\nBusiness not Jimmy Butler ask again Wednesday we ever gotten in front of the camera on the other people\nHe's not old job back him junior right not to that level of what we saw today and his performance but my whole problem is this Frasier inroads around ski to write that what Jimmy Butler did today\nPretty much get too slow clap from the guys on the ...\nThen when he's in essence telling me is the team has turned on Karl Anthony towns and Andrew Wiggins 'cause that Jimmy Butler's public enemy number one into what you're telling me is nobody on that team respects those two guys because they're on team Jimmy Butler\nHere's what you do I'm going to lay it out easily here this is what you do if you're Tom Sybil and you're a Mr leading this what you do\nYou don't try to\nBecause that's exactly what he wants this is the pet human child that stops his feet\nAt the dinner table saying I don't want my broccoli but I Want ice cream after dinner\nAnd they'll throw that has the fifth don't drop broccoli on the floor fake tears the yelling the crying the screaming right because they think that's going to make the parents say OK okay I'll take the broccoli away there's your chocolate ice cream just shut up Jimi\nBut I didn't mean mother you have some experience so I Know she's got you know it doesn't work though in my household\nI say All right then they'll ice cream I Know broccoli no ice cream you take your ... you get the asking you don't you don't there you go you want to see like why don't you packed me a lunch every day why does need hot lunch at school it's disgusting I said well you know what daddy's forty years old and I survived that same exact ... once you ate and public school and guess what\nIf you're hungry eat it if you're hungry don't want to eat it that's on you you starve not my fault the food right there for you attack and you're damned lunch every day and he's like snowflake parents packing lunch for their kids like really you know Nick what oh yeah\nCan be found [noise] to start\nPowerful not just outside to discover\nBeautiful blessed that come together to create it off or get home and said sure\nThis is the fourth or fifth one wants to you by the council and the U.S Forest Service so\nWell I'm Glad you enjoyed it but I think it's that had back in\nTime I'm sure they'd be careful getting us a\nI'm going to return the kayak\nHow about a jak T\nGoing to find a neighbor had ... years after the U.S Forest Service\n[noise]\n\nTaking these ones where you go into Iraq\nSort of happy hour go in the forefront NBC Sports radio NBC for radio dot com bubble or has a history of\nBeing from that goes back to his days in Chicago where he\nUpset the likes of\nDerrick Rose because\nIn the hierarchy of leader he got along with doing right there was a John Doe and Derrick Rose gives me a ... hierarchy of leadership\nHe kind of jumped the line in their mind and he would want to speak his mind he wants to be the team leader yet those two guys are pretty much they know where the team leaders but when he wasn't there long enough to really establish himself I guess than you know and ball or I guess to close because he'd go play with weight in Miami apparently both from market market\nBut you know Rondo\nWho's not really shy when it talk when he when when it comes to talking about teammates\nRemember that he led into Dwayne wade in Jimmy Butler back when they were playing with the ball\nBecause both are in Dwayne wade had leading to their teammates about being an selfish and you know or their effort and things like that kinda G ... likes to talk about young players efforts well he did that in Wayne way did that in Chicago so Rondo\nAll star weekend fired back on Instagram he said quote my veterans would never go to the media\nThey would come to the team my vet didn't pick and choose one they wanted to bring it they brought it every time they stepped in the gym weather was practice or a game they didn't take days off my bed didn't care about their numbers my vets played for the team where we lost the what blame ... they wouldn't blame us they took a sponsor ability and gotten the gym\nBy the way how ironic are those comments when you think about what Jimmy Butler did today\nThis by the way January of two thousand and Seventeen almost two years ago\nHow ironic right my veterans would never go to the media what a Jimmy Butler do after the practice went straight to the media to an interview with the jumping Rachel Nichols on ESPN\nMy bets didn't pick and choose when they wanted to bring it Judy bowler picked this because we have yet to show up at a practice with a week before the start the season and he just happened to choose today when he had the interview with ESPN lined up to quote unquote bring it\nThey brought it every time they stuck to the gym where there was practice or gay well Jimmy ... hasn't\nBeen bringing it because he hasn't been showing up\n\nHe didn't get along with Ron do and Derrick Rose in Chicago he didn't get along with Fred ...\nI mean it was ugly his exit from Chicago was not pleasant\nThe only guy he seems to get along with this Tom seminal joined guy that we can stand and that the only way to obviously the Marquette connection and then they got along in Chicago but the fact is it just seems to be a case where Tom said but it was the only guy that can put up a Jimmy Butler yeah now he's trying to escape Tom ...\nI Do think when you look out there the talent level of Jimmy Butler what he brings is a two way player you would ever every team interested in bringing him in considering he's available right but I think teams are weary and scared off by his attitude I think there are scared and weary of things as what he did today\nThat's not a reaction that make the team say ooh I Want him that's a reaction to make the teams that I don't want him I'm afraid to bring that doesn't that dynamic in my locker he's too vocal\nIf you're ... and Jimmy bummer talks ... starts talking smack on the next what do you do start calling out Kevin knocks publicly what do you do\nYou destroy your team and by the way whatever team brings them is going to give them a huge contract so not as if you get rid of them next year because he's a bad guy in the locker room you're stuck with me but if you're bringing them in\nAs a Knicks fan I Would want nothing to do with Jimmy ... don't forget to the Internet detectives remember that story about Jimmy Butler I'm hanging out with Carl Anthony towns his girlfriend yup yup\nEx girlfriend whatever it is whatever that walk in and then you have the whole thing with like running around with carrier union right Dwayne wade\nThat may be a joke that we don't we don't know what I mean Dwayne wade did fire back at him right he commented on Gabrielle Union thing and then Dwayne wade saw it and then commented on it but I mean you would hope\nThat there's your part to rise to the it'd be nice yeah I don't it just seems like someone if I'm a Knicks you know personnel with Christopher present just being the main do there\nAnd Kevin knocks you know hopefully he could mature into something good but you got to protect presented kept bringing them out there he would destroy present as this convoy absolutely he's a domineering personality I wouldn't want anything to do what you ... how good he is\nHere's the thing though if if for Jimmy Butler what's the one constant when it comes to Jimmy bother me butler lead teams at any success he's peel you said he's on your PC you would see however when\nYou got to have to show it out in the Philadelphia Eagles Seattle though that that's it and he played with a U Maria's banged up in that game probably should've played and had a hundred and forty four years I think but she was never won anything Jimmy ... and the winner\nAnd to me I think you're kind of see what happens I think Jimmy ... this is a divisive guide a locker room federal do he's uh twenty five point guy in place solid defense I think Jimmy ... is a net\nNegative I really do I I don't think Jimmy bowler makes you that much better team because I think Jimmy bowler makes everybody else in the locker them uncomfortable and because of his style of play the NBA insiders say that he's an old thirty and a lot of where it's early called ... physical body right right I'm\nGoing to get the bill just works either death he's like Japanese baseball coach I get something like that it works either that\nMakes you rub it got really make you actually work out right amazing\nI wouldn't touch them and I think that's why look when\nHe was available in the report came out of the nix the nets and the clippers\nTo any one of those three teams jumps\nWhere they fall over themselves to require give me a while or know Miami's negotiating against itself right now\nThinking about that they are negotiating against themselves\nTo get your email or find a way though this is a big thing we have to get into\nThese is good for the NBA\nThinking about that I'll tell you why this is actually good for the NBA coming up this season starts in the week is back

F. HR\nOr NBC Sports radio lifting\nAll start Jimmy Butler filled up through his first practice or the Minnesota Tim Rosa week before the start of the season and it didn't go as planned\nAs he was out there yelling at coach's front office executives and also dividing his teammates before being interviewed by ESPN meanwhile joellen beat signing the richest endorsement deal ever given to a center he signs a five year deal\nWith Under Armour over ... and new balance meanwhile ...

as he looks for a new home on the air force in the states\nRadio [noise]\nHey I'm Andy if you don't know me it's probably because I'm not famous but I did start screaming company called Harris the idea for Harry's came out of a frustrating experience I had buying razor blades most brand for overpriced over designed and out of touch at Harry's or approaches simple here's our secret\nWe make sharp terrible blades and sell them at honest prices for as low as two dollars each we care about quality so much that we do some crazy things like by WorldCom chairman blade factory obsessing over every detail means we're confident in offering a hundred percent quality guarantee millions of guys have already made the switch to aries so thank you if you're one of them\nAnd if you're not we hope you give us a try with the special offer get Harry starter that with a five blade razor waited handle shaved Joe and the travel cover all for just three bucks plus free shipping\n... currently at the Newtown isn't respected guy in the team he's not a leader when he opens his mouth people don't listen to the butlers the driving force on that team he's the one that all the young players respect Carl Anthony town just kind of a guy who doesn't work that hard he's all about his own numbers\nAny kind of happy with his situation that it's I think the narrative right now Jimmy Butler right he's not he's not mentally tough would you agree that's the narrative right now that we have currently at the Newtown yeah friday much okay so if you're currently Anthony towns put on those big boy pets and fight back\n\nYou got to say something you're going to allow the narrative to all come from Jimmy Butler because ESPN looking at all up the SPN Jimmy ball or right Adrian will giraffes keeps waiting quote unquote source is\nSaying that the players love that rah rah their tour to force the might drop moment from Jimmy Butler because he did that by the way at the expense of a Carl Anthony towns at the expense of Andrew Reagan's at the expense of Scott Laden he did that on their expense but might drop\nThe slow clap apparently is what happened that moment\nSo if you're calling pretty towns and you want to establish yourself as the leader of that team the movement will part of that team every ball if you get trade of but you can't move me because I Am the future and the president of this\nTeam suck it up and fight back show that you're the guy come out with the statement that practice why did you not push around should be butler but she'll be butler started why don't you pushing back\nYou gotta fill up your chest and say oh my team you were a rental you don't want to be here my team you guys you get behind me don't listen to this guy\nI met a driving down the line I'm going to get his face give me the ball in the low posts a ball around me and I'm going to back him up and smack it in his face and a lot for them to see what he does that's what you need to do with your caller is right now your soft right now I'm not\nAs a young player picture my wagon a gym in to uh to call Anthony towns\n\nLike you know you think about the military Sean right and I'm going to use member saving private Ryan\nAnd Tom Hanks is captain Miller and his troops love 'em right they run through a wall for him and then when the you know the medic gets killed Giovanni ... bc there's that moment with that were burned and then he's kind of being in subordinate right and then then Tom size more as the ... they're trying to get him back in lines that the gum pointed and right\nAnd then Tommy make that speech where he's from and all that and like the guys to understand what he's doing and they love them again right\nLike that has to be Carl Anthony towns you have to be that captain that all the guys want to get behind you and when you say run across that field and for those bullets you're gonna do it because you trust them\nRight now he's the captain and don't want to follow him when he says hey we're going to go from this location location trust me will make it on base but yeah not happening you know first stay here\nThat's what's happening here calling from Newtown he's got to get these guys to get behind him and believe in them\nThat's what has to happen and you know what he can't wait a couple of days he's got to do it no no\nBut for the NBA they liked the drone mean a girl in the town has to turn to his teammates to go look on the captain now\nIt's not based movie right was\nThat what he's got to say is if you have to say ah what's what's the dollar amount on me now remember because they have like the amount of money as to what he was before the war like what did he do for a living he's like well what what's the tally up to now\nAnd the uh the the loser soldier you know the one who's the ... at the end like he's like stunned that that's what are you asking as his soldiers fighting amongst themselves right like he's the one that said I mean cause any town right now is to say anything\nYou're the top of me is not a leader currently have any towns is not a leader I Know he's a young guy but you know he's been a lead long enough and he's a face that Minnesota Tim rule franchise but you're automatically the leader now acted but sadly here's what he did after practice\nThe team together and what are we hear about that\nI Know I'm just saying that we're trying to be the leader that right but he's not doing it accurately or right so you believe everything you read do how do we know how they're ... years one of the teammates reacted to that poorly but you know but here's the problem with that we do now but here's the problem with that Sean\nWhere it was Jimmy Butler when that happened\nJimmy ... already talking SPN at that time baller without a practice when Carney towns rallied the troops right\nSo that's like ah you're you're hiding in the bushes while the bullies pulling all your friends or the bully leave then you come out on top and say oh man if I was here I Would have knocked them out I feel like a stories coming of you in seventh grade and you are hiding in the ... I Would have [laughter]\nOh yeah well he's two blocks away and I came here to protect you guys bullet yeah you're right you're that's what it was well buddy buddy tried as my point he tried but even in trying to me according to your right what you don't even know where you're trying I think he looks weak\nHe's rallying the troops after the guy who's responsible for all the nonsense they left\nTo NBA players needs to be leaders\nOn the elderly in order to win I think on young teams that how he's the young guy on the team yeah but he's a young guy major weakens as well I mean those are the two ... and then they're the ones being targeted\nBut don't right but it's about fighting back if they weren't the leaders I think to a point yes I think to a point when you're being challenged you have to be the leader was Kobe Bryant leader no but Kobe and Shaq they don't like each other right they won but then they\nCouldn't keep it together after that you know I wouldn't want to camping and I wouldn't want how many want eight and Coby wanted more can we want to build her six Kobe what George W regret the fact of how many more championships good what was shocked at least to\nAnd what it would it mean meant to his legacy as he battled for number six late in his career right mhm thinking about that you know you read of the fact that he was a jerk and couldn't get along with shock\nI think he regretted it and I think for a guy like ... pounds if he doesn't fight back now and established himself\nBecause he is the rock and Minnesota Jimmy ball or can get free that they're not moving calling the towns like you're going to suddenly go else right now but when you're building around Carl Anthony towns the whole point is that the super bowl is brought in to compliment Carl Lee Anthony towns\nCurrently have any towns is the joint weight on the team when Miami brought in the other guy recall in the town is the common factor there\nSo he's the one that they have obviously invested in so he's the one that can go out there and be raw raw and rally the troops because he's not going anywhere\nWho's the leader on the Lakers and in the eighties it's magical rah rah ... leader\nCream maybe no ... and say two words\nI was magic probably magic I mean if I you know what they are so many veterans though\nI mean you could you could be a nice leaders my point you mean like I was either Ohio yeah you know you know in an elegant way you don't have to be a yelling butler yelling and screaming and call now people write like Michael Jordan did apparently do\nYes but here's the thing for calling the Newtown Joe he doesn't have to be our our our leader like that\nBut when your intestinal fortitude is being questioned in a public display like today at Minnesota symbols practice there are times where you have to kind of step it up you can go back to being a calm leader that lead by example and is friendly with everybody\nBut when you're the one that's actually being called out directly or indirectly\nYou have to show you have leadership qualities by fighting back and that what they call it than it how did that said he needs to do something or else that narrative that we have I'm currently in three towns just grows the narrative now is he solved the soft right that's the narrative piece off and he doesn't work hard\nThat true that is what I mean all of us that have been right across especially defensively\nThat's the big knock on it now doesn't try defense yeah doesn't try to find somebody which I Believe by the way honestly how many young guys they do try defensively\nJimmy Butler money's on the young guy but that's why we spent like a ball in the choir letter guys like that who understand like\nThere's two sides of playing basketball James Harden I always kind of like a James Martin Ron even to play that size strength play a lot better defense last couple of years like James Harden come on\nCarmelo come on you play defense when you want to play defense if you have any sort of athleticism you can play defense come out with and he's not us I mean he's not just to the movies on the line manic right he can move\nBut you're telling me he can't move and block guys and get in front of you have to pick on Eli man ... I Wonder what else yeah two Super Bowl what do you know they'll say oh they oh they'll say\nHe's not going anywhere I Move and he's right to say that it's ... it's right to do and if I'm just kidding I'm just very what I mean you guys over and he wants to see ... he's a great is to civil MVPs you're right that is the narrative when it comes to have a real quick I you know we brought to Kelly ... on the show and brings up real quick\nKelly Brian situation\nThere apparently is might be a home from coming up what's the ideal place I'll tell you what it's funny because of you\nThink about the conference he's looking in when you think about the schools how funny with that narrative be if he shows up in the ACC and apparently that's where he's looking that good that smart be allowed to leave to go to an ACC school\nI think about that I mean there's a reason why schools don't want guys to stay in the conference back nobody is worse than NBC Sports radio and the NBC portray a mobile app [noise]\nYou're listening to a um Thirteen twenty W.

Stadium in the Bronx in a game for to move on the face the Houston Astros obviously big reaction Boston to knock it off their rivals big reaction here in New York as well\nWe had to Boston columnist for the Boston Globe damn Sean as he joined us and\nYou don't hear before we get into what this means and things like that I Want to get your thought as a baseball guy your thoughts on the decision by Alex Cora after only a Thirteen pitch eighth inning and ... being a typical Christian Bale out and throw in Ninety six by the way to automatically goes to closer and bringing kimbrell and not go with failed to try to lock down that night we okay with that decision\nI was a again Campbell's the closer you know go three run lead that's his job twice here so yeah it's ah it's okay and sale you know they're thinking that they can he's going to be their their game ... starter against the yanks if a\nIf you know things don't go well so\nYou don't want to burn him for thirty or forty pitches and then asking to go out Chris game five two days later so\nIt didn't even occur to me they would do anything else when you came in you do is going to be a you know one one inning guy that was that I thought the stranger all was poor settled left after six o five innings and throw ... pitches sixty five pitches when you're only given up one run is not a lot\nAnd ah but I think he knew he had he had a ... for the night and he thought he could bridge that so that's what went down but it is a process I Can't say I was like saying what do they do it here so I I Would not change that now\nHow would press three without score in terms of his decision making them working compared to what Aaron Boone do then I'll tell you being a Yankee fan Dana I have to admit I thought it was thoroughly out coached out managed buyouts Cora\nWell that's fair I mean I had a really bad two games in New York especially and are\nJust amazing that after you know going too long and in game three that he would do it again was about the endgame for I was just it was obvious he had nothing it looked impaired I mean\nCould move off the mound loaded the bases in the first to get out of it screwing up a lot of balls and I was just stunned that they weren't people warming up and they didn't have everybody on board everybody ready for that I thought it was\nA stunning lack of recognition of of the moment unlike last year when you're already pulled Severino you know with one out in the first inning it's like hey we can't fool around here it's a one game eliminates\nTake it was clean this up and uh that wasn't done against three and four and and ... going to have to pay for that I mean you know he had a one hundred games to share a crate rookie manage season but those were those were not as good days for him\nIt's funny 'cause after the air and judge incident at Fenway Park after game to walking by the home clubhouse playing New York New York on a boom box nothing was said of it until really yesterday in the post game press conference out score kind of alluded to it\nThen you're a guy that didn't do you've been around you know this team you've been around the city a long time is that something that you think really kind of was that bulletin board material stuff although they didn't even kind of make reference to it until after the game\n[noise] yeah I think it was and again I I Love that kind of stuff as as a writer you want that we were all over her we saw the video from Saturday Night so people were addressing it Sunday for the Monday papers showing the off day\nAnd a and then of course they come on they win sixteen to one and then when they clinch it the next night they're playing a song and the clubhouse so that was obviously a direct part we're taught to that but you know they did it on the field and then you are allowed to kind of doing the clubhouse after that so\nThere was premature and judges part I like judge I think he is going to be here he's the future is MVP and they're making and\nGreat player and then it seems like a you know really stand up guy all that stuff but it probably as much as we loved it for purposes of of theater probably regrettable move when you look back at it\nThe great dish honesty joining us calmness the Boston Globe Iran going deep the enforcement NBC Sports radio\nHas the baseball guys I Am dance to see the first Yankee red socks series you know with so much drama so much anger out there frankly and clap for fourteen years from the two thousand and four how great as it for baseball though to have this in the sense of you can sense there's clearly bad blood between the two organizations\nWell yeah I mean they had a you know they had a brawl earlier this year and and there's just the the ancient history and it's not like the seventies or even right or ten years ago and a rod and ... and had all that stuff going on\nIt'll never replicate that that was the height\nBut uh I think that you know as baseball goes these days and then to have them I mean they had two of the best three records in baseball this year and that's a good first round matchup so uh that was all about it and you know again five would have been even even greater and uh I thought I thought the Yankees would show better frankly it's like\nOf Boston did a great job they think the yanks didn't ... didn't hit a home run the last two games in her own park which is pretty phenomenal are given what they did this year so socks really attack them in a good way got it done and they deserve to move on but I was I was fired up or before during and after the series\nThe moves that corner may do all of the Christian Vasquez gets to start in the end he hits the series winning home run off Britain one of those Yankee Stadium jobs\nYou know was switching the rotation of all do you go again three to open up in New York rather than force elements have going game for you know ... on the line up the kid hits the first ... first cycle in postseason history then he doesn't even play a game for\nYou know as you're watching these moves where were you thinking to yourself when you you know you get a line of car do you get the rotational changes are you thinking what's he doing or you know there's some brilliance there\nWhile after game to it at home I I wrote a column saying they need to start you know behaving and playing like the team that won a hundred and eight and you know just put on a big boy pants and get out there and and pushback as it felt like they had lost both of mine and apply for when they open or was was good but they had a five holy and they hung on for dear life and\nAnd uh it didn't feel secure and then they had you know routed game tonight along homers\nAnd it just it felt like a they were kind of in the hall and they got to New York\nAnd I suggested that they they start ... second and a and put the average the third and start stealing bases and they did all those things I was like hey I'll take credit for this this is great but now so those things didn't strike me as\nAs a seismic at that they were logical moves was he made in and it was weird though because on Sunday he said well you don't want to panic after a small sample into games and then he he changed for four guys in line up before game three and they all did well and then of course for game for as you stated\nYou know he he let the guy who hit the cycle sit down\nFor the cat Vasquez in there who hadn't caught for sell all year\nAnd he hits the game winning home or what amounts to the game winning home early in the game and I was a good job on a plate so yeah\nHe's a he's on fire right now his his things even set of all the it was going to pitch seven and as you give up one run which is exactly what he did there was a liquor the managers really in a in a hot spot right now and\nAnd uh you know he's he's very confident he has been that since day one and uh it it's all working for him and of course he has the the strength of having been the bench coach for the Astros last year so a lot of knowledge about their team or the stocks go up against a really great upon in the next round\nNFL dot com slash social

Price to be the guy that's going to save you gain too so you don't go back to Houston do two games to none\nHistorically David prices one of the worst may be the worst postseason started history isn't it amazing to say about that show and he is the worst post season started history\nHere may tenth starts in the postseason he personally has only nine teams have lost all ten of his postseason starts lots more hands he is the worst\nStarter and postseason history I Will not second guess Alex Cora after the clinic that he I Know right you're right it was you know what ... congrats being the first postseason player in history of a cycle you're on the bench next game you know Christian Vasquez you literally did not catch\nOne game of report this year I'm going to pen pencil you in for game for and he'll be a game winning home run up the series winning homerun\nI'm going to play rock called income on like playing games or instead of ... kids are big double RBI scores aren't\nI'm going to pitch yeah we've all the over ... you know to start the series it so I'm going to sail for an inning yeah bring it for ... for an evening on their throat days amazing worked worked and everything you did work\nAnd uh but I Do have to question David Price going game too I don't I Do then you have to pitch they would probably at least once in a series right against the Astros\nWhen I came to set home\nFirst of all maybe it's worse for him to pictured home isn't it worse to pick him for president worst punishment home he's become the a rod of uh of Boston he gets booed there\nBut for your team though he team sick about David prices for your team said well you can have an years right but it's a game before bigger spotting into\nWhat is you can be down through ... down to one get them out on the way but here's the problem if you go down to nothing going to Houston and you have all the ... three and four okay but you know ... ... here's the problem might still have to win game one\nHow about this than if cell doesn't win game one you're not winning the Sears anyway if they if the if the Astros get to ... you're done\nRight it isn't that true right they they can't be the Astros without fail be dominant again not any failed to win today ... is still with games they'll do that a pitcher honestly against Yankees so though I mean ... why did no I'm saying the bullpen no not the\n... the rest of starting rotation for some it was great yeah but how about that about of all the that\nAlex Cora predicted seven innings one run baseball now and he gave you seven innings gave up one run amazing the guy has made a pact with the devil and it's working I don't know what he did he sold his soul I think let me have this World Series when\nAnd I don't care what happens to me because everything he touches turns to gold are you nervous about calls Korea\nDoes help yeah a little bit absolutely you have to think the Astros need healthy no ... no no they don't I don't think so and\nIt's amazing you know what some teams draft poorly right you never always sit with your draft picks nope look at the Philadelphia Phillies there probably hoping Mickey Modi act even becomes made clear at this point he's been terrible two years after the number that guys like mired in single a Hindu twenty whatever these terrible\nThings about that roster right now now the Astros tanked games tanked seasons but look at their draft picks turned out to be Korea pregnant\nRight I mean to cornerstone super star players who both happened to play on the website of the infield right mhm they're superstars pregnant in Korea\nThat that is hitting on your draft picks George Springer yep another guy they hit on George Springer was the first round pick I think no he's early early from Yukon right yeah there's three first round pick spent of amounted to cornerstone players on your team\nThat's impressive give him a lot of credit for that yeah but they they messed up some too of course every team's going to mess up here and there I mean baseball draft the biggest crap shoot out there but it is\nHas three guys coming off you know losing seasons in high draft pick that have actually amounted to star players is a George Springer star he's a Thirteen hundred guy used me as a star now he's not elite superstar like Korea or pregnant those guys are at least superstars\nSpringer is it all star that's what he is by strikes out too much about that and then but who's better break been er Korea\nPragmatism pregnancy is thought they're pregnant and the MVP conversation numbers he puts up mhm he's unbelievable walks a lot too\nThat's a good that's a tough team anything about like you know they pulled the trigger on the Berliner deal who they give up from Berlin rather\nThan looking at the Detroit Tigers on thinking\nMuch talent who should get purchased in Berlin you gave away like your eighth right like you guys on his way to the hall of fame at this point the way he's and pictures of the Houston but what did you bring back for him I don't know the coyote soccer is a guy that did not hit on him yes if they'll roll picking the twenty Fifteen drafted to top picks yes so I mean not everyone\nTurns out where soccer now what's he doing no idea that terrible I mean it's easy to see a high school kid that uh if you think two thousand Fifteen he's what Twenty one now Ninety seven he was gone yeah yeah twenty so he can't beat it might not be you might not be terrible you might not be a ... they played them this year I mean they have high hopes for him still but I mean he hasn't\nI guess well but we were comparing him right where comparing him to what they've hit on you know you're right he was a high draft pick he's the guy that ah you know but he made the majors though at Twenty one\nAnd they had to actually he's pretty good is good yeah good minor league career yeah so I think look so I don't know they hit on him to my goodness I guess when we think about the Braves in an an Arab twenty year\nOld being SARS already pushes lawyers being trapped on those international Siamese [noise]\nYou know Boston you managed to exceed they also made some great trades

with their hands dirty in this you know why is that I see it why is that the government sees it why is that there's testimony for those involved\nKnocking the door down the NC double a sitting in their high horse in Indianapolis doesn't say squat why did the show Miller still recruiting top five classes now he's doing it cleanly\nLike you're doing cleanly now and before you have to have a deed is helping by buying and players right trained right are you telling me that they're not buying players now that the boosters aren't still involved\nSo I watched boilers which has gotten way too political for me by the way the season I I Love the rock the\nFirst couple of years of all this as dumb as shows of this has been fun to watch it's fun you know I mean if they miss cast\nBeyond this cast that that super agent with the the hot blondes yeah from New York obviously that accent like if you're a super agent representing like top players\nYou have a bigger set on yourself then that guy that they're they're showing right the gym or the quote unquote rams you don't go away but you don't go from selling cars to being the gym or the rams are gonna hear\nRight that doesn't happen right\nYou don't go\nAnd be as kind and nice looking and friendly looking as the dominant defensive end of the cowboys like that one character like they kinda miss Kass\nLike it's just not a good casting job my problem is they've gotten so political right but the one thing I Do agree with this years they're protecting the NC double a\nYou know the rocks going after the NC double I on the show and you know what what he says about them to point is accurate they are kind of spineless they really are and I think this is the case what just highlights that like I Want to see heads roll in college basketball I Want to see\nSome changes occurring well I think the schools have more power than the NC double as a whole but but but kind of like the U.S right\nNow the un have real power you know the kind of spineless to wear but here's the difference though\nWhy are we leaving it up to the schools do end does anybody trust the schools to police themselves\nWith what's happened in college born in there and see the NC double a due to a school look at SMU who did that to SMU fancy double A. who are laid the hammer down on Penn State for a while now they then\nGave it all back but who was that who took scholarships away from Alabama at one point the NC double a\nWho went after Ohio State and kept him out of all the NC double a All right so then then I suppose\nBut in this day are why because you have so many big schools involved here's the problem for the NC double a\nThose instances we talk about Ohio State with their little infraction Alabama when they are issues you know the other programs of issues yeah you'll get it for a year or two right unless it's so big like Penn State and it's a national story like it you can't just slapped their wrist and say you know welcome back next year\nBut when you have a the entire sport uh college basketball under the microscope with some of the biggest programs and names out there involved or at least the mention is being involved\nThink about if the NC double A. actually drop the hammer on college basketball in this whole dirty and that's the paying players to go to certain schools by the sneaker companies with of course wink wink jobs and the coaches think about the names in schools that would ultimately be taken down Sean\nYou think the answer really wants to take their head out of the sand you think it's really wants to go kill Kentucky\nKill Arizona Joe Kansas North Carolina Duke\nEvery major program in the country some of the biggest names in coach and you think the answer but he wants to do that one school here or there sure take away scholarships take away a post seasons\nBut five ten twenty of the biggest schools in biggest names in college basketball all involved in the same sleepiness toy you have to smack him all the same time you think the antibody wants to do you want to watch a March Madness where for ...\nSo you're saying the schools have the power then know what I'm saying is they yeah they are afraid of the backlash the backlash schools no not from the school from the public from Kansas from North Carolina from Kentucky no because uh relevancy the sport but I don't think the people I don't think the public cares\nIf you don't think if you had an ugly turn of the top twenty five teams that country out of it\nWere suspended for two three years you have so many top twenty five program so it doesn't matter yeah but you take out kids ... Kentucky and the big guy that was only to get him some care no but it's bigger than just Arizona if it's just Arizona I think they could hear an Auburn you mentioned those two schools people killed but Kansas is involved\nThere they're mentioning this as well you want to keep digging and digging and digging what do you think you're gonna find\nRight why do you keep begins with a gold mine after you strike a little bit of gold because you know you're gonna find more you dig and dig and dig look ... wants to find something they can problem is they don't want to go there because I think they don't want to find this\nBut enough reading of what's going on in courts right now when the guys that are now working in testifying for the government I Need payments to the ...\nWhat was the story a hundred grand right that was a story Miller denied it\nHere's another guy saying yeah we paid ... family twenty five jeez\n... no come on not buying it\nThey don't want to know that's the problem but I just thought we would have more at this point I thought after that broke and people are all those guys out there writing articles about this is it\nJust you wait sit back and see the names of the issues that drop right okay we've sat back and wait and now what half a year more dropped beside Rick Pitino\nThe other guys are still recruiting top ten classes the assistant coaches got other jobs that coaches that we thought we get fired quickly there still coaching and that's just nothing has happened\nSpineless what it is about going to school just mine was too I mean you can't just wants to investigate builds up in the program we'll talk brings a lot of money that school you didn't Carolina really wants to know Roy Williams knows no ... no the Arizona wants to know do show military Arizona basketball and the\nSad that the state we live in though and as a consumer product I Do want to see those teams in the tournament\nCome on you and I like mid majors but I mean they just beating the big boys\nYeah and the big this other big boys that will take the big boys this place I think so you you're not in Kansas for a year you some do not do [laughter] I just saw Michigan or maybe Michigan yeah\nStill UCLA Wagner was legitimately recruiters who still feel I\nLove Texas many big school I'd I'd like you won't miss them for a couple of years I'd like to look into those programs do you think it would hurt [laughter] not have do can Kentucky for talking with down for a little bit yeah I think when they had what's his name the guy from Texas and that was the coach of what was the name\n... Tommie Smith no well you know after ... Smith\nWho was after Tony Smith, Kentucky and he was as you came from Texas in\n... Billy God really hold on don't break all\nSaving for the other side well we'll get the name bill anyway the NC double a survived and that's why I Survived without Kentucky for a few years they gonna keep surviving you are not really looking for a few yeah All right I Want to be sort of real quick so habibi is the biggest name in UFC right we think you'd just be Conor McGregor\nHere's the problem for the U.S see what happened after the fight and I don't mean I don't mean what happened to the states I mean literally what happened afterwards in terms of how be getting out of the country you got to hear what happened next day's worth but NBC Sports radio in the NBC Sports radio mobile app [noise]\nThirteen twenty W one thing John Wisconsin Rapids\nCBS News special where\nHave you ever swam in more\nOne hundred percent we're focused on search and rescue and recovery as Florida governor Rick Scott CBS meteorologist David more concern looking to the next two places in my brain is\nThe main concern in terms of flash flooding there's a flash flood watch that goes actually all the way up to Boston forty eight inches of rain as possible in that portion of northern Georgia in the south Carolina there's another area from North Carolina copying to Virginia\nCheaper technology and science at the national Hurricane Center mark ...

I think we are but you know when the two games prior to but ah obviously there's going to work out for us it's hard to win and the NFL argue type rich theory but I was going to get that first one\nWhat is Josh Rogosin like and I asked that question because no one denies the skill set the question with him come again this year from of course UCLA has been his attitude you know I mean he's kind of a very bright guy maybe a little too bright what's he been like\nA you know I don't think it's it's never a negative thing to to write a God that'd be quarterback position you know young he's learning I got away not wait to go yet physical skill set but are you learning the game and learn to adjust and learning how the pro game work in what goes into it and the work that's required\nThat's all new for you know twenty something year old kid so he's a he's learned he's growing getting better veterans can work started about\nThe kind of course you know what you like in the huddle\nHey quirky by all of that type of that to us or\nIf you're ... you're going out there and putting the ads on getting hit I think you have a little bit of a from a little bit off with you but he's on the jokes around these you can tell you do like a young kid fresh out of college wide learning a lot and that would be probably thing\nJust come from in New York Giants the more you have established quarterback for a heck of a long time and Eli Manning in a huddle you know he's a leader now you have a Josh Rosen a young kid I think what do you see twenty Twenty one years old\nComing out as a junior from UCLA he's their leadership qualities there and as a guy who's now veterans in this league and he got elected shelters been asleep forever as well\nHow does a Josh Rosen go about becoming a leader without being I mean\nWe're not really being I guess an ego trying to be a leader too hard at Twenty one you know what I'm saying like how do you go about doing that\nYeah the first part leading by your actions and got stuck to earn their respect for you based on like how your play how you handle yourself how you prepare how you work at a job\nPA process and training camp and when he got his opportunity still young you still makes for a few mistakes and there are things that you know I Would I could look at the lie and say you did this very well ... needs to get to this level but ah he's grown he's going to get there and going to get there and his own way and and that's something that\nThey'll continue to become more and more of a leader but just ... just playing that position and the quarterback position coming in and commanding are running the auto ... it comes to territory\nHow has it been though in terms of the quarterbacks yeah the guy is saying Brad produce\nAn established veteran you had Mike lemon obviously and now that have the young guy kind of take over you know some some quarterbacks obviously don't handle pinching so well what's it been like though in terms of the same breath for now he's handled now having to take a rolls back behind Josh frozen\nYou know than than the ultimate pro I think he's been in situations where he's been in other places ... quarterback battles um Sam's a true professional and he's handled himself likes as such um for the team obviously we got to go out there and we got away with who's that quarterback and that's coaches decision and\nAnd we're all with that and who are looking forward to obviously you know we have three very capable quarterbacks when the roster\n'em to go out there and just play hard whoever's out there\nWhat do you guys just a line have to do better Justin\nPaul later on the ball better I mean as far enough wrongly gotta that's that's\nNumber one as a unit though you know all the guys you know we're we're in this thing together so long I make a mistake you couldn't make all the other everyone else look down that play for this keep learn the off and learn a little new on love it\nLearning how we're going to go and attack the fences with jobs as a quarterback and find out what we do well I mean we're not even a full year and says off and so I Know a lot of time to the learning curve to that\nIs a tough though just in you know you're now in what I guess you're sixty or I guess in this league\nAnd you want to win obviously you know you come from the giants and it was a tough fresh for the giants you come that Arizona and you got a Twenty one year old quarterback and that usually means look\nWe're going to go with this kid we know there's going to be again I'm not saying it's a throwaway you're obviously because there's so much involved in terms of getting a kid prepared is it tough for you Justin knowing that with a young quarterback at the helm they are going to be a lot of growing pains which means we're gonna lose games because of that\nHe did that you look ahead to the future do you say we get through this year we get the experience for Josh Rose now the way of being a rookie the futures really bright is that how you look at it\nAnd I do want to win now and that's obviously the mentality you go into it with but ... of these teams that have on Super Bowls in the past so you look at the eagles uh last year having a young quarterback that doesn't take up that crazy cat number or the Roswell some of the world I'm\nHer other teams that have won recently um is definitely a formula is on the view so the future that me as bright I'm looking forward to that but it's obviously tough winning or losing\nLast time I was ... you know my second to last year in New York two thousand\nOwners at sixteen Fifteen we went to the playoffs but are not winning definitely wears on you\nArizona Cardinals or just a few joining us going deep enforcement NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com you look at what's happening in New York I mean as you spend you were drafted there in the first round you spent five years in New York the kind of look at what's going on there with all the drama\nYeah I definitely say I mean I I definitely have followed the team obviously we didn't leave on the best terms you know as I Believe as free as you know many free agents who who don't get offered by their former to leave on on great terms but I'm Still following along and I hope some of the guys that I Know that are still there you know I Wish him well\nWhat do you think about comments from Dallas is it fair for a guy to come out and make those comments if you're in that lock room in that happened with one of your teammates would you be upset\nUm I I don't really know what's going on with the lock them is I don't know anything about those coaches I Do know Joe ... is a once in a generational type choir I mean he's the guy that you know he's in his prime he wants to win games\nUm it it's tough though airing I I don't think ever airing out dirty laundry and public\nEver really I really cannot work out too well um but again I don't know the climate in the locker and I don't know if there's been conversation and ... with the team and with the players so I talked to judge it from afar\nIt's interesting just to go from a team or as you said you have a generational talented wide receiver no doubt that Kim junior to a team that has and you know I'm forty years old you're you know mid twenties\nOne of the greatest players in our generation both of ours in Larry Fitzgerald who puts a huge numbers doesn't say anything really and goes about his business how different is it and what's the benefit of a guy like Larry ... who shows it out there every day but doesn't kinda figured that launching that you're talking about\nIt's definitely tough and and look I Will say that the media in New York is\nMay God Bless you and God Bless the usa\nThis message has dropped to use that as a U.S air force\n\nAt temple idea can be developed into something big back and change the world\nGrade my music teacher helped me make a vision board it was the most of my health as an operation to me that\nMade you didn't have needed to make our collage\nWhat if I never gotten a chance\nUnfortunately that's the reality our teachers face everyday therefore than their own money\nTeaming up again with the book for getting to donate ... million dollar donors choose or\nCharity that teachers get what they need to bring learning to live free\nOr helping them more than seven hundred thousand\nBenefiting more than eight million\nIt's an idea that change the world\n[noise]\n\nUsually\nWant\nTo ask you our our number three being forced an NBC Sports radio NBC

issuing personal fouls\nYourself [noise] because nobody is off limits\n\nSometimes train wrecks just continue being train wrecks\nAnd I think that definition fit to name Lenny ... better than most\nFederal and let me through it was a proud member of the New York Mets\nAnd the Philadelphia Phillies somehow became a power hitter with the Phillies somehow got bulging muscles when he was a little strong he got the ... yeah that's right chemical has meant that happened back in the day\nBut when he died should then had the higher being this great penny best remembered the whole penny

he said you wish you the yeah well well for that now All right\nI Want to get something to hear your neck Mr Right just our rights as citizens brigade right now is Nick Anthony he's tough the tough\nDo you like pointed old ladies Jay walking and tell them you're breaking the law may your three miles over the speed limit slowdown do not do that they will police powers [laughter]\nBe do current people at bars when you walk by and there's an outdoors drinking or you're Twenty one [laughter] All right we don't get to the show and I want to bring you into this because obviously um this this is\nRelated to you in the sense of it's your team up boy so the big were rumors are that the Philadelphia Eagles who need running back help after Jay a giant bringing up the bill we're bringing up or you know there were horrible there they are horrible\nRight are you saying there's something there because this is what I get from you they're awful then there's there's a movie with James McAvoy where he plays like twenty nine different world [laughter]\nYou know what I'm Talking about like a no doubts girls and like you play different roles and like they're like forty personalities and like you don't want to get the number of forty and each one of them like this is science so it came out recently you don't you're right\nYou tax thing about the bills [laughter] he's like multiple personality so for weeks I get tax from showing on Sunday saying the bills are the worst team in football and then I have to argue with him or the jets better or the bills better right I don't know why you have to read the jets it up all the time\nBut you do on these tax you know but on the bills no but you compare him to my chest for the worst team in football because if we bring the jets the bills and the cardinals right\nBut this past Sunday you sent me a text saying jets aren't bad the bills are the worst team of football\nAccording to the what the analytics right whatever it is well known Sunday I sent you well you you have to back it up a little bit I sent you tax after they beat the Tennessee Titans yes the bills are not the worst team in ... that's right [laughter] right right and\nThen the other personality of yours shows up on Monday right happy because they want right you know I'm I'm I'm saying I don't know how to write to you know a mood swings on my team and then I get the one where I guess you looked at the uh the pro football focus numbers yes\nThose are the worst I felt a little deeper and I realized that yeah that they might be the worst here in football yes so there are terrible okay ... they're terrible and they might be the worst but they're winning too many games for terrible team right now\nThat's the problem maybe going to be bad ... bad honestly can you name it even worse\nI thought Arizona was said don't give me the falcons I Know they don't have a worst record now but the bills are the bills are worse I think the Arizona Cardinals rival\nClose close\nBut here's the thing though was shown McCoy right now apparently with the Philadelphia Eagles meeting running back help his name is come up because of eagles already ... ... it's too hard to trade fillet the bell right now\nAlthough James Garner Big Bend says James counter asked us to continue to see some planes on he does but here's the thing thanks coach if you're the bill such pick that aren't you doing everything your partnership with Sean McCoy anywhere\nYes right get something for him at this how do you know that's not happening\nI Believe it has to be happening to have some kind of leverage she can't come out and just say you're on the market\nYou can't just come out and do that because the ... kind of leverage it right the fact is what is fair market value ... western I'm I have no idea what fair market value is because if you're in Philadelphia Eagles look you look at a repeat of Super Bowl champs round pick\nIf you're the eagles me a little desperate to give a fourth round pick\nElite force because that's what probably would be better than windows small wood he's better than a Adams a kid that the ... Frazier Notre Dame right the local kid\nCornell meant Corey comment and it's not bad but listen you've got to be going back to Philly ... he's paying up I think right hate right these things or you know a ... I was the guy use the feature back five by the way they're thirty five right your costs thirty\nI think it'd be the eagles you have a hangover there's clearly a Super Bowl hand or you have to bring another show McCoy and costs you a late for throwing pick do it if you're the bills and you get a fourth round pick for a guy that you can release any way at the end of the year considering that cap numbers you have to make nine million dollars or the debts\nTaking a decade right and the only building yeah right plus ... wants to play for a contender pills probably don't look like a contender this year or next year than you save six million so the fact is no getting rid of him right now when the iron is hot and there's a clearly usually think then the the bills will train them before the deadline\nRegardless of what short term and says his press conference and he ... he was saying hey brand and being an eye the gym at the bills and show Mr Moore saying we talk about potential traits so I mean it's kind of admitting to Detroit and talking about it is worried\nThat the Denver Broncos do bring in small Charles what I mean by that is this was on the court has all the off the field

[noise]\nYou can't win without me [noise]\nNo that's not what I'm telling you it's one Jimmy Butler and told the Minnesota Tim rule\nThat's right it's overtime here on a Wednesday evening into Thursday morning NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com and the biggest news\nIn the sports world because there are no major league baseball playoff games you on Wednesday or Thursday because the baseball postseason is just constructed very poorly in baseball sport that you play every single day during the regular season but during the playoffs you only play twice or three times a week but I digress\nShowed up at symbols practice for the first time this pre season Jimmy Butler practice with the timber wolves\nButler played in a scrimmage with the bottom for players\nOn the timber wolves bench and he went up against the timber wolves starters you know those guys\nCall Anthony towns and age where games they're pretty good group of players\nAnd what the Jimmy Butler do he scheduled them all and over the course of this vote diverse what a great word vociferous practice\nWhenever I hear that word don't you think of like um it's like the type of words like Don King would use you know or like a you know it's like a [noise]\nNo I'm trying to stay there for oh that's a parole word award Ross Perot\nRoss Perot yeah now yeah [laughter] ... ... is a\nPromoter word and yeah so what I'm saying it's like I think of um the character that was in rocky five the movie that never happened by the way which was based off of Don King um where you know he just was saying it where it would be promoting it like this is the most vociferous fight it's\nGoing to be [laughter]\nLike I imagine like that [laughter]\nImagine him coming out there like Don King or somebody [laughter] go to\nThe gym and bought one returned to practice Sydney most vociferous wait what a general manager Scott late in the lead me to go to Tom typically do absolutely votes separate [laughter]\nGeorge Washington do that's the name of the the the character and rocky five\nWho is described as a loud and obnoxious boxing promoter only in America\n[noise] [laughter] so jury butler returned which will practice and what's most vociferous\nShe yelled at general manager Scott Laden you believe you need me\nThat's almost as good as Kirk Cousins coming off the field pointing to the cameras and saying you were like that\nThat's what Jimmy Butler did he schooled but symbols starters\nRight and then basically said\nYou liked that you need me you can't win without\nJeff T\nTaj Gibson call Anthony towns angel Wiggins can't win with out me he's right they can't win without him to steal a Reggie Jackson\nIt stars the drink and they absolutely need him [noise]\nAnd I don't know how much of all of this requesting a trade not showing up not playing in the pre season holding out if you will\nIs because he truly wants out of Minnesota or is it because she wants to get paid by Minnesota\nJimmy ... didn't interview with ESPN after the practice\nAnd Rachel Nichols who doesn't incredible job on that show the jump\nShe asked them were those reports about you screaming at your general manager and head coach were those reports accurate and here's what Jimmy Butler had to say\nBut it is true but they got a thing I haven't played basketball and in in so long am so passionate and I love the game and allow new or for any other reason except for the convenience and go up against their best to try to prove that I can hang on my emotion\nCame out at one time what is the right way to do it no I Can't control that when I'm Out there competing like that's my love of the game as a wrong me\nOkay I get that he's fired up obviously first time he's playing the game in months the competitive juices flow and I get that 'cause I'm that way too I tend to get an attitude when I play I I Am\nTotally with him on that part of me though believes that this wasn't exactly a genuine\nThat perhaps this is Jimmy Butler pain during for a new deal we all know he wants to get paid NBA players want to get paid\nIf Jimmy Butler all he cared about was the love of the game he wouldn't be trying to get a max contract but all these players want to get paid what they are worth\nAnd you know what the timber wolves aren't going to pay him well he wants to get traded to a team that is going to pay him\nThat's the facts of the matter here this doesn't have much to do with the timber wolves ability to win this season or compete this season this has to do with the fact that he's going to be a free agent at the end of the year and he wants max money\nAnd he knows that if the symbol of resigned him they could pay him more than anybody else\nOr if you get treated to a team and they re sign him he can get traded he can get signed for more than if he were to just test free agency\nHe wants to get aid to all these other guys around the league are making a lot more money than Jimmy Butler and he wants a piece of that pie he was asked is the situation with Minnesota fixable\nAnd could be but a new I think so you know you got to be honest I mean I Do I think so no I mean honestly if they raise everybody's going to be honest you know\nOkay at the very best what are they looking at the third spot in the western conference at the very best\nThe high watermark warriors rockets Lakers with the blonde those are going to be your top teams\nJazz will be competitive thunder there'll be right up there as well\nTimber wolves during that mix along with the pelicans\nAlong with you know I Know the spurs lost to John Day but you know\nTrailblazers have been trying to be competitive\nNo gets washed is going to watch this is kind of botched up\nCalling the times got a ...\nDo you want to now build\nOff of this with Jimmy Butler\nAnd see where you go this year Steve you can make a run and then\nShe leaves him for nothing\n... son in the long term\nOr do you trade him and get something back\nThat's the question you've got to ask\nI think you've got to train him\nAnd wherever he goes doesn't necessarily mean that's where he's going to end up you know ideally you bump to\nGo stay with the team like in in ... George\nBush George got traded to the thunder everyone thought he was a shoo into the Lakers he winds up staying with the Oklahoma City thunder\nAnd maybe that's going to be the case were ever Jimmy Butler ends up the deal with Miami fell through they're trying to get it to happen again\nDoesn't seem like the rockets step up and get involved I don't know\nBut I don't think Jimmy Butler starts the season with the Minnesota symbols I I just don't and I don't think it's the talk I don't think it's the right move to start the season with him\nI don't think it's the right move at all\nFive five three two three four NBC eight five five three two three four six to do I was sent odds\nWeeks ago on see if I could find that here\nIn this in the mail\nI was sent odds on\nLike what team he would play on before the season started and the Miami Heat where the favorite now this was as of this email with probably a\nCouple of weeks ago so he was first I guess when the first request for the trade\nWas announced Miami Heat were the favor\nFollowed by the Minnesota timber wolves\nAnd then the Los Angeles clippers\nI still think Miami's involved\nI still think Miami's involved I don't think he stays in Minnesota\nUnless I could be wrong unless he gets paid\nUnless he gets paid eight five five three two three four NBC eight five five three two three four six two to one more thing from Jimmy Butler on the situation with I'm On the report from practice and his interview with Rachel Nichols here's what he said\nI was on it was brutally honest yes I think that that's the problem everybody's so scared to be honest with one another if you didn't like the way their hand and myself and and and I think it's one of the fires come up to me somebody say something I'm not gonna take it apparently it's not personal stimulation and done to you you you probably right\nI Want to say I hope then I don't know how wrong how passionate about it I Love the game and I love to win and that's all they're doing with competing plan of heart\nAnd the other part of the interviews says ... am I being tough on them yet that's who I Am because she was challenging um some of the players right a hit like his teammates or whatever\nAnd he says quote I'm not the most talented player on the team who's most talented player on our team cat\nWho is the most God gifted player our team wicks who plays the hardest me I play hard put my body on the line every day in practice every day games that's my passion everybody leads in different ways that's how I show I'm here for you\n\nButler trying to be a leader dishes how he does but these reports coming out\nI don't know who has what to gain from them\nThe timber wolves have leverage now to hold on to him boy or a student to train them and get more in return or the Jimmy butler have more leverage now to get treated to a better situation or does he have more leverage out to get the data\nFrom the timber wolves which in my opinion is what he wants from this whole thing is just to get paid\nTo let me up on Twitter at Scott's on air SCOTT ass away and a half hours over time you know what I mean she sports radio to NBC Sports radio dot com caught up about ten minutes or so for now when we're joined by Kurt hew and pro basketball talk and NBC Sports dot com and talk a little while but obviously\nWith the Jimmy butler stuff wants to get his thoughts on it and there is adequate\nWhere it's going where does he think Jimmy Butler will end up to a start the season which actually begins next week I'm Crazy that there'd be a season begins on Tuesday\nPre season games and you're not really pay much attention to although everyone made a big deal about Lakers warriors tonight so lake or for the warriors and the preseason game in

protects our troops with each purchase a map of both sympathetic for Eighteen Ninety nine a portion goes to the intrepid fallen heroes\nSo I don't you know you can make a deal but I don't know that he's going to get any better than what he wants especially as time ticks on like if you start to get into the season and now I get them for less games\nAnd I get less time to try to woo him\nAre you you're you know there's value just goes down um\nGets a Glenn Taylor question and the owner at some of the owners to step in and go All right hey this deal is good enough and is it right now it would have to be Miami that's the only place with real traction is the only place they've gotten way down the line with the owners just got to step in and go you know what that feels good enough to make that deal do it um [noise]\nWhich will be a bad sign for hope but uh I don't know that anybody can she's there won't turn right now anyway um [noise] well that's the only way it gets done and it's just impossible to predict this was an owner who's always been a bit hesitant to pull the trigger out that\nDuring the cardio and pro basketball talking NBC Sports dot coms got them are here it's overtime on NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio mobile apps this the entire driving force behind us and my accurate and saying this is all because Jimmy ... wants to get paid\nWell yeah Jimmy ... yes he wants to get paid and he doesn't want to get paid in Minnesota\nThat's what I'm saying like what he wants to get her in Minnesota offered him a max extension he would stay\n[noise] I don't think that's a really good question if they kept him collect summer and he had to he had to accept and by by the way it just so people know the numbers\nThe max for the team with his bird rights which is right now so that would be whoever they trade him to ... ... is ... you can give him five years a hundred and Ninety billion Garrett cheap\n... knows this do which is why he's trying to get traded\nRight in the most he can leave for if he signed if Minnesota doesn't trade and he just decides to go sign with you know Miami which they wouldn't have the money but I think it was a side with the clippers or whoever next year\nThe most they can payments for one thirty nine um but that's a lot of guaranteed money on the left on the table and by the way to get guaranteed money when he's got to be thirty when he signed this deal and he's got Tom typical miles on it and he is ... there is there is concern from teams about giving him a five year deal that that there are some\nLittle dang drop off the cliff type of situation ahead of him or you know it was just a miles catch up with him they're really concerned that some places about like hey do I really want to pay him a five year max so\nThat you know that he realizes that that guaranteed money is not going to be there on the back and so yeah it's basically comes down to he wants to get treated so he can get paid next year\nYeah and I think that people have to understand the Jimmy bowler is well aware of all of us financing stopping so he knows that by getting treated that team will have a bird rights and they could pay him nuts\nThat is so they he knows this and which is why he's trying to force the trade now instead of playing this season out and then trying to get chopped off in in the in the free agency period next year he is well aware of all that which is why he will exactly out as it\nGets this he gets there there there's no subtlety here and eat this is about landing somewhere he wants to be but somewhere where he's going to resign that's why he gave them a list of teams [noise] um and he was suddenly open to Miami which I think by the way is a good cultural fit and a lot of ways it's a\nIt's a team that's big on conditioning it's a team that is big on resting guys you know they don't when they condition the heck out of guys and they don't want them into the ground I'm kinda the opposite of the school he's betting most of his life with it but I was so there's a lot to like about the idea it's just you know he's he's got to get traded he's got to get the death somebody's got to pull the trigger on the deal\nI Know it's only the pre season so far occurred but uh is the hype surrounding the Lakers would shit or should people really kind of slowed down slow their role a little bit when it comes to already putting this team in the western conference finals\nThey slow your role to ramp\nUp its just get a T o using other Los Angeles team as an example um the rams didn't look terribly impressive in the pre season um they didn't ... barely play their stars I think they're doing OK Scott I like the last time I checked I think they're going to be pretty good\nYeah it's it's still the pre season and yeah they said some place and they're getting a little bit better are starting to find some connections and and rotations wind up to the ball was back to like there's some things that are working but\nI mean I was watching that game tonight going gosh it's just so pre season it's not the exact rotation is they're they're both coaches are still toying with her patients in line ups and things are going to try and the other thing is that\nYou know that the Barney tapes that beautiful jumper that forty foot jump shot to close out the house and by the way it's so fun to watch job abroad shoots him almost half court because it is so strong he's some strong\nHis his ... mechanics don't change it's ... it's the saying he's not heating it it's just a ... jumper for him but you know nobody close on him trying to go see some sort of close the Clinton was right there clay Clinton smart enough to close that up when the game matters but he looked at pre season there's a lot of that going on out there\nYeah I just think that you know they're good and and they'll be good but I think at at ... the number three team in the western conference right now I think anybody who was just saying that you know gold my date or even Houston is going to take a drop off you know they're they're they're not paying close attention there's I think\nYou I I think Houston to a little worse but not that much worse than the other thing is three I think is really high for them but I don't I think the gap between three in the west and ten in the west this year\nIs going to be five or six games probably like it's just going to be so tight that it's not impossible I I tend to have Houston therapist I trust them like every night they're gonna show up and play defense and Donovan Michel ... toes is going to get them some pockets and I just trust them to play better at night in a night out\nBut I Do the Lakers right now I think the Lakers are gonna start slow and pick it up but you know we'll see maybe maybe they figured out more in the pre season them at that I that I'm given them credit for\nWho's number two for you is it Utah is it no no it's ...\nIt's golden Golden State in Houston in some kind of order it's really I think the order is how much does Golden State in the caring yeah ultimately it's like\nThey were there to see last year because do some really wanted it and they didn't think Houston's defense is a little worse I think the ... well I'm it's just how you know the Golden State wanted to they could she's Seventy four wins again they just don't want to it's a question of just staying healthy at and how badly they want it\nYou know why I think is actually going to chase it who I think it's going to chase the ... the the season when\nI think the cell phone on a mission yeah yeah I I really I really think Boston is not just on a mission to win to stay healthy and to win the NBA championship\nI think they're going to try to win as many regular season games as possible I think this team is going to wean high sixties and push the Seventy when plateau [noise]\nI think that they are going to I if you told me at the end of the day they have the most wins at the end of the season\nI Will completely by that I think that it's even possible unlikely for this reason they're the best team in the east they're already favorites to come out of this and go to the finals and you know we'll see what happens which won two and see what happens with faults in Philly we discuss all that but Boston's that seemed to be\nAssuming they make the finals\nIf they're really going to challenge Golden State home court matters got to be home yet is that is it yeah it does it got to start on their home court and and not that that's completely gonna phase the um the cell um\nThe a ... minute they've won everywhere bought some of the talking about by the way just to do the plot tomorrow I I Am a we've got a whole Celtics breakdown pod cast dropping with a sharp likely from NBC Sports Boston ah ramps tomorrow morning so Bob so there's a we actually discussed that finals or among other things\nYou know what we are going to watch it and we're going to talk

at um the way the postseason going ... they are just begging for Dodgers and Red Sox because they need to read and he's writing I read an article by Christine Brennan from USA Today and she does she has a great job\nBest um you know in the business but I thought she was a little unfair because she was this article I read it out so you guys can follow me at Scott's on their\nShort article about how baseball's in trouble because of the ratings numbers\nBecause less people are watching baseball's boring I get okay I Do and why agree with someone for points it's a little unfair in my opinion to judge Monday's rating of game three Yankees Red Sox against Monday Night football\nAnd I understand both teams were a blow up so that's why you're like okay well you know it's kind of fair but fans were tuning into she Drew Brees breaking records\nAnd its football football is always going to do great\nSo they got ten point four million ten point two million whatever it was whereas the baseball didn't even come close to\nThe baseball number on Monday was bad\nIt was a four point for one\nBut that game was over in the ...\nIn the red Sox didn't need to add runs in the in the fourth inning game was over All right you're hungry for the poor thing All right Kim was over in the force than you would plenty of time to turn the game off and tune into Monday Night football\nI think the better comparison would be\nBecause it was a stand alone game and it was a better game that came down to the wire\nSo that's more of an indicator of if people are watching because we paired up against Monday Night football yeah you know the average sports fans going to gravitate towards the football Yankees Red Sox theme for average seven point one million viewers\nIt peaked at eight point five million viewers\nAnd that's a lot closer to that ten million number that Monday Night football guy\nOf an accurate depiction their\nEight five five three two three four NBC eight five five three two three

there's been some good games\nYou know I still think the best game was brewer's cubs I'm that game just seem to have everything um I thought the wind was taken out of the sales of the Yankees Red Sox only because of the way it gave me three was I think the Yankees were going to win too in a row against this team\nSo you know you look at it and I I'm just hoping for classic series you know to have one game or or or two games that are good does not make a classic series and uh\nSo far baseball needs it and uh you know there's been so much written 'cause there's no games by the way [laughter] like that's that's the other thing like you got to move this stuff up and because they are not\nUm I saw the one thing about you know leaks from the commissioner's office that they're secretly rooting for the Dodgers\nThey are not secretly doing anything they are backing the Dodgers\nTo win an [laughter]\nBut it's ... it's ... it's it's one of the things that I have an issue with and it's down the list but it's on my list of issues with baseball because if you're going to judge a sport by what markets make the world series you have something missing\nThe NBA does not care who makes that the the finals as long as they're super stars make if they're playing in Cleveland or Kalamazoo they don't care and the super bowl is the super bowl and they don't care if the Jacksonville Jaguars make the super bowl they will hype that they won't care\nAnd if it's a classic game it'll do a fair share reading but if the world series is brewers Astros as opposed to dodger's Red Sox it's going to go down a full ratings point\nYeah you're right you're a hundred percent right then and now she's pregnant has to realize this too because he went on ESPN last week and complained about the fact that all of their divisional series games are played at two o'clock in the afternoon but I'm Sorry Alex when Yankees Red Sox or the other series TBS is going to take that as the eight o'clock primetime game\nThey have to try to get as many eyeballs as a possible\nAnd and I saw the ratings that that this year's division series the ratings were up from last year and it's because of Yankees Red Sox in primetime not because of the Astros\nIndians [noise] right and I don't think it's a ... it's a mock on Astros Indians I just think it's more of a statement of the sport if you don't have any players that you know who they are ... I mean people\nTry it out of a line up um I think that your sport is just hoping for the world to factor and you know the thing that I was taken aback by and I I noticed this on national broadcast how many people are surprised by the brewers\nI Do some stuff in Milwaukee so I've seen probably\nSixty Seventy five brewers games this year ... there are a good team yeah they're not perfect team they're not there twenty eleven Phillies they're not you know they're not the the the two thousand one mariners like these great teams that didn't that didn't wind up in the in the post season\nYou know the brewers have a chance to to really do something because they can shorten games very very well and that's how they won during the regular season\nThey won and everyone kind of shrugged their shoulders and they know how to take a punch and I I hate to say it but anybody who surprised you just didn't see him yes because they were great all season long\nBoundary and their strength the strength is their bullpen but\nWhen it comes to the post season now both pending is not going to work against the Dodgers team\nBecause that Dodgers line up might as well be an American league wide open and you imagine them in the American league one of the ... and that was your first and you can throw in jail or in the outfield their camp I mean they're just stack the Dodgers so I don't think bull pending works for them but that being said\nI don't necessarily agree only because of all the off days you know there's so many opt to first of all the ... the brewers won on Sunday they are not going to play till friday they can throw six pictures on friday and still have at least two of them are available for to for them to on Saturday well do\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home here dancing

mean you know going to Minnesota I'm not going to use a lot of running backs and I'm certainly not going to use one who has major concerns encourage the mood scheming\nOr in 'em off into blind play

they've changed we\nWant to reach out and you're playing and I'm teaching art fair match like yeah you're on a draft Kings' and a lot of people are playing for BP are now I use in long also it's just

hard without ball you you know like it's really really hard to be efficient on it touches that the rhetoric that position so far ... has done it and I think he's earned baby a bigger role than people realize\nPrint charger theme I mean he's going to get twenty twenty five thirty percent of snaps\nA leading Melvin Gordon and that's significant I just think people need that real estate expectations where as you mentioned you know taking twenty yard pass it to their house and stuff like that uh is very difficult for running backs to sustain so\nI'm not the kind of guy that looked for high production and blow by then he backed the Christian but I think that ah he's certainly really count to die and yet you got to play twenty or thirty percent of Napster that sent\nTalking Adam ... overtime NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com give me one wide receiver that you're a keen on this weekend in one wide receiver you're fading [noise]\nHi keen on I'll go ahead and say his God or in all I'd already mentioned the spot that I thought was really nice for the box and a lot of people are going to be drawn to make ends with good reason to charge acts of a good reason\nAnd can't break with good reason I think we've got a window is just it's kind of if not more than all these guys and I I Know that saying a lot of Chris guy when is that true specimen athletic profile perspective it than local produce their economies out there and you know he'll rotate a little bit he's not going to play every snap but in a potential shoot I think he has\nA chance to ah really I'm kind of surprised and people at a lower ownership\nThan the other guys I'm\nFor feeding on tracking this week I I Would say Antonio Brown is someone that would scare me just because you know after

with Rachel Nichols the jump on ESPN I mean what a data have cameras there and Rachel Nichols in attendance\nCouldn't have been planned right I mean Jimmy bowler shows up his first day of practice in ESPN happens to be there with Rachel Nichols what a ... and then he happens to throw it see fit and throw everybody under the bus walk out of practice and go straight to Rachel Nichols again what a coincidence\nYou know what I'm not buying bridges today\nI'm not\nInto me maybe it as a matter of timing\nBut Jimmy Butler who publicly doesn't ever really come out and do ballistic you may not be the most ideal teammate it we're going to go over that aspect of Jimmy Butler's career starting in Chicago now Minnesota but\nHere's Jimmy Butler going all crazy in practice that we ever on a jury but we're going all old job back in junior before\nI don't know I never heard of it to this level on a day he happens to show up at practice there happens to be a one on one interview set up again fool me once shame on me fool me twice no fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me what I'm saying is this today Jimi butler showed exactly why\nI Would not trade for him jury butler today showed why if you're the Brooklyn that's the New York Knicks or the LA Clippers the free TB apparently wants to go to why they would not make a move for Jimmy Butler because what Jimmy Butler did today was not only embarrassed himself in my mind\nBecause he's telling Scott laid you up and need be yet Jimmy ... was the one that wants to get out of town Scott late in Tom's river don't want to freedom is Glenn Taylor the owners are saying yeah trade them you want to make it off or call me direct\nBut when you're calling out the young players exactly the reason why there's apparently a problem in the Minnesota symbols locker room and you show it out\nThere and practice embarrassing teammates\nEssence what you're telling these teams of young players like the next the nets\nYou put me on a team of young players I'm going to call him out I think they're being lazy I'm gonna call 'em out is that what these teen needs that a healthy dynamic in the locker room so Jimmy baller\nThat's like throwing oxygen as a spark in a fire but what upsets me about the whole Jimmy Butler thing is this well I think Jimmy ... looks like a clown\nMe makes call Anthony towns looked like a clown he makes Carl Anthony towns look toothless he makes Carl Anthony towns out to be somebody who is too afraid to say anything in one spot lives that are then you'll rallies the troops in the southern and no one wants to listen to him\nAs if his message is hollow\nBut there's another aspect of this that really upsets me okay let me read you a ... year olds are asking is as good as they come when they come to me he's Mr basketball okay\nAnd on Twitter what they're asking he talks about what happened is one of the road and I read it first and I'll tell you what I have a problem with quote\nA lot of Minnesota players left timber wolves practice today energized by Butler's performance mesmerized with him taking end of the bench players in running the table and the regulars sources said at the end he marched out like if a might drop butler delivered a Tour de force\nWhat what would be to be the source considering he sat down with ESPN right after the practice\nThis is straight from the horse's mouth of course first butler energize the players by the way did he energized the team to more than forty eight wins last year\nDid he energized Minnesota to be a much better team with all that talent apparently he didn't do much energizing last year during the season but yet in one practice might drop Tour de force I'm not buying it\nWhy would any young player look at what he did today and be like man that's awesome yeah call out Carl Anthony towns in Andrew Wiggins yes ... yell at the GM yeah treat 'em all like crap oh man I Want to be with him\nThat's the type of leader I Want on my team really maybe that's why Minnesota just screwed up organization that is one squad\nHere's what you'll be butler is doing Jimmy Butler's trying to be as annoying and root as possible so they trade them\nAll at once out now because if he doesn't get out now in the season starts he lose the tens of millions of dollars in IMAX deal if you get shipped elsewhere during the season for if you have to sign is a free agent next to offseason that's the problem Jimmy Butler wants to be annoying Jimmy Butler wants to be a cancer right now because Jimmy Butler wants out\nAnd you don't think it's an wince when Jimmy bowler vocalizing that the way he did today in practice\nThe day he SPN cameras in interviews are there you don't think that's a coincidence that Jimmy Butler did these antics today knowing full well that would get front page headlines considering he was sitting down the biggest mouthpiece out their ESPN\nBusiness Jimmy Butler ask again Wednesday we bought ever gotten in front of the camera and yelled at people\nHe's not owed outback him junior right not to that level of what we saw today in his performance but my whole problem is this Frasier inroads around ski to write that what Jimmy Butler did today\nPretty much get to slow clap from the guys on the team\nThen what he's in essence telling me is the team has turned on Karl Anthony towns and Andrew Wiggins 'cause that's Jimmy Butler's public enemy number one into what you're telling me is nobody on that team respects those two guys because they're on team Jimmy Butler\nHere's what you do I'm going to lay it out easily here this is what you do if you're Tom ... and you're a Mr leading this what you do\nYou train them because that's exactly what he wants this is a ... child that stops his feet\nAt the dinner

took a sponsor ability and gotten the gym\nBy the way how ironic are those comments when you think about what Jimmy Butler did today\nThis by the way January of two thousand and Seventeen almost two years ago\nHow ironic right my veterans would never go to the media what a Jimmy Butler do after the practice went straight to the media to an interview with the jumping Rachel Nichols on ESPN\nMy bet didn't pick and choose when they want it to bring it Jimmy baller picked this because we both had yet to show up at a practice with a week before the start to see that and he just happened to choose today when he had the interview with ESPN lined up to quote unquote bring it\nThey brought it every time they step to the gym whether it was practice or a game on Jimmy ... hasn't been bringing it because he hasn't been showing up\nSo he didn't get along with Iran do and Derrick Rose in Chicago he didn't get along with Fred ... the coach\nI mean it was ugly his exit from Chicago was not pleasant\nThe only guy he seems to get along with this Tom seminal joined got it seemed we can stand and that the wait and wait obviously the Marquette connection and then they got along in Chicago but the fact is it just seems to be a case where Tom sip it it was the only guy that can put up with Jimmy Butler yeah now he's trying to escape Tom zip it out\nI Do think when you look out there the talent level of Jimmy ... brings to Wade player you would ever every team interested in bringing him in considering he's available right but I think teams are weary and scared off by his attitude I think there are scared and weary of things as what he did today\nThat's not a reaction that makes a team say ooh I warn them that's a reaction to make the team say well I don't wanna I'm afraid to bring that dynamic into my locker he's too vocal\n\nIf you're ... and Jimmy ... starts talking smack on the next one you know search called without Kevin knocks publicly what do you do\nYou destroy your team and by the way whatever team brings it means going to give them a huge contract so it's not as if you get rid of them next year because he's a bad guy in the locker room you're stuck with Jimmy ... if you're\nBringing them in as a Knicks fan I Would want nothing to do what should we bowler don't forget to the Internet detectives remember that story about Jimmy Butler I'm hanging out with Carlin the town's his girlfriend yup yup\nEx girlfriend whatever it is whatever that walk and and then you have the whole thing with like running around with carry a union\nI made a joke that we don't we don't know what I mean Dwayne wade did fire back at him right he commented on Gabrielle Union thing and then Dwayne wade Jordan and commented on it but I mean you would hope\nThat he got he got his your part to rise to the it'd be nice yeah I don't know it just seems like someone if I'm a next you know personnel was Christopher present just being the main do there\nAnd Kevin knocks you know the hopefully he could mature into something good but you got to protect present gets you kept bringing them out there he would destroy presented his convoy absolutely he's a domineering personality I wouldn't want anything to do what you don't care how good he is\nHere's the thing though is if for Jimmy Butler what's the one constant when it comes to Jimmy bother me butler lead teams had any success he's Tio do you say he's on your PC you would see however when\nYou got to a speech showed out in the Philadelphia Eagles Seattle oh yeah that's it and he played with a you might be as banged up in that game probably shouldn't a plane and had a hundred and forty four you are like that but she was never won anything Jimmy ... and the winner\nAnd to me I think you kinda see what happens I think Jimmy ... this is a divisive guide a locker room that'll do he's uh twenty five point guy in place solid defense I think Jimmy ... is a net\nNegative I really do I I don't think Jimmy ... makes you that much better team because I think Jimmy bowler makes everybody else in the locker them uncomfortable\nAnd because of the style of play the NBA insiders say that he ... he's an old thirty is a lot of where in the early called ... dip into body right right I'm going to get the bill just works He did that he's like a Japanese baseball coach I get something like that it works either that makes you run and he got really make you actually work out right\nAmazing I wouldn't touch them and I think that's why\nLook when he was available in the report came out of the nix the nets in the clippers\nDo any one of those three seems jump\nWhen they fall over themselves to go to any of our know Miami to go see any against itself right now\nThink about that they're negotiating against themselves\nTo get you mean by by the way this is a big thing we have to get into\nHe's just you know for the NBA I\nThink about that I'll tell you why is actually good for the NBA coming up

are you with each purchase of metal bowl synthetic reaching a portion goes to the intrepid fallen hero scarred\nAccount currently at the Newtown isn't respected guy in the team he's not a leader when he opens his mouth people don't listen to me Butler's the driving force on that team he's the one that all the young players respect Carl Anthony town just kind of a guy who doesn't work that hard he's all about his own numbers\nAny kind of happy with his situation that it's I think the narrative right now Jimmy Butler right he's not he's not mentally tough would you agree that's the narrative right now that we have currently at the new towns yeah friday much okay so if you're currently Anthony towns put on those big boy pants and fight back\n\nYou got to say something you're going to allow the narrative to all come from Jimmy Butler because ESPN's looking it all up the SPN Jimmy ... right Adrian will giraffes keeps waiting quote unquote source is saying that the players love that rah rah their tour to force the might drop moment\nBecause he did that by the way at the expense of a Carl Anthony towns at the expense of Andrew Reagan's at the expense of Scott Laden he did that on their expense but might drop the slow clap apparently is what happened that moment\nSo if you're calling pretty talented you want to establish yourself as the leader of that team the movable part of that team really bothered you get ... but you can't move me because I Am the future and the president of this\nTeam suck it up and fight back show that you're the guy come out with the statement that practice why did you not push around should be butler but should we bought let's start at why don't you pushing back\nYou gotta fill up your chess and say my team you were a rental you don't want to be here my team you guys you get behind me don't listen to this guy\nI'm going to drive down to lay nominate don't get his face give me the ball in the low pose the ball around me and I'm going to back him up and smack it in his face laughing and see what he does that's what you need to do with your caller doctors right now your soft right now I'm not\nAs a young player hit your my wagon a gym into law to call Anthony towns\n\nLike you know you think about the military Sean right and I'm going to use the member saving private Ryan\nAnd Tom Hanks is captain Miller and his troops love 'em right they run through a wall for him and then when the you know met it gets killed Giovanni ... bc there's that moment with Edward Byrne and then he's kind of being in subordinate right and then then Tom size more as a sergeant ... trying to get back in lines that the gum pointed and right\nAnd then Tommy make that speech about where he's from and all that and like the guys understand what he's doing and they love them again right\nLike that has to be Carl Anthony towns you have to be that captain that all the guys want to get behind you and when you say run across that feel for those bullets you're going to do it 'cause you trust them\nRight now he's the captain and no one following him when he says hey we're going to go from this location location trust me will make it a want peace but yeah not happening you know first we're going to stay here\nThat's what's happening here calling for the time he's got to get these guys to get behind him and believe in them\nThat's what has to happen and you know what he can't wait a couple of days he's got to do it now\nBut for the NBA they liked the drone mean a curling towns has to turn to his teammates to go look on the captain now\nAnother movie right was\nThat what he's got to say is if you have to say ah what's what's the dollar amount on me now remember because they have like the amount of money as to what he was before the war but what did he do for a living he's like well what what's the tally up to now\nAnd the uh the the loser soldier you know the one who's the ... at the end like he's like stunned that that's what are you asking us soldiers like fighting amongst themselves right like he's the one that says I mean Karl like an iPad right now is to say anything\nThey don't tell me it's not a leader currently have any towns is not a leader\nI always a young guy but you know he's been a lead long enough and he's a face that Minnesota Tim rules franchise but you're automatically\nThe leader now active but sadly here's what he did after practice\nHe gathered that the team together and what do we hear about that\nI Know I'm just saying they're trying to be the leader that right but he's not doing it accurately or right so you believe everything you read do you how do we know how their teammates reality really one of the teammates reacted to that poorly but uh you know but here's the problem with that we do now but here's the problem with that Sean where it was Jimmy bowler when that happens\n\nJimmy ... already talking SPN at that time baller without a practice when calling from Newtown\nRallied the troops right\nSo that's like ah you're you're hiding in the bushes while the bullies pulling all your friends or the bully leave then you come out on top and say oh man if I was here I Would have knocked him out\nI feel like a stories coming of you in seventh grade and you are hiding in the shower [laughter]\nOh yeah he's two blocks away and I came here to protect you guys bullet yeah you're right you're that's what it was well but he ... he tried as my point he tried but even in trying to me according to your right when you put even trying I think he looks weak\nHe rallied the troops after the guy who's responsible for all the nonsense they left\nTo NBA players needs to be leaders\nIn order to win I think on young teams that he's the young guy on the team yeah but he's a young guy measure weakens as well I mean those are the two ... and then they're the ones being targeted but don't right but it's about fighting back\nEventually ... leaders I think to a point yes I think to a point when you're being challenged you have to be the leader was Kobe Bryant leader no\nThe Kobe and Shaq they don't like each other right they want\nBut then they couldn't keep it together after that you really wouldn't want to camping trip and I wouldn't want how many want eight you Kobe wanted more tell me what to do her six Kobe what George W rent the fact of how many more championships shock at least to\nWhat it would it mean meant to his legacy as he battled for number six late in his career right mhm thinking about that you know you read of the fact that he was a jerk and couldn't get along with shock\nI read it and I think for a guy like ... pounds if he doesn't fight back now and established himself\nBecause he is the rocket Minnesota Jim Ebola can get traded their not moving calling us any towns like you're going to suddenly go rounds right now but when you're building around Carl Anthony towns the whole point is that the super bowl is brought in to compliment Carl Lee Anthony pounds\n... pounds is the joint weight on the team when Miami brought in the other guy recalling the towns is the common factor there\nSo he's the one that they have obviously invested in so he's the one that can go out there and be raw raw\nAnd rallied the troops because he's not going anywhere who's the leader\nOn the Lakers and in the eighties magical rah rah ... leader\nCream maybe no cringing say two words I was magic probably magic I mean if I you know what there's so many veterans though\nI mean you could you could be a nice leader as my point you know what I mean like I was either an idle yeah you know you know in an elegant way you don't have to be a yellow butler yelling and screaming and calling out people write like Michael Jordan did apparently do\nYes but here's the thing for calling the Newtown Joe he doesn't have to be our our our leader like that\nBut when your intestinal fortitude as being questioned in a public display like today at Minnesota symbols practice there are times where you have to kind of step it up you could go back to being a calm leader that lead by example and his friends with everybody\nBut when you're the one that's actually being called out directly or indirectly\nYou have to show you have leadership qualities by fighting back and that what they call it that it how did that said he needs to do something or else that narrative that we have currently in three towns just grows the narrative now is he solved the soft right that's the narrative piece off and he doesn't work hard\nThat true that is right across especially defensively\nThat's the big knock on their cars and tried to find someone that doesn't try defensive with which I Believe by the way honestly how many young guys they do try defensively\nJimmy Butler money's on the on the young guy but that's why I respect like a bull in a quiet letter guys like that who understand like there's two sides of playing basketball star James Harden I always kind of like a James learn Ron even to play that size strength play a lot better defense last couple of years like James Harden come on\nCarmelo come on your plate deepest what you want to play defense if you have any sort of athleticism you can play defense come out with and he's not us I mean he's not just to the movies on the line manic right he can move\nBut you're telling me he can't move and block guys and get in front of all you have to pick on man cause the ... I Wonder what what else yeah two Super Bowl what do you know they'll say well what are you there oh they oh they'll say\nHe's not going anywhere I moving he's right to say that it's ... it's right to do with a new piece I'm just kidding I I just want to be in the eyes over and he wants to several you the greatest through civil MVPs you're right that is the narrative when it comes to have a real quick I you know we brought the Kelly bright situation on the show what brings up real quick\nKelly bright situation\nThere apparently is by behold from coming up\nWhat's the ideal place I'll tell you what it's funny because if you think about where he's looking thing about the conference he's looking in when you think about the schools how funny with that narrative be if he shows up in the ACC and apparently that's where he's looking\nThat good that smart the let him leave to go to an ACC school\nI think about that I mean there's a reason why schools don't want guys to stay in the ... the Airforce and NBC Sports radio and the NBC portray the mobile apps\nHe is am Thirteen twenty W Abyei jar Wisconsin Rapids weekday mornings at five AM CBS News special report\nThe strongest storm ever smack in the Florida Panhandle regain my nearly a category five time money of devastation their President Trump pledging how\nWe will there no effort [noise] snow ... snow resource to help these great fellow citizens of ours that are going to a tough time right now Michael\nWeakening to a tropical storm as it moves through Georgia okay H.

red Sox taking care of that beating the Yankees at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx in a game for to move on\nThe face the Houston Astros obviously big reaction in Boston to knock it off their rivals big reaction here in New York as well we had to Boston columnist at the Boston Globe damn Sean is joining us and\nYou don't yeah before we get into what this means and things like that I Want to get your thought as a baseball guy your thoughts on the decision by Alex Cora after only a Thirteen pitch eighth inning and ... being a typical Christian Bale outing thrown Ninety six by the way to automatically go with the closer and bringing kimbrell and not go with failed to try to lock down that night we okay with that decision\nI was a again chemicals the closer you know go three run lead that's his job twice here so yeah it's uh it's okay it's sale you know they're thinking that they can he's going to be their their game five star against the yanks if a\nIf you know things don't go well so\nYou don't want to burn him for thirty or forty pitches and then ask them to go out as gay five two days later so\nIt didn't even occur to me they would do anything else when he came in you do is going to be a you know one one inning guy that was that I thought the strange will was poor soul left after six or five and he's been throwing up sixty five pitches sixty five pitches when you're only given up one run is not a lot\nAnd um but I think he knew he had he had to sail for the for the night and he thought he could bridge that so that's why what went down but it is a process I Can't say I was like saying what do they do it here so I I Would not change that now\nHow would press without score in terms of his decision making them working compared to what Aaron Boone did and I'll tell you being a Yankee fan than I have to admit I thought he was thoroughly out coached out managed buyouts Cora\nWell that's fair I had a really bad two games in New York especially and are\nJust amazing that after you know going too long and in game three that he would do it again was about the endgame for I was just it was obvious he had nothing it looked impaired I mean\nCould move off the mound loaded the bases in the first to get out of it screwing up a lot of balls and I was just stunned that they weren't people warming up and they didn't have everybody on board everybody ready for that I thought it was a\nA stunning lack of recognition of of the moment unlike last year when ... ... you know you know with one out in the first endings like hey we can't fool around here it's a one game a lemonade should we go to like take a clean this up and\nGames three and four and and ... going to have to pay for that I mean you know he had a one hundred games this year grade rookie managed season but those were those were not as good days for him\nIt's funny 'cause after the air and judge incident at Fenway Park after game to walking by the home clubhouse playing New York New York on a boom box nothing was set up until really yesterday in the post game press conference Alice court kind of alluded to it\nThen you're a guy that's in the know you've been around you know this team you've been around the city a long time is that something that you think really kind of was that bulletin board material stuff although they didn't even kind of make reference to it until after the game\n[noise] yeah I think it was and again I I Love that kind of stuff as as a writer you want that we were all over it we saw the video from Saturday Night so people were addressing it Sunday for the Monday papers showing the off day\nAnd a and then of course they come on they wouldn't sixteen to one and then when they clinched it the next night they're playing the song and the clubhouse so that was obviously a direct retort to that but you know they did it on the field and then you're allowed to kind of doing the clubhouse after that so\nThere was premature and judges part I like judge I think he's going to be here is the future is that MVP in the making and pray player and it seems like a you know really stand up guy all that stuff but it probably as much as we loved it for purposes of of theater probably regrettable move when you look back at it\nThe great dish honesty joining us calmness the Boston Globe Iran going deep dance worse than NBC Sports radio\nAs a baseball guys I Am dance to see the first Yankee red socks series you know with so much drama so much anger out there frankly in after fourteen years and the two thousand and four how great it is it for baseball though to have this and they sent them you can sense there's clearly bad blood between the two organizations\nWell yeah I mean they had a you know they had a brawl earlier this year and and there's just the the ancient history and it's not like the seventies or even right or ten years ago and a rod and ... and all that stuff going on\nIt'll never replicate that that was the height\nBut uh I think that you know as baseball goes these days and then to have him I mean they had to the best three records in baseball this year and that's a good first round matchup so uh that was all about it and you know a game five would have been even even greater and uh I thought I thought the Yankees would show better frankly it's like\nA Boston did a great job they think the ex didn't ... didn't hit a home run the last two games in her own park which is pretty phenomenal are given what they did this year so it's actually attacked them in a good way to get it done and they deserve to move on but I was I was fired up a before during and after the series\nThe moves that corner may do all of a Christian Vasquez gets to start in the end he gets the series winning home run off Britain one of those Yankee Stadium jobs\nYou know a lot of switching the rotation have all the game three to open up in New York rather than force elements of going game for you know ... on the line up the kid hits the first ... first cycle in postseason history then he doesn't even play a game for\nYou know as you're watching these moves wait what are you thinking to yourself when you you know you get the lineup card to get the rotational changes are you thinking what's he doing or you know there's some brilliance there\nWhile after game to it at home I I wrote a column saying they need to start you know behaving and playing like the team that won a hundred and eight and you know just put on a big boy pants and get out there and and push back because it felt like they lost both of mine at five for when they open or was was good but they had a five oh they and they hung on for dear life and\nAnd uh it didn't feel secure and then they had you know routed game too and all along homers\nAnd it just it felt like a they were kind of in the hall and they got to New York\nAnd I suggested that they they start concerts second and a and put the average the third and start stealing bases and they\nDid all those things I was like hey I'll take credit for this this is great but no so those things didn't strike me as\nAs a seismic as they were logical moves which he made in and\nIt was weird though because on Sunday he said well you don't want to panic at the small sample into games and then he he changed for four guys in line up before game three and they all did well and then of course for game for as you stated\nYou know he he let the guy at the cycle sit down for the cat Vasquez in there who hadn't caught for cello all year\nAnd he hits the game winning home or what amounts to the game winning home early in the game and does a good job on the plate so yeah he's a he's on fire right now his his things even set of all there was going to pitch seven and his and give up one run which is exactly what he\nDid not already there was a that could manage Israeli in a in a hot spot right now and and uh you know he's he's very confident he has been that since day one\nAnd uh it's it's all working for him and of course he has the the strength of having been on the bench coach for the Astros last year so a lot of knowledge about their team as the stocks go up against a really

Houston do two games to none\nHistorically David prices one of the worst may be the worst postseason started history isn't it amazing to say about that show and he is the worst post season started and history\nBeing made ten starts the postseason he personally has only nine his teams have lost all ten of his postseason starts lots more hands he is the worst\nStarter and postseason history I Will not second guess Alex Cora after the clinic that he I Know right you're right it was you know what the coaches congrats being the first postseason player in history of a cycle but you're on the bench next game you know Christian Vasquez you literally did not catch\nOne game of reports though this year I'm going to pen pencil you in for game for and he only a game winning home run up the series winning home run\nI'm going to play rock called income on like I'm gonna playing games or instead of ... called Kim's or big double RBI scores aren't I'm going to pitch yeah we've all the over ... yeah to start the series good strong sales\nFor an inning bringing for self earning on their throw days amazing worked worked at everything you did work you know and uh but I Do it the question David Price going into I don't I Do Dan you have to pitch David Price at least once in a series right against the Astros\nWhy not game to set home\nFirst of all maybe it's worse for him to pictured home isn't it worth the ... for president worst ... home he's become the a rod of a a Boston he gets booed there\nBut for your team though he team sick David prices for your team said well you can have an years right but at the game before bigger spotting into what is you can be down through ... down to one can imagine the other way\nBut here's the problem if you go down to nothing going to Houston\nAnd you have all the ... three and four okay but you know ... here's the problem they still have to in game one\nHow about this than if cell doesn't win game one you're not winning the Sears anyway if they if if the Astros get to ... you're done right it isn't that true right they they can't be the Astros without sale be dominant again\nNow they need to be able to win today ... joined us yeah feel without games ... Bennett pitcher honestly against Yankees so why are they all though I mean ... why did no I'm saying the bullpen no not the ... the rest of the starting rotation for some it was great yeah but how about that about of all the that\nAlex Cora predicted seven innings one Ron baseball now and he gave you seven innings and gave up one run amazing the guy has made a pact with the devil and it's working I don't know what he said he soldiers still I think let me have this World Series when\nAnd I don't care what happens to me because everything he touches turns to gold are you nervous about calls Korea\nDoes help yeah a little bit absolutely you have to think the Astros need healthy malice career to be no no they don't I don't think so either\nYou know it's amazing you know what some teams draft poorly right you never always do with your draft picks nope look at the Philadelphia Phillies there probably hoping Mickey Modi act even becomes ... player at this point he's been terrible two years of being the number that guys like Martin single a Hindu twenty whatever he's terrible\nThink about that roster right now now the Astros tanked games ... seasons bulk up their draft picks turned out to be Korea brag men\nRight I mean to cornerstone super star players who both having a play on the website of the infield right mhm they're superstars pregnant in Korea\nI mean that that is hitting on your draft picks George Springer yep another guy they hit on George Springer was the first round pick I think no is early for early front or you can write yeah there's three first round picks that amounted to cornerstone players on your team\nThat's impressive give him a lot of credit for that yeah but they they messed up some too of course every team's going to mess up here and there I mean baseball draft the biggest crap shoot out there but it is impressive when the team has three guys coming out\nLosing seasons in high draft pick that have actually amounted to star players is the George Springer a star he's a thirty and a hundred guys use their star now he's not elite superstar like Korea or pregnant those guys are all these superstars\nSpringer is it all star that's what he is by strikes out too much about that and then but who's better regular correct\nPragmatism pregnant to start it pregnant than the MVP conversation numbers he puts up mhm he's unbelievable walks a lot too\nThat's a good idea that's a tough team and you think about like you know they pulled the trigger on the Berliner deal who they give up for Berlin rather\nThan looking at the Detroit Tigers I'm thinking\nThat much talent who should get purchased in Berlin you gave away like you're a strike like you guys on his way to the hall of fame at this point the way he's a ... Houston\nBut why did you bring back for him I don't know the title Tucker is a guy that did not hit on him yes after roe picking a twenty Fifteen drafted to top picks yes so I mean not everyone turns out where soccer now what's\nHe doing no idea that terrible I mean it's easy to be a high school kid that uh if you think two dollars and Fifteen he's what Twenty one now Ninety seven he was gone yeah yeah twenty but he kept me might might be you might not be terrible now you might not be known as ... they they played them this year I mean they have high hopes for him still but I mean he hasn't\nI guess well but we were comparing him right where you're burying him to what they hit on you know you're right he was a high draft pick he's the guy that uh you know but he made the majors though at Twenty one\nAnd he had a actually he's pretty good is good yeah good minor league career yeah so I think what is your thought on that debate hit on him to my goodness I guess when we think about the Braves and and and\nThere are twenty year old being SARS already which borders being dropped the international by nice\nYou can tell me they also made some great trades and brought a lot of young arms

Boleyn family and another ... executive took care of it if you want to know about the toothless news all the NC double A. just follow this case\nBecause I just don't have any idea why nobody else has suffered because of that\nAre we supposed to believe this never happened and this was all made up by these people that have been arrested\nIf that were led to believe orange surprise\nSean when you hear about these cases and I'm not surprised ... rate and got paid their parents got paid for him to go to Arizona He was a top recruiting the nation and I'm not surprised when people mention Cannes is that all these other big programs being involved do I believe the bill sells for the ... the Roy Williams of the world do I think\nBut up doing everything kosher no I'm not an idiot\nBiting my shift is the only guy legitimately recruiting without any problems and Duke is so great that everybody wants to go play a Jew and that's why everybody picks Duke and he got three of the top the top three recruits of the nation coming next year just because he's might just she has to be any waves the magic wand and they pick him over Arizona and they pick 'em over\nKentucky and they pick 'em over North Carolina my supposed to believe that\n... more All right sorry I don't buy it\nDo I think there's a financial bidding war between Kentucky and Duke and Kansas and other top programs for five stars yeah I wasn't born yesterday too I think the coaches know about it yeah do I think they encourage him yeah but I think the sneaker ... companies are in compliance with that yeah\nI think it's a whole group that's messy with their hands dirty in this you know why should I see it why is that the government sees it why is that there's testimony for those involved\nNot getting the door down but yet the NC double a sitting in their high horse in Indianapolis doesn't say squat why is it the show Miller still recruiting top five classes now he's doing it cleanly\nLike you're doing cleanly now and before you have to have a deed is helping by buying and players right trained right are you telling me that they're not buying players now that the boosters aren't still involved\nSo I watched boilers which has gotten way too political for me by the way this easily I Love the rock the first couple of years of all this has dealt with shows that this has been fun to watch it's fun you know I mean it's it's miss Kass\nBeyond this cast that that super agent with the the hot blonde yeah from New York obviously with that accent like if you're a super agent representing like top players\nYou have a bigger set on yourself then that guy that they're they're showing right the GM of the quote unquote rams you don't go away but you don't go from selling cars to being the gym or the rams within a year right that doesn't happen right\nYou don't go\nAnd be as kind and nice looking in friendly looking as the dominant defensive end of the cowboys like that one character but it's kind of miss cats like it's just not a good casting job\nMy problem is they've gotten so political right but the one thing I Do agree with this years their portrayal the NC double a\nYou know the rocks going after the NC double a on the show you know what what he said about them to a point is accurate they are kind of spineless they really are and I think this is a case what just highlights that like I Want to see heads roll in college basketball I Want to\nSee some changes occurring well I think the schools have more power than the NC double as a whole but but but kind of like the un right\nBecause if you want to have real power you know the kind of spineless too man but here's the difference though\nWhy are we leaving it up to the schools do end does anybody trust the schools to police themselves\nWith what's happened in college for him and see the NC double a due to school what can SMU who did that test them you can see the boy who are laid to hammer down on Penn State for a while now they then\nGave it all back but who was that who took scholarships away from Alabama at one point the NC double a\nWho went after Ohio State and kept him out of all the NC double life All right so then the Aspen was\nBut it is they are why because you have so many big schools involved\nHere's the problem for the NC double a those instances we talk about Ohio State with their little infraction Alabama when they have issues you know the other programs of issues yeah you'll get it for a year or two right unless it's so big like Penn State and it's a national story like if you can't just slapped her wrist and say you know\nWelcome back next year\nBut when you have a the entire sport college basketball under the microscope with some of the biggest programs and names out there involved or at least be mentioned is being involved\nThink about if the NC double A. actually drop the hammer on college basketball and this whole dirty and they're still paying players to go to certain schools by the sneaker companies with of course wink wink jobs and the coaches think about the names in schools that would ultimately be taken down Sean\nYou think the answer you know really wants to take their head out of the sand began simply wants to go kill Kentucky\nKill Arizona kill Kansas North Carolina Duke\nEvery major program in the country some of the biggest names in coach and you think the antibody wants to do that one school here or there sure take away scholarships take away a post seasons\nBut five ten twenty of the biggest schools the biggest names in college basketball all involved in the same sleazy and this toy you have to smack him all the same time you think he ... he wants to do you want to watch a March Madness where for him in the favorite to win at all so you're saying the schools have the\nSaying Israel for aids they yeah they are afraid of the backlash the backlash schools no not from the school from the public from Kansas from North Carolina from Kentucky no because the relevancy the sport when I don't think the people I don't think the public cares if you don't think if you had an NC double a tour of the top twenty five teams that country out of it\nOr suspended for two three years you have so many top twenty five program so it doesn't matter yeah but you take out kids if the Kentucky and the big Arizona to get him some care no but it's bigger than just Arizona if it's just Arizona I think they could not care about already mentioned those two schools you think people killed but Kansas is involved\nThere they're mentioning this as well you want to keep digging and digging and digging what do you think you're gonna find\nRight why do you keep it give it a gold mine after you strike a little bit of gold because you know you're gonna find more you dig and dig and dig look ... wants to find something they can problem is they don't want to go there because I think they don't want to find this\nBut enough reading of what's going on in courts right now when the guys that are now working in testifying for the government I mean payments to the under age and\nWhat was the story a hundred grand right that was a story Miller denied it\nHere's another guy saying yeah we paid ... family twenty five jeez\n... no come on not buying it\nThey don't want to know that's the problem but I just thought we would have more at this point I thought after that broke and people are all those guys out there writing articles about this is it\nJust you wait sit back and see the names of issues that drop right okay we've sat back and wait and now what happened a year more what's dropped besides work Pitino\nThe other guys are still recruiting top ten classes the assistant coaches got other jobs that coaches that we thought we get fired quickly there still coach and he asked is nothing has happened\nSpineless what it is about going to school just mindless to mean you can just wants to investigate bill self in the program built up a lot of money that school Carolina really wants to know what ... Williams knows no ... no Arizona wants to know shouldn't do it for the Arizona basketball and the\nSad that the state we live in though and as a consumer the product\nI Do want to see those teams the NC double a tournament come on you and I like mid majors but I mend majors beating the big boys\nYeah and the big this other big boys that'll take the big boys this place things so you you can't just for a year to stop do not do [laughter] I'm just sort of Michigan or maybe this can you\nStill have UCLA I think no Wagner was legitimately recruited you still feel like the taxes as many big school I'd I'd like you won't miss them for a couple of years I'd like to look into those programs do you think it would hurt [laughter]\nDoes not have to Kentucky for talking with down for a little bit yeah I think when they had what's his name the guy from Texas and as a coach or what was the name\n... ... Smith no well you know after Tommy Smith\nWho was after Tommy Smith in Kentucky and he was you came from Texas in Texas and then Billy God really hold on don't break all safer for the other side will will get the name\nBill anyway the NC double a survived and that's why I Survived without Kentucky for a few years they gonna keep surviving just are not real good for a few yeah All right I Want to be so it real quick so habibi is the biggest name in us the right we think he just be Conor McGregor\nHere's the problem for the U.S see what happened after the fight and I don't mean I don't mean what happened in the states I mean literally what happened afterwards in terms of how people getting out of the country you got to hear what happened next days' worth but NBC Sports radio in the NBC Sports radio mobile app feels like we're interrupting the conversation\nThis is Brian posted catch Wisconsin badger hockey right here on your twenty four hour information station am Thirteen twenty WFAN jar Wisconsin Rapids\nCBS News special reports hurricane Michael\nFor time Russell in Panama City were destruction seemed to be inside this hotel\nPeople ran for\nGovernor in fear after hearing parts of the roof fly off now families are worried about their homes you wash out but they know what maybe days at least until they can go back to their properties\nKind of when the\nNational Hurricane center specialist David Roberts says the threat from the storm remains and people ought to be vigilant possibility\nTo tornadoes isolated tornadoes or tonight and then to a Thursday morning I'm from Georgia and to the Carolinas particularly on the eastern portion of the system\nThere are two known fatalities blamed on the storm which is now going to travel up the east coast CBS News report jailer\nHere's your forecast from the weather I weather center overcast guys overnight lows around thirty seven western early when ten to twenty miles per hour funny guys accepted again tomorrow high temperatures each up to forty wives\nSlows down to about twenty nine tomorrow night mainly cloudy skies expected drying with temperatures well below average friday and Saturday and high and low forties did he ever forty years\nFrom now whether ... whether center I'm wrong with you Jennifer cheap skier\nTogether we can turn a stairwell into what are the moments now [noise]\nWe can turn a rescue refugees too immature [noise]\nTogether we can vaccinate seven hundred and ten thousand people living\nTogether and we are Doctors Without borders\nDoctors Without borders goes where others don't to provide life saving medical care and more Doctors Without borders dot org\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd we're going every which\nWay\nThe way\nBack\nOn doing deep enforcement NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com we head into what amazing what number six of the NFL season amazing how quickly the years going by the Arizona Cardinals coming up their first year on the road to San Francisco forty niners twenty eight eight teams their guard\nJustin ... joining us here in Justin's you guys were so close to two weeks prior you lose the Seattle by three you lose the bears bye to your finally pull off at first when the season nice skip the monkey off your back huh\nYeah I think that was the big issue for us so I I think we know when the two games prior to but ah obviously there's going to work out for us it's hard to win in the NFL I can tell you reached bearings but I was going to get that first one\nWhat is Josh Rogosin like and I asked that question because no one denies the skill set the question with him come again this year from of course UCLA has been his attitude you know I mean he's kind of a very bright guy maybe a little too bright what's he been like\nA you know I don't think it's ever negative as they are too too bright of a God at the quarterback position he still young he's learning I gotta wait wait do you have the physical skill set\nBut are you learning the game and learn to adjust and learning how the pro game work and what goes into it and the work that's required that is all new for you know twenty something year old kid so he's a he's learned he's growing is getting better veterans can work started about\nKind of course you don't even watch like in the huddle\nGays quirky by all of the type of that to us or\nIf you're if you're going out there and putting the pads on getting hit I think you have a little bit of a from a little bit off with you but if he's on the jokes around as you can tell you do like a young kid fresh out of college wide I learned a lot and that we find anything\nJust come from a New York giants team where you have established quarterback for a heck of a long time and Eli Manning in a huddle you know he's the leader now you have a Josh Rosen a young kid I think what do you see twenty ... Twenty one years old coming out of the junior from UCLA\nHe's their leadership qualities there and as a guy who's now veterans in this league and you have a life that shelters been asleep for Evers well\nHow does a Josh Rosen go about\nBecoming a leader without being I mean\nWe're not really being I guess an ego trying to be a leader to heart a Twenty one you know what I'm saying like how do you go about doing that\nYeah did you first start leading by your actions and guys start to earn their respect for you\nBased on like how you play how you handle yourself how you prepare how you work and Josh has done that throughout the OJ processed and training camp\nAnd when he got his opportunity still young you still makes for a few mistakes and there are things that you know I Would I could look at the lines that you I did this very well ... you get to this level but he's grown he's going to get there and going to get there and his own way and and that's something that\nThey'll continue to become more and more of a leader but just ... just playing that position of the quarterback because you coming in and commanding running the auto ... it comes to the territory\nHow has it been though in terms of the quarterbacks you had a guy a same Bradford who's\nAn established veteran you have my Lehman obviously and now that have the young guy kind of take over you know some some quarterbacks obviously don't handle ... so well what's it been like throw in terms of the fence with same Bradford how he's handled now having to take a rolls back behind Josh Rosen\nYou know than than the ultimate pro I think he's been in a situation where he's been in other places ... quarterback battles I'm Sandra true professional and he's handled himself likes as such um for the team obviously we got to go out there and we got away with who's that quarterback and that's coaches decision and and we were all with that and who are looking forward to\nObviously you know we have three very capable quarterbacks on the roster\n'em to go out there and just play hard whoever's out there\nWhat do you guys just a line have to do better Justin\nLater on all better I mean starting up from that that's\nNumber one as a unit though you know whether you guys you know we're in we're in this thing together saw one guy made a mistake you can make all the other everyone else look down that play finished keep learn the off and learn a little new on love it\nLearning how we're going to go attack defenses withdraw their quarterback and find out what we do well I mean we're not even a full year and says all and so I Know a lot of time to the learning curve to that\nTough though just in you know you're now in what I guess you're sixty or I guess in this league\nAnd you want to win obviously you know you come from the giants and it was a tough fresh for the giants you come down to Arizona and he got a Twenty one year olds quarterback and that usually means look\nWe're going to go at this kid we know there's gonna be again I'm not saying it's a throw away you're obviously 'cause there's so much involved in terms of getting a kid prepared he's it tough though for you Justin knowing that with a young quarterback at the helm they are going to be a lot of growing pains which means we're gonna lose games because of that\nHe said that you look ahead to the future you say we get through this year we get the experience for Josh ... now the way of being a rookie the futures really pride is that how you look at it\nAnd I do want to win now and that's obviously the mentality you go into it with but you will call out of these teams have won superbowl's in the past so you look at the eagles uh last year having a young quarterback that doesn't take up that crazy cat number or they're also well some of the world um\n[noise] and there are other teams that have one recently um is definitely a formula is on TV you so the future that we as bright I'm looking forward to that but I thought was a tough one are losing\nLast time I ... you know my second to last year in New York two thousand\nOr the sixteen Fifteen we went to the playoffs but are not winning definitely wears on you\nArizona Cardinals who are just a few joining us going deep bench horsemen NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com you look at what's happening in New York I mean as you spend you were trapped there in the first round you spent five years in New York you kind of look at what's going on there with all the drama\nYeah I definitely say I mean I I definitely have found that teen obviously I we didn't live on the best terms you know as as you as a free as you know many free agents who who don't get offered by their former to leave on on great terms but I'm Still following along and I know some of the guys that I Know that are still there you know I Wish him well\nWhat do you think about comments from a hotel is it fair for a guy to come out and make those comments during that lock room in that happened with one of your teammates would you be upset\nUm 'cause I I don't really know what's going on with the ... I don't know anything about those coaches I Do know Joe ... is a once in a generational choir I mean\nHe's the guy that you know he's in his prime he wants to win games um it it's tough though airing I I don't think ever airing out dirty laundry and public\nEver really got broken that work out too well um but again I don't know the climate in the locker and I don't know if there's been conversations internally with the team and with the players so I talked to judge it from afar\nIt's interesting just to go from a team or as you said you have a generational talented wide receiver no doubt that Kim junior to a team that has and you know I'm forty years old you're you know mid twenties\nOne of the greatest players in our generation both of ours in Larry's the child who puts a huge numbers doesn't say anything really and goes about his business how different is it and what's the benefit of a guy like Larry Fitzgerald who shows it out there every day but doesn't kinda figured that laundry that you're talking about\nYeah it's definitely tough and and look I Will say that the media in New York is a million times different in the media and Arizona um so I don't know I I think being in New York you have do have the camera on them and all on everyone's followed him around the errors Arizona a little more lack 'em\nAnd brought to you like Feeding America and the apps\n\nCan we can walk to school at the corner we\nStopped like kind of down forty one thirty one I mean\nWe took a left right or whoever you\nKnow music was coming from the car\nAnd he's a smart kid so distracted\nThere are so many others found\nSuddenly he realized he forgot his homework again on the cable [noise]\nSchools\nWhen you can see learning and attention issues from their side\nYou can be on their side that's why there's understood that or a free online resource for the parents of the one in five kids with learning and attention issues get personalize recommendations practical tips daily access to experts and more to go for misunderstanding to understood dot org raunchy by understood in the ad council\n\n\nYour your passwords\nSports radio down job\n\nI don't want that number three being forced an NBC Sports radio NBC both radio dot com it's on every night to kind of point out those who deserve to be shooting for doing her thing stomach flat out ridiculously stupid we do so here by throwing yellow flag and issuing personal fouls\nYourself [noise] because nobody is off limits\n\nSometimes train wrecks just continue being train wreck [noise]\nAnd I think that definition fit the name Lenny ... better than most\nEveryone Lenny sure it was a proud member of the New York Mets\nAnd the Philadelphia Phillies somehow became a power hitter with the Phillies somehow got bulging muscles\nThe ... yeah that's right chemical and has meant that happened back in the day\nWhen he died sure then had to hire being this great penny best remembered as a whole penny stocks than there was a genius\nThe NBC's Jim crater where Kramer would out Lenny dyke stride and what a genius he was when he came to stocks such a genius that Lenny die sure makes so much money that he bought Wayne Gretzky mansion in LA like Nineteen million bucks [noise]\nCalling this guy fell out ... when he died sure was a Ponzi scheme in crook\nSo he went to jail for that\nAnd it continues to roll downhill for when he ...\nHe's been indicted by a grand jury in New Jersey on drug charges\nFrom a major incident were in their alter ... Gruber driver\nSo the indictment charges that he had cocaine methamphetamines and was making terroristic threat\nIt's all third degree crimes these are up to five years in prison what he is facing he claims he was threatening the Hoover drive and tried to kidnap them\nWhen they try to change where he was going [noise]\nMeanwhile obviously the other side of the story is different in our mind going to trust Lenny dyke show with his history no\nIt's actually a sad story when he died for the fall of what he died he was a bullet play around with that shot apple loved player he was not just in New York\nBut he was a bowl of player in Philadelphia image and a dog with a lot\nOf course has gone out he doesn't look good for him it looks like he will be spending more time in jail\nPlenty dykes gr\nIs my personal balance you know what it is Sean like\nYou would hope an incident were waking up and say I'm going down the wrong career you know by the wrong path in life\nWhen he died strict time after time after time it's one thing after another where he continues to get in trouble for bank\nThat'd be the next ... something\nBad could happen to the guy\nThat's why I got I I Hope not and he has such a great player for the ... spark plug in eighty six yeah and also\nFor the Philadelphia Phillies when they went to the world series nice to be three yep he was you know he was great lead off had our great respect for the ah that'd be ... it'd be be yeah yeah I used to play out like that he and ... and you're right John crock\nYeah how in the third base yup\nMickey ... yeah ...\nI could just as you might be right with me on that he was he was saying was that the last time he was a picture on the ground that seemed to encourage her chilling turtle Holland carry Mulholland ... of course would give it up to Joe quarter and game six\nBuddhism and they had so much for the holiday on that team that was amazing to me you know I spent five years in Philly and\nI got to work with their adult who passed\nAway last year from brain cancer but what a great guy he was but\nEven though they didn't win\nThose guys did not buy milk and so I Would hang out Dutch we'd go someplace and like\nPeople would show up\nThe women all dare and all the women would all it would be like now forty year old women all show up the darn oily all I got there don't was married and he died you know ... up the personality had dared adult and was\nMarried to the original Mitt suitors\nBecause she was the attraction of Phillies games\nI mean that guy lived a heck of a lady was telling me stories about him in ... on the road and him on the road I mean these guys live I Would imagine most ball players on the road yeah yeah absolutely\nBut uh the personalities those guys are amazing soccer was on the head of him yeah married I don't think it was on the phone from I don't remember and all that\nMariano Duncan was alright I'm your personal found today there was a big news news because the brawn James said\nHis kids drink wine his fourteen year old an eleven year old\nI've got very mature fourteen and seven forty and an eleven year old James told reporters\nMy fourteen year olds drink

more farewell Angelina [noise]\nAnyway welcome back to the morning magazine in part to were visiting with Ford county ah for each program coordinator Laura Huber we're celebrating\nFor age weak and okay we've talked about how the kids early then I saw the ... so what we're doing this tutorial about new history of forage either as not just about forms and know that there's a lot more to a civil war do you want to go next with the story I was forty\nWell um where are we today\nWe are no longer in the separate boys and girls clubs girls can learn canning and boys can learn about farming now um for each has the largest youth development organization in the United states it's far beyond the United states as well it happens and er it um it's been copied in countries all over the world\nUm so it's gone international which is really exciting\nSix million people here in the United states we have over seven hundred youth right here in would county who are participating in for a\n... are from um five year old kindergarten all the way through the year after they graduate from high school and um what's really the the thing that I think is best about for ages that\nIt is directed by you so I'm the activities that you want to learn about\n... noticed I said the things that they want to learn about us or are things that we can do and for age we have no set curriculum that we have to teach our kids um so what they can do is they they join a club\nAnd the club can be somewhere near their neighborhood it might be just where their friends hanging out whatever it be\nUm and they work with some adults who really care\nSo the adults than they use for um some um trusting relationships and done the adults job is to make sure that programs are offered that meet the interests of the youth in that club\nSo each of the clubs here in ... county and right now we have sixteen clubs um the clubs each have different personalities so we have um let's talk about Snyder for each right here near Wisconsin Rapids\nThey have a phenomenal food stand for us um the central Wisconsin state fair so [noise] um some of the things that those kids are learning you know yes fundraising but they're you know inter personal communication when they're um staffing the the the front end there\nAre running a food operate basically running a little restaurant\nThey absolutely are um so they're learning all of those little business um bits but then they're also learning or inter personal communication and they're they're learning about service and they do a fantastic job with um plays that creative arts stay\nUm they do have some kids in a horse project they have kids in dairy you know it it really runs the gamut but one of the highlights for Snyder is\nUm and I don't know if you've ever had the cranberry apple pie up at the central Wisconsin state hire\nThe head of one of those\nKids are learning to make everything from scratch they all get together they make the pie crusts from scratch they assemble the pies they bake the pies everything's so I'm just a really cool opportunity\nThan what we should get them to the other on a field trip over to miss these men you to talk to shove Bryan who's famous for his whole mid ... a real love working with both kids are those kids would get a kick out of here I mean that's cool I mean to ... their hands on that's hands on activities like I said discovered\nAbsolutely and one of the things that they've done really well this past year is they've kind of made a focus to say you know what the things that you use are learning today really have an impact on the careers that you choose to\nExplore tomorrow when it's time for you to hit the work world so you talk about maybe I'm a field trip to ... they've done all sorts of things with having um different professionals come into the club and talk about what skills are necessary to be successful in those fields and it's really run the gamut\nSo Snyder's focused on um he was learning for career readiness is one of the other highlights that a lot about Snyder\nFirst of all since I notice you are probably wearing a T shirt I says Golden Globe for age making the best better since Nineteen twenty eight\nAbsolutely so I've made it up a point to try to get all of my club T shirts [noise] um I don't have them all yet but I think each and every one of our clubs\nIs just outstanding and I'm my job here is to break them up I got to go and participate in the Golden Globe club meeting this past Tuesday they made out at ... elementary school up by Marshfield\nAnd they have the largest club in the county\nThey have over eighty members long and you should have seen how fantastically organized that meeting was um the most difficult piece for them that night was a it was the first night for their new I'm officer team\nTo be up front and learning how to speak into a microphone and manage the microphone was probably the most challenging thing they worked on\nOr ... or ... I don't want to go down in this part of the county ... or southern were telling me for he's clubs\nSo we talked a little bit about Snyder all writing rice um that are further south right now is the whittenberg workers and they meet in a coup soft furniture um and they've got\nA really ... so like I said every club has its own personality and right now I'm really impressed with how the whittenberg workers are I'm working with their can get a column middle aged let's you know middle school and high school aged kids\nYou know sometimes it's really hard for clubs to retain those members in the middle school and high school stuff because that's where new opportunities in school and in sports and everything really blossom\nAnd the whittenberg workers have been doing a phenomenal job keeping the interest in keeping activity has going for those middle and high school aged kids so um if if you're in the southern\nCounty and you know you've got kids that age\nCheckout whittenberg workers surface um and they have like again a wide variety there always faithfully I'm participating in creative arts stay but one of the things I'm excited about is um that club is growing in the involvement that they take in other\nUm county and even state wide events so it's really exciting to see when kids are making the most of the opportunities that for age has out\nThere for them working some other clumps as we take our tour and saluted all the local forage clubs and we're going on for each week\nYeah so they carry go getters for each club is I'm now meeting invest spur\nSo they are in a state uh I'm how do I say they're just membership is blowing up food and expert unfold growth yeah so and and it's kind of this this crazy experience for that club because they've gone from a club that was like\nSeven to ten members kind of quiet doing their own thing well lo and behold word got out that um they're general leader is an absolutely incredible horse leader\nSo um use are able to join which ever for each call they want to and they hadn't choose based on what projects are offered to wear their friends are what night of the meat or what night of the week they meet you know whatever it is and so we have a lot of people now seeking out the Kerry go getters\nBecause they have that really strong horse component um\nSo that's driven by a specific project interest and um\nSo if you love horses and learning how to raise a horse and all the other aspects of\nI was gonna say caring for a horse different styles of riding horses you know I'm going to admit that horses are not something that I've been very familiar with at all\nAnd so I started to really learn a lot during the fair this year I had no idea that first of all there were different styles when people were talking to me about English and western I had no idea what they were talking about so it's really cool for me to watch our ... our young people who are confident and knowledgeable enough\nTo stand there and teach me what it is that they already know about law and to be able to explain it in such a way that I can actually learn the differences between these things and to hear their um reasoning for why do they choose\nTo do this versus that\nYou know I'm I don't know if it's just an incredible thing but they carry go getters again they're active\nIn plenty of other projects as well but the thing that really draws people to them is I'm Tina and Mike Fox and they're incredible um horsemanship and their willingness to share that I'm with our young people I I\nAnd I think that's such a gift to have people in our county in our our extended community to who have special passions are special deals to be willing to share that with you on people\nAnd you know I I think it's a selfless thing for those people to share their gifts\nAnd when you stop and you talk with those um incredible leaders they're not going to tell about you know all of the fantastic teaching that they have done\nWhat they're going to do is they're going to tell you about all of the incredible inspiration that they gain from working from these kids they're going to break up the um skilled development and just how impressed they are with their kids because for every one of these leaders it's not about the leader and it's absolutely about the kid and they are there to celebrate\nSkills and discoveries and experiences and that is so inspirational for me\nHome for America in the morning is am Thirteen twenty W.

depends\nOn which game you're looking at if you're looking at the first couple of not bad if you're looking at the BYU game you're seeing a kind of an ugly performance out of the ... it's it's been you know it's it's routine it was picked to be in the final four maybe some people over ... over their skis and we certainly bought in here specifically off of their performance from the Orange Bowl last year but\nThis team just hasn't been able to kind of take it to that next level and I kind of in the news you get the same way\nYeah they've been hurt a little bit I think to Wisconsin of late ah there's still formidable when you got Jonathan Taylor in an office of line that's basically they have their picture was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated this year\n... you know they got some ... ... you know and you know what they're they're a team that basically comes right out of there nothing no surprises they're going to line up and they're going to run it's going to be a whole line of scrimmage or is this kind of football I Love\nAnd um and and they got talent and uh they've won in the past a head coach Christie's\nThen what coach too straight years ... it's a good football team\nDespite what the expectations and all the other stuff for a while you mean Michigan though is they're going to have their hands full and Michigan you know you look at them they lost that other than the first half against Notre Dame you know they have a that disappointed a lot of people but since that game they've got better each and every week and and that to me that's important\nWell that was give me my next statement is you know going back to that game yeah it it didn't look good and then as the as time has gone on they've gotten better I mean I Know there was a lot of cries early on and everybody expects this program to be back in the top four top five and I I understand that\nUm but they did seems like at least right now they're on track and they guide they're heading in the right direction so to speak and they got some good they got some salad players they got a pretty good quarterback in shape Patterson obviously all close to Seventy percent completion percentage sixty eight point is if I'm not mistaken he's he's been really good\nRight now to me he's been the different ah Michigan I mean I remember the game last year at a in Madison\nAh we had we had you know we are at risk I put on the road and that's a good football team a year ago but we are quarterback in a way that gets comes down to the that's what I think is great about only work now I Know he doesn't probably get a lot of respect as much respect I think is a pilot given but that kid makes plays\nAt certain key points in games\nThey get them over the hump he did against Iowa this year\nAnd and I find that to be a real asset for him and to that ah and that's what Michigan his lack the last couple of years and what shape Patterson they've got that guy now that guy can you know him last week or

took a screen shot of six tweets coming from dar Nell Mayberry okay I'm going to read them to you so Jabari Parker\nWas um this this was last night they played Indiana in a preseason game\nAnd says here from Dr Eli sisters the bulls prepare to open the doors to practice of the media any minute the biggest topic will be the mood and mentality of Jabari Parker the native son who was moved to the bench in game for the pre season and declined to discuss the move with reporters last night\nAs the media walks into practice Jabari Parker spotted in the weight room\nJabari Parker just tried his best to take the high road when discussing his moved to the bench in last night's preseason game he said he declined to speak with reporters after last night's game because he quote wasn't prepared to answer questions\nThen asked is reaction to the lineup change Parker said quote I Try not to get emotional understanding there's a theory to everything I just tried my best to be where I could then Parker set a permanent move to a reserve role would quote be a huge adjustment for me but\nI've just got to change with the time Parker also said no comment when asked if he'd be willing to accept whatever role fits best\n[noise] this is the guy that I'm One of his last week was I'm coming home\nTo Chicago and the rose was supposedly going to be coming home and Chicago's favorite son and then Jabari Parker was going to be coming home and he was going to try to throw the franchise on his back and become should Congress favorite son and\nNow they are they're sending him to well remember they put their Greg when roaming the bench and he just for the team better that way\nHe became a better player in that regard [noise] uh he uh but good Jabari Parker was coming home to be the main\nWell the issue here that I took away from it was\nJabari coming out and saying that can be a huge adjustment forum to be in a reserve role wasn't even a reserve role Milwaukee he that's all he did was come off the bench last year some ... should be very comfortable with this ah but again if you're a Jabari Parker\nHe does want to be the ... ... and Chicago right now is in a holding pattern because they don't have the guy on their team they've got a lot of good players there's a lot of young talent there but I think if you're Jabari Parker going in that situation\nHe has it in his head that he should be the guy so now once again here we go I [noise]\nGood luck with that Chicago the good news for them as the contract that they would Jabari Parker bacon bail out of it so after this season it's not like they've got Jabari Parker under contract for the next five years and they're stuck with us but it is kind of interesting that we're in the pre season and he's already been relegated to the\nBench what is it about Chicago that drives people crazy Derrick Rose MVP rookie of the year the whole thing went nuts Jimmy Butler\nLeft here good guy play from our cat get to know I'm a little bit then he goes down to uh Chicago he gets good I give 'em credit he improve his game he was always a good defender then he took his defense turned over to his office and he became a burgeoning star\nAnd then went nuts and then you saw the whole story coming out of yesterday and today was how he came back to Tim rules practicing just basically caught everybody out and told the organization it's just a big giant bird and wants to hell out of their challenge them said you ain't blank without me and it just like ... white\nAnd now you've got you've already part going back home and he gets sent over to the bench and\nIt is what it is you know I mean it just what is it about Chicago that people go home and get full of themselves\nI don't know I don't know what it is\nPaid five five eight three zero eight six for it if you want to chime in and joined the program you can feel free to do so eight five five eight three zero eight six for it [noise] um we have not talked much box basketball we'll get into that a little bit down the road\nWithout a doubt um\nYou know it would cause I Do want to talk some bucks basketball just right now you got the brewers heading to the you know see as she got the Packers getting ready for Monday Night game ah the president right now is obviously the Milwaukee Brewers and what they have going on it's just it's ... some fascinating stuff\nFor a player that a left I don't understand when when by the way when a Chicago came to town to play in the exhibition game why'd you boarded Parker was met with such booze\nDo the Milwaukee other than just didn't like the organization I don't think there were a lot of booze you can hear it you can hear in the broadcast\nAnd people were tweeting about it you know I mean I I'm just out why why would anybody do what did he do basically just said he didn't trust the organization in bed and I'll be honest I I don't know I didn't get it\nBut anyway he's down in Chicago and that's Chicago's issue now um\n[noise] uh let's see here I got a couple of tweets this one's from Trevor who says the Milwaukee Brewers I think you're going to win in sixth excited for this game do you know where a guy can get tickets on the secondary market well here here's the biggest I guess note\nIf you're going to be buying tickets the one thing they recommend first of all go to a reputable ticket dealer okay ah our friend Michael reconnection ticket service he'd be happy to help you okay there's a lot of good ones out there secondly if you buy them from someone specifically\nOkay if you buy them for some more from someone when you pick 'em up tell that person I Want a picture of the tickets and I want a picture of your driver's license and if they're not willing to give you a picture their driver's license don't buy it from them\nDon't buy it from them just just a little advice because then you know probably the tickets are are not a not for real\nJust just so you know\nBecause usually most reputable people will say that you're sure here you go there you go but don't otherwise don't buy it from somebody like that especially if they're asking an exorbitant amount of money which tickets for the NFC I said now sold out\nThere now sold out so if you are going to get tickets for the game it is going to be on a a\nTrack him down elsewhere ... track him down elsewhere type of a type of scavenger hunt paid five five eight three zero eight six for it if you want to chime in feel free to do so eight five five eight three zero\nEight six foray we talked about changing uh if if changes are at all are made to the house yes roster what would you make also a brewer is getting ready to take on the Dodgers are a little bit more than twenty four hours from now it's about twenty nine hours from now as a matter of fact\nIs when that thing will be getting ready to get underway and or the brewers\nLot of people not picking the brewers but there is this a theory out there this conspiracy theory that uh baseball doesn't once Milwaukee in the in the world series we'll get into that and explore that a little bit when we come back more of the bill Michael sure right after this\nThe organization you know what Craig count so I'm sure he's going to look at it and go and that's just I'm not worried about that don't you know that's that's just talk don't worry about it you know but it's got to be something that sits in the back of your mind especially this is a specific we'll say you're you're ... you always have seen\nYou know you've got a three to breaking value feels right over the plate\nYou know crashes turning around looking at the embargo you're kidding me you know and he's calling it a ball putting another man on walking in Iran whatever happens to be you know you're thinking yourself okay there you go at legitimize is what he said it still worst thing to happen to major league baseball\nEight five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eighty three zero eight six for a if you want to chime in ... please feel free to do so\nA five five eight three zero eight six for it\nThis is one of these things that we've talked about it's not really stated\nNot really stated but\nYou always wonder in the back of your mind a new commissioners do leagues actually have their thumbs on the scales rather than allowing things to be equal on all sides\nA five five eight three zero eight six for it\nAh this is Mark Mark said we were just talking about the same thing last night how major league baseball's probably drooling it the fact that they could get Boston in LA together on the same TV stage would be huge ratings boon for these two franchises\nAnd for major league baseball as well no way they want the Milwaukee Brewers to screw things up so let's go Milwaukee let's put our thumb on the scale ourselves\nA this one from Jason Jason writes I Can't believe that this executives said this does he does he feel that he has an axe to grind against major league baseball because he's not in the game any longer\nI honestly I don't know the history\n\nOr I don't know San Francisco and not well enough as far as the personal interactions go\nTo to give you an opinion one way or the other I Wish I did I Wish I could give you some kind of deep insight to say you know yeah he's he's ... he's outspoken he's always been honest and that's true but I don't know if he's PO to baseball or feels like he's been black border has something to say a negative just to say I don't know\nIt certainly seems like now I haven't heard of the entire context of the interview but it certainly seems like once it was stated there was a lot a lot of backpedaling\nTo say wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute ... you can't do that you can't say that but you know as my dad used to say we used to go to the forum on the weekends you'd always say sun you can't put the blank back in a horse\nOnce you do it\nThe window one time now in the backyard throwing baseball against the house dad said don't do that you could break a window don't do it I don't know why just kept doing it boss slipped out of my hand bam right through the window\nBad came out looking at the window looking at me looking at the window looking at me I'm I'm just I'm probably I don't know ten twelve years old\nJust feeling I'm going to get crushed homes or I'm Sorry that sun can't put a bag and horse once it's out that was one of his favorite thing\nNow it's out there a five five eight three zero eight\nSix for it [noise] like I said I think it's good for baseball for the Milwaukee Brewers get to the world series because then you're talking about another team that tore down build it back up and has done it in for and you know all intents and purposes the right way\nMade a couple of deals to get some you know players that had experience that are going to bolster this team they didn't go out and just by a World Series or you want to spend two hundred and fifty million on one particular player but it would be the smallest media market with a smaller budget\nAgainst the biggest payroll in a big media market in baseball and I think that is a terrific story line for major league baseball I'm probably wrong in the sense of ratings and money but I think the storyline itself for major league baseball\nUh would bode well but then again maybe that's wishful thinking on my part because I think last year when you're talking you know LA and in Houston I don't think there are a whole lot of people looking at these masses going go Houston go\nEight five five eight three
