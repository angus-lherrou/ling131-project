talk Lakers too if you'd like\nMark sure sure well let's start with the Lakers are obviously and it's so funny we we had one of our basketball guys on earlier who we have on a on a weekly basis who writes for pro basketball talk and\nI said you know what what is what is the expectation from abroad and this and this team um you know this is what he's been to a street NBA Finals and I don't I Can't see this team getting to the finals what's what's the title odds for the Lakers right now see\nWhat's interesting about the title art odds mark is that the Lakers or the number four team there at twelve to one to win the title number one is Golden State there the prohibitive favorite minus two hundred got about two hundred to win just a hundred on Golden State but after that used to and Boston and then the Lakers as the number four pick\nHowever in terms of how many games Vegas expects the Lakers to win and this is a much more sophisticated market with pro is bending over and under the Lakers are only supposed to win forty eight games that makes them the eighth best team\n[noise] well that's interesting I've I've seen\nI I I've had why shouldn't say scene lines but a lot of conversation and set the over under at fifty but a Vegas it's edited forty eight on\nWell what's happened is that the Joe fanny pack walking up and down [laughter] is betting his twenty dollars on the Lakers over there not going to win forty eight games or more with LeBron and the pro is actually that the Lakers under\nAn part of that is that they know that LeBron played every game last year right led the NBA and ... minutes per game and the feeling is is that\nWith a long term contract with the Lakers here maybe in the first year that that they scaled back in those minutes and\nI was part of our top a conversation earlier today and and I said this I said you know he's lived abroad he made all the ... a parent we made all the uh\nThe roster booze and Cleveland when he was bearing in inserted himself in a lot of those decisions are told Tyrone Lou hey we're not run in this way in a critical situation going to do it my way and I'm thinking so Magic Johnson download walls or all of a sudden get until the Bronx and how much is going to play that doesn't seem right to me to be\nI think it's going to be similar to when Peyton Manning got um a cut off the field the punt any dissuade the up and [laughter] I'm right on the show here\nBy the way we are talking with the president goes are sports handicapper from previous job you're under center or want to get to a couple of games one of the more interesting matchups this weekend will feature a the the New Orleans saints coming off of by week on what's interesting about this is Drew Brees has never beat\nThe Baltimore Ravens who by the way or two and a half point favorites uh in this ah this game which is interesting because I think the game as being played in New Orleans and I know Baltimore's coming off of that game\nInsects against Marcus Murray oh that would explain the line to me\nOkay the game is actually in Baltimore and what isn't ... laying the two and a half and it I think it's all about the home field I these two teams rated equally but frankly if I get\nCaught two comparable teams that I get the home team mark with the absolute dominant defense against a really really good off than I Am going to look to back the defensive team the number one team and the federal ... every time\nEven even the fact that there is not a few ago but even even the fact that they're giving up to two and a half points used to like Baltimore that's what\nI Do because I had the two teams rate it equally and I've got Baltimore home field worth more than three points but I got to tell you I'm a little concerned just a little and here's why back in two thousand this as a slam dunk biggest pet of the month\nBut in two thousand Eighteen in the new NFL where you're not allowed to tackle any more Mart [laughter] yeah I Know all the sudden\nHow unstoppable are these top five officers that just the Kansas City is the same time the rams that just marched down the field\nWe talked about that yesterday on the show you know Roger Goodell at the oldest reading to your came out and you know there's never been a better time to be an NFL fans we've got record run a record pace for your religion passing yards completion points and it's great and I'm thinking I guess it's a great a pure fantasy football player but for somebody who played the game for a decade in the NFL and covered it for nearly Thirty Years' Steve\nI don't think the game is better I mean listen it doesn't surprise me these numbers are going through the roof given given the are the most recently changes but but all the rule changes over the last ten or Fifteen Years it's an off into football game\nYeah and the bottom line is I think the pendulum has swung too far and you look no further than the Brady touchdown run when on the line backer hasn't been as grass but he's been so code step to don't rough the quarterback and he can't even tackled the quarterback without worrying\nAbout an ... an innocent you know just just getting him to the ground and let's go with them Brady scores a touchdown [noise]\nSpeaking of ... of the new the patriots will take their foreign to record on the road there in Chicago Chicago getting could have been for him to bed many opportunities down in Miami last week to win that game it kind of a\nA you know threw it away in my opinion a coil Mac had an ankle injury I don't know how much uh he's going to be close to one hundred percent but this is being played at soldier field\nI tell me the lines because I I I thought why was even though the New England is favored is is actually a lot lower than I thought it would be what's the line in this game\nYes a New England is favored by three and they're even some spots in New England only eight to an hour and a favorite mark this is all about power ratings and stats Vegas feels that cargo isn't above average team slightly above average\nThey feel New England even though they're the second or third best team in the NFL we only had them read it for ... points better than an average team the underlying stats are very good this year\nSo if you take the difference between a team four and a half points better than average team and the team that's about a half a point better that would make the spread on this game for on a neutral site you out in the whole field and that's why that this point spread is sitting at three or below\n\nAll the ... for the Houston Astros down for games to one of the series [noise] Jamie Martinez it's a solo shot [noise] off of Justin\n... the Boston Red Sox are up right now want nothing David Price still in the game as he works through the third any now are getting getting George Springer the ground out so\nI was more than halfway home\nOr you you said a shockingly good prices still in the third\nOr yeah what what do we went for tougher in a string to start right correct yeah and I was the way the way our score used up as both and last night I Would think that this guy's got to go at least five clause right and uh so we'll see I mean he's never want to see the game ever\nReally talking about give you ... well I didn't get the win the game but you did not win that's all I did not when we were when the winds are the most important stat for all major league baseball pitchers\nWinter the most important stat in any sport my friend when you keep score when is the most important that team win but not the pitchers ... is the most important step ever hey\nI bet you didn't know let me ask you a question yeah\nOr if you were writing the ... do you feel really comfortable about that seven year two hundred Seventeen million dollar deal you gave David Price\nAt this point no by that I mean he gave us a soundbite that all that matters is the post season and you can throw the rest out and this is what matters about team and thought about me right listen based ... it's funny because David prices contract that Frank he's contracted a classic example that\nAre being used now which left a stagnant free agent market and one of the later guys to sign\nJD Martinez who got a lower cash value than guys they had free agency years before I did but it seems to be worked out just fine for him by the way yes\nJudy Martinez is home run off of Justin Berliner yeah was the\nAnd that Berliner has allowed in twenty six innings of elimination baseball wow that's an important stat it is so important [laughter] I just I figured I'd just little hand shake\nTheir feet but you know I look at it this way nobody will remember that when he goes ahead and\nGoes to five and won an elimination you\nSaw it on the other set our podcast which you can download on on major [laughter]\nThem maybe maybe a for a guy who edits that podcast so yeah if they want to hear if you wanted to hear it they'll here and I feel that they may yeah that'd be [laughter] a by the way let's not that I mean because it's getting really ugly others Thursday Night Football game right down the street here at the state farm stadium\nBetween the Arizona Cardinals and the Denver Broncos\nAnd ah by the way it it's ugly and I mean really really ugly uh we've got eleven and a half minutes left in the first tap and Denver has already out twenty twenty eight three a lead on the Arizona Cardinals Josh Rosen's thrown a pick six and defense is given a big plays in my God it's ugly\nSo I guess there's some of that heat off of a Vance Joseph will dissipate just just just attack just to pet a couple of other interesting match ups and weeks out of the national football league you've got Drew Brees\nAnd the New Orleans saints who should be refreshed coming off the pie week apparently had somebody told me that John ... was here in the north Scottsdale area for a couple of days unwinding why not\nI mean you can only work so much right anyways uh did you know the Drew Brees\nWhen they win against the ravens\nWill have beaten all thirty two teams in the league on Sunday alright\nHowever what's what's even more interesting than that is\nThat his own for a career against the Baltimore Ravens their opponent this weekend\nNow a win would allow breeze the joint both Peyton Manning of bread far as the only quarterback said a veto thirty two teams\nWhich again is interesting to listen they're not the same conference so because of the the way the\nOther schedule rotates around you know you're playing these guys want one once every four years or something like that they become zipping through and unfortunately\nDrew was you know had the misfortune I guess of\nA face in a ravens defense that had players on like Ray Lewis and and I had read a over his Eighteen your career those the kind of place you know players he's he's facing but but I Will say this\nIs going to face the best defense and the national football league with regard to fuels points allowed it to me that's the most important that\nWe can talk about yards and all that kind of crap and it doesn't really matter I guess unless you're playing a fantasy football but the ravens have allowed only twelve point eight points per game and they're coming up at twenty nine points shut out a over\nTennessee a breeze was asked this week or if he's upset about never having an opportunity yet to have beaten the ravens and here's how we answer that question\nWho was a I mean again you just you try to make it like any other name any other opponent you turn on the film you digest what she said\nAlso take a name off the helmet and just go off of you know what you see on film and they're in a string the talented defense policy front line backer or back in secondary they built that defense should those pieces you know and so our execution has to be the frame of this uh [noise]\nI couldn't agree more but um my my guess is in by the way we were talking to are good for the anti put away for Monday morning quarterbacking Sports Illustrated used the NFL analysts who joins us from time to time an anti spends probably thirty forty hours a week\nUh watching NFL tape talking NFL coaches round the week and we talked about this quote unquote amoeba defense the ravens a ran against the Tennessee Titans so you got all these guys are just milling around the line of scrimmage on the defensive side of the ball and it's difficult to identify who's who who's coming who do you block et cetera and\nAnd in part that was one of the reasons\nThat uh Marcus Mary on the titans had so much trouble he he was ... eleven times only completed ten passes\nOr about to say this you want to run that immediate crap against Drew Brees and Sean Payton and my guess is they are going to eat that they live so I'm really interested to see on\n... on the defensive coordinator in Baltimore comes up with for this game we should also mention that a breeze will also winner this game on Sunday with four hundred and Ninety nine Korea touchdown passes so he could become the fourth\nGuy to get the five hundred on\nSunday which I guess would be cool\nThing is how prolific in ... I get this has to do with rules changes I get it this guy's completing Seventy eight percent of his passes through five weeks the NFL Seventy eight percent he owns the record in the NFL already\nI last season they completed Seventy two percent of his passes and you think my God if they can just get that deep and straight out on the on the New Orleans saints they can get that defense just top Fifteen didn't even have to be a top five events top Fifteen\nWith ... and Michael\nShe has no way breezes playing [noise]\nThe championship might be [noise]\nLA Rams in Norwich ... [noise] All right Bye bye three two three four BC let's take a quick break I'll get your pencil papers out\nWhen we come back far NFL week seven picks yeah you don't want to miss that you're under ... and you're listening to NBC Sports radio\n[noise] we look at\nYou were in BC sports radio with raising\nObject pigs and you could ask for a bigger story for the Denver Broncos tried to step that for game losing streak crushing the cardinals right now the desert what the age of three\nTo first quarter pick sixes against Josh Rosen andme encased in a sixty four year touchdown pass to Emanuel Sanders and again the writers artists twenty eight to breathe the Broncos were on top early in the second quarter also in the desert in fact well football Arizona State hosting tampered with no score late in the first\nGame five of the ales she has to win or go home for the Astros right now they're down to the red Sox won to the top of the board\nGED Martinez was solo home run at the top of the third off of Justin Bieber letter again one up in what's on the fourth time in Philly particularly the bowl sixty\nFive fifty eight and a whiz lead the heat by a point of a happy fifty nine fifty eight\nNBC Sports radio [noise]\nIf you suffer from E.

times this is one of the harder things for me to pick this week I I like what Todd Bowles do a defensively I think Sam Donald continues to get a little bit better\nPut the Vikings a man that's a team that I expect better play out of the defensive side of the football despite some of the issues that they've had over there I like to see them cook it doesn't look like he'll be available for cousins have been playing well I'm going to take the better quarterback of the two so I'll take the Vikings on the road here how about you out\nThere that makes perfect sense to me there's no revenge factor her cousins never wanted to be a New York jets [noise] ah the Vikings take care of business on the road they are the better team All right how how about you Brett lark I agree with your first and then I think Tom Bowles doing a great job of New York I'm going to put you got home and take the jets don't\nWow see I went back and forth there for a couple of times I really thought I'd take the jets but\nYou just never know from a rookie quarterback from week to week All right so you'll pick the jets house and I'll have a bike it's meanwhile the patriots and foreign to coming off the big when it gets Kansas City or in Chicago to take on the three and two bears still some question marks about\nHow close to a hundred percent will ... will be after suffering an ankle injury the bears through one away last week at Miami I think the patriots or to stop despite being on the road I'm going to take the England is what Alex\nYes it is two thousand eight teams it is not Nineteen eighty\nFive I Am alive I'm not born yet so I feel like now is the time to take the patriots to Chicago Bears All right we're gonna make it three in a row\n[noise] yeah [noise] I think this gives them because negatives a disciple venue read it and they just had a tough time stopping Casey last week\nBut I Do think they went and it was\nAll right so all three of us take the patriots without one meanwhile the bills or two and four starting Derek interested in his fourteen fear was just signed last week there in Indianapolis to pick on the one in five calls\nA Jesus bills team it's hard to figure out they're not going to get particularly good play the quarterback position they're playing on the road I'm going to take Andrew Luck of the goals of this one Alex\nSmart below and it's just very difficult to try to pick their Anderson has been on the team I Know the ... with Sean makes Herman but you're right [noise] less than a week I take captain Andrew last to beat those fights and then as you would call it on the Twitter feed\nLittle squirrel oil involved there how about you but it's such a tough game it's so hard to pick somebody go against the guys and I want to go to build on the ...\nLooking at trying to make up some ground it goes out on the Web or take the Buffalo Bills on the road in Indianapolis meanwhile the Bronx to three and one time or on the road they go to Tampa Bay to take on the two and three buccaneers Davis Wednesday at the controls you know I'm going to do this for one more week guys I told you I fell in love with the Broncos I thought they were America's new team [noise]\nA big truck by the San Diego chargers at home\nThere on the road I don't know why I'm going to do this\nThe buccaneers Alex Wilde march alone I think you and I both had the brown last week\nBy our account would have had them over five hundred for the first time in bulldog half a dozen years but that being said I I I think it's going to be a tougher road for them I'm just going to take the home team\nAll right how 'bout you breath mark you know I've been talking about the brown this week one I think they're good team but the uh San Diego I did the same thing the charges explained the weaknesses either it's a tough task I'm going to take the bucks at home\nReally I just don't think that buccaneers defenses worth of damage to the point yeah we'll see alright meanwhile the wind the two or three had to Miami to take on the poor into dolphins blocked off while it gets started quarterback over ASU great\nUh I don't think it really matters I like the Y and Z on the road and this one how about you I was\nI was going to take ASU and there was ... for Arizona State but it is it you know I mean if he were playing under Center for the sun devils right now I don't even know what I'm Talking about the middle line as well do you like to live as well Brett how about you but with the heat and humidity of South Florida did to the bears and the second half last week\nSo I'm going to take him to stay the same thing's going to happen I'm gonna take that off he's at home\nWhile then all of a sudden we have a quarterback controversy and cell phone is that what you're saying brought Wyler [laughter]\nAll right let's move on to say to foreign one we'll go to Baltimore to take on the foreign to ravens retold you Drew Brees had she had to win against the\nRavens in his career he's also and for as a matter of fact I don't think that matters everybody talks about this ... to get a hell of a job against Tennessee I think the St Louis asked them if they want to use that a medieval look against New Orleans so I'm gonna take the saints on the road against the ravens Alex\nThe ravens are going to stay high here there's some kind of a\nMonkey on drew reasons back\nAnd I like the ratings at home [noise] but how about you mark you and I both teams to represent the innocence general I think they're starting to click I think the role of the rings\nYeah I agree [noise] All right so let's move on cowboys at three and three to Washington to take on the three and two red skins\nI really don't know enough about either of these two teams the cowboys are playing better on the defensive side of the football back Prescott to become a runner as much as he has a password that helped them put a forty against Jacksonville I don't know what to expect from the Redskins there for her to take the home team and I don't know why but I'll take Washington as this\nOut full they played really well against the Carolina Panthers and then last week\nWas that last they last about\nPretty shows last week [noise] okay well no they didn't\nThey ... yeah that's correct\nSo her up and down when they're absolutely they are I I just find a lot of similarities between the Panthers and the cowboys and so I kind of like the advantage that the Redskins have with their defense against a duck Prescott and not ... Elliott so I'll take the Redskins at home [noise]\nAll right how about you brought to Jekyll and Hyde seems more like you know the home team you don't know\nSo off the Redskins meanwhile the LA Ramsey only undefeated team remaining in the NFL to San Francisco to take on the one in five forty niners no explanation needed I'll take the rams Alex Bram ...\nDidn't tell All right it's going to the primetime games before into bagels coming up that heartbreak he lost on the road arrowhead take all the five and one chiefs [noise]\nSystem arrowhead cup place to play this chief team is role and you could argue they should have one or might have won that game and Fox burlap week I'm going to take the chiefs in this one Alex\nYeah I didn't bother looking it up but I just do that any Dalton doesn't habits for prime time so I like the home team cheap says well not that Seattle I think it might be the toughest place to play my baby so I'm going to sweep it with the chiefs\nAlright so I'll take the tree so we rented out with a Monday Night football game the giants are wanted by a head to Atlanta to take on the two and four falcons who have had got multiple issues on the defensive side of the football this week the tape Freeman\nSort of on the frame and I should say they're starting running back it's been placed on is reserved I don't know who to pick here so I'm going to go with a whole to even take the falcons Alex [noise]\nYup falcons make a lot of them the giant that too many questions to answer and Brett I'm gonna go dirty dirt\nDirt All right ladies and gentlemen our entire week seven picks of the national football league all of us\nTook the Denver Broncos by the way tonight and the Thursday night game against Arizona and they are off to a a huge should start is not so or want to know so far yes we are one of those so uh we get to take that into friday with us\nAh by the way you can get our picks on our Twitter site at other center NBC or ALS will have those posted here in a few minutes or less ... oh they're already posted like very very very efficient breach right now are they take a quick break and we'll come back wrap things up all put under center on review this is NBC Sports radio in the mobile and\nI just didn't weren't just ... you are listening to NBC Sports radio [noise]\nFor coverage of high school sports team at right here I Am twenty to twenty four\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home to a fear dancing on the\nCars would leave governance talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two weighty\nAre your permission\nParks and available in every state two seasons one long green sleeves Johnson make a world of difference you can protect yourself and so you're close talking co workers how plea finding neighbors\nTwo month old niece that's why ... specially trained pharmacist credit provided over sixty million police Johnson to thousands and buy for your flu shot today with a zero dollar company would love to insurance because protecting the world starts with protecting you are\nPlump green justice decide you know one\nThing that just to avail duty station health related restrictions may play\n... with the NFL game day morning in the\nHome rich guys in the mirror Eugene micheal herb and herb water review every game from every angle every Sunday Morning a match up you got to be able to hang out with the big boys with a lot of reporting from around the we all season long [noise] NFL game day more\nSunday and Monday Easter only NFL Network\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's\nPremier home purchased wander we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates stays locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial approval only about I'm thirty three year fixed rate loan sulfur crossing permission conditions people having liquor license and all the states and I'm like thirty thirty visual conditions or to just ... from a barrier\nMessing up in theory or to adhere to\nWe've covered it talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or do we\n\nDo it and I ...

genes in his number forty three leakers Jersey and by the way I'm getting sick and tired of all I mean have you seen this one like three minutes thirty three Jersey magic in thirty two Jersey what brought him is twenty three Jersey forgive me afraid she has the latest single regular season game yet\nLaker uniform and here we are already putting them up there with the grades you know what he's by the way a heck of a lot more similar to cream of Georgia more than he is the Magic Johnson and here's why\nMagic grew up with the Lakers right magic was drafted by the Lakers nurtured and became a star with the Lakers ... was already started he was a guy named ... who else indoor who was putting up thirty twenty with Milwaukee\nSo he was a story that already came a Los Angeles\nLast time I checked LeBron's bittersweet what fourteen years Fifteen Years it's been a decent player in this timeframe right he's been imported star\nWars Coby in that picture you can have luau as well Kareem Abdul Jabbar Magic Johnson you're not going to put a space for Kobe Bryant like type thing about this what is your take out cream and put Coby\nBecause of the fact that Kobe also was a draft pick if there's just a stupid picture doesn't make any sense everybody wants to tie history in from like the older generation it doesn't work wears George biking was the first great later you get the draft\nBut if what brand mania in Los Angeles too even though the Dodgers are playing a game number six tomorrow Milwaukee maybe not I mean working at the Milwaukee in about thirty minutes talk to her body might Keller\nBut apparently everybody just cares about LeBron James look\nThey care about the rams are five and no one cares about the chargers in fact apparently these owners meetings are actually talking about the viability of the charges have you heard this one I got I got to bring this up John did you hear this one that the chargers in terms of revenue projections and it had originally projected four hundred million dollars next year\nOr the first year the new stadium next year yeah I think it is next year I was the year after this is your number two by the way in Los Angeles maybe brighter Nick knows that the expectation the new stadium opens next year for the two thousand Nineteen season or is it going to be two thousand twenty season\nWhat are we hearing\nDo we know anyone in LA earth LA LA has gone independence day Israel so here's the thing\nWhatever it is their first projected four hundred million dollars in revenue Sean they've now lord that over a hundred and fifty million you know why 'cause I ain't going to charge a premium prices for tickets if there is no demand they're planning a thirty thousand feet soccer stadium that they cannot sell out by the way\nSo apparently they are a good football team they are they're foreign to they've won three in a row but here's the thing the personal the licenses are going for as long as a hundred bucks a seat\nBut you know what a hundred buckets yet ah metlife stadium in New York for the jets the giants wedding on opening up the stadium in LA in twenty twenty twenty twenty five so after delays in cost overruns twenty twenty ... twenty twenty two right probably that it probably costs doubled a to point seven billion they thought it would be\nI mean LA is a big unionized workforce I think so yeah probably be like twenty twenty three and about seven billion dollars there'll be have done\nLike the New York subway system but anyway here's the thing about this with a bronze and I understand the anticipation I understand why people are so excited they superstar right since Coby retired and really Kobe's last year or two were fat to see him like limping around there at the bottom like\nBut the reality is let's look at things and truly understand what it means\nSo the Lakers had to go young right\nThe way she Julius Randall said yesterday thank goodness he looked good feeling right\nSo here's the problem for the Lakers does Alonzo ball praying Ingram encounter ... benefit in their development having LeBron James\n\nI was talking yesterday after the show is Sean and I was talking about the Knicks now without ... maybe it's for the better with a young Ross the youngest Ross in the NBA twenty four point one years old\nDoes it benefit the Kevin knocked is in the you know Frank ... and then the ... the world that there is no poor thing is that you feel obligated to pass the basketball too so we can shoot a twenty five times and the game because besides him it was hard away junior I guess right\nIf it's LeBron James that a bunch of young players around which kind of as many brought into veterans but those are just kind of\nTaking a salary cap room for a year and then they get the gun anyway because they want those max deals next year but the reality is LeBron James is eight ball dominant player he's been a ball dominant player since he could walk\nSo rather than bringing the main gr in developing more ... ball developing more\nThan ... cruise we're developing more Lorenzo ball is even going to bring the ball up the bronze guy that brings a ball up right but brown got the ball in his hands eighty percent of every all fence of set\nSo there's a brand and anger and feel comfortable taking Eighteen shots the lawns overall feel comfortable actually trying to run off ants because let's say if you got a great shooter he's got to run an office right that is his strength is this court vision I\nMean your strength isn't hey look bronze gonna find him open ended up papa three pointer and hit you know forty three percent of his threes and fifty percent from the field that thought Alonzo balls game\nSo does what Brian James being in Los Angeles while it brings excitement and fun\nDoesn't help the development of the younger players or does this mean the Lakers\nWe have bad did any sort of a rebuild with youth and then it tried to plop along with what Brian getting older and older because remember while he's going to be thirty four years old\nAll brawn James has played a lot of basketball this is your Fifteen or sixteen sixteen over the course of the last eight years he's been to the finals eight straight years do the math is twenty extra games a year\nFor that's eighty that's one sees it another ... he's played two extra season's over the last eight years\nPeople talk about Tom favorite old bodies right like a journey butler is a good old twenty nine because he's played Sybil do\nWrong just because he's played basketball at the NBA level since Nineteen and I have a lot of postseason hoops and he's never been like Coby Coby got to stick his first year come off the bench the second year and then finally become a starter sturdier\nPressure what wrong started day one averaging Twenty one points a game when he should have been a a high school or college freshmen Ohio State\nSo the fact is the Lakers to me it's desperation obviously if you have a Brian James you gonna get LeBron James just say no to the brawn James he got it might get it\nBut in the realm of building a team for the long haul\nDoes this help young guys and my answer is no and I'm not going to blame were brawn James, LeBron James change the way he's played basketball at the highest level we have maybe ever seen in the history of the sport to help Brandon ... Alonzo ball and ah you know and then ...\nAnd we can definitely be something to help\nMaybe is all you need to find out more about autism nope big joyful smiles by six months is one early sign learned

cents okay\nThey are a six feet maybe five seed in the western conference\nThey win a series get knocked out around to\nAll because all abroad by the way and LeBron\nJames start to see is the best player in the NBA and to see who's the best player in the NBA I don't think this year we see any sort of a drop off now he asked me this next year that's where we see the drop off but as of right now I don't think we see a drop off with what Brian James\nThat are better than the Lakers a Golden State obviously Houston I think Utah underrated\nI think they're good team I think Portland would that

then he goes on for ten\nAnd he's mine is Twenty one I think on defense because he doesn't play any defense and leave a hundred and thirty one points in the game yesterday I mean there's\nThe problem it'll Carmelo Anthony is Kevin Love it's kind of get a lot of people like crappy teams he's going to excel Rikers it's not a lot of other options and Kevin lovers the man and Minnesota twenty five and fourteen right\nDo you look at Carmelo with Denver they tried to people put people around that they made a trip for Alan Iverson didn't work he had one nice run to the conference finals I think right with a Denver\nThe fact is you know more often than not they were decent teams at best not great he was the best part of the Knicks team and you can do whatever you wanted\nTo comment on what was going to put a big numbers with crappy teams\nYou put it on and see what other star players and he's got a role to play you can't play that role he doesn't want to play a role he just wants to be to be the top guy he wants to be the big dog that wants to do what he wants he wants to build a brown and be all over the court and take whatever he wants to take you can't do that if he has to fit a specific role so what's your role in Houston\nOkay it's been off ... off the bench right is that a role where they had their ... who did it yesterday by the way\nBut doesn't he have to kind of pick up a defensive slack because they lost two key defensive cobs this off season\nAnd they bring in so he's not going to be forever result he's not going to be looking by Moody's defensively but that'd be at least have to try that part of his job and that's not going to happen so we could have written the script we can written the final chapter of this book Carmelo Anthony name recognition\nWhat you watch on the court he's a great player\nBut I'm In a situation where he's got to play a role to actually help the team when it's hot and you'll get a championship [noise]\nThe reason why they don't

out there are losing a lot of wondering when will the hammer come down on that spring on our buddy Robb Dr ... ... talk and NBC Sports dot com and before\nWe get to the recruiting scandals that continue with a net vi investigations in court cases and things like that Rob\nThe G League announcing this interesting new endeavor I guess where starting next summer they going to be paying the elite of the elite high school players are guys that don't want to go to one year of college for one and done a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars away in the ... is just going to lead to a lawsuit from the answer delay 'cause they potentially could lose top high school players I don't\nThink so uh you know this seems like it's something it stems from\nUh the rice commission and their insistence or at least in a you know some of the findings that they have caught the loser rice or that basically said and then put the blame it or put the the oldest all the MBA to make a decision of whether or not they actually want to keep\n'em this one and done rule around because at the end of the day like this is the abuse right rises ... out of college basketball so I'm One of the things that the commission found was or one the one of the things that they determine or in their findings\nAre was basically because say you know it's all you guys you are the ones that are going to have to make this decision and help us out because we are not the ones that can change is real and and maybe necessarily change things for the veterans\nFor basketball so [noise] um [noise] I think that that's what this stems from and\nIt you know I don't necessarily know how much impact it is really going to have because\nWhen you think about like look I'm all in mind that the college basketball players in college football players especially the best players programs\nThey do not get enough right they they should be allowed to tap into what some of their earning potential is riding matures into should not be things should be able to capitalize uh financially on their name on\nYou know the star power they have like a viable you say is one of the the single biggest stars in back off or when you look at you know any video that a Youtube video that all his life was together if I'm going to get millions and millions of using the has so many years\nCan't capitalize on any of that because it would be to to play violation we should be allowed to write write\n'em and\nThat but that is all true right the college basketball player is still a pretty good you're like you're living a good life you know if you go straight to the G League\nYou are flying commercial you are taking connecting flights you won't the small towns where are you know one night I was going to the beach that's off the interstate and go into like sue city you're going to be an eerie you're going to be in Reno and like I'm sure things are fine towns no they're not that that that's very different\nUh you know staying at the holiday inn a ghost town then flying ... private in staying at five or\nA five star hotels but you do when you play it Kansas or Duke it out to your program like that\nAnd you know it's it's it's different being some guy an Eighteen year old and it's usually go to get up against twenty five twenty six year old former oil conference players that are fighting for the paycheck that they're going to be able to pay a ... you know from their families it put food on the table for the kids with\nUm instead of being a God on a campus in Lexington where basketball players are absolute more ships or being a basketball player and Lawrence can slip that is a pretty good likes you know I don't\nIt's not perfect and there are things that should be changed that that that should make it better for them because they should be allowed to tap into that stuff but it's not like these guys are are living in poverty on this campus is right like it's still pretty good life in the college basketball player and I just don't see\nThat many kids making decision to say okay for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars I'm going to pass up on that opportunity to experience college basketball playing ... at the plate and fall gals feel has to go clean that usually for\nA hundred twenty five grand when Brian Bowen who is like a top twenty five player he's getting a hundred thousand dollars\nLike here's the thing that we are we speaking honestly here on the right yeah get they're taking a pay cut for like five thousand dollars is gonna be a pay\nCut people wait what did that and we're talking with Rob Dr ... talk and NBC Sports dot com I agree these kids are making more than that anyways catches a scholarship and some money under the table but if there's FBI investigation into court case does end up turning that's big it off\nThen they're not going to get that money that they'd been accustomed to receiving when they cannot throw their services around five different schools and go to the highest bidder rod so let's just say that speaking gets turned off and doesn't that make the hundred and twenty five thousand more attractive\nImportant theory but I don't think that this turns to speak at all you know I I think that the reason that this is a court case right now is because there's all this entire thing\nStems from this guy named Margie plays right was a financial advisor in Pittsburgh and he got caught stealing his quest how about this this is my favorite part of the entire trial he got caught taking he he was a financial advisor for professional athletes in Pittsburgh\nAnd he got caught taking his clients' money to invest in movies like more than two million dollars' worth and like one of the movies you can go out it's called

the FBI and he said hey look I can give you if you just you know helped me out with some of the stuff and and and keep me from getting in trouble and um\nAnd and that's why this is a thing or they go into here saying okay we are going to try to take down college basketball that would not be the victim was never a goal or FBI to go into this investigation and you know\nTry and find a way to powering down and watch the college basketball but that wasn't the thing that we're going to target that the feds hats this bill into their lap and I don't even know like if they don't count ... why

exactly you know people people today by the way they watch multiple things at once anyway\nNot only that costs to games but here's the thing\nA lot of baseball teams for the most part a result teams anyway the very few national teams and major league baseball\nIt's just not going to make a difference there but they want the teams to be national teams I get that they want to pretend like oh ... they're going to be national team right you should start the game I seven forty five no later on the east coast on the east coast and west coast same thing\nFor a living reality and realize that they can pretend all they want but everybody knows it's regional if there's a\nGame to play it on the west coast is what I'm saying it she didn't start in a way to earn some forty five I agree a hundred percent\nBottom line is baseball cannot afford to have these game start this late why you didn't hear it and after ... am eastern that's impossible if you have a nine to five job\nTo get up in the morning and to have you know to go to these games the commute you're homeless two thirty in the morning\nIf we didn't have a show last night\nI Would not have watched the game to the end I Would fall asleep on the couch I Would have literally falling asleep on the couch woken up and drool down the side of my face with a light on my living room me on the couch going where am I what happened and then getting on my phone and realize oh okay the red Sox won at it happen let me through the highlights but I weigh ... around\nFor a long time because even the Yankees Red Sox robbery even those games take forever yeah\nYou know I don't have like three hours and ... and forty five minutes to invest in the middle of a summer you know a hundred and sixty two games schedule even if the Yankees Red Sox and I love the Yankees and the dog is that right do you\nI don't I don't have the attention span nor the will to do that All right fine in Houston\nThe Boston Red Sox heading to the world series base sweep all three games on the road in Houston David Price the monkey is off his back six shutout innings picks up his first postseason when as a starting pitcher\nI guess you could say it's the second team win right because of their lifetime and game to the one and he said at least it was a team win\nCongratulations for the Boston Red Sox moving on they took care of business they knocked off Justin ... they do it on the road by the way for the second straight series they did it again the stadium and the visual round they do it on the road is used in here and now they sit back and wait to see and\nI'll tell you what is the baseball fan I Want the Dodgers I Want the Dodgers and I want the red Sox that's to national teams that's two teams of national fan base it's not like the Milwaukee Brewers have had a great season they have\nMilwaukee is the definition of a regional baseball team they are the Dodgers have more of a national following and here's the funny thing about it\nBoston and New York so he's a rivalry not just in baseball or other sports that they city rivalry you still have people that are a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers so even if you have the LA Dodgers are still Dodgers against the red Sox and some would be in New York saying well\nIt's the Dodgers hey I'm a Mets fan I can remember the Dodgers I became a Mets fan when the Mets came and not a Yankee fan because when the national league left to New York I was going to root for the Yankees\nI that's what it is we're one went away from Dodgers Red Sox listen if you're a major league baseball you want Dodgers Red Sox\nThat's the theory is you want no offense against Milwaukee but the baseball one Milwaukee hey you want ratings or do you not want ratings Dodgers Red Sox well read Red Sox Milwaukee won't rate nearly as much\nThatch just reality of Geographic's LA big city number two media market Milwaukee not so much\nCongratulations Boston Red Sox they are the two thousand and Eighteen American League champions they got it done ... kimbro gets done in the ninth inning they take care of business they move on and by the way surprised by it to beaver land or to be cold to me title\nTo beat ... they saw younger the title but that's right but I'm more than a game and what she had already yeah\nTeam with a superior rotation so much for the Astros so much for the Astros defending champions know and they're on their pitching rotation right yeah\nYeah absolutely\nBerlin who's been so great in the postseason couldn't get it done to mistake pitches Jeannie Martinez a solo bombing the third\nAnd then the uh the big blast the Raphael beavers free run home run the sixth everyone picked Houston twins series especially after the game one I give I give boss and a lot of credit for for coming back at the way they did give her lender beating cold yeah\nI'm more into but I mean wow man incredible what that bullpen with the red Sox bullpen for them to win four straight against the Astros depressive do you remember when uh Charlie Morton this year was like ten and two of the one nine year at one point the season\nWe forget how good they had three guys a topic he already leader board the American league early this season\nFor Landrieu coal and ... and the red Sox just romp right through them and five games I mean that's incredible\nStreets even go back to Boston\nAnd you know what the hundred ... wins\nThey were the best team after that a hundred and\nThree and we all thought our I forget the number of wins look at the players know\nPunter named wins most wins they were the best team congratulations Alex ... who won the world series last year the bench coach all the Houston Astros\nEvent of the world series is its worst fears the manager the red socks that good evening when he's back to back World Series not ethnic Anthony has his way by the way the Dodgers need one more but how about a Christian Bale claim ... Shaw gave one of the world series\nThat's not a\nFive hour game by the way Christ Bill Clinton Herschel might be what we want to and a half hours a great baseball two to one type of game\n\nI'll tell you what though did once again bulletin board material help the Boston Red Sox people look at Aaron Judge and the Yankee series walking past their locker room blasting New York bureau to boom box did Alex pregnant inadvertently help the Boston Red Sox\nIn terms of motivation to move on next door to dance what's been NBC Sports radio when the NBC Sports radio mobile app\n[noise] it'd be the sports radio that coverage of high school for\nWhere I Am running W.

brawn James and\nRon do not much else for LA let's head out to LA talked to her body curtailing pro basketball talking NBC Sports dot com hey Kurt or do you think that they may need you and may they may be the Lakers to come out and show how did three pointers very ugly first half of the Lakers you especially the young guys what is that what these guys they catch you three pointers\nWell first off I don't think my ... eleven seem issued a three point or would not be recommending that um\nThey're offered I Can't be much worse no but the lack of shooting was long a concern for this team but that this coming into the season the concern was\nHow you're going to space to forward they've done it with like really smart attacking wander the bond James can kind of do what he wants an ... his way it's just a big plays Ronda has this high IQ they're getting\nSome shots with the attacking and a lot of shots with Tebow they probably did a great a specially early but this was the concern is was one of the issues with this team along with the fence was what's going to happen when is the shooting the catch up with them and this is\nThis is the problem they run into to\nPortland one of those ... they're going to be in the mix them in Portland in New Orleans and a few other teams are going to fight in the mix I mean a few like seven other teams rewriting the mix for some of those playoff spots\nYes it's game on of eighty two but the games are going to matter in the west there was no nights off\nThis isn't the is the eastern conference in more liberal on like you don't get to just kind of push and pull your way to win that easily so we'll see what happened to the second half but they've got to find some force base in because at some point everybody's just gonna pack it in on them they did a good job of driving it in her kitchen scoring any way but at some point\nThere that that's going to start to go away 'cause things are just going to take that away from\nYou know Scott I was debating was showing\nIn regards LeBron being there and what it means for the development of Alonzo ball branded Ingram ... because what bronze going to be their power however many years but those guys are going to be the ones that have passed the mantle to maybe and you know at that point maybe it'll be star players maybe not\nIn terms of their development having LeBron James on the roster\nAs a ball dominant player and having Rondo who's kind of similar\nDo you think it helps the development of those three young players or do you think appointed stunts their development\nI kind of depends on how they're used and I'm curious if they have the rotations are going to ultimately shake out you know in the first half\nThey had Brandon ... a and a Ron linked largely and\n... on okay off the ball not great he wasn't getting shots he wanted he was aren't getting comfortable that burned a couple of times defensively I'm too\nI I and I'm you know wondered out loud and I'm not the only person who set this on Twitter like would they be better off staggering that a little bit and let the brawn and wives are but I mean one of the box sets have ... so\nDominant with the second you know let them dominate the ball let them do some ... maybe restaurant with with Ron\nI'm just I but I think that that's the kind of thing that shakes out over the course of the season for them where they try to figure it out that said I think somebody gets hurt his wife with ... who's ... who's going to finish her you know how to create or anyway so right I like that I think we're going to blend in with before on its it's how Ingram and ball or going to fit in frankly\nParticularly in ... he's the guy they need\nYou know even if they do get another shoe whoever the next you know whoever the next superstar is kind of Anthony Davis or whoever\nWhoever that player is got to be the number three\nYeah anger if their option yeah Kurt here's the other thing though la brought out a great situation in Cleveland 'cause he pretty much campaign Tyrone Lou to be the the the coach there you know yeah look I can look walking seriously tell LeBron what to do or don't do this and that I mean who wants to kind of being a neutered here isn't he\n[laughter] well so was I mean so it was time Lou I mean let's let's be honest and write every coach yeah every coach to he had goes into the season going\nYet this year with a couple of rounds minutes back uh this year we're going to and he's on the ice on pace for forty two minutes you know in the opening night that well we're gonna play unless we're going to rest and we're going to do this we're going to do that and and it just never works out like the way they plan to end up eating in more and besides\nIf Iran wants to play\nWith I got

war's been NBC Sports radio Houston Rockets lose their opener and it's not that they lost the game you bad happens it's the fashion as to how they lost the gave a hundred and thirty one points Carmelo three of ten\nMinus twenty or minus Twenty one on you know and he's on the court\nNow it's just one game out of eighty two and I get that but he's been there's been a nightmare scenario that people had that Carmelo gums and he's not going to have shot because he didn't have many shots last year and okay see and you lose the defensive presence of a reserve and Lou combine mood day and that's why you give a hundred and thirty one points\n[noise] this is the nightmare scenario and the other part of that is what Anthony is supposed to do is help boost that oftentimes and harden was an egg hardened and Chris Paul were good not\nOtherworldly and last season they were pretty much otherworldly every night and that's part of the reason that the one sixty five games that they weren't this night and it showed that they you know look again the west is deep you know New Orleans is a good team if you've come out and play nice against them\nAnd they gave us is going to run roughshod over new um [noise] I I I think it was a little bit of a one off for them but it is going to take a while for\nCarmelo Anthony to find a rhythm coming off the hit Mitt it as much like if he got really cold in the second half he's not used to it he's going to have to figure out his rhythm with this um\n[noise] but yes this is the nightmare scenario and by the way I think this I think they're often will save them most nights\nBut what they lost the matchup really it really impacts them against Boston and Golden State and those are the teams that they're targeting those are the teams that they're going to be I mean those are the three teams one of those three teams very likely to win the NBA title one of its going to be one of those three almost certainly and\nReal how real answers right

last Fifteen Years at the Sox are in the fall classic Scott Burns your overtime on NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com the best team all season long is now continuing their season as they head to the world series the red Sox won a hundred ... games\nIn the regular season and it was the fourth time in their franchise history that they had won a hundred or more games in these three prior occasions they have made the world series and now you can make it for for for\nMaking the world making it to the world series in a hundred when seasons they beat the Astros for one and the most surprising part of this series was the performance by David Price\nHere in game five\nYou want to talk about flipping the script David Price has been known throughout his career for his postseason failures\nDavid Price for the first time a couple of games ago he didn't he didn't get the win\nBut his team got a win and again that he started first time in the living post season starts that's happened\nAnd then here in game five\nTo utilize this change up\nHe had a velocity that\nWe haven't seen all season from him\nAnd David Price throws six shutout innings striking\nOut nine doesn't walk up batter allows only three hits\nAnd the red Sox beat the Astros for one\nYou want to talk about how the red Sox scored there was a called third strike that wasn't called a third strike or just in Berlin and wasn't happy about that Jay Z Martinez in his home run later in the back\nAnd they in Rockville Denver's with a three on shot that in most ballparks with the exception of Fenway Park and in Houston\nThat's probably a fly out to the warning track\nBut short porch there in left there with those high seats\nAnd you know the green monster and Fenway so hey he put it to the right part of the ballpark endeavors with a three run home run and that was your difference too long balls the only thing that ruined or gave up\nAnd the red Sox win for one uh ... tried to make it interesting again he only walk one guy in the ninth inning but you know it's been a journey for him I thought that\nIt was a good thing for hours Cora to go back to him\nI did I wouldn't have and I tweeted that out I wouldn't have gone to print Kimball there and then I then because of the struggles and the way that Nathan you've all been looked in the eighth one or two he was sitting on the gun\nI Know he just pitch the other game and this was basically a throw day for him but many mode through that right up in the eighth inning I wouldn't have gone to ... throat you know I wouldn't put you've already back out there and then maybe had Kimball warming up just in case but you know Kate\nKimball comes in and get the job done\nGets another save\nHis third of the series writers fifth the postseason strikes out too in that nine thing through just fourteen pitches nine of them for strikes you did walk one batter as I mentioned but he wasn't roof top like he was in his prior outings and now that gives him some confidence moving forward the red Sox going back to the world series\nAnd this is a theme that will be favored\nOver whoever comes out of the national league\nBecause they're better than the Dodgers and they're better than the ...\nThe only team that was better than the red socks this year was the Houston Astros and it was darn impressive for them to go into Houston and when three straight\nYou get the split in Boston and then they win three strains used and that is down write impressive\nEight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six to to\nThe ... the MVP of this game for sure\nWhat David Price for this series you know you look at all these performances right Jackie Bradley junior had a heck of a series he was your A. L. C. S. MVP\nHe hit the you know\nBig hits the all the eyes of the nine hole you kidding me\nJacki rather junior had a great series Mickey bets defensively had a great series\nAny NATO playing this game and it was almost identical to the play from last night's game the fan interference call he almost ... almost was there it was maybe about five feet short ... jumped up at the wall and caught a ball that\nI don't think it would have been a home run but it looked like it was a home run saving cash because he jumped up and he was higher than the wall 'cause again so short waltz only seven feet so it looks like he's Robin a home run but I I think that ball probably hit the top of the wall there but it's just crazy like ... is less than less than twenty four hours it could have happened again but it didn't\nAh the red Sox now\nTrying to in their fourth title and Fifteen Years again the world series we'll begin Tuesday night at Fenway Park we will be there\nNo knock him with ... and I'll tell you that is\nThe best thing about\nThe red Sox winning tonight\nYou don't\nHe didn't have to use ... will get\nRemember Christian Bale had the stomach illness\nAnd he was pushed back he was going to start game six if necessary now Chris Sale has extra time to rest both for game one of the world series on Tuesday\nAnd that is huge\nHuge for Boston\nAnd the idea of Clayton ... against Chris Sale and again one of the world series\nThat is a baseball fan's dream\nWe will hear from some of the members of the Boston Red Sox manager our score as well but first I Want to hear from manager AJ Hinch of the Houston Astros offering praise to the Boston Red Sox\nFan I mean they're the most wins in the league for a reason you know there is completed payments as we are and there are that are are really exceptional\nUm and that's not taken away from their pitch and you know they pitched welder bullpen stuffed up when they needed to a tremendous balance they put pressure on you from the very beginning they don't concede any of that they do it right and that's why it's hard to get twenty seven up again so they never stopped coming either relentless growth\nAnd he said they play the Astros\nDiseases we ran out of when you know you can break down to the series however you want whether they're to editing or you know they they they took into it and they won games and you know we were in those games and we\nMore from Jackie rather junior on the game plan\nI think I just call boils down to you don't have I have a game plan and obviously executing you can have a game plan but sometimes it might not work out but not the batter definitely do you want when you get pictures you want to clean picture that you can handle and I'm On defensively you want to you know trying to make all the planes you possibly can in order to obtain don't want to give away any out\nThere was a plan and get some really good ball team here so you know Ron denounce or at a premium but he said it's not over yet\nThe guys and the crap out there are tremendous tremendous we got great great people I'm first and I'm also a great players it's it's used to be able to you know continue that the trend of of winning I'm obviously\nWe want to win at all I'm definitely set out there and we are far more\nYeah then they will be favorite to do so but what's to better match up like for them but which team in ... you know poses the larger threat is it the Milwaukee Brewers in that bullpen or is it the LA Dodgers and that line up you know I guess I lean towards the Dodgers because\nYou know in the American league they\nThey can throw out at Fenway\nTheir ideal light up\nYou know they pretty much have an American league team\nThat they get to the age of hit or\nJust works out in their favor\nBecause you can have let's say your wind up is probably going to be you know you've got bell injure\nTurner um\nPlus they are so so here's what you would do neck in the American league ballpark your Dodger fan what'd you da to Muncie or would you do a church camp\nYou tell them I think I Would the AIDS him\nOkay if you did you camp then you've got mugged see it first\nRight right you would do\nIt the thing is they have so many guys\nI don't I don't know what their ideal lineup is All right so let's\nDoes your second\nRight let's go Machado at short and then turn or at third right and you're out the old the ... camp your outfield is going to be ...\nKiki and Jacques Peterson\nAnd then you have ... off the bench you got Taylor off the bench you got David Freese off the bench\nWho do Peters is so many different often ... there's so many different options\nIt'd be start Austin bars that means you got ground off the bench the Dodgers with a designated hitter gives them so much more flexibility because now it gives them one of their top bats\nInstead of normally having to pull them off the bench in a pinch hitting situation now it gives them the flexibility to give that guy for bats are five at bats\nI think it's a huge advantage for the Dodgers have designated hitter\nHuge advantage\nMaybe that's a tougher match up for the red Sox as the LA Dodgers because of that fact\nPaid five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six students that we'll get to the mouth score and some of the red Sox down or when it comes in and you know rightfully those guys are are\nPartying and celebrating a you know our corner was on the field with his fiance is baby and they're all having a a great time there are some Spanish interviews but doesn't really help English speaking audience to play some Spanish language or\nA Spanish speaking folks will appreciate that but [noise] no not us and not the English uh audience will might not understand what he's saying that\nEight five five three two three four in BC eight five five three two three four six to do\nEven though the series ended in only five games\nWas it a great series\nYou see I don't ...\nNeed a certain amount of games to determine a great series or not what I look at a series I look at was each game competitive\nWas each team build with granola\nThing to me there was trauma in all these games right\nI I thought that there was a lot of drama in these games\nYou know I looked at\nThe way that the series played up\nOkay game on the Astros win seven to two\nYou know just in Berlin was legit I'm\nChristian Bale kind of struggled\nYeah of course I mean struggling Chris sales to runs in four innings you know that's a struggle for Chris so but the Astros got done\nThey scored you know ... off the Boston bullpen you know they scored the are they ran up the score there in the ninth inning so seven to two even though it was really a you know three to ball games going into that nine thing so the Astros win game one and then the red Sox win game to seven to five\nThey bounce back okay a Jackie Bradley junior\nHad the three run double off the green monster that was the big difference in that game\nJak rather junior with the grain slim\nThat's the only reason why the game was able to to the grand slam blew the game wide open and then you had the eight to six game which featured the fan interference call\nAnd then tonight for one game\nWith just you know\nBig moments big pitching performance from David Price and even just in Berlin and with the exception of the two swings\nEight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six due to the red Sox going to the world series trying to win their fourth title in Fifteen Years and who will they face well we'll find out very quickly\nGame six brewers and Dodgers friday night\nThe Dodgers have the edge but if there was\nWhere the brewers\nWould go to the bullpen and\nTry and get as many hours as possible from those guys it's this game it's an elimination game at the first sign of trouble weighed my leaves out of this game\nAnd Josh haters going to go to innings\nIdeally from Milwaukee the book for waiting ... to give them six\nIf Molly from given six you'll go to Haiti for seven and eight\nAnd then you'll turn over to jeopardize for the night because I don't think you trust anybody else ... granted there are some guys that are really good in that bullpen and there are guys that yeah you know you do kind of trust\nAnd there have been guys who have been very effective\nWhether it's story you know or um\nAnd he's had plenty of rest because he didn't throw in game five\nHe's going to go to winning [noise]\nSo if my least can give you a sixth grader do seven eight jeopardy nine [noise]\nThat's the rest of these victories the brewers\nTalk to our baseball insider said that but when we\nTake your calls a day five five three two three four in

and eight will think about this\nIn two thousand a team baseball had eleven thousand less ball hitting play so let's just acknowledge that this is a different game ten years later and so because it's not traditional these unions take every chance they get to criticize ... council and the fact of the matter is is he's he's one\nHe's he's kept the best record in the national league is the guy that does not have starting rotation and the thing that I didn't like I think I told you this couple of days ago\nI didn't like Chuck scene on short run and I have a rule about ... guys on short rest\nIf you think a guy's going to be pitching on short rest\nAnd you think he's that caliber that you want to get extra starts out of him you have to try it and the regular season\nAnd the Milwaukee Brewers had opportunities just like anybody else but they don't have they'd never tried it with us charts theme that you do not want the first time he tried something like that to be in an elimination situation so by stretching ... seem to game seven he's\nYour best starter at this point he's the only guy that can give you a real length which is what you need because you're gonna have to utilize your bullpen in game six and so these guys are going to lay it all on the line I'm not saying the Dodgers aren't the favorite they are up three games too but the theories is far from over\nYeah of course well Mali given them linked then they don't have to go to the bullpen for extended innings I think the things that we can guarantee ourselves that haters going more than one in here in game six on friday and that's bad for the Dodgers because let's say Molly gives you six strong innings and then you get hater going seven and eight to ...\nYou know this could be hit the series could be headed towards seven\nI think if you go to a game seven and you throw in us just seen the idea that that they just took a straight pick up like that's what that's what these games are\nAnd if you have a straight pick um that's that's amazing with the ... that is what sports is about and game sevens are better than wild card games they're better than five like the ... the best thing in sports uh I'm hoping for it I you know it's it's it's not going to have a rooting interest\nI just think that there are two guys on the Dodgers they maybe a majority chateau and yet you also ... that are punks and I'd love to see Milwaukee\nMachado no signs of the actions against pages Aguilar when he deliberately kicked his foot on purpose I thought that was such a dirty punk play good word I said it that night and said punk is just a fun word to say just keep going on pumped pumped much out of the punk sees it probably won't be\n... and it's funny 'cause people in in the Orioles organization knew that too yeah I mean you get what you get and and\nAll of that is that you're talking about a circumstance\nFor a player that has all this talent and you're showing that he ... he is such arrogance and he'll get his money to prevent so fine but you know people are wondering whether now you can get him at a discount you're not going to get him at a discount the problem is you're going to get 'em and you're not going to like them\nYeah well that's the truth and you're gonna pay way too much I Would only give 'em like a three to five year deal the fact that he's going to get much more than that it's just disgusting before we get out of your set who matches up who gives the red Sox have difficulty because you mentioned there'll be favorable we're both\nBut who gives a Red Sox a more difficult time easy a slam dunk that has the Dodgers because of their line up because when they play in in Fenway they can roll out in American League lined up or is it the fact that the brewers have all these weapons out of the bullpen there'll be harder for the red socks off it\nActually if you think about it in American League park you know the the the brewers have scope and and soccer so they could\nThrow at you know I think I'd rather take you know months the campaign Taylor's\nFan I understand ... here's my argument um I think from a ... starting pitching staff or the Dodgers can match the red Sox you know what I'm saying I think the Astros are better rotation and both of them but if you're going to tell me that fails close to a hundred percent uh I Love the idea of Chris elegance quake Kirsch I\nThought that we can only dream you know but\nThe but the idea that will be twelve it can mean that you know that and and just the idea that I think the red Sox are the prohibitive favorite against either team but if they go up against Milwaukee and Milwaukee can somehow get a lead\nI'm telling you good luck Josh leader will face that Red Sox wind up and that's not an easy thing the weird part about it is I wanted the Astros and the the brewers just because in my head like when I close my eyes the Houston Astros during the national\nLeague walkie brewers are in the American well yes and so for the you know if the brewers and the red\nSox ...

wins the American league pennant he is looking to become the fifth rookie manager to win the world series\nMost recently with Bob Bradley won the world series with the Diamondbacks in two thousand and one this is the first time a manager has had a team clinch his team clinch a postseason series on his birthday or they are the third team to defeat multiple\nHe was dead [laughter]\nWhat was the big\nMan it'd be in many have fled the greatest movie ever there is a book [laughter]\nThere was a ball hit the centerfield right right and demons ... like he plays it off the wall and he goes to throw it in Ramirez like\nDoormen God it was hilarious [laughter] he was standing so close to him when it happens [laughter] he was like I don't know it was just so dumb anyway\nYeah the that that's a funny one there that is that is a funny one there\nMaybe he knew the name and just didn't have a good throwing arm and he did it on purpose but that's a classic Manny Ramirez highlight\nI Want to talk about the ... the new NBA Julie grueling before I forget because you know a lot of sports happens here tonight but I really wanted to get a chance to talk about it because I treated about earlier staying in case you didn't hear\nThe NBA gee league you know used to be the developmental even the league now sponsored by getting ready to host the G League the NBA junior league made an announcement where they're going to offer what they call select contracts to eat meat\nProspects who are Eighteen years old but still not eligible for the NBA draft\nSo the NBA still has the whole one in ... right well now you can instead of going to college if you're that good the gene we will offer you a select contract worth a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars\nThat starts in the summer of twenty nine teams now if you want to wheat highschool prospect if you're like die on William Sanders a feature number one pick in the drafts instead of going to college you can go to the G League make a buck twenty five you know a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars\nAnd you become one of those select players and then maybe you get called up and to the NBA or or you you play one year in the ... league and then you go to the NBA here you know once you're one year out\nAnd you're eligible for the NBA draft or whatever\n[noise] dishes what I don't like about this okay or I don't get about this I think the minor league baseball argument is going to come into play and what I mean by that is\nIt's the minor league baseball versus college uh football argument that I say all the time\nYou know 'cause a lot of times you have kids that are elite baseball and football talents that get recruited to go play college football but also get drafted in the major league baseball ... collar Murray's the perfect example right column or who was the eighth overall pick in the major league baseball draft but chose to go back to Oklahoma and be their quarterback this year\nThe minor league baseball arguments going to come into play here with the NBA Julie because you could choose to not go to college\nSigned one of these selected contracts right make a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars which is for an Eighteen year old kid that as a heck of a living\nBut by and is the big but\nYou are traveling\nRegular flights that have to connect in weird airports because the NBA gee legal out of these teams don't play in\nBig time cities\nThese games are not nationally televised\nYou're staying in hotels and it's not exactly five star places that you're saying that because you're playing in cities like sue falls\nDelaware parts at Delaware\nLong Island Maine Lakeland\nRio Grande\n... day of Ontario ... this isn't exactly the the major cities here in the United states\nOr or\nYou could\nGo play division one college basketball\nLive like a king\nI mean you weren't treated like royalty on campus if you are this elite player\nYou take your teams in the NC double a tournament every one of your games is on national television you become a brand\nNew signed with an agent you can make\nAfter you're done playing college and it's only six months seven months because you don't care about going to school years trying to get to the NBA\nAnd let's be honest ... drink a little more me almost ... college sports and all that stuff\nI think it's a no brainer you go to school\nLive that college experience\nA hundred and twenty five thousand dollars is nice but it's very short sighted because you might play has better competition at the college programs you go to Duke\nYou want to play against federal competition\nAnd by the way neck I have this map here of\nThe NBA gee league and there's a team the the the um\nThe Washington\nWizards affiliate\nIs called the capital city go go\nAnd so I treated out\nSounds like a bachelor party location\nYeah capital city go oh yeah yeah definitely [laughter] you know the name of the capital city go go\nThe capital city go go\nTell me that's not a place where you went to a bachelor party one time I go [laughter] you want to go to the capitals to then go on down to do it I think I've been there before here's your teams in the NBA Julie the main red clause\nThe Westchester next the Long Island and that's the Delaware blue coats\nThe capital city you go the Greensboro Swarm\nLakeland Magic raptors nine all five of the kid didn't

winner of the animals the Dodgers leaving the brewers three games to two in that series game six in Milwaukee friday night we'd Mali against pungent real\nGame seven if necessary would be Saturday

traditional these give me a ... take every chance they get to criticize ... council and the fact of the matter is is he's he's won\nHe kept the best record in the national league is the guy that does not have starting rotation and the thing that I didn't like I think I told you this couple of days ago I didn't like Chuck scene on short run and I have a rule about ... guys on short rest\nIf you think of guys going to be catching on short rest\nAnd you think he's that caliber that you want to get extra starts out of him you have to try it and the regular season\nAnd the Milwaukee Brewers had opportunities just like anybody else but they don't have they'd never tried it with you as a scene that you do not want the first time he tried something like that to be in an elimination situation\nSo by stretching ... seem to game seven he's your best starter at this point he's the only guy that can give you a real length which is what you need because you're gonna have to utilize your bullpen in\nGame six and so these guys are going to lay it all on the line I'm not saying the Dodgers are the favorite they are up three games too but the series is far from over\nYeah ... well my lead gives them linked then they don't have to go to the bullpen for extended innings I think the thing that we can guarantee ourselves that haters going more than one in a year in game six on friday and that's bad for the Dodgers because let's say Mali give just six strong innings and then you get hater building seven and eight to ...\nYou know this game could be hit the series could be headed towards seven\nI think if you go to a game of seven and throwing us just seen the idea that that they just took a straight pick up like that's what that's what these games are\nAnd if you have a straight pick them that it's amazing with the ... that is what sports is about and game sevens are better than wild card games they're better than five times like the ... the best thing but in sports uh I'm hoping for it I you know it's it's it's not going to have a rooting interest\nI just think that there are two guys on the Dodgers they may not even try to try to do and yet you also ... that are ... and I love to see Milwaukee\nMachado got fined for the actions against pages Aguilar when he deliberately kicked his foot on purpose and that that was such a dirty punk play good word I said it that night as a punk is just the word to say just keep calling a pumped pumped much out of the punk he's a ... and ...\nAnd it's funny because people and and the Orioles organization knew that too yeah I mean they you get what you get and and and the problem with all of that is that you're talking about a circumstance\nFor a player that has all this talent and you're showing that he ... he has such arrogance and he'll get his money to sell fine but you know people are wondering whether now you can get him at a discount you're not going to get them at a discount the problem is you're going to get them and you're not going to like them\nYou know that's the truth then you're gonna pay way too much I Would only give 'em like a three to five year deal the fact that he's going to get much more than that it's just disgusting before we get out of here said who matches up who gives the red Sox a difficult time 'cause you mentioned there'll be favorable\nBut who gives a Red Sox a more difficult time easy a slam dunk that it's the Dodgers because of their lineup because when they play in in Fenway they can roll Latin American lead lined up or is it the fact that the brewers have all these weapons out of the bullpen there'll be harder for the red socks off and\nActually if you think about it in American League park you know the the the brewers have scope and and stock is that they could\nAsk you know I think I'd rather take you know month the campaign Taylor understand\nI understand ... ... here's my argument um I think from a ... starting pitching staff or the Dodgers can match the red Sox you know what I'm saying I think the Astros are a bit of rotation and both of them but if you're going to tell me that sales close to a hundred percent uh I Love the idea of Chris elegance Clinton Kirsch I\nLove that we can only dream you\nKnow but the but the idea that will be a twelve a game you know you know that and and just the idea that I think the red Sox are the prohibitive favorite against either team but if they go up against Milwaukee and Milwaukee can somehow get a lead\nI'm telling you good luck Josh either will face that Red Sox line up and that's not an easy thing the weird part\n... and the the brewers just because in my head like when I close my eyes the Houston Astros during the national league brewers room America when he asked for a job and so for the you know if the brewers and the red Sox ...

in a lake\nOr uniform and here we are already putting them up there with the greats you know what he by the way a heck of a lot more similar to the cream of Georgia more than he has to Magic Johnson you here's why\nMagic grew up with the Lakers right magic was drafted by the Lakers nurtured and became a star with the Lakers ... was already a star was hell a guy named ... who else indoor who was putting up thirty in twenty with Milwaukee\nSo he was a store that already came to Los Angeles says established product last time I checked the bronze bittersweet what fourteen years Fifteen Years it's been a decent player in this timeframe right he's an imported star\nWars will be in that picture that blew out well Kareem Abdul Jabbar Magic Johnson you're not going to put a space for Kobe Bryant\nLike thinking about this what is your day job cream and put Coby because of the fact that koby also was a draft pick if I could just picture doesn't make any sense\nWants to tie history in from like the older generation it doesn't work wears George biking was the first great later\nYou get the draft but if what Brian mania in Los Angeles do they even though the Dodgers are playing a game number six tomorrow Milwaukee maybe not I mean working at the Milwaukee to about thirty minutes talk to her body my color\nBut apparently everybody just cares about LeBron James look\nThey care about the rams are five and no one cares about the chargers in fact apparently these owners meetings are actually talking about the viability of the charges have you heard this when I got I got to bring this up John did you hear this one that the chargers in terms of revenue projections and it had originally projected four hundred million dollars next year\nOr the first year the new stadium next year yeah I think it is next year I was the year after this is your number two by the way in Los Angeles maybe brighter Nick knows that he needs to be the expectation the new stadium open next year for the two thousand Nineteen season or is it going to be two thousand twenty season what are we hearing\nDo we know anyone in LA or LA LA has gone independence day Israel so here's the thing\nWhatever it is their first projected four hundred million dollars in revenue Sean they've now lord that number to hundred and fifty million you know why 'cause I ain't going to charge a premium prices for tickets if there's no demand they're planning a thirty thousand feet soccer stadium that they cannot sell out by the way\nSo apparently they are a good football team they are they're foreign to they've won three in a row but here's the thing the personal the licenses are going for as long as a hundred bucks a seat\nBut you know what a hundred buckets yet a metlife stadium in New York for the jets the giants wedding on opening up the stadium in LA in twenty twenty twenty twenty or so after delays in cost overruns twenty twenty ... twenty twenty two right probably they're probably costs doubled a to point seven billion they thought it would be\nI mean LA is a big unionized workforce I think so yeah probably be like twenty twenty three and about seven billion dollars there'll be have done\nLike the New York subway system but anyway here's the thing about this with the bronze and I understand the anticipation I understand why people are so excited they superstar right since Coby retired and really Kobe's last year or two were fat to seem like limping around there at the bottom lack\nThe reality is let's look at things and truly understand what it means\nSo the Lakers have to go young right by\nThe way she Julius Randall said yesterday my goodness he looked good feeling right so here's the problem for the Lakers does lungs oh ball brain Ingram and call ... benefit in their development having LeBron James\n\nWas talking yesterday after the show is Sean and I was talking about the next and how without pausing is maybe it's for the better with a young Ross the youngest Ross in the NBA twenty four point one years old\nDoes it benefit the Kevin Knox is in the you know Frank ... the world that there is no poor thing is that you feel obligated to pass the basketball too so he can shoot a twenty five times and the game because besides him it's what heart away junior I guess right\nIf it's LeBron James or a bunch of young players around which kind of as many brought into veterans but those are just kinda\nTaken a salary cap room for a year and then they got the gun anyway because they want those max deals next year but the reality is LeBron James is eight ball dominant player he's been a ball dominant player since he could walk\nSo rather than bringing the main gr in developing more inland so bold developing more than ... cruise with developing more Lorenzo ball is even going to bring the ball up the bronze guy that brings a ball up right before I got the ball in his hands eighty percent of every often subset\nSo just a brand and anger and feel comfortable taking Eighteen shots those Alonzo ball feel comfortable actually trying to run and often because let's say she's not a great shooter he's got a running off that's right that's is his strength is this court vision write\nMe strength isn't hey what bronze gonna find him open ended up papa three pointer and hit you know forty three percent histories and fifty percent from the field that's not Lorenzo balls game\nSodas LeBron James being in Los Angeles while it brings excitement and fun\nDoes that help the development of the younger players or does this mean the Lakers have completely abandoned any sort of a rebuild with youth are they going to try to plop along with LeBron getting older and older because remember while he's going to be thirty four years old\nAll brawn James has played a lot of basketball is is your Fifteen or sixteen sixteen over the course of the last eight years he's been to the finals eight straight years do them at its twenty extra games a year\nFor that's eighty that's one sees it another four so he's played two extra season's over the last eight years\nPeople talk about Tom Sybil bodies right like a jury but was a good old twenty nine because he's played for civil do\nThe wrong just because he's played basketball at the NBA level since Nineteen and I have a lot of postseason hoops and he's never been like Coby Coby got to sit as first deer come off the bench the second year and then finally become a starter started here\nPressure but wrong bitter started they want averaging Twenty one point the game when he should have been a high school or college freshmen Ohio State\nSo the fact is the Lakers to me it's desperation odd like Brian James you gonna get LeBron James jumping around James he got it might get it\nWithin the realm of building a team for the long haul\nDoes this help the young guys my answer is no and I'm not going to blame LeBron James LeBron James changed the way he's played basketball at the highest level we have maybe ever seen in the history of the sport to help Brandon ... Alonzo ball and ah you know and and and how ...\nJoin up now I Am the extinction old\nTime is running out working in call anytime in the in the last five years as a breeding population has gone from

Lakers right [noise] they use about ten minutes [noise] my expectations for the Lakers realistically my expectations for LeBron James here here's what it comes down to\nThey're not anywhere remotely close to being the same classes the rockets or the Golden State warriors vierra forty six to ... when the best\nAnd that's what brought addict Fifteen wins okay they are a six see maybe five seed in the western conference\nThey would've series get knocked down around to all because all around by the way\nAnd LeBron James starts to see the best for the NBA and the seasons the best player in the NBA I don't think this is the year we see any sort of a drop off now if you asked me this next year that's where we see the drop off but as of right now I don't think we see a drop off with the brawn James so give me the teams in the west\nThat are better than the Lakers a Golden State obviously Houston I think Utah underrated\nI think they're a good team I think Portland without backward is very hard to pick against them I Would take them is that for right now\nUh [noise] I Can't really read San Antonio yet that's a hard one they're still good names on that team Minnesota know too much of a

Minnesota to much problems San Antonio maybe that might be six but I'm not gonna take San Antonio with that because the Marta rose villa mark soldiers combined LeBron James opposite brawn James it's six\nThrive in Phoenix no Denver no six ... six out of four or five who you who you've taken out of the list I put out of a detainee you take it out Portland okay San Antonio\nNot just to relieve yes or no memory that that's a big loss yeah do you have one of the Golden State might add develops gives though\nI might put the ... are you by the way how about it I mean every day it was just the beat goes on unbelievable but I I got to get this been real quick how 'bout this Carmelo Anthony yesterday his his first two shots for the Houston Rockets\nAnd he's mine is Twenty one I think on defense because he was appointed defense I Believe a hundred and thirty one points in the game yesterday\nI mean this is the problem you know Carmelo Anthony eighth Kevin Love to get up even crappy teams he's going to excel right 'cause it's not a lot of other options like Kevin what was the man to Minnesota twenty five and fourteen right\nDo you look at Carmelo with Denver they tried to people put people around that they made a trip for Alan Iverson didn't work in one nice run to the conference finals I think right with a Denver\nThe fact is you know more often than not they were decent teams at best not great he was the best player on the Knicks team and you can do whatever you wanted\nTo comment on what was going to put a big numbers with crappy teams\nYou put it on and see what other star players and he's got a role to play you can't play that role he doesn't want to play a role he just wants me to be the top guy you want to be the big dog that wants to do what he wants he wants to look around and be all over the court and just take whatever she wants to take you can't do that if he has to fit a specific role so what's your role in Houston\nOkay it's been off ... off the bench right is not a role in the head of their ... who did it yesterday by the way\nBut doesn't he have to kind of pick up a defensive slack because they lost two key defensive cobs this off season\nAnd they bring in turmoil so he's not going to be forever result he's not going to be looking bottom Uday defensively but there'll be at least have to try as part of his job and that's not going to happen so we could have written the script we can written the final chapter of this book Carmelo Anthony\nName recognition what'd you watch on the court he's a great player\nBut I'm In a situation where he's got to play a role to actually help with the winner possibly go get a championship the reason why I never won a championship since he was Nineteen at CERN you\nHave a lot easier to do it in college

second inning and it wouldn't even be shocked in that scenario to see hater in in the second any any of that if you get a two runners on and nobody out\nThere that chance you could go to hate or at that early second or third any to say okay this is the highest leopard situation we're in might be the eyes leopard situation we're in the entire game or going to do with our best\nThat I Would not be at all surprised not all managers would do that I think ... council and their GM David Stern they think about this differently and I have no no hesitation on that front\nChat with their body might

going to sound like my own stock is just getting introduced try 'em all that but they won't be most shit will be proved to be very popular here\nWhen his name is announcing what's in the ... were\nThat close to acquiring him in July during the all star break it it was the Dodgers are the brewers um the brewers would have had to have sent Cortland burns to Baltimore in that deal and we we can see what value courtroom burns is to Milwaukee right now so\nI'm you know ... reputation reputation as are usually earned it almost always earned and his is he did nothing to change that earlier this in this series with a with kicking you'll our first that just sliding into second\nWe're not out already they were just dumb um kicked of Aguilar that was you went out of his way to do it nobody can look at the video and not she it and he just enhance his reputation of being a great player with a with a a a shortage track record and he's earned that reputation\nMy guy you're a sports fan you're a baseball fan so so I got to ask you this question because you know which I thought it was a heck of a player he's going to get paid a lot of money when you're done when he flat out came out on that bus wanted at ... he's not Johnny hustle\n[noise] yeah that's that's just a weird isn't it I mean\nI Wonder if that\nYeah I don't know who admits that and then you know you're in a year and a contract off season you're in a free agent off season\nUm ultimately when they get to the bargaining table I don't know that that costs money but in the short term you have to be thinking I don't want to say something that potentially my brain is come up in some negotiations I don't know if it\nSplits end up being I signed that deal for three hundred million and that would make it to a deep um I don't know he's going to notice it\nBut that's just an ... he he is a strange um athlete I'm Dee is fantastic in his ability they might be unreliable as far as the overall ability he as as a shortstop um but I don't know if he's got both ... and the water all the time as far as the other stuff\nYeah no question about that Michael I have the automated I gotta do is we got to switch to other Packers here because Aaron Rodgers is saving that team but uh boy outside of Aaron Rodgers and he's been great especially last couple of games what's happening this team besides injuries what's the biggest problem just seem right now\nYeah I I think that same simply you know they they were fortunate to win Monday Night again San Francisco I watched um San Francisco's ... the athletes they have on the defensive line and watch the the ... they can wreak now that's not a good team at all\nUm overall especially with the loss of ... but the Packers don't have that dynamic a catch Russia or claimed that he was was that for five years early in his career and not that any more ... ferry on the other side is not that\nI'm you know the Green Bay is going to they're going to have their future told to them they'll have a role in it when they come out of the pie week next week they'll play at the rams at New England Paul Miami\nAt Seattle at Minnesota in five weeks being a by the time that five weeks man is done we're going to know whether the Green Bay has a potential to be a playoff team and if they don't there will be wholesale coaching changes Mike mccarthy signed a one year contract extension on January second\nOr if this is not a playoff team and it even if they are and if they're not an NFC championship or Super Bowl team Mike McCarthy's one year deal will be just that\nWow athlete though should he be [noise] I'm Sorry if he had a hot seat shouldn't be on a hot seat\nOr if they don't last Sunday and Monday Night again San Francisco I'm the pie week would have been really interesting it yeah they struggle out of these are the five games out of the pie week he's absolutely on the hot seat you know keep in mind I'm\nA ... to ... the new GM he was in the system but he is a new GM and I don't know I don't know anybody knows for certain whether good at ... love this McCarthy has his head coach\nBut you know most GM's want their guy even if it's a guy from the system they want their own guy so um yeah I think the seat is pretty warm right now in Green Bay\nSince there three two and one\nLast question Mike how about the fans though you know Brian ... he made one of his own guy regardless of you know coming up through the system knowing McCarthy but how about the fans what's the reaction to Mike mccarthy are they is there Mike mccarthy fatigued there\nI think ... anywhere where the coach has been eleven twelve years um there's some fatigue and in Green Bay the ... that they've only been in one Super Bowl in the entire Aaron Rodgers career so yeah there is some fatigue I liked to Mike mccarthy as a coach\nI felt there aren't there there's only a handful of guys I Would take over him and not even a handful probably like if the push comes to shove but yeah there's always the one team doesn't get to\nThe end of the line if they don't get to the Superbowl don't win the Superbowl and coach remains after ten eleven twelve years there's fatigue and even in Green Bay

this interesting new endeavor I guess where starting next summer they're going to be paying the elite of the elite high school players are guys that don't want to go to one year of college for one and done a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars away in the G League it's just going to lead to a lawsuit from the edge because they potentially could lose top high school players\nI don't think so uh you know this seems like it's something that stems from\nUh the rice commission and their insistence or at least in um you know some of the the finding that they have with Congolese arrives basically said and then put the blame it or put the the oldest or the NBA to make a decision of whether or not they actually want to keep\n'em just one of them are all wrong because at the end of the day like this is all the abuse right rises and the ... so I'm One of the things that the rice commission found was or was the one of the things that they determine or in their findings\nAre was basically to say you know it's all you guys you were the ones that are going to have to make this decision and help us out because we are not the ones that can change his role and and maybe necessarily change things for the veterans for basketball so um\nI think that that's what this stems from and\nYou know I don't necessarily know how much impact it is really going to have because\nWhen you think about like look I'm of the mindset that college basketball players in college football players especially the best players programs they do not get enough\nRight they they should be allowed to tap into what some of their earning potential is right or mature as they should not be things should be able to capitalize ah financially on their name\nYou know the the star power they have like a viable you say is one of the single biggest stars in basketball or when you look at you know any video they are a Youtube video that all his life was together if I was going to get millions and millions of viewers in so many scrap all was pretty ... capitalize on any of that because it would be\nAnd we should be allowed to write write\n'em and\nThat but but that is all true right the college basketball player is still\nA pretty good you're like you're living a good life you know if you go straight to the G League\nYou are flying commercial\nYou are taking connecting flights you won't the small towns where are you know one night I was going to the beach that's off the interstate going to like sue city you're going to be an eerie you're going to be in Reno I'm like I'm sure you're fine towns now they're not that that that's very different uh you know staying at the holiday inn and those town\nThen flying ... private and staying at five or\nA five star hotels like you do when you played Kansas or do could Kentucky or a program like that\nAnd you know it's it's it's different being some guy an Eighteen year old and it's usually going to get up against twenty five twenty six year old former oil conference players that are fighting for the paycheck that they're going to be able to pay a ... you know from their families have put food on the table for the kids with um\nInstead of being a God on a campus in Lexington where basketball players are absolute worship or being a basketball player and Lawrence canceling that is a pretty good life you know I don't\nIt's not perfect and there are things that should be changed that that that should make it better for them because they should be allowed to tap into that stuff but it's not like these guys are are living in poverty almost can't leave campus is right like it's still a pretty good life being a college basketball player and I just don't see\nThat many kids making decision to say okay for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars I'm going to pass up on that opportunity to experience college basketball playing rough arena the play in four gals feel has to go play in that you leave for\nA hundred twenty five grand when Brian bowling who is like a top twenty five player he's getting a hundred thousand dollars like here's the thing that we are we are we speaking honestly here it's like when he was on the right yeah get they're taking a pay cut for like five thousand dollar pay\nCut people wait a minute what is that right and we're talking with Rob Dr ... talking NBC Sports dot com I agree these kids are making more than that anyways scholarship it's the money under the table but if it's FBI investigation into court case does end up turning that speak it off\nThen they're not going to get that money that they've been accustomed to receiving when they cannot throw their services around five different schools and go to the highest bidder Rob so let's just say that's been gets turned off and doesn't that make the hundred and twenty five thousand more attractive\nIt wouldn't theory but I don't think that this turns to speak at all you know I I think that the reason that this is a court case right now is because there's all this entire thing\nStems from this guy named ... plays right Brian was a financial advisor in Pittsburgh and he got caught stealing his quest how about this this is my favorite part of the entire trial he got caught taking he he was a financial advisor for professional athletes in Pittsburgh\nAnd he got caught taking his clients' money to invest in movies like more than two

keep me from getting in trouble and um\nAnd and that's why this is the thing that they do go into here saying okay we are going to try to take down college basketball fat with not be that there was never a goal of the FBI to go into this investigation and you know\nTry and find a way to powering down corruption and college basketball but that wasn't the thing that wasn't the target that the feds hats this fell into their lap and I don't even know if they don't get found guilty by the federal government that they care about this stuff anymore and then the federal government doesn't care

at five o'clock there was the right we get that naturally game at five o'clock between the Dodgers and the brewers\nSo they wanted a space it out and everything but you know what you have to play off games going on at once\nIf they're going to be if they could overlap a little bit is that the worst thing in the world who cares to different audiences exactly you know people people today by the way they watch multiple things at once anyway\nNot only that watch two games but here's the thing\nA lot of baseball teams for the most part a result teams anyway they're very few national teams and major league baseball\nSo it's not going to make but they weren't there but they want the teams to be national teams I get that they want to pretend like oh ... they're going to be national teams\nRight you should start the game I seven forty five no later on the east coast on the east coast and west coast same thing for living reality and realize that they can protect all they want but everybody knows the regional if there's a game to play it on the west coast it was what I'm saying it should start in a way to earn some forty five I agree a hundred percent\nBottom line is baseball cannot afford to have these game start this late why you didn't hear it and after ... am eastern that's impossible if you have a nine to five job\nTo get up in the morning and to have you know to go to these games in

Sox won at it happen let me see the highlights but I weigh begging there's room\nFor a long time because even the Yankees Red Sox robbery even those games take forever yeah\nYou know I don't have like three hours and and forty five minutes to invest in the middle of a summer you know a hundred and sixty two games schedule even if the Yankees Red Sox and I love the Yankees and the dog can set right

David Price the monkey is off his back six shutout innings picks up his first postseason when as a starting pitcher\nI guess you can save the second team win right because of their lifetime and game

second free series they did it again the stadium individual round they do it on the road is used in here and now they sit back and wait to see and I'll tell you what is a baseball fan I Want the Dodgers\nI Want the Dodgers and I want the red Sox that's to national teams that's two teams of national fan base it's not like the Milwaukee Brewers have had a great season they have\nMilwaukee is the definition of a regional baseball team they are the Dodgers have more of a national following and here's the funny thing about it\nBoston and New York so he's a rivalry not just in baseball or other sports that they city rivalry you still have people that I remember the Brooklyn Dodgers so even if you have the LA Dodgers are still Dodgers against the red Sox and some would be in New York saying well\nIt's the Dodgers hey I'm a Mets fan I go home for the Dodgers I became a Mets fan when the Mets came and not a Yankee fan because when it actually left New York\nI was going to root for

I Can't be much worse now but the lack of shooting was long a concern for this team but that this coming into the season the\nConcern was how you're going to space to forward they've done it with like really smart attacking Rhonda Cook the brawn James can kind of do what he wants to ... and ... his way it just plays Ronda has this high IQ they're getting\nSome shots with the attacking him and a lot of shots with Tampa they played it a great a specially early but this was the concern this was one of the issues with this team along with defense was\nWhat's gonna happen when does the shooting but the catch up with them and this is this is the problem they run into to\nPortland one of those but I mean they're going to be in the mix them in Portland in New Orleans and a few other teams are going to fight in the mix a few like seven other teams rewriting the mix for some of those playoff spots yes it's game on of eighty two but the games are going to matter in the west there's no nights off\nThis isn't the is in the eastern conference in more liberal and like you don't get to just kind of push and pull your way to win that easily so we'll see what happened to the second half but they've got to find some force base in because at some point everybody's just gonna pack it in on them they've done a good job of driving it nurtured scoring anyway but at some point\nThere that that's going to start to go away 'cause seem to just going to take that away from\nYou know sky I was debating was shown earlier in the show in regards LeBron being there\nAnd what it means for the development of blondes snowball branded Ingram ... because what ... going to be their power however many years but those guys are going to be the ones that are passed the mantle to maybe and you know at that point may movie star players maybe not in terms of their development having LeBron James on the roster\nAs a ball dominant player and having Rondo who's kind of similar\nDo you think it helps the development of those three young players or do you think appointed stunts their development\nAnd kind of depends on how they're used and I'm curious as to how the rotations are going to ultimately shake out or you know in the first half they had brand named ... uh end up with Ron linked largely and\n... on okay off the ball not great he wasn't getting shots you wanted was hurting comfortable that burned a couple of times defensively I'm too\nI I and I'm you know wondered out loud and I'm not the only person who sent this on Twitter like with any better off staggering that a little bit and let the brawn and wives are but I mean one of the Bronx it has a grim and lawn so\nDominant with the second you know let them dominate the ball let them do some British maybe restaurant which but Ron\nI'm just I but I think that that's the kind of thing that shakes out over the course of the season for them where they try to figure it out that said I think somebody gets hurt his wife would have on who's my records was a finish or you know how to create or anyway so right I like that I think we're going to blend in with before on it it's how\nIngram and bowl are going to fit in frankly particularly in ... he's the guy they need you know even if they go get another shoe whoever the next you know whoever the next superstar is kind of Anthony Davis or whoever whoever that player is\nAnd you got to be the number three yeah anger up their option yeah courage here's the other thing though\nLa brought out a great situation in Cleveland because he pretty much campaign Tyrone Lou to be the the the coach there you know yeah look I can walk and seriously tell LeBron what to do or don't do this and that I mean who wants kind of being a neutered here isn't he\nWell so was I mean so it was time Lu I mean let's let's be honest and write every coach yeah every coach that he had goes into the season going\nYet this year we had a couple of rounds minutes back uh this year we're going to have you thought that I have a taste for forty two minutes you know in the opening night they they're well we're gonna play unless we're going to rest and we're going to do this we're going to do that and and it just never works out like the way they plan to end up eating in more and besides\nIf one wants to play\nWith I got news for the wall and doesn't get the final say on that gets the final say on that or it's going to be an interesting just to see how that matched does it you know he ... he he came to respect ... but that was a rough start you know Mike Brown\nWasn't smooth there's blacks kind of the extreme on the other end uh we'll see how this relationship goes on and walk inside his biggest fan is Jeanie Buss um it's good to have the owner in your corner so it's ... it's a the power play there is a little interesting\nChat with a buddy Kurt hew and pro basketball talk of NBC Sports dot com your ongoing deep to enforcement NBC Sports radio Houston Rockets lose their opener and it's not that they lost the game you bad happens it's the fashion as to how they lost the gave a hundred and thirty one points Carmelo three of ten\nMinus twenty or minus Twenty one on you know and he's on the court\nNow it's just one game out of eighty two and I get that bought you think that the nightmare scenario that people had that Carmelo gums and he's not going to have shot because he didn't have many shot last year and okay see and you lose the defense of presidents ... mood day and that's why give a hundred and thirty one points\n[noise] this is the nightmare scenario and the other part of that is what\nAnthony was supposed to do is help boost that oftentimes and work hard and was an egg harden and Chris Paul were good not other worldly and\nLast season they were pretty much otherworldly every night and that's part of the reason that the one sixty five games that they weren't this night and it showed that they you know look again the west is deep you know New Orleans is a good team if you come out and play nice against them\nAnd they gave us is going to run roughshod over you um [noise] I I I think it was a little bit of a one off for them but it is going to take a while for\nCarmelo Anthony to find a rhythm coming off but he admitted as much like he got really cold in the second half not used what he's gonna have to figure out is written with this um\n[noise] but yes this is the nightmare scenario and by the way I think this I think they're often will save them most nights\nBut what they lost the matchup really it really impacts them against Boston and Golden State and those are the teams that they're targeting those are the teams that they're going to be I mean those are the three teams one of those three teams very likely to win the NBA title one it's going to be one of those three almost certainly and\nI'm all alone\nNo non\nWe've helped over a million homeowners and we want to help you know there are more ways to help\nCoal

they don't have to look for a thousand yards and here he is he's still on the bus down believable Josh Rosenstein don't hear from him yeah let's here from Rosen why not\nThe chosen one his his Rosen talking about his turn over ...\nI think it was kind of an old saying I got in college I'm from one of my coach said don't turn a or a car crash into fatality so I think sometimes you just got to make the smart play and I can't just kinda toss it up there or\nI mean I even got lucky and some of these some of them are ... and some of the worst so I'm going to take care of the ball for the most part I think that was part of the biggest lesson I could take some again\nOh I see smart I like him I Do work but you know they they have an area near the sound argued there no but you know what we talked

F. HR it's time now for the morning magazine brought to you by comfort air heating cooling plumbing\nNow with the morning magazine here is Carl he'll keep thank\nYou Jerry and good morning everyone congratulations you've made it to the end of another workweek welcome to the friday edition of the morning magazine I Am Thirteen twenty and streaming live that W with H. R. dot com it's time for another state legislative update this time for Senator Patrick tested in Steven's point joins us from Stevens Point I'm a news learning today and good morning senator\nFriday happy\nFriday to you as well well might as well get your take on getting a reaction from all all sorts of local officials to the big news out of beer and then in the paper or what was your reaction when you heard the big news\nAddict so for those who are already um the\nAnd the paper and beer and just announced last week and expansion of a hundred and eighty nine million dollar project\nAnd they're going to um pressure off at one of their machine to do an Arab or they're going to break a couple of ... or a wastewater treatment of fiber recovery is huge the first time in almost twenty five years we've seen an expansion of a paper plant in central Wisconsin where\nUnfortunately over the course of the last twenty five thirty years which backed up that where we've seen layoffs which being a bankruptcies we've seen in some cases plant closed down altogether so there is a tremendous investment in central Athens\nAnd what makes it even more impressive is the fact that any paper just purchased that plant them catalyst\nBack then earlier this year in June or may I Believe it was so this is a strong message that they are here to stay and they are committed central Wisconsin so I I really started by this news\nAnd world ... cocoa who was on the show from Reggie or yesterday yesterday when we were doing our tone of Rome reporting mentioned that the the plant a manager here though um local corporate had him\nOr his his messages they want to be a compassionate company they plan and being involved in this community and that's great news and and the shows are represented ... talked about this to\nTo help out and make sure that we continue to move in the right direction and continue to build upon the progress of what these last few years\nOr anything or any projects in particular that are on your radar things that you are planning to work huh\n[noise] [noise] yeah so there's a there's a number and has a we get ready for this next legislative session we've already um began to create an a very long list though a project we want to work on and whether it's standalone bills or get incorporated is next\nI'm first and foremost one of the big ones that I'm hoping we can get accomplished and and we continue to work on is the um Tribune project this is one that I really really want to see come to a\n\nCome to fruition and when I take a look at what they were able to do with the confluence project over in the square area I see a similar vision with the Tribune project but focus more on October newer shift to focus on basically\nA community based regional base\nA skills and and a development center that I think could serve as a model for for other regions around the state so we we continue to um work with the folks will read encourage would continue to try and work with our legislative colleagues and so\nWe're going to keep trying to build a case for why why we need to have that\nTo try and make that investment so we can get the than off the ground because\nAs I've often said that when you see what this project is because it can sometimes be difficult to explain to some of our colleagues just sure what it is but when you when you see played as you see their plans you see the blueprints are the life all just goes off and it becomes just\nClear as day why does some corn and why it would be such a benefit for for the community\nWell one of the aspects of that project ties in with the girls in the hospitality industry and we've seen was saying Kelly and then as the kids and then there are planning to\nPut in there and the mysteries technical colleges for their hospitality program wants to base their you know their training in terms of their calling their training camps at the Tribune building bigger knows the partnership with encourage on that so there you are looking at something tai chi in right away with a workforce need\n[noise] [noise] ... exactly and that and I think they want this fit perfectly on line with everything that not only I talked about but it certainly the the governor's agenda as well where it's been\n... workforce for for ... workforce workforce workforce\nWhereas before and it just a few short years ago it was the exact opposite that war we need to create jobs and what I really liked about the concept of this project and what I really like\nUh when I see what's going on not just with the Tribune project but in other aspects of central Wisconsin as well that\nIn years past where you at all these various organizations they're all kind of working on similar goals but everyone operated within their own silo there wasn't much communication between\nDifferent organizations different governmental units\nAnd now because of the challenges that we have within our our demographics Asian population they need for more workers\nYou have seen those silos disappear you see more widespread communication you see more collaborative efforts between public and private entities you see competitors working with one another because they realize we're all in the same boat here\nWorld rolling in the same direction that we want to make sure that our region remains a economically viable and we will remain a attractive place to do business then\nAnd so it's fixed rate in line with\nEverything that we've worked out over the course of the last two years and so we're going to keep pushing for it because\nI see the importance of it I Know a lot of the other folks involved from MIT faith to encourage to a local leaders we get it and so now we just need to continue to make our case to our colleagues down to Madison like this could certainly serve as an example for um other projects like this around the states\nYou mentioned about working in silos yesterday we had on\nIn part to the program in the books from a W the small business development center and an extension office and talking about the collaboration that's being developed between the chambers of commerce\nIn central Wisconsin the extension office in the lead to train and entrepreneurs to get to help get them up and started [laughter] and that's another and that's a huge regional thing between the university and I guess\nHow can we continue to help facilitate these type of activities\n[noise] and that that's a that's a great question Carl because that is that as an area that I have also tried to focus on it and my work down to Madison because\nEven though our economy is doing extremely well right now our our our business startups of individuals' actually want to start a business\nHas remained relatively low compared to other states in the mid west and so you know whether it was the the bill that we're introducing got signed into law that wave the El Al the filing fee for for um students enroll in a technical college or a four year you W college\nTo ah get a business off the ground um these are the types of efforts we need to see because there are\nPeople out there who have great ideas\nNot just young people across the board and all ages but who have an idea and they want to see their dream come true and start a business and so anything that we can do to um make those possibilities in reality\nI say the strong message that we embrace\nInnovative ideas we embrace new business we embrace startups\nWe want to continue to make sure that not only do we have the atmosphere to do that that there are organizations out there that are willing to help individual that that want to do that but probably most importantly that will remain to be a state that\nUm encourages new development as opposed to um stifling it so this is going to be I think another component that is going to be on the forefront and\nAs we get ready for the next legislative session because um even though we've gotten a lot done over the course of the last eight years they're still a lot more that needs to be done to keep moving Wisconsin forward and keep moving us up in the ranks as a great state not only to do business and but to ah to live as well\nLooks like and I know with the election just around the corner and transportation will be one of the issues you folks will have on your doctor governor has announced a proposal to increase the share of the states here transportation funding to towns\nWith an additional three million over the calendar year and there's other proposals on all sides of the ... the ... where do you see what do you think's going to happen or do you think because it's become a hot campaign issue finally going to get a long term solution to our transportation needs\nThat my hope I certainly hope we can get there and you just a highlighted the governor had proposed given more a state aid that only two pounds but also the counties and\nSo I I think in some of the reforms that were implemented last session within the tea and obviously the leadership of secretary Iraq but the agency has come a long way and so you know you're going to hear a lot of rhetoric over the course of the next three weeks or specifically on transportation\nUm you know there are some candidates out there who are advocating all options on the table or in some cases increases on the gas tax of upwards of a dollar you know whether that's true or not\nI don't know but what I'm what I'm telling people is\nIs that yes options should be on the table but revenue increase there should be a last resort that we can continue to ensure that reforms are implemented within DOT that we continue to make sure that we prioritize wants versus means that we remove frivolous spending within the department of transportation\nBut more importantly I think what's going to go a long way toward that long term solution\nIs how do we find them more equitable way to ensure these local wrote aid to\nEnsure that a more rural areas of the state get their their fair share now the good news is on that says that by twenty twenty twenty Twenty one somewhere in there provided there are no the way all of the major projects are down in South south eastern corner of the state they're going to be completed\nTheir decisions long before Governor Walker was in office by previous administrations that they were going to spend heavy up front which tied up a lot of resources and state aid or for these projects\nSo one thing products are freed up there it's going to be a lot more resources for allocation state why because I Know that it's been an area of contention for some because they they seeing 'em stay dollars in tax dollars gets funneled through the master projects on the I Ninety Ninety four accord or\nBut those are coming out for completion so um it's it's becoming almost say I don't want a perfect storm but the environment is going to be much better\nWe're going to be able to have a clearer conversation with clear eyes or for a long term solution ensure that our area of the state isn't being left behind to the more urban centers in southeastern Wisconsin\nAnd with that I'll let you go I appreciate your time and we'll talk again\nFunctionally target to get into this a little bit I and I I I the topic industrial mechanics industrial heartland that's an interesting term or ... where are we talking about\nSure so this is this is what I did for a living before I became an instructor at mid state so we're the people who ah keep the machines running that produce anything that is that is made so everything that we're wearing and that the chairs are sitting on and the the ... the desks are or were leaning on and things like that\nAre made somewhere sure and they're made by machines right why people running machines bomb and so the industrial maintenance technician or industry mechanic is the person who um we could we\nStart at installation and then we we do preventive maintenance which is we we make sure we the machines are running Whelan stay running well OK if something should go wrong we weave in and fix it\nAnd so the training that I get my students and that the other instructors working with me with any industry mechanical\nGive our students gives at that baseline set of skills to go to any employer and um learn those particular machines but you have every machine is made up of systems we learn about the systems okay so if from from what we would call\nManufacturing as people understand that um whether we're building widgets or rolling paper off the end of the roller making cranberry juice um\nThat's a that's a product right right so uh the machine's really are made up of of components no matter what the product is the components are very similar\nEvery shaft runs on a bearing in rolls around and around sure and no matter what um what business you're in we have a lot of rolling chefs [laughter] that's all that's a foundational class a bearings class for my students said that I'm actually teaching this semester for my new students [noise] um\n[noise] and the ... they can go in a lot of different areas I myself have had a a varied career in industry maintenance before I came to me it was great\nI was going to ask you where what industry where you win\nWell I started out at a large machine shop um that made parts for cranes and well and earth moving equipment and then I worked at a meant\nThat made awards and medallions not money but [laughter] ... and in college and things like that so that that was vastly different than working in the machine shop area sure um [noise] and then I went to work at a car company in their bras foundry oh wow that was another difference that\nThen I went to northern Minnesota to work at a board plant and making oriented strand board and that that time I decided to get into education uh so I went and saw my teaching degree in and decided to take another attorney my in my past but the point being um\nAll of those businesses that I worked for was very very different but I still had the same base set of skills that I took to each one of my students can take their base set of skills\nOut of any of our manufacturing programs and go to an employer and worked to enhance them at that particular players it's an entry into anywhere okay that's the key is the key is it absolutely is\nAs lucky then it's cool I I I'm ... I'm Glad you were or gave us a little bit of ... your own background because it shows you folks that the quality of the education you get a mistake technical college you got people teaching you who've been in the business\nThey know what you're going to be facing and they know how to help you get to where you want to go with your career we got pay some bills real quick and then we're going to continue our discussion about manufacturing and the opportunities educationally at MIT state technical college you're listening to morning magazine\n[noise] in week one of the high school football playoff the assumption royals will travel on friday to pits we'll\nTake on the Panthers for the right to advance of the two thousand Eighteen tournament if you can't get to the game W.

the the die having said that they might not power Saturday will be highly than even with the highest paid having agreeing casino have anything to carry things down ... let me get lost twenty five and he went to college it quite\nSigning corny right now mostly cloudy and fifty one and a and Thirteen twenty welcome back to the morning magazine and part two of our segment we're saluting manufacturing in our mid state technical college up day we're visiting with Mike shields industrial mechanical technician instructor\nAnd we were just talking about industrial mechanical technician\nAt well I guess we kind of answered this in a way but why would you say they should choose your program why would a student wants to ... interested in manufacturing be interested in your program\nWell sure Karl I'm I think it takes a certain mindset so obviously I think uh students should come up with some mechanical aptitude that does not mean they have to have they know everything about mechanical things but just some aptitude if they like their tech ed classes in high school\nUm things like that um\nAll of the math classes they take in school help them develop logic\nAnd logic helps us find out when a machine breaks oh that's trouble shooting okay do they have being able to follow a logical process as well as good as well and we also build that into our classes in and help students increased their trouble shooting skills [noise]\nUm I just did that had a um a little exercise and my bearings class this week with my new students um to help them analyze something and\nTry to figure it out on their own and then we went back into discussion and and there were some some aha moments in there where students oh that's what we were doing so some got it right away and some didn't but that's it's a step we take those steps as we as we teach in the classroom and in our labs [noise]\nUm they should in in my program they should ah get a satisfaction out of I'm\nDoing something physically so if you if you walk away at the end of the day um and you've fixed the machine or you've built something or whatever and you can walk away and say I did that and I'm very proud of it\nThat's a that's a good mindset um if you would rather do something else and get your uh satisfaction out of\nUm maybe programming I'm a computer or things like that there are also those opportunities with any industry mechanical technician program saw many machines are controlled by a programmable logic controllers peel season we teach\nThat end of it as well it's not all about the mechanics of it is a ... there's controls and power on the electrical side and so a student that likes the ... the computer and um but still likes to work with their hands might also be\nIdeally suited for a career I'm which could take them in many different directions\n[laughter] so how long does it take to complete their program program as a two\nYear associate degree so that's four semesters um and most students are able to complete in those four semesters um\nWe do have part time students that are working through and so then it will take them longer than that because they can't do a really a fulltime job in a full time student school schedule but we can accommodate that and we can work things out and try to get them\nOn a progression that makes sense for them and um it takes some extra work and dedication but the they they make it happen\nNow if you are a fulltime student\nOr even a part time student do you have an internship opportunities or on a summer work opportunities do you have a relationship with employers who say send me some of your really good students because I Would think this is a way for a company from a company standpoint\nOh I really liked the student you sent me Mike and when he graduates he or she graduates among offer them the job\nI'm extremely that you asked me that question because yeah we we do have companies that provide internships for our students um we actually have an internship class song and register for the class we have them they have to journal during their internship and do some other paperwork requirements while they're going doing their their job\nUm with a company that and and then we can get feedback on the value of the internship and what it's doing for them and we find that they're both the students in the employers really like this process one of our employers\nAre was at my advisory committee meeting a last week\nAnd they've hired ten of my graduates in the last five years wow all of them were interns off all of them they hired as summer interns um they come in they interview students who want the internship they select\nEnding treadmill staying in one place and never getting ahead with those minimum payments you\nFeel like

volleyball and\nAnd now all the other activities that go along with and jak starting soccer nowadays and all those types of things were always out an active in the community\nOr I Am a I'm also a full time real estate agent so I have a foot grounded in the private sector so I have a real good idea of what's going on in our community as far as the business ideas and the business grows and the needs of our community in that area has been in the legislature now for eight years I chair the public benefit Reform Committee\nAnd we deal with a lot of the right size of our benefit programs in the state of Wisconsin\nIt's also been the vice chair for six years of the environment forestry committee which is coming very much ... when you deal with environmental issues in this area continuously especially on water issues but also for eight years been on the colleges and universities committee so those are the three that\nMy entire career because all three of those touch here to home quite a bit of you know I'm pretty excited about all the success we've had the last few years especially here locally\nOr you know from the success from a few years ago writing the bill to help stand valley gets started five years early to bring six hundred jobs to Adams County to the work we did the state budget to improve our infrastructure on highway Thirteen and our local airport\nI Try to stay out of the big heady discussions and Madison and I tried to focus more on local issues and how those conversations in Madison affect us locally as I think that's been my wheelhouse and I think I've been pretty successful in doing that so I'm looking forward to tell me more about it throughout the next twenty minutes\nI'm your response to one of the first ads Iran against do is play does your comment where or the I'm just going to serve this many years and yeah so it talk about what's your response to that when someone says Hey Scott I thought you were to ... only term limit yourself\nYou know and that's what I always thought that my my family would kind of give me this leeway for a couple of years a couple of terms or figure out that by the time we get through the fourth year they're kind of done with it\nBut the excitement from my family and the support that they've given me have given me the opportunity to keep going back to Madison and if I had only been there for that for a year witnessing the success and saving those jobs at skyward\nThousand family support in jobs in Steven's point\nWe went to see the success we've seen was saying valley we wouldn't have seen the success we've seen with other announcements from economic development things in this area\nSo you know the book is stuff along with my family support and the and the list of successes really kept leading to bigger and better things and I think\nAs long as I'm successful as long as I'm motivated and as long as I'm accomplishing things that makes sense and really fulfill the names of the people in my district\nI keep asking for their support and every two years and given that opportunity to do so and if they don't want to agree with that and want to send me pack and back to wherever I'm going to go next to work again that's totally up to them but I I Know my commitment level a second to none I Know my availability of second the non\nSo when you hear some of the negativity that goes along with this race I think it's it's a bunch of ... because I don't go negative I talk about the things that matter and that's what I Want to do today is talk about the real issues of the race instead of just you know some of the things that somebody will flipping through out there just to try to score some political points\nOne issue that has been brought up and the Democrats bringing up as a school choice program sure and and this is a it's taking money away from public schools that should be listed on people's property tax bills and it's and increasing exponentially is going to be putting a hole in the bud okay I'll let you respond I'm\nSure you've heard all of the different\nYou know I even listening yesterday to the interview with the challenger and just to hear him say that the parents don't have a right\nTo make a choice blew my mind that parents don't have the right to make decisions for themselves and their families on what the best educational opportunities for their kids\nAbsolutely ridiculous so everything that we do at the state level and the choice program only sets up a competitive situation for a public school if they're afraid that they're going to lose the students\nThat gives them the chance to be innovative and creative to try to keep that family more interested or keep them more active and engaged it just has to have an opportunity for them to compete a little bit and if the school really isn't working for a child it's a family just says you know what I'm paying these property taxes are not receiving the level of services I think I should be getting him\nWhy shouldn't they be able to make a choice I'd just boggles my mind that the kids are left out of this equation just to protect the the mantra of you know whatever political point somebody wants to put out there and if you don't think about the kids in the family is in his equation you're missing sixty percent of the argument at my point\nOh or other areas there were there could be some tweaking folks have pointed toward problems with some schools in the Milwaukee area\nYeah you know when you look at scores and you look at accountability and all of the things that they said just don't exist every curriculum for every choice school has to be approved by the PIN last I checked Tony ... is running deeply I nowadays and running for governor\nSo Tony eras plays a huge role in making sure that we're approving these curriculums for each of these schools that are in the choice program\nAnd yes just like any other possible institution of any kind there can be failures and there have been a few I think there have been three since I've been in elected office they had to close\nAnd it's unfortunate but when that experiment doesn't work\nThere are other options available it's not like these kids are being left out of educational opportunities but at least we're giving them choices and options and chances whether it's virtual charter you know whether it's independent charter school or or at school district run charter school or it's a choice program worth ... traditional K. through twelve\nParents have that right by the time you get into a school situation you figure out it's not working and you take two three four years for your child to be in that same situation without an option it's too late you've lost a child\nAnd building that into their future you can't wait nowadays in such a competitive world\nTo make the situation of fit your needs you have to find the thing that fits your needs right now and that's what we're doing the choice program\nYour income limits in place there's entry points in place that allow only entry points at certain levels it's not freely and fully open for everybody all the time there are certain percentages are in place for school districts not be able to lose more than one or two or three percent as it goes up the next few years\nPlenty of things that have held the choice program from being everything that people fear it can be if they're against it as some of us think that there are better opportunities for choice schools to be more creative\nAnd I think you know in the future will see that creativity comes through from both public school and choice schools and trying to find the right students for their needs and getting students that excited about what they do [laughter]\nEconomic development I Know that's been a passion of yours I wanted to get your feeling on some of the rhetoric in the campaign or about well we're we don't compare well with Minnesota either in terms of income or art student loan debt cetera you've heard some of the stove or\nGive you the floor to respond to you know\nI grew up in Wisconsin Rapids I'm I'm a rapid Brett from day one I've lived here my

I don't want to see resilience but almost\n... ability for this team to shake off to launch there's been a resident you may have not sustain in quite some time\nI mean it'd been more than a month when right did that it was one day passed one calendar month since they had lost back to back games which is kind of remarkable um the the the that post game ... was not um it was not\nDoom and gloom it was ... it was more like kind of a determination like we need to you know we need to go into games I mean they have no other choice but to take that kind of mindset into games six is just say we need to win this baseball game and then play another baseball game\nSo um you know again I I I think that they feel like on paper they are they're very well set up for these two games and I feel like the ... you know this gets into it and I I I've I've been at a bunch of enough yes as we're teams fall into positions like this\nAnd I'm like going into yesterday's game\nWith a pitching weighed Miley for one batter it it it was another example of kind of that always\nThat tug that always fascinates me between\nAll hands on deck have to win today's game these are every playoff game as a Muslim game and then the idea that these teams strategize to win series they they strategize to win games but they mostly strategize to win this year and I think that part of what happened in game five at the beginning\nWas a strategy to win the series um\n... you know and it was the same time helping yourself by getting a match ups you ought to try to win that game so they feel like just from the big picture it this is this is a seven game series if you can get there they feel like they're in a good spot with Miley interesting going against review and rocket fuel or\nI'm In having the you know the brewers bullpen and pretty good shape\nUm they feel like they're well positioned to to\nReally get themselves a chance to pitch to win the series now the two things that could soil that or if you continue not to hit again you said that from the start of the Dodgers and I think that's part of what needs to be also recognize fears that sounds very good they talk to and\nThey were in the world series last year um they have you know Clinton her shot the front of their rotation Kelly gentle Kennedy dancing at the back of their bullpen Justin Turner hitting second in that line up um they're really good\nSo if the Dodgers come out and and really soon but that then the birds are in trouble as well because that's also the Dodgers fans can be just as frustrated as brewers fan by the way they swung the bats the Dodgers have come through more with runners in scoring condition but the raw numbers are equal offensively to what the birds are doing so we're talking about a handful of that that\nWas run are those going position late in games against her very good for the gold and\nThat is the difference between the birds being up free to and the Dodgers being up three to an end obviously we're in the the the the reality of the situation for the birds that it's the the ladder right now I'm so it's been a very evenly matched entertaining series that's coming down to the fat in big spots and I I don't think that should be a huge surprise for silver baseball\nWhen you look at demanding maternal situation or if you even want to call it a situation more so than into I I guess might be the best way to put it but\nUm when is this thing just completely put to bed and other major league baseball has stepped in and said one knock it off to a we're going to find you ten thousand dollars which is basically a slap on the wrist but letting them know that there overlooking his shoulders is is is completely no no\nUh that's a really good question I Would say you know we didn't see it you got kitten game five but I mean obviously it was not what you wanted to order if not not what you wanted to do there and I heard um so\nYou know that this ... this story will continue in the future in my opinion\nBut you're not going to settle this in the national league championship series where every out every play to parents is so precious\nUm they were really really mad and that group called Austin Christian reality is not fire he guy that you are seeing him out you know you just laid back pretty chill guy even when things are going great when things are going that\nUm he was really mad about that Manny Machado thing and he made sure that everybody got around all the cameras are ready to go yet something you wanted to say and and boy he said it you know dirty player from a dirty player you can't get more clear about the way he felt about name Machado\nUm the Denver Christian college set into the cameras so they're they're they're pretty ticked off when when you start getting into a situation where it looks like a guy is risking injury of\nSome of your key players um but it's really hard to sell that um when you just need out so I think all that needs to be put aside\nThere'll be opportunities to you know ... if you want to do something about that there's opportunity to do something about that later hey could end up in St Louis cardinals uniformly that'd be fun for the next seven years eight years ten years or whatever it is\nUm so so I I think you have to sort of put put the emotions on hold and just focus on trying to get to the world series the fans that are going to have fun with it tonight I imagine you\nKnow hey look I Hope the fan and I said as before even if the birds get down early last night I was watching the end of that uh that Boston a series\nYeah and in that place you could have heard a pin drop and I kept thinking the same thing bill man why these fans have to get in it man there's an energy there I mean I Know it's something you can't save are measured we put a statistic too but\nDon't give up and and I just couldn't imagine at Miller Park so even if the Dodgers get up by three four five runs early don't get to keep going you know don't shop til is dead\nIt's hard to do because at this point and that look I I had the exact same thought yesterday bill watching that a ... minute maid park the crowd shots admitted may par\nYou spent hundreds of dollars on these tickets you've spent thousands of dollars for a lot of those people on tickets all season long you've done this for six seven months so much hope so much energy so much excitement all these great moments all season long\nOh this is it but you know they're we're seeing crazy things happened in baseball David Roberts has been part of it remember uh fourteen years ago\nA day Robert was right in the middle of one of the greatest thing that's ever happened in terms of comebacks in major league baseball with the red Sox um and it it can happen and I agree with you or that\nIt is a big deal for to for the brewers or find a way to keep this crowd in it a tonight because it it makes a difference it it shouldn't you know those guys are down ... than they do the\nThe we've all seen her love of the game to clear the mechanism thing and you you walk out the crowd employer game\nBut a player after player after player said that it matters that the caller makes a difference in the outcome of these games and that's when you add that for sure at the top the list of reasons that they feel like they have a shot when two in a row\nIs that these games are at home it would be much different if they were going out on the road and happened to him to at Dodger Stadium so um it it is a big I think it is a big factor tonight\nJust for them to do and now even if they go down do enough to keep the crowd into it in and keep that crowd engaged because that will be a battle battle playing the outcome of the game\nThey added that is that I'm a ... ... ...

four as well\nYeah yeah okay so I don't know which is I mean I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I have never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nNight and the last thing it on our car empower the um on your class he said you know twenty or Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy with and can we were eighty wet hand\n[laughter]\nOkay why don't you jump on the lander insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much this guy's overcharged you for everything you sold your\nCar and you're probably gonna end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\n[laughter] that sounds like we're getting a deal I'm In the end of it like\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle\nAnd the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason heard a Ramsey talk about this case someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically [noise] um\nThe people who sell investment based or\nWhole life or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there's an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me\nAnd so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they say oh crap\nCrap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return\nRegardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die with cash value\nPermanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only the face of amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a bad right of return and when you die they keep it all\nThis is a bad savings account to bad investment broker will pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap and that's what they Ramsey has always had for twenty five years here on the air upset at\nThem for twenty five years is liable and myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based\n... and ever and I did get a horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque\nOld school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college\nCame around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from it\nHad it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy anything\nOther than\nFifteen to twenty year\nTerm life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker that shop several companies the best way to buy insurance if any connoisseur a broker the shops several companies and get you the best possible deal\nOr that your car insurance for homeowners insurance your long term care insurance sure life insurance your insurance of any kind letter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of Neal and that's why we've endorsed for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from slander and I don't own Zander insurance I don't own any of it that show a lot is always told about me\nI Would I Want to have a whole lot more money if I did on the sand or insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason he done well is he said he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd then also your name to listen to people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple takes care of you guys\nYou the listener and you need to get term life insurance have been cost that much so just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance hope by the way a broker you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with get what they are usually a north local providers for your for what we call PNC property in casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance you can shop\nMost people say three to eight hundred dollars a year\nOn their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agents in the business captive agent can sell for one company like a state for major\nForeign nation wide in Asia\nPeyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent was it nationwide that's nationwide and go but um and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that what you're paying for those guys\nWhen you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in\nNeither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nFocus is one of my favorite times of the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for the new routines well

Pennsylvania hate Carl welcome to the ... show\nHi Dave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure was up\nHey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping you can give me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free uh recently at our house talk yeah why do you go\nYeah happy about that a decided to you know fell off the best most just to do that people kind of said well why would you do that other people's money you're low interest [laughter] that's right and I tell you what the peace of mind is great fun you know the good problem I have is we were able to\nSell some stock options and I've got about five or six hundred thousand dollars that I'm trying to figure out what to do with a few that about the same amount in four one K. which I have to be in the market [noise] um I'm a little nervous about possibly also invest in the amount of money and the market\nMy foot palms we for about ten home and then I'm thinking about using that money to buy a rental property outright mhm and uh and do that and maybe diversify a little more ... and I want to hear what your thoughts were on that\nIn ... um I think is excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor\nAnd it's you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you\nYou know but you you put put a renter in a house they go out and you [laughter] and so there was a ... you know you've got the hassle of buying it you got to pay the taxes you pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a national factor I've got a bunch of it\nI'm not by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market I've got a lot in both\nBut a real estate will give you a better rate of return but it requires\nManagement by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else to what you've got a manager manager you cannot ignore it and so\nMy real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit to the you know that appreciation schedule in other words the actual cash on cash return the ... modest expenses as a return on investment and the growth in value you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual returns which is called the intern right of return the IRR\nOkay which you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples\nHigher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent right of return I are are not casual cash is about ten okay or a little less and some of it okay\nBut uh I our our total what the increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that than I Am on the road to ... on the other maybe double what on that are making a mutual fund\nBut I've got a lot more hassle with it I mean ... you know even though I don't manage around and my son in law runs our our real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally\nDeal with a renter or something like that or anything or vacancy are broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this
