fourth quarter the St strata whether ... consecutive game\nThere all the way of doing that\nYou'll do range there's no reason to do it it'd be that would make it a certain point they make the law so yeah I think they run the ball\nAbout the tea stretched out to the left side hill it's going to be the quarterback [noise] use the receiver of like the backfield extra help would take this takes their hat off peak for themselves but he's right\nThat is the deal hunter\nWho came in with seven and a half to last so poor\nThat's not what you want to do though I Know I mean he did not approve or ranger [noise]\nIt'll be terrible here so right now the bald spot on the thirty ... fourteen [noise]\nI mean it's going to be about fifty six yard field goal attempt it'd be doing but there to keep the up and saw the field I Would think they are going to actually use a time out is the one the other one thirty to play [noise]\nThe kind of thinking to yourself that some of what you get when you put it take to the back a little bit of Drew Brees to rebuild the situation nobody can and can't do\nNeal is probably trying to do a little bit too much didn't handle all opted to keep it in Missouri [noise]\nLast yard [noise] All right so the world uses the time about a thirty second ... goes to the sidelines he's not over what the bend so uh I Would assume they're going to the mall\nWas like there\nAgain Minnesota has no time out but it didn't see they're down by ten barring another Minneapolis Miracle they really have no chance to witness game [noise]\nCheryl to be back deep to receive

return to stay with us for the football most gay record we'll recap the highlights of stats from tonight's game to hear from a member of the winning team that Scott gravel once it got to have scores and highlights from around the league that's all coming up to the game [noise]\nSo cuts it's down to play\nWith his fans heading toward the exit not all of them but a fair amount of the shot gun he dropped back to his end zone\nDumped Saddam to Laurie Maria and the near side of the fourteen and take it down outside the Cassini are a lot of cussing [noise]\nDavis make to tackle again of seven

county to play [noise]\nNew Orleans up by ten thirty the Vikings with football just running up and try to do something positive\nAs cousins drops back to pass underneath\nWho will say this Murray Murray inside territory to the forty six but he's behind\nWhich well second now eleven now than\nAt the clock why couldn't they finally stopped the clock at nine seconds to play [noise]\nRiver upsetting for the record inside of the reef yeah well that's all the people you've\nGot this little spike football and that means he's got six seconds left\nTo just throw it up last time [noise]\nYeah I think at this point\nYou're down ten just probably want to move on\nIt for\nWeren't able to store touchdown but what's it about a forty two yard field goal to stretch to lead to twenty to Thirteen it wasn't the only mistakes in Minnesota with experience over three minutes ban and the third quarter looked very briefly like Kirk cousin fumbled the football away his own territory and back that was the call on the field but a replay showed that he was down before the bumble\nThat actually would have been better mistake as opposed to what ended up happening a couple of plays later when his receivers stuck with it\nBecause this takes us out of a shotgun looks right now [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWas\nFunding stopped running PJ Williams didn't the ball hit him right the only chance that he lost in the end zone for the touchdown for all intents and purposes this fall game was over because let's face it a very good job of controlling the ball and the clock despite the fact that they were out game for a good shot through the night\nAnd early in the fourth quarter and drive it began in the third they ... have made it seem second drive with another will must feel both stretched to thirty to Thirteen and sort of had to make a whole to climb out of\nThis together Seventy five yard drive on thirteenth plays that I'm feeling catching a one yard touchdown pass from Kurt cousins but\nThe saints killed out most of the remainder of the clock\nNico stone to a thirty such once he win or lose sayings after losing in the opener now one six in a row their six in one on the air\nAs sort of Vikings falling to forty three in one if you took a look at the numbers Minnesota how getting New Orleans by what they did and as the guy's pointed out Drew Brees for only a hundred and twenty yards on the night you would have thought it would have gone the other way it didn't\n... gets a very big victory on the road at us banks stadium tonight over the Minnesota Vikings with more\nOn tonight's game that's rejoined comic or anything and Jason Taylor guys\nYeah Scott I think your point about uh the the ... for the New Orleans saints breeze was just Eighteen to twenty three hundred and twenty yards a you would think that this war would be different it would it be thirty to twenty the saints a beating\nThe Minnesota Vikings but the two turnovers were huge one was a pick six of course but prior to that that feeling bumble and they returned by a lot more set up the score so they capitalized on those two turnovers which helped them to the victory\nBut that was huge she'll be was it was everything for this theme today and you know it to to turn over in the red zone\nFlip the field get the penalty which ended up ... ended up putting fifty more yourself or triple throwing his helmet to play later come ours and he ends over touched down in that as part of the downhill trend for the Minnesota Vikings and the things just took off from there and it picks fixing the second half was was the final Becker for\nSex also for the New Orleans defense and I think that was that was big because each time you saw the Vikings try to do something you know it was stopped by the saints defense whether it be stopping the run or stopping the past or getting into the fields\nYeah and we knew coming into there will be some issues up and said wait for the Vikings running out of line and you know had a couple of guys hurting ... he had to start to write cycle ... out here with over to the left tackle spot Danny's adore came into play ... played left guard so there was some some mix up in turmoil but there were some changes up and said well you know in the office of life was going to be incumbent on\nThose guys trying to give her some time to get rid of the football and and there was a few times where they just didn't do that and\nEven though the interception earlier you're Kirk as he was he's still on the football and and it you know it's it backfired on them\nAll it's time to select the guy go drive of the game what do you think they're Jason\nWhat was it was obviously a New Orleans dry there was a Fifteen play Dr\n... only ... only covers fifty yards but it took eight minutes Fifteen seconds when you delete and you're trying to take care of the ball here out of this dome that did it and then we'll butts forty to your Google so Fifteen plays because your drive eight minutes of Fifteen seconds has you\nKnow basically put the game away at the end that's the drive of the game ... by guy go great news there's a quick way you could save money switch to a guy go go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you can say fifty percent or more on car insurance the loss by the Vikings means that the north is tightened up even more\nThey find themselves that for three and one the Chicago Bears are born three the Green Bay Packers are three three and one of the Detroit Lions who are coming in to a U.S banks stadium there next game\nOr on the fourth of November they find themselves at three and four meat while for the saints who lost that first game to the Tampa Bay buccaneers it seems like it was years ago they now one sixth graders Scott said they are six and a lawn Carolina is five and two and then you have Atlanta and Tampa\nBoth at three and four so they are in control of their division would they fund NFC match up coming up next week when they take on the rams\nThey played out in Los Angeles last year this year they play in New Orleans\nSets a place to play I mean the come across the play in the Mercedes Benz dome or whatever they call it down there in New Orleans that places that will be rocket next week\nWell it it's going to be a fun weekend of of the uh football down in New Orleans I and I don't think we're expect Drew Brees to hundred and twenty yards again against the rams\nOr if he does they will not with the other one of them now and say that\nI Will say it's the most efficient a hundred and twenty yards I think you could see from all fame\nQuarterback ... barely broke us went that night but he got the way that it's all a matter of them\nAll right so again the St sweat it thirty to twenty over the Vikings let's

doctors are lucky they weren't sweat because I think Boston is just so clearly a superior team\nTo the doctors and they proved that over the course of an entire season not only did they win a hundred\nAnd eight games they did it in a superior league the national league compared to the American league is uh is is more than a got below and I made the point earlier in the show I think without question the red Sox the Yankees and the afterwards we're all better teams and the Dodgers\nThat I Would make the case I think the ... and the Indians are too I I Would say there's five teams in the American league better than the Dodgers\nCertain inferior leak throw the doctors into the American league they might not make the playoffs in fact I don't think they would\nWhich is why I'm a proponent of seating and all sports basketball baseball and football pick the best teams in the morning to twelve one through sixteen whatever it is and let's go ... are we not going to watch the world series depicts the Yankees against the red Sox were not going to watch because they're both American League teams I I think that would be great\nWhat's wrong with leading the playoff team why so they have to be national against American League especially now that we have so much literally play\nIs kind of diluted the whole American National League thing hasn't it\nAn NBC Sunday Night Football Goodwin for the same thing that they go to six in one gain a little bit of a measure up over ... over that a playoff lots of the ... so you're saying so again my my pre season to get to the super bowl to play the New England patriots excuse me looking better and better I'm getting so excited I'm losing my breath here\nLet's get out to the guest hotline let's go to our good friend from NBC Sports bay area he is the warriors insider he's the bay area insider it's our good bread money pool was that money\nYes sir how you're doing a good one another another good went for the warriors today are going to six in one over the net so what seven threes ... today and thirty five points and the lawyers of course ruling again and and without question the heavy favorite to win another MBA championship\nYeah they look like a they their their main business this year last year they had come up you start we've had some moments this year where they look a little off but uh on this road trip I thought this was a chance to get well er and against the mix um they were close for three quarters and been Kevin direct takes over as costs twenty five\nIn the fourth quarter in law away the next night they just give them a kind of an all around team effort to have a big lead and been of course there will never quit\nOr that's what their style to come back and make it closed down the stretch but the water's just have to watch Katie and too much Steph Curry and for them to come back off\nThe Knicks fans cheering for Kevin Durant and uh and certainly for him to be a big mutt\nA couple of years ago but I Can't imagine any scenario I mean if it's got to leave but it's not going to be for that to that disaster of an organization the New York Knicks\nI wouldn't think so but I I Can't dismiss it because uh one knowing Kevin and and the fact that\nUm you know he's had some success what the warriors they want to championships with him he's wanted me a a finals MVP both times\nOr if they win it again and he went to the finals every third time a part of me wonders if people want a new challenge\nAnd I don't know if there's a bigger challenge out they've been trying to resurrect the mix especially given at ownership situation if it's just not healthy at the same time uh they have a very attractive coaching David says they'll players love him\nA and Kevin's business partner rich climbing is a long time and expand who dreams of someday running the Knicks front front office uh\nSo you know I mean senator mentally I I I think Kevin has to consider that even though there is no way on earth he could go there and make them ... percent contender in the next year or two\nSo it wouldn't seem and have to sell the team for him to consider going there who would want to play for him\nThat the ... that's that's what the take their ownership is the issue there yeah I think\nIf Kevin has learned one thing but the warriors it is bad ownership matters\nUm I mean this the the water's current current ownership is taking his team to places where previous all their ships have note\nIt just wouldn't do it couldn't do it wouldn't do it and um I think that's something that can be appreciated by NBA veteran player like that and he he wants to describe it to me as the warriors bring a place where you graduate from all the other NBA teams out there [laughter] so um\nYes it do I think he'll go to New York no I don't but I Can't dismiss it just because I think part of him might get restless and just want a new challenge is something he's an explorer at heart\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised that some if some place else\nI've kind of looks it looks like a place to go where you can discover something new about himself I wouldn't be surprised\nWhat about the Lakers joining liberal and if he wants to channel I guess if he wants to be the most hated player an MBA history maybe that would be a good choice for them but you think you would consider that you\nKnow he sat down when he said that one down already and uh I I don't know I don't think that's going to happen um\nYou know that that rumors come up a new for numerous reasons numerous times now he bought a twelve million dollar mansion down there in Malibu and\nUm that's that's what it is that's really where they pick up steam it's like okay V. wants to live in LA and play with Macron's yeah um you know I Know not necessarily I I I don't think he'll do that now uh\nIf if somebody said if he's going to go to New York or LA which one do you think he'll go to oddly enough I think he's in New York before you go to LA not that I'm saying is going to go to either was\nAnd you know moving out here means nothing to get you you know this money you know Malibu colony down there all those houses on the beach like Gucci rowing it's every MBA player in every team in the league has a house there is one after another and when you go down it demeans nothing when they buy a house they're\nExactly a lot of guys spend our summers in LA yeah and as much time if they can so\nIt's not that unusual for that to happen but when it happened and people heard about it like oh my goodness you thinking about going to LA not necessarily that what the clippers All right well you know what anything is possible because he will become a freer to a July you've got to opt out\nAnd he's got to figure out what he wants to play and he may stay with the warriors but he may go elsewhere so what ... what does it play out because he is not just in his hand at all so far\nHow close are we to democracy cousins playing\nGod the water's not putting a timeline on it but based on where he is I Would expect to see him sometime\n[noise] better pick 'em up I'd say December\nUm I think he's getting he's come a long uh I Do think he'll be playing before the end of the calendar year so uh my earlier prediction which was about six weeks ago I said about Christmas Day\nUm maybe a little before that now it's possible uh he's coming along and progressing lightly and we're still you know two months away from Christmas so uh I Would think that he will be practicing with the pain sometime in November\nAnd dependent putting how that goes will be on the court with the team in games in December probably playing limited minutes you know restriction Eighteen twenty minutes a night or even maybe less to start with until he gets up to conditioning and gang condition what should I take I take\nAnother month or so so you may not see the best of him into after the\nAfter the new year no joy and they will be back before that\nJoining us here for ... days when the ... the ... the warriors inside and of course they are inside of for all sports\nYou know do a lake of the owner who is a multi billionaire and he can certainly afford it but what I Do need probably he said he wants to keep this team together he wants to bring everybody back when contracts are up and he doesn't care three hundred million for a

the off season where the money they throw around\nThe Dodgers should be good again depending on if they get a new manager and whether they bring back with shot over the Clinton criticized back we'll see but I don't think we're going to see the Dodgers again in the world series next year I think this is I think they pretty much a less they get a competent manager now I might change my mind that\nAnd when you look at the all time meltdowns and major league baseball history\nI mean how bad is there's a ... a one man being out managed by another day robbers being out managed to start to

sort of one\nTeam and they kind of under achieved\nWell it's unfortunate I kind of goes to show you what can happen would have something great but not all of their leadership pieces that better probably really see eye to eye and I think a buddy of mine and post soul very similar in their coaches alive but at the same kind\nOf very difficult time kind of seeing eye to eye and coming together and make it work and it just shows me a tremendous example for me as to how important it is to have energy at the top of any organization to have a long lasting effect\nI Know you're you're probably the greatest player in the history of Baylor football and ... you were up for the job of nearly two thousand I think you you were close in two thousand seven before he took the San Francisco forty

just an honor to even have money and put in that hat and you just never know about life but I'm I'm very thankful for\nWhere I Am and the opportunities that I've had and the opportunity to better coming and the opportunities that I have so very excited about that\nMight still happen you're still young enough Mike [laughter] well God has a tremendous sense of humor but we'll see what happens in

what did you learn from that now that you're going to be back in professional football in the ... or ... are you going to do anything different this time that you didn't do before as a learning experience\nWhy I think the greatest thing about this opportunity because I I really have a chance to go out and acquire the coaches that I really want to work with that I really feel that can come together and and create economy to environment to kind of culture that I Want to teach them to be you know all of that decision was up to their head coach to make\nAnd so these are bringing in the kind of funny that you want to kind of talent that you want and so being able to do based on the ground up um sewing tree in so excited about that because that's one thing I think uh being able to have your hand and on the pulse of everything that moved\nThere are no excuse me so very excited about that opportunity\nYou gonna run the forty sixty pets that was pretty successful when you play you gonna run that in the way up to the ... you know I'm\nI'm I'm sure I'm going to run some phase of it because you know a lot of people talk about well that wouldn't work today I well I'm not sure I I don't think a lot of people really you know what they're doing when they are looking forward to succeed but you just might see it you just never know\nBut it's funny that the the XFL is coming back and now we're going to have to lead to professional leagues besides the national football league coming up next year to\nWall it'll be interesting I think that for the alliance is just a matter of putting quality programs out there and the quality players in a quality teams that you can just kind of schooling or what have\nAnd you couldn't have better people running this league as well with

C. O. G. T. S. O. N. A. I. are your thoughts on the twenty eight gene World Series the twenty Eighteen major league baseball season as a home\nAnd in my opinion\nWhat I look back on this World Series and let's not forget about the Dodgers who made it to the world series for a second straight season and lost\nHappened in two thousand eleven with the Detroit Tigers\nThey lost back to back and the Dodgers just off back to back and it's tough I don't know how this team is going to respond will they be able to get back for a third consecutive year that is a very very very tall task\nBut they were great and the regular season they were great in the post season the acquisitions and whatnot you know we we talk about all the time or the acquisition of\nTeams that win championships but let's talk about the acquisition of this team that did not win the championship you know getting David Freese was a huge move he was or their best player in this World Series\nNow Ryan ... who's been so good for them in the post season was not good in the world series that move did not pay off while in the world series to me this World Series changed\nWay and David Roberts hook out rich hill in game for\nSeven innings of just stellar baseball on the mound for rich show\nThe Dodgers had just taken all the momentum in that game after the ... home run\nAnd Dave Roberts decides to\nPoll rich hill from the game when the Dodgers had a lead and weighing rich hill was shutting them down\nIt was that moment what I feel they lost the game\nBecause once the red Sox scored those runs\nTo me that changed everything it really did it changed everything and\nThis is what I mean by a manager having the freedom\nTo do things their way and I don't know where the decision came from and I'm not just going to say it was a number of driven decision but ritual it throw Ninety One pitch is okay he six and a third innings\nPearce your most valuable player he three home runs a you know had a tremendous series because each it was just that much more important than the next eight runs batted in and just five games\nIt was all about the home runs here in game five to move the bed with a home run JD Martinez one yard as well and what a season JD Martinez hat and there's another guy\nYou saw the way that baseball was cringing right in this past offseason\nThe big name guys weren't getting the contracts they weren't getting the contracts and why should they weren't getting the contracts that they thought they would get\nIn and JD Martinez state of eligible for a long time if you recall in this region process because she wanted a ton of money in free agency\nAnd the red Sox were the team that was really interested in him but they didn't want to go for the money in the years that he wanted he wanted at least one fifty that was the woman I remember coming on the air and telling Red Sox fans JD Martinez wants one fifty and the Sox are going to give it to him\nAnd what happened the red Sox got a five year one hundred and ... million dollar deal done\nOne ten for JD Martinez is a deal a deal for a player who is pretty good with Detroit really good with Arizona\nAnd this season with the Boston Red Sox and end VP candidate\nBlasting forty three home runs leading the week with a hundred and thirty runs batted in thirty seven doubles we believe with three hundred and fifty eight total\nBases the guy was the key\nOf the keys to their season and getting him for that cheap up a contract in comparison to some of the other deals that are going to be handed out just imagine what Machado was going to get and I wouldn't touch Machado but just imagine what my child is going to get\nThere's going to get jaded Martinez five years and a hundred and ten million dollars for the production he gave you in his first season is a steel\nEight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six to to\nDavid Price I thought he could have won the uh most valuable player I really did because David pricey me ... all here from their rights and just a second\nShe pitched in game two in relief in game three was warming up in game for and then seven dominant innings here in game five\nDavid Price up until this postseason was over eleven eleven post season starts with out a victory you want to his final three post season starts two of them in the world series\nHere was David Price with the media after the game\nMade so highly of you\nWhat does it mean to you to be a great teammate [noise]\n\nSon who misses I'm this is again we get to play [noise]\nYou know it's a it's a relationship that you may you know why you do this while you play this game at a [noise]\nThat's what makes this game so special\nAnd emotional David Price after the game just tremendous just tremendous\nEight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six to to\nTo made it and the guy who was criticized when he signed the big contract many people thought that he was not a big game pitcher the red Sox were were insane for signing him to such a big big deal\nI'm\nNot quite the case 'cause he proved to be very important for them down the stretch very important for them and how about this the red Sox\nIn the locker room celebrating after the wedding\nBlasting New York New York\nAnd then if you recall when the Yankees defeated the red Sox in the ... yes just one game but after the game it was a or even before the game or for the next game or after the game Aaron Judge walking through Fenway blasting New York New York on a boom box\nAnd it looks like the red Sox have still uh haven't gotten over that but now using the world series when to rub it in their faces by blasting that as they're celebrating in the clubhouse pay well you're lucky when the world series\nYou got to do whatever you want\nSo you get to make fun of the New York Yankees if that's the Boston Red Sox go right ahead have fun at the Yankees expense you deserve it\nAnd you deserve it eight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five three two three four six Jew Jew I mentioned the Dodgers before a you know sometimes it it stings but you win with class you lose

just in this World Series but throughout the entire twenty Eighteen season it really was masterful to watch him go to work because we are in an analytical trend in major league baseball where managers are getting hired just to be yes men\nAnd you see it all throughout baseball and I'm not trying to disrespect some of the guys that have been hired but\nManagers are being hired therefore players they're young they can identify with the current rosters\nThey have no prior managerial experience and they're all\nYes men they are analytical driven yes men who are savvy with the media\nAnd will not ruffled feathers of an organization so when a general manager and the analytics department and the scouting departments when they come up with a game plan that managers just supposed to say thank you and rollout that game plan but Alex Cora\nTime and time again has been allowed to deviate from the plan whether it's keeping the left the in the line up against the left the pitcher using a pitcher on conventionally Alex Cora has consistently\nBeen allowed the freedom to do as he pleases with this Red Sox roster walk combining\nBe analytical mind set because the red Sox and one of the

C. O. G. T. S. O. N. A. I. are your thoughts on the twenty Eighteen World Series the twenty Eighteen major league baseball season as a home and in my opinion\nWhen I look back on this World Series and let's not forget about the Dodgers who made it for the world series for a second straight season\nAnd lost happened\nIn two thousand eleven with the Detroit Tigers they lost back to back and the Dodgers just lost back to back and it's tough I don't know how this team is going to respond will they be able to get back for a third consecutive year that is a very very very\nTall task\nBut they were great and the regular season they were\nGreat in the post season the acquisition say let's not you know we talk about all the time [noise] uh the acquisition of\nTeams that win championships but let's talk about the acquisition of this team that did not win the championship you know getting David Freese was a huge move he was arguing their best player in this World Series\nNow Ryan ... who's been so good for them in the post season was not good in the world series that move to not pay off well in the world series to me this World Series changed\nWhen David Roberts hook out rich hill\nIn game for seven innings of justice gentler baseball on the mound for rich show the Dodgers had just taken all the momentum in that game after the ... home run\nAnd Dave Roberts decides to poll\nRich hill from the game\nWhen the Dodgers had a lead and Wayne rich hill\nDown it was that moment what I feel they lost the game because\nOnce the red Sox scored those runs\nTo me that changed everything it really did it changed everything and\nThis is what I mean by a manager having the freedom to do things their way and I don't know\nThe decision came from and I'm just going to say was a number of driven decision but rich show it thrown Ninety One pitch is\nOkay he\nSix and a third innings he was about to face to line up another time through at that moment\nMight have been smart numbers driven point way to bring in a relief pitcher\nGave the ah give the red Sox a different look about what happens Mitch moral and with the home run\nState and then the next inning steep here's the home run in the ninth inning the red Sox open the floodgates the game was lost and in my opinion the world series was the last one day robbers took ritual out in the seventh inning of game for\nBut he's been locked in for a while I'm very proud of him there's a lot of people that gave up on him throughout the season but we knew\nThat he was one of the best pitchers in the big leagues them he cares he wants to win finally he got his horses are about Steve Pearce the world series MVP from\nDay one I got to New York ... double what seems to be and um [noise]\nHas been great not only on appeal but in the clubhouse he's been a

a\nTeam and anytime you lose the last game when you're in the playoffs that's no fun but what's now your future what's the Dodgers I got three days now to think about all that stuff before uh before anything happened to them so there'll be an eventful three days for me and I'm trying to figure it out management shot to also\n\nGoing to hurt you know this could be a very different looking Dodgers team next season do they sign Manny Machado de do they lose claim commercial and does this team that won six great division titles three consecutive NFC as appearances to scrape\nTo the world series but yet they have not won that title Dave Roberts on next year\nGo back out there and then I expected to be back here next year but celebrating on the field but I think the culture of players the large majority are in place I think there's a lot of good things I think that some of what we're what we're doing what we've done a Barrows appointing certainly in the right direction\nWhat about ... future\nHis legacy that with the Dodgers than what he's done for the organization the fan base you know wearing his Jersey Clayton exemplifies what it is to be a Dodger and to be a man of character so whatever decision he made that is with him and his family\nBut for me to ah be on his team for for three years I've learned a tremendous amount from him\nWhat about the criticism that I'm sure he's heard it and I criticize them as well for those decisions that he's made in this post season and in this World Series specifically they Roberts on responding to that criticism\nI appreciate the interest in in our game in baseball and and so the insurance their opinions all that thing I think that that's a I kind of look at it as a good thing you know because if there's interest and people at the ... good for all of us um but I Do know that there's a lot of thought things that people aren't always privy to that decision I make\nYeah like taking ritual out when he's dealing in the seventh inning and you were clinging to a lead that you just all the momentum back because of the ... going on and you decide to take ritual out of the game\nAnd then and then in ... says that he was just trying to be a good teammate and respectful and you know he wasn't going to put up a fight and the robbers said well if you put up a fight over the capital of the game\nThat loss of the world series day Roberts and really did it last year the world series and and sometimes when the decisions workout you you're a genius when they don't work out for you you're the goat you have to take that as a manager that comes with the territory if Brian\nMentioned comes in and gets guys out and if not about another picture comes in and gets guys out and he's looking like a genius\nBut it's not the case

thank you so let's get out of the guess speaking of dignity or let's go to the guest outline right now and I'm sure a boy you know it it takes a strong man and a good man to come on the radio after what's been happening to us he put all this season\nIf the great John Jackson the former U.S the all American NFL player with the cardinals and the bears and now part of the U. S. C. broadcasting jak day what's up I thought you might be in hiding today so appreciate your coming on\nNo problems have I have been in hiding out for you just I just stick my head above water just\nAlive [laughter] well you know ... they played well enough to win the jak Sears did the freshman quarterback and then they look good but the ... you can't give up thirty eight points and get that down what was it twenty four to seven and a and give yourself a realistic chance to win even though they may come back [noise]\nYeah you know there's always the you know I mean you look at the right side of all these games are the charges have been losing any do you find some bright spots but the problem is is it the right spot changes from week to week and the and the things that are failing you change from week to week I mean you know to try to get off to a great start in that game where they get a return for a touchdown\nOK special things are going to be a major contributor and this one and then Arizona State answers where there's you know Seventeen or to Seventeen points which are like twenty four points showed it found themselves down by Seventeen then they make a great comeback to get back in it and then he took place at the end and just couldn't make the key plays a\nWin the game so it's frustrating because it seems like we can we can and week out their choice chasing their tail in terms of ...\nIn a couple of weeks ago was penalties they fixed that up then it was some special teams are you a big set up and it was often wasn't working and then they get there they had to they scored points on Saturday and then and now the defense of a problem so it just sort of a round Robin type of issue and it becomes really frustrating\nDone more to the U. S. C. broadcasting the form all American wide receiver USC an NFL player would they went through the NBC's once more sweeter dot com yellow rose Rose Bowl and it went over Penn State his first year back to world championship last year\nBut born born not acceptable intelligent land you know that they did you think clay held and can survive this if things don't get better by the end of the year\nSo I mean you know trust the the rules are out right now especially when you're not winning and the expectation is so high at USC every single year and you know they don't they don't years are not a possibility but I think there is some factors around this that you have to consider you know if I was Lynn Swann making this decision which I'm not but if I was making this decision\nThere are a lot of factors you have to consider in terms of how they got to the point um last year of course they had because of this except they had in the previous two years you know they say that they sent Sam Donaldson the pros Ronald Jones goes to the pros\nOf course they had some you know the on paper net all those guys leave early so you lose a lot of your office of guys on the opposite side of the machine green as well I Can't forget him so used for guys and leave the pros early\nSo therefore he started they were supposed to be your best players and then you show up this year and you said that he has his ear starts going on there I mean the deepest of players are dropping like flies\nI've never seen a teen have for captains named at the beginning of the season\nBy midway through three of the four captains are hurt and when they went up with a coin toss through before we're not even in uniform I mean that was it was amazing to me so the loss of camps man\nI'm Puerto cuts to the correspondent Margot tell didn't play those are three cats is only cast in it was in full uniform was telling Logan down the officer center\nIsn't you lose three guys on the defensive in a couple of days or injuries and some significant ones um and it's just too much to overcome form a team that it was talented but not but now you're losing your star power and when you lose that many stars which is hard to be great\nAnd you know one thing that's hard to take and difficult in mind coming from the sidelines and I think it was three different times yesterday they had to burn time outs 'cause there was confusing and they didn't get to play in on time or does that fall on the head go to the office of coordinator\nSo are you a little bit of a combination of both I mean I I think that you know one time they burned a time out over the decision whether to go for\nYeah for down um\nYou know that's a special team\nType of decision of course you wish that you have some idea what you're going to do\nBut you have burned a timeout like it you chose to go well at first they were going to keep the field goal\nAnd then they burned a time out to decide to put off his back on the field and go for it then you don't make it and then you burn out for me it was one thing because that you know sort of defeated the chance to take the lead or if they're still going to hide it or if they could've went up you know by four points\nUm that opportunity was gone and then you burned a timeout which at that time didn't seem like the worst thing in the world\nBut it ends up being a major problem because you can't get the clock stopped at the end of the game to get your audience when more opportunity\nYou know I Love the dishes in the Gulf War and I think we should have just not even thought about it and thought about the field goal it's just right away made a snap decision and gone for but I didn't like to play called kind of a slow developing run left in the defense time to break through and make a plan I loved it just isn't the Gulf War and I didn't like the political\nYou know it's interesting I've talked to you know of course several people a day and everybody I sort of got the cause of sort of fifty fifty on whether you go for it or not because\nYou're at home and so you think that the crowd going to be on your side these types of things you're in fought back from a Seventeen point deficit and you have the opportunity to tied the score and you know in in in play good football but you're exactly right clean ... monitor are clear message to this team\nAll year is gone then we're going to control our own destiny and we're going to go for it now go\nBack to the Stanford game before the half the children had similar situation they were ... of force in one situation they chose to go forward there\nAnd didn't make it as well and because they didn't make it they didn't they didn't make that that first down separate goes down their scores at the end of the happened that proved to be a major difference maker in that game so it seems like every time the tourism and pays for the fourth quarter to a port in one or\nTwo decision this year they chose that sometime they chose to go for some time they'd be elected the pun but each and every time that that when it comes back to that decision in the game being a ... in terms of how the outcome when\nYou think they say if they do decide to make a change would they do they go outside the family for a new coach here and I know a lot of the big donors in a lot of the old timers around here and it's all like to do things to USC way and and Lynn Swann is medical director now but\nInvest in better futures when when you went\nTo the un dot org slash invest a mind the jar will thing to waste a wonderful thing to invest\nService announcement ... by you know I\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\nLet me ask you know\nWe\nGive them another ... another downpour and on the bottom of the some of the running\nOut the red Sox nine hours away from winning the world series on me not only interesting date Robert Six out\nTo start or is the last two games who are throwing shut out late into the game in any any leads cursed out there into the seventh inning when he's given a foreign runs I\nGo figure basement and the days mission to BCS once with an embassy sports radio dot com back into the gas outlined a kind enough to hang on with us to talk to us from college football the great former all American at USC wide receiver NFL player with the cardinals and the parents of course and now part of the U. S. C. radio broadcasting to make John Jackson J. J. dragging it was\nYou had no problem but you know probably like I said I I'm come out and you are but I'm going to go back as soon as they're so\nIt's like my life but I live my life and your name and I'd hide out my only come in here to do the show\nYou know\nWhat a great year in the background of Washington loses the council yesterday twelve to ten or\nThey've got what three losses now Oregon loses at Arizona who's having a terrible year us She's born born UCLA so under five voters tamper loses against Washington state whom USCB is now getting into the top ten with one loss of what what year\nIt has\nBeen absolutely I I just had you scratch your head in terms of you know who's the best team\nEither ... that then\nTo our north or the patch works out I mean you know from a carpet standpoint I mean they're happy Rikers parity within a conference and all that kind of thing but from a national perspective\nThese types of upsets in if you don't really cause a problem for the carpet or the perception of the conflict in terms of you know not being as strong as people would think\nI think that what happens is in the past twelve there's a lot of teams that throw the ball a lot and you know when you look at just outlined um you know on these teams are in these days if you own a team report three hundred total yards of our friends\nThat can be considered a good defense of outing um you know Washington state will put five hundred yards on you in a minute um and so because of that I think that you know it it makes it for this exciting conference\nBut it gives the perception that we don't play defense and give it to protect perception is especially when these different types that happened we can and week out that certain teams are as strong as they are made up could be and they start to fall from the ranking so\nI'm overall I think it's great\nWith it the coverage believe it or not the Trojan still have a chance to make it to the actual championship game I went to Utah laws that of course they have to win the rest of their games which is going to be a challenge as well but\nUm it it it leaves a lot of teams in the raise the conference I think like say if they are competitive but I still I still like the old school days when it was as UCLA and Washington every single year [laughter]\nYou know you you are you played college football you played on the national football league ... you watch about as much college football with anybody over the years\n... Alabama goes undefeated this year they say I Do they go down maybe it's the greatest college football team of all time considering now for the first time in the same and they have a great quarterback and it's almost unfair with all those athletes they have all over the field to give them the best quarterback in college football with a Heisman Trophy winner\nAnd the thing is so surprising and then he developed into what people consider the best quarterback in college football and he hasn't even complete ... season ... as a starter that's with probably even more amazing\nI think in Alabama they they thrive off of a couple of things the first thing that I think is obviously there are good um and they you know they dominate recruiting wise\nI'm from that standpoint but then because of their conference which is a little bit different than the pack twelve right I mean in in a conference in there and there's a couple of things are really good but if your windows two or three days everything else seems like a cakewalk and they don't play a lot of tough it out of conference game that I think the pact will also the teams are sort of\nChallenging each other or challenging themselves to go outside the carpets I mean I see this year will plead Notre Dame outside the carpets\nI'm I'm a Texas of course I was at a conference so two teams that were in the top five at some point um up the season or on us he scheduled not to mention the teams that they have to play with in the conference so that that twelve while they're trying to pull to prove their metal and sort of show the nation how good they are\nThey're taking on a lot of teams out of conference and because of that it makes the entirety of the season is very tough to get up every day and we can work out\nWell one of course speeding UCLA or you know ... ... turns it into a ... a good season for us as always but you can ruin Notre Dame ... and you can knock them out of the final four and out of the national championship picture what House we would that be\n[noise] yeah well you know that's the one thing that you would see a sort of become accustomed to do I'm not written that fairly celebrating voting somebody else's ... because you always want to be in the conversation right because uh we always tease\nThey have the most significant when I was Thirteen and nine three that they label Thirteen and nine by the way when UCLA was able to be upset European and make them at the national championship\nSo I'll go work in that role of the upset you know trying to pull off it upset if that really gratifying fairly because they want to\nBe the one that is that the hunted and not being that you know where everybody's coming after you but you're right it's a unique situation this year we're trying to not Notre Dame out of the national championship and if\nThat were to happen I Would say I would celebrate about twenty four hours and then I'd go back to being upset\nThat I actually [laughter]\nBut I thought of an interesting scenario today with Alabama being so great obviously Alabama they could lose one here and don't get into the final four I think they've got more leeway and more padding in any team in the country even if they lose when they're still getting in but what about this\nWhat did they beat unless you might be coming up this Saturday they beat Auburn by fifty or they beat Georgia by fifty in the SEC championship game\nBut in a second to last game they lose to the citadel Jay Jay does that does that knock Alabama out\nWith a fishery knock him out I don't think\nIt's going to have it but yeah that would definitely knock them out I mean that's another benefit right I mean you know they they built up such cache deservedly so they've earned it um that if they lose the game they're doing a hug\nLimit when they're not for its\nThey're still in the hunt because their conferences perceived as those tough that\nTwo of the four teams if you're talking about last year or two of the four teams within the conference are going to get invited to act upon the final four to play for national championship and they were able to with it without winning their own conference which to me doesn't sound like a right way to go about things that okay that's our college football is doing it\nThese days and I don't it it just it it it's just unique how things happen um but like I said Alabama's everything they're getting in and tell somebody\nKnock them off you know they're looking down and everybody thinks that grade as always thanks for hanging in for a second segment\nDays anytime buddy I'll be back next week when he goes to a great one was willing to surface after an embarrassing loss he believes the lingo I tell you what one rule I make the final four though you have to when you're conference you know when you're conference you don't get in\nAbsolute the great can email us needs to do some of them that they weren't\nWilling to broader than I Am\nOne\nMajor on your

I think the brawn James his greatest\nAsset is always staying in the moment\nAnd sometimes you hear guys say say caused medically and generically that a little weight will will deal with that when we get to know the bronze is really staying in the moment and and I don't think they use even given in one thought because I think that he knows\nThat he has an innate ability that no other player that's ever played this game hats and that is he can take this guy and make the best of him let's be honest with the Golden State warriors to expendable contracts on that team\nThey don't really have to have played Thompson although he's a very good complement this up for and they do not\nReally have to have a dream on green although he is the he's the physical boom that that basketball team needs they do have to have Kevin ... and they do have to have Steph Curry and as long as they have those two pieces\nThe other pieces are interchangeable for the bronze brilliance is that\nWho ever the Lakers go after\nWho ever the Lakers bringing they won't just be a the best basketball player everybody thought they were wrong though was cancer\nThe bronze brings the man he's a different person they thought JR Smith was the cancer the bronze orchestrated that deal from New York and he got an NBA tired of the JR Smith\nHere are Smith doesn't it looked like a basketball player anymore she's like a shell of himself I mean I was talking to one of the ah security guards at the game last night\nAnd he was saying that he thinks the JR Smith made just walk away from basketball I don't believe that that's the case because he loves money too much he loved to party loves to drink all these other things that go along with being an NBA player but he checked\nAll the way out and all of that is because of the brawn James look interesting Tom since they give him an extended the long term contracts Tristan Thompson could have got their contract anyplace else who would have play called will fight\nThe Lakers play call will be called the brawn James now call we'll talk with an attractive that anybody else but he was the inspector\nThat went into the Lakers culture checked it out for a year when they signed

into the game ... or ... or so ago and I\nSaid it was can lead jets and\nSo now dancing is officially in the game and the Dodgers are down five to one top of the ninth inning now and the red Sox are looking to put the Dodgers a win win World Series championship and\nYou know and and I said before the series started to I like Boston and six and I just think that the American league it's so vastly superior to the national league and I joke you know and I say National League is AAA caliber baseball\nYeah you know obviously it's better than that but I think they are just a dramatic difference and I think clearly the red Sox the Yankees and the Astros are all better than the Dodgers and now you can make a case maybe the AIDS and the Indians to\n\nKnow who's back for the Dodgers next year assuming they lose this game and they're down five to one of the top of the night I I Would imagine clicking Chris I won't be back if proper some other teams uh you know disastrous again in the world series here\nGave up for runs in seven innings tonight after given up five runs in four innings in his first starting some of the world series you let me do the math of seven innings plus four is eleven and he gave up for private nine runs allowed earn in a limited and that is not going to get it done\nAnd he was really lucky he didn't give up more than four because of the red Sox in a whole bunch of balls right on the screws what a line drive right at Dodger field or is he he could have given up eight nine rods tonight\nAnd it's philosophy down now into the low nineties you stop throwing as hard as they used to I I'm not going unless he's willing to take a hometown discount I I'm not willing to go there but they were talking to three hundred million dollars again\nAt Thirty Years' old no somebody else wants to pay that they can have in my hometown discount maybe and I would imagine teams around baseball looking at the velocity and looking at the postseason performance aren't going to give them that kinda money either\nSo they don't get me wrong he's he's going to get a rich God right he's going to be making a whole bunch of money but I don't think unless somebody steps up who really wants him I don't think he's going to get any new anywhere near what he thought he was going to get\nThey get a guy like many Machado who uh I think it was kind of a disappointment with the Dodgers this year very good player in Baltimore\nUm and you know a scout I was reading a scout this morning saying you know he's a hell of a player I don't I don't think I Want him\nBecause he said himself\nBut I'm not the has linked up a guy I'm not the topic either\nBalls that's just not me he said that a couple of weeks ago\nAnd then you look good in game three hits a line drive off the field wall in the world series and he's standing there with monitoring his work\nAnd and because he thought it was going to be a whole model bounces off the wall and it winds up with a single eternity a double into a single\nAnd I was listening to the game on the radio I'm away from the way to work and uh and and Rick Monday was not at all happy and Rick Monday or the former major league baseball player and he's been part of the Dodgers radio broadcast here for years he he was you know he's an old school guy\nAnd he was just flabbergasted ... and you just know he was trying to keep himself under control and not completely lose his temper on the air but you said how can you not run hard how can you not play hard this is the world series for God's sake\nHe's sitting there on first base but he just went off to left field wall\nAnd then last night I remember that great play by ... the third baseman ... third baseman to Boston when it looked like it was going to go into the corner and maybe the Dodgers gonna run makes it nice stop throws the first in at least ... ran hard yeah three quarters of the way down the line\nBut you saw the last couple of steps he let up but the most incredible thing watching the replay was [noise] I I I Can't even say without laughing he blew a bubble with the ball because we had in his mouth\nTo think that you would care of that little about winning the world series that you wouldn't run out of all the hit off the left field wall\nAnd then as you are wanting to first you're blowing a bubble what is the most important player maybe the entire World Series wow\nThere's the Dodgers pull off a double play here so there's two outs and the night for the Boston Red Sox and who are three outs away from winning the world series now now do do they trust their closer tonight who has not been very good throughout the world to that or do you bring Kelly back out there that I think I think I might\nI I just don't know if I trust the closer the way he's been going for the red Sox\n\nNBC Sunday night game ... all over the Minnesota Vikings are thirty\nTwenty hours on the Vikings have gotten in touch down since we last checked but there's only a minute and Fifteen seconds to go and it looks like the St certainly are going to win this game because of turnover returned what what uh one fumbled they picked up a formal and read it all the way down the field and then score then returned an interception forty five years for a touchdown\nFor the same again a measure of revenge here against the Minnesota Vikings and speaking of the states we've got a caller on the line from the great city of New Orleans Pierre oh he's having a house party as well I guess what's up yeah you're on NBC Sports radio\n\n[noise] I don't have time\n[noise] [noise]\n[laughter] well there's my pre season Superbowl pick\nTheir New Orleans saints now the rams certainly have been the best team in football this year they know the states will be going to six and one after this when it was emitted nine seconds to go and the same syrup thirty to twenty Vikings have the ball and I know that sounds funny to say after after that miracle in Minneapolis last year when they pulled out thing out of the last second but\nWow can they go down and score in one minute without any time I get it on side kick and get a field goal scoring Ken ah\nWell after what happened last year when these two teams met in the ... I guess anything is possible\n\nSaints and patriots were my pre season Superbowl picking while the rams look great right now I'm having serious concerns about drawing McVeigh\nAnd I have been nothing but positive about him Ninety percent of the time I think he's been a breath of fresh air in the national football league I Love the fact that he attacks the ... just look at the difference between he and Jeff Fisher has to go to the rams just the immediate turn around\nThat I like everything about this guy and he's and he's not an old school guy and he doesn't coach the way a lot of these old fossils go to the NFL who are set in their ways and hardheaded except\nLast year he choked when the rams got to the playoffs now the first round home playoff game at the coliseum against the Atlanta Falcons and he went against everything he'd done all year last year he got conservative he played the field position game he punted and tried field goals what he should have gone forward on fourth and I'm like you don't really does\nAnd I think he felt the pressure and I think he choked in that game against the Atlanta Falcons okay you've talked at up to be in a first year coach he chalked it up to being an early thirties okay let's hope we learn from it\nOr beyond the four walls of the classroom\nTime to recognize the great things are happening in teaching\nI Know how you can make more\nParties I teach any I can [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nBoston Red Sox World Series champion twenty eight teams five to one game just ended they brought in Chris Sale to close the game out which I think gives me a pretty\nGood moves away ... missing lately sale closes about strikes out about how ironic that it was ... who strikes out in the game and indeed Dodger career most likely let's get up at the ballpark right now you know the great producer with NBC Sports we knew that it was ...\nAnd for me whenever I Believe in for those guys live ... stadium producer Garrett rent what's up Garrett\nLive right here the weather is setting up ... percent I'm Out of the ACLU thinks so\nAre you on the field\nI Am not quite there yet that they will not allow other music rather than people to get on there and they're done with a trophy ceremony dinner that happens then the golden arch of all the others thousand of us get to go on the field so well wait it out for a little bit\nPlug in a hundred and eight wins World Series championship in five games where does this Red Sox team stacked up along the great teams of all time\nIs red socks to enroll likely but I don't know if that's the greatest of all time people and saying how like the American league was actually the American league east anyway I Believe they combine thirty two and a dance an Orioles and the shooter so\nYeah I don't know I didn't have an inflated wins on the front of the\nActual season but you know they back to the other day pretty much dominated the Dodgers most of the series they dominated the Astros so they seem to be so many ways you know\nWhat you know not exactly the right number but you know they they capitalized they didn't have to practice\nBut this might be you know this might be the worst job of managing in a real serious ... by day Robert would you agree with it\nWell on top of all we talked about ... sale and people are going to play it Ninety One catches some people said that hill almost ... told him that he wanted to come out that he resign of gas but\nBut the bigger point to me that he couldn't quite tell all insurers flash shock leaders and others were three of the five gay guys don't get to the same day that'd be the it'll last theories and then from the bench\nFor three and a five game so yeah I mean I don't care workers are in the world series they play about lawyers and he didn't do that\nI think there's a lot of 'cause he said in a situation happened tonight what they have\nTheir place could have easily bring young and the fifth or sixth one and one of the one Ron tutor one or three to one lead Alex or let him say on this and see what happened to retire Fifteen straight guys and comes up so\nYou know it's amazing to me it's amazing uh Robert removed two pictures in a row who are pitching shut out late into the game in in in in in ... in in retail and then tonight he leaves gross out there and for the San Francisco to give up or run\nI don't know what I saw it scared scared because I took it out first shot right after what happened last night so [noise]\nYeah I I when you're talking about in the ... as well how long have you on the bottom of the order add some a couple of batting at that point and maybe let them go and then it was like jazz or after that [noise] so I'm a little bit of leeway but [noise]\nI yeah I can definitely see why she goes well\nWell you think I'm Dave Dave Roberts Clayton occur so in many risotto where they all gone you think they won't be back next year [noise]\nMuch shorter there's no way he comes back and play with Justin Turner and then coming back now so he's gone most likely I'm here in Philly tribes or Yankees out or exactly fits in with the Yankees either but the regimes\nThat ruin it I think personally I don't come back [noise] he wants to play their\nOther than maybe the Texas Rangers all open the pocket book form whether or not I I I Can't say I'm leaving\nWell he's throwing them alone having these days he sold in the low nineties now he's going to have to take a discount nobody's going to hundred million on a thirty year old or so and Ninety miles an hour anymore\nYeah I mean that wasn't a second and third anywhere talking about that as well I mean it was Ninety Ninety One topped out at and you know even just a year or two ago he was in Ninety seven Ninety eight\nOr so central proud owners in late in the air as long as she's already sat in a while to share and get gas all that or [noise] or what do you do yeah but we look at your stakeholders to LA and watch and right now is Dr phil\nAnd I I'd say it's whether you get thirty five million dollars a year\nWho knows maybe someone else pointed at us but\nUm I Can't see it what was the percentage of Red Sox fans in the ballpark it sounded like there were a lot of them and they were very loud [noise]\nThey want to concentrate it I'll give them that they got a couple of different sections rather or be able to entire\nTo pull out there is some of them are incredibly loud\nI thought more definitely more than any other game of the three that they were here in LA and it's a more than the course of rulers ... theories do they do not believe that my hair and when that jak elite early why they were on their face last night\nBut you know we've got breaking news here in the Boston Red Sox have announced their championship bakery parade and they've also announced that the grand marshal and the ... will be day Robert so we get bigger [noise]\nOur mayor I didn't get as much as well and yeah they do operate in a hurry up\nAnd got to be there and then it got to be parents right with the three home runs\nWe thought that we thought it was for what we really only a few games he really did nothing and then once you're in a hurry\nAnd the way that the advice that I looked at him now so I I didn't talk to you can go in and buy the price of comments and I was actually a bigger name he's had a bad reputation I'm never looking around the author nannies turn that around that\nI could see the U.S will\nNot run into Lebanon ... and the real serious workers saw a wow what can you say All right great stuff Garret thanks for the check in\nA

people that don't know [noise]\nKnow you you need a scapegoat sometimes now he's going to take a lot of heat for the decision that he made yesterday I think absolutely rightfully so um but yeah it's kind of\nIt's it's the way that baseball's working now if you don't win it's what what have you done for me lately you know two World Series appearances is impressive but this was a franchise that hasn't\nWon a title since Nineteen eighty eight they desperately wanted title ... you mean you're there in LA you know that more than I Do um so I I think\nI I think they're going to take a long hard look at getting rid of them and you know this is an ownership that doesn't shy away from paying money so you know do they go out and get a guy like Joe Jr already to come to LA and he's the guy who's already won a World Series I I think that would make some sense\nThat people are already talking about my social as well although I I think I Would I Would prefer Gerard yeah I think it was and I think maybe his time has passed so ...\nI mean he's he's he's a hall of fame manager if\nStay with the angels I mean that was a a nothing franchise when he got there and and for him to do what he did and and to sustain that success for as long as he did a certainly he he's a hall of famer but uh yeah I if I'm the Dodgers I he wouldn't be number one on my list\nOh you're part of the navy broadcast team they played Notre Dame yesterday or how good do you think there's Notre Dame team is final four caliber and can they survive a loss and still get in\nI'll answer the second question first I don't think so um unless I mean look we're going to see the first rankings unveiled a on Tuesday night Notre Dame is going to be in the top three I Would assume there'll be number three um they do have a great when\nFrom maybe the best when right now in the country up there with Ellis used went over Georgia\nI mean the beat Michigan to start the season that wind just keeps getting better and better\nUm I I Do think this team is legit uh I really do and and\nYou know on the side I'm actually a Notre Dame fan grew up in a Notre Dame household so yesterday was kind of a a unique experience is the third time I've been a part of a Notre Dame navy broadcast the Navy's broadcast team\nBut Notre Dame was twenty seven and a half so I didn't really have to worry about you know hiding my allegiances all that much but ah I really don't think they can survive a loss because you look at what's remaining for Notre Dame are northwestern had an ice went over Wisconsin but they're still on rank uh Syracuse likely will be eight and see when they play each other on November seventeenth\nAt Yankee Stadium but you know you're talking about an eleven and want football team with a good went over Michigan or the rest of the resume wouldn't be really be that sexy you would still be you know nine wins overpower five teams if they were to stumble wants and have eleven wins\nA stand for losing to Washington state certainly did them no favors yesterday we know how much this committee or appreciates and when it comes down to a a tie breaker they\nTend to lean in favor of a conference champion what would be very interesting Davis let's say Notre Dame is eleven and one let's say Alabama's in it at at Thirteen and no ah clams and is then a Thirteen and no and then Michigan is there at twelve and one\nUm I think Michigan would get in in that scenario over Notre\nDame well that was my next question to you you would think well Notre Dame beat them head to head there and but they don't that's not how the system works in college football no Michigan's played a better schedule and as accomplished more in law said to head\nYeah Michigan ends up twelve and want to figure it out if it comes down to Notre Dame and Michigan at Michigan at twelve and won it gets in over Notre Dame um you have that\nThat extra data point that they always throw in your face but you know if Michigan where to get in you know look at they're looking at their body of work their loan loss will be on the road week one against Notre Dame so ah their loss would be better than Notre Dame loss whether it be to northwestern Florida State Syracuse or USC so with Michigan did\nLosing again would be far superior uh the Notre Dame they have an extra when they have a conference championship in this scenario and they have a window for Ohio State on the road they have a winner over Penn State they have a a win over Michigan or started Wisconsin an impressive fashion who's sitting\nAt a ... and then the big tent championship game which\nIs you know it might not be a huge I mean looking at what's going to come out of the west David it doesn't look great northwestern right now leads the western division Wisconsin's over there they just lost the northwestern Iowa certainly could get in there they lost the Penn State over the weekend but still be a quality opponent and you're a conference champions\n... even if I'm going to undefeated Michigan's in if they went up ... wins out there and no matter what any pirate us a hundred percent\nAnd Alabama goes undefeated here I'm Tim I think that eliminates LSU that eliminates Kentucky that eliminates Georgia and Florida was already eliminated yesterday because they have Alabama goes undefeated they would be all hopefully they'll have to last and so that eliminates all of them I think Alabama is is so great and it looked unbeatable all year but\nYou look at Clemson to wait forever Lawrence was playing right now and with that defensive front seven they're all NFL players I think that's the one team that could be the Alabama\nYeah I've been really impressed by Columbus and I said at a couple of weeks ago leading up to that NC State came I felt like they were going to come out and just obliterate them\nAnd prove that they cause there were a lot of skeptics after that Syracuse scammed people were you know questionable questioning whether or not this Clemson team was for real they had a bit of a a a stepping up their toe but we're able to prevail against Syracuse and right now boy it seems like this team is just all full go right now\nAnd uh yeah this I mean ... and Dave you mentioned Notre Dame if they if they have lost it can they survive it I\nThink Clemson if they lose the game that I don't know if they're going to survive that and wet and says I\nJust think about what their body of work is Boston College beating Miami was helpful because they go to Boston College and a couple of weeks but who are they going to

Series champion Boston Red Sox five games over the Dodgers\nAnd the Dodgers are lucky they weren't sweat because I think Boston is just so clearly a superior team\nTo the doctors and they proved that over the course of an entire season not only did they win a hundred\nAnd eight games they did it in a superior league the national league compared to the American league gives ah is is more than a cut below\nAnd I made the point earlier in the show I think without question the red Sox the Yankees and the Astros were all better teams and the Dodgers than I Would make the case I think the ... and the Indians are too I I Would say there's five teams in the American league better than the Dodgers\nInferior league throw the doctors into the American league they might not make the playoffs in fact I don't think they would\nWhich is why I'm a proponent of seating and all sports basketball baseball and football pick the best teams in the morning to twelve one through sixteen whatever it is and let's go ... are we not going to watch the world series depicts the Yankees against the red Sox were not going to watch because they're both American League teams I I think that would be great\nWhat's wrong with feeding the playoff team why is that they have to be national against Americans like especially now that we have so much sooner league play\nIs kind of diluted the whole American nationally thing isn't it\nAn NBC Sunday Night Football Goodwin for the saints then they go to six in one gain a little bit of a measure up debris bans over that the playoffs last ... last either saints or again my my pre season to get to the super bowl to play the New England patriots excuse me looking better and better I'm getting so excited I'm losing my breath here\nLet's get out of the guest hotline let's go to our good friend from NBC Sports bay area he is the warriors insider he's debate or insider it's our good print money Paul what's up money\nYes sir how you doing I'm good well another another good went for the lawyers the day you're going to six in one over the net so what seven three is the first step today and thirty five points and the lawyers of course ruling again and and without question the heavy favorite to win another NBA championship\nYeah and they look like a they they're they're mean business this year last year they have kind of a multi start may have had some moments this year where they looked a little off but uh on this road trip I thought this was a chance to them to get well er and against the mix um they were close for three quarters and Ben Kevin ... takes over the course twenty five\nIn the fourth quarter in law away the next and then tonight they just get on a kind of an all around team effort to have a big lead and then of course that will never quit\nA that's their style to come back to make it closed down the stretch but the water's just have too much Katie and too much Steph Curry and put them to come back off\nAnd the Knicks fans cheering for Kevin ... and certainly for him to be a Nick much like they did with LeBron a couple of years ago but I Can't imagine any scenario I mean if he's gonna leave it's not going to be for that to that disaster of an organization the New York Knicks\nI wouldn't think so but I Can't dismiss it because uh one million Kevin and and the fact that\nUm you know he's had so much success with the warriors they've won two championships with families want me a a fire was MVP both times or if they win it again and he wins the pilots every third time a part of me wonders if people want a new challenge\nAnd I don't know if there's a bigger challenge out there than trying to resurrect the mix especially given that ownership situation it's just not healthy at the same time or they have a very attractive coaching they would face they'll players love him\nA and Kevin's business partner rich climbing is a long time to expand who dreams or some day running an extra front office uh so you know I mean some are mentally I I think it has to consider that even though there is no way on earth he could go there and make that much I can kind of in the next year or two\nSo it wouldn't seem and have to sell the team for him to consider going there who want to play for him\nThat the ... that's that's what would it take their ownership is the issue there yeah I think we've covered has\nLearned one thing but the warriors it is that ownership matters\nUm I mean this the the worst ... car ownership is taking his team to places where previous callers ships have note that just wouldn't do it couldn't do it wouldn't do it and um I think that's something that can be appreciated by my MBA veteran player like that and he he was described it to me is the warriors brings a place where you graduate from all the other NBA teams out there\nUm yes it do I think you'll go to New York no I don't but I\nCan't dismiss it just because I think part of him might get restless and just want a new challenge is something he's or explorer at heart and I wouldn't be surprised at some in some place else I kind of looks it looks like a place to go where you can discover something new about himself I wouldn't be surprised\nWhat about the Lakers joining liberal and if he wants to channel I I guess if he wants to be the most hated player an MBA history maybe that would be a good choice for them but you think you would consider that\nNo he said that when he said that one down already and uh I I don't know I don't think that's going to happen um\nYou know that that rumor has come up a new for numerous reasons numerous times now he bought a twelve million dollar mansion down there in Malibu and\nUm that's that's what it is that's really where they pick up steam it's like oh Katy wants to live in LA and play with Macron's yeah um you know I Know not necessarily I I I don't think he'll do that now uh\nIf if somebody said if he's going to go to New York or LA which one do you think he'll go to oddly enough I think ... and you go to New York before you go to LA not that I'm saying is going to go to either one\nAnd you know moving out here means nothing to ... you know this money you know Malibu colony down there all those houses on the beach is like Gucci rolling it's every MBA player on every team in the league has a house there is one after another and when you go down it demeans nothing when they buy a house they're\nExactly a lot of guys spend our summers in LA yeah and as much time with a can so\nIt's not that unusual for that to happen but when it happened and people heard about it like oh my goodness he thinking about going to LA not necessarily that what about the clippers are well you know what anything is possible because he will become a free agent in July you've got to opt out\nAnd he's got to figure out what he wants to play and he may stay with the wars but he may go elsewhere so what do we we will have to play out because he is not just in his head at all so far\nHow close are we do to mark his cousins playing\nOr the water's not putting a timeline on it but based on where he is I Would expect to see him some time [noise] trying to pick a month I'd say December um I think he's getting he's coming along uh I Do think he'll be playing before the end of the calendar year so\nUh my earlier prediction which was about six weeks ago I said that Christmas Day um maybe a little before that now it's possible uh he's coming along and progressing lightly and we're still you know two months away from Christmas so uh I Would think that he will be packed scene with the team some time in November\nAnd depending on how that goes on the court with a team in games in December\nProbably playing limited minutes you know restriction Eighteen twenty minutes a night or even maybe left to start with until he gets up to conditioning in gang condition what should I take I take another month or so so you may not see the best of him until after the after the\nNew year no joy will be back before then ...\nJoining us here from NBC Sports betting or even days with the ... the ... the warriors inside and of course they are in sign up for all sports\nYou know do a lake of the owner who is a multi billionaire he can certainly afford it but what I Do need probably he said he wants to keep this team together he wants to bring everybody back when contracts are up and he doesn't care three hundred million four hundred million dollar payroll whatever he wants to keep winning and keep the team together a\nTo read it like to walk to school at

three two three four NBC or heavy up on Twitter at Dave sports got all up and down the NBC Sports radio network Red Sox and five for the world series championship in the last Fifteen Years for the red Sox boy it seems like yesterday doesn't that we were talking about the curse of the band but you know\nAnd one of the most snake bit and devastated franchise in baseball history\nWith the curve for the man but you know hitting them in Nineteen Nineteen when the order sell sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees to to finance no no Nanette a Broadway play he was backing and then the Yankees went on to win what twenty six World Series\nA and the red Sox didn't win any after the eggs into the ban but you know and then finally in two thousand four of the course was broken and now for on the last Fifteen Years they've gone from the most current team in major league baseball along with the cubs\nTo being the best franchise the model in baseball you look at us this young Red Sox team ... they're going to be the favorite to win it again next year\nAlong with the Astros along with the Yankees and eat it and you know the Yankees are going to add some players in the off season where the money they throw around the Dodgers should be good again depending on if they get a new manager and\nWhether they bring back with shot out whether Clinton criticized back we'll see but I don't think we're going to see the Dodgers again in the world series next year I think this is I think they pretty much a less they get a competent manager now I might change my mind that when you look at the all time meltdowns and major league baseball history\nI mean how bad is there's a one man being out managed by another of debt robbers being out managed to start to finish by\nAlex Cora ... and you know no no you know I'm getting old\nI remember when I was corals a rookie playing with the Dodgers I think I was the first one ever to interview in the dugout at Dodger Stadium when I was doing the pre and post game to the free both came Dodger talk on a on a local station here and I was I was I was the first one ever to interview Adrian ... remember they brought him up for the minor leagues this young kid from the Dominican Republic\nNineteen years old sitting on the best I said wow look at that guy Nineteen he was like six one six to about two hundred and thirty pounds a solid rock solid muscle said wow that that gives them an child right there\nHe didn't speak one word of English and now he's blue and that was it was great but I had to sit down I was the first one ever to interview him I sat down in the dugout and I had a translator with me not nice skin I said but it's going to do something and he's had a great career you know knocking on the door or five hundred home runs\n\nBut David Robertson mysteries when you look at how we handle that pitching staff or ... when you look at the the nonsensical moved here in games three and four every move pictures throwing shut out with a lead late in the game\nGame three Walker bealer up one to nothing as a to hit shutout going with seven strike apps\nAnd he was still throwing a hundred miles an hour and he got the red Sox out one two or three in the seventh inning with to strike outs but we have to take him out because uh uh it it almost kills me to say the least is a pitch count\nAnd game for takes out ... pushing the shut out with one out in the sand but then again tonight at least ... and with four runs allowed into the ... nothing you did make sense All right so I'm going to give you one more chance here we've got a caller on the\nLine from Los Angeles we'd been hit with his house party from New Orleans now fill up your properly screened the call I Know a Los Angeles accent being a native okay and he wants to talk about

themselves off as\nBoston and Los Angeles on these characters get on the phone and started screaming I think they use those fake telephone number of things you know when you get a\nCall from

not take any more calls would still say every part of the country is to ... he's who that drunk celebrating that New Orleans saints victory tonight [laughter] I\nBetter be a legitimate call here bill

what he said that about a few people but but it was really interesting\nIndividual and really someone in my life is really a help develop really into the person that I Am today\nYou know almost everybody I've interviewed ... ... that's probably the best team in the history of the NFL but almost all the players like they had on over the years say a ... that they think they should have won three or four maybe more would that team and they kind of under the\nWell it's unfortunate I kind of goes to show what can happen would have something great but not all of a leadership pieces that better place really see eye to eye and I think a buddy vying posts because it's so very similar in their coaches alive but at the same kind\nOf very difficult time kind of seeing eye to eye and then

I think the greatest thing about this opportunity years I I have a chance to go out and acquire the coaches that I really want to work that I really feel that can come together and and create the college degree environment to kind of culture that I Want to be you know all of their decisions up to their head coach to make\nAnd so these are bringing in the kind of funny that you want to kind of talent water and so being able to deal with on the ground up I'm throwing tree in so excited about that because that's one thing I I think uh being able to have your hands in on the pulse of everything that moved\nThere are no excuse me so very excited about that opportunity\nYou gonna run the forty six defense that was pretty successful when he played you gonna run that in the way up to the ... you know I'm\nI'm I'm sure I'm going to run in some ways because you know a lot of people talk about well that would work today I well I'm not sure I I don't think a lot of people where you do what they're doing when they are looking forward to succeed but you just might see it it just never know\nWhat's funny about the the XFL is coming back and now we're going to have two leagues to professional leagues besides the national football league coming up next year or two\nWell it'll be interesting I think that or the alliance week is just a matter of putting all of the programs out there and do all the players have quality teams and and just kind of thing or what happened\nAnd you couldn't have better people running this league as well with Bill ... one of the guys in ... and then a team of advisors were former National Football league stars\nAre absolutely I mean you mentioned the name of your on your that\nRight away grab a lot of people attention because the class guy will be tremendous GM for many years there in Indianapolis Colts buffalo and I I just think that gay came the cave that left the cost to deal with and Charlie embrace all have a a tremendous reputation for being a\nGreat businessman so I'm very excited to be a part of it and uh some of the games that are a part of the organization is you're ... you're satisfied\nBut you know what I'm saying but I I think about you might when I watch the NFL's on the way it's played now you can't hit the quarterback anymore you can't hit receivers going down field or\nAre you you you can't hit 'em all around the knees you can't hit them high [laughter] they might throw you out of the league if you came back to you you might have had to find a different way to make a living and get a new job\nYeah you know sometimes it looks that way but I I think we'll we'll figure it all out and I think they're taken some steps in the right direction or we just have to kind of figure out exactly where we're trying to go with it but I I think they're going in the right direction\nAbsolutely I mean you see like a lot of the guys from your your end before who are suffering a long term health issues is absolutely the right thing to do\nAbsolutely yes you're you're exactly right is just a you know their their health or the players should be the most important things should be saying that we

looking at a she's do we have too many cars do we have too many vehicles in the county\nOr do we not have enough or do we have too many how many do we need we can now go that fund and and if with the executive committees authorities say we need to hire a X Y Z company because they can come in and tell us what we're doing as far as equals is it is it sufficient for us is it cost effective force because\nWe're not really good at looking at ourselves very accurately we we can say we do internal studies and things like that but you know what we tend to be\nPretty subjective and not very objective and so even if you have another department come and look at you sometimes that's not that's probably a little bit skewed so to have someone come out with a\nFresh set of eyes so to speak on something that you think is necessary I think that's that's a good endeavor and so the executive committed to\nSecond lead the other fund is going to be for a renewable and sustainable energies\nAnd I think that's critical uh for the county there's very few areas where we can really project\nCrude savings or a a good sufficiency savings doodle efficiencies and I think that that's an area a that can

that's what we're here every weekend for to learn\nThe are happier and have more vitality\nThat's what we are all about education we're not telling you what to do we're not tell me to go off your drugs we hate that you're on drugs because drugs to really do work\nYes they do kids so they can save lives but they really don't work in a majority of the cases and so many people are just relying on drugs to be healthy drugs don't make us healthy\nOnly food and nutrition that we get on a daily basis makes the difference bad food bad diet that help\nGood food good diets creates good health that's the bottom line\nAnd of course you're going to add to dietary supplements because they can fill the gap for things that are missing when we don't get the right food or even if the right food may not have all the nutrients we can fill in the gap with good dietary foods governments and then natural medicine\nYes they can take the place of drugs many natural medicine them more effective than the drugs that are used by the same education and they don't have the\nSo when you choose the natural remedy emits well made well designed and it follows the guy to dump the scientific site as clinical studies you will have a great product and it's worth thinking out those products to make sure that you have the right product\nTo do the right healing and restoration so we're here just share information not to tell you what to do\nAnd always when you decide to make changes talk to your doctor if you're on drugs I'm not recommending you go off your drugs until you talk to your doctor\nOnce you start digging a natural remedy take it for three or four weeks along with your drug and then talk to your doctor about reading yourself off the medication or going off the medication as he directed or she directs so we're here to\nShare information and we have lots of good information to share with you today we're going to talk about a special\nSubstance that naturally produced in our body\nAnd seemed to diminish overtime to the aging process and then we may supplement but there is very powerful anti accident has called looted by own\nThat's a multiple will come back and talk about that in a moment we'll talk about I've listened to his question about puppy swollen hands\nAnd what about the twelve for infant brain development and the nutrients out of the day lemon balm\nB. A. L. L. lemon balm vitamin D for headaches and much more free rarely get to all of our topics for the day so let's start off with\nLooted by on Jeannie like George L. U. T. like Tom eighty like Tom H. I. O. N. E. looted by on what is it\nIs a very powerful anti accidents\nYou had a very powerful detox Blair the body and our body makes that under a good conditions\nThe body can make two anti accidents\nThe rest must be obtained through the diet soda me food like lots of fruits and vegetables nuts and seeds and berries they all contain anti opposite ends as well as do spices like Kirk human or\n... or grape seed extract bills are very powerful at opposite ends and we can add one more to that and that is olive oil ivy olive leaf fruit or olive oil the all contain very powerful anti accidents\nBut there are two that the body makes one is super oxide this new tastes that's an enzyme and the other one is going to lie on\nNow what they do for us to neutralize free radicals\nFree radicals are component\nAre made in our body like rust on metal and steal\nIron rust cars rust belt that is free radical damage to our body raw out kind of silly to say that it really isn't that interesting process but it's a process similar to that that our body wears out\nRadical damage than these three radicals come from a variety of areas\nEnvironment son chemicals exposure to pesticides pollution and the poor diet\nSmoking\nThat's why the body is destroyed by over excessively\nAre lower I sell it to be exposed to pesticides chemicals preservatives excessive son nuts on we need sun but excessive son excessive alcohol smoking all of these habits\nAre causing free radical damage so we have instilled in our body it compounds calls looted by on to override the free radical damage\nBut two things happen blues violent is somehow over diminished where over time we do not make enough of it and\nThrough the aging process we make less and maybe we are just overwhelmed\nBy free radical damage from smoking excessive alcohol son chemical pesticides we have more of these components in our environment today than ever before so now we are at a point where the glue by on can't really do its job because we are overloading the system\nIn fact by age sixty five\nWe have up to fifty percent laugh how the active biologically form of good with my own no maybe this isn't something you've\nHeard before because good phone is not a I don't see too many people walking into a store and asking to buy oh I'd like to do it by on\n\nSo maybe you're the first to learn about it because it's not like oh I Need more vitamin C. I Need more vitamin E. or I Need more ... more date\nThe subject of good by on is so critical\nThat we can't live without it and here are some other factors which reduce the levels don't we don't know if the diseases\nThat we have reduced a little bit by own or we have more diseases because we have reduced violence\nBut disease definitely reduces the level poor nutrition you are what you eat\nWe need to eat a diet that includes all the vitamins and minerals emphasis on anti Oxford's anti inflammatory compound\nAnd we can look and live better throughout our life it depends what\nYour priorities are is that for me to say what your priorities are\nMaybe you prefer to rent a lot of smoke a lot and any fast food wrapped in fast food restaurants and eat the garbage and drink a lot of soft drink do all the things that are counter productive but I've got a feeling that if you're listening in this program you're listening to be healthier and better\nSo I think I'm speaking to the right audience I think you want to know how to do that\nSo changing your diet and adding more documents and especially it goes by on levels has a tremendous impact do disease poor nutrition and any toxins\nChemicals preservatives\nOr pollution also decrease in ... levels infections used up a lot of your levels of violence trauma drug especially as the ... which is Tylenol\nAnd that's why Tylenol in the number one cause of liver failure in the U.S\nOne study found that children with autism\nHave only sixty percent active vilify on and forty percent in the inactive\nWhen children of that age should have Ninety eight percent packed up and only ... percent inactive the one hand cause children with autism to have a low\nLevel of brutal violence\nYou can restore it if you have a low level we can rebuild it that's the nice part of our body you know I Believe that no matter how old you are\nWhat do you have gone through how you feel and what diseases you are fighting there is hope\nYou can change that around if you have have you fired to change it\nThat are willing to sacrifice and what I see a sacrifice I don't believe that the sacrifice but for some people is going to feel like a sacrifice\nBecause you're going to have to give up the way you live today because obviously if you're not well what you're doing isn't working and you can expect to do the same things over and over again and expect better results\nSo you can't continue to eat what you're eating and living that lifestyle you're living and expect to get better you have to make changes\nNow those changes may feel like sacrificing because all you don't want to give up\nThose ... those the desert\nYou don't want to give up drinking and smoking and party you don't want to give up a lifetime of joy but when you are hurting enough\nThen you may get the idea that hey it's time to change but don't wait too long now I Believe every case can be improved dramatically but the longer you wait the harder it yeah\nSo at the first sign you're not feeling well and you start getting a few aches and pains don't wait until you have many aches and pains\nTo make the change some people need to have the hammer fall on their head before they began to say oh I've got to do something but remember\nAll people think that all the all they need to do is go down and get a drug and their problems are solved drugs do not solve problems in fact most drug bringing on other problems then have to be dealt with other drugs\nI'm sick and tired of being on drugs then change your weight\nChange your diet change your lifestyle give up the things you are doing that maybe injure yourself cellular wise damage your cell and make some big changes\nSo Al Gore go to restore ... levels\nWe can do that\nBut the difficulty was supplemental blues high on is that breaks down rapidly we're taking or early\n\nSo the only effective way to get booted lie on it as active form went to heaven injected if you've ever seen any YouTube\nVideos where doctors have treated patients with Parkinson's disease\nOr MS and they have shown them before injections of good by on and then after they've injected them as little as ... it's amazing almost look like it's not true like the video has been doctored up\nBut injections are inconvenient very expensive up to a thousand dollars a treatment and sometimes they may need one or two treatments a month\nAnd not all doctors make it available\nBut now new research has shown a way and found a way to stabilize ... so that it remain active form it's biologically active form\nTo use or early ... in fact a group of French researchers discovered a stabilized form of good by on which they have\nPatented as a stable oral form of violence a tablet that adult than them out\n\nAnd showed

H. O. [noise] we read what's happening with the Green Bay Packers what we can expect from reading your own an upcoming predictions of some of the action with the NFL the Green Bay Packers Monday morning quarterback is probably you buy\nReal heating pulling Islamic [noise]\nFantasize down is Monday morning quarterback kills your whole bike\nGood morning every one or a depressing a little bit of mourning after the Packers\nA car I should have won that football game yesterday they\nShut up they should have one and I think they wonder if\nYou get your ticket or fall goes I Love to hear your opinion someone five four to four twenty six hundred Apollo Thirteen twenty on to us all your phone\nI'm Sorry in a situation like that you have the highest played player in the NFL is your quarterback argue will be the one of the best all time come from behind quarterbacks in the NFL who's brought you back to when how many games with more hail Marys than any player ever that I Know of I mean I don't think they would have needed a hill and I agree\nThey had plenty of time right both the special teams coach and coach McCarthy should have grabbed the Montgomery and said that's what you do not take do not bring the ball out of the un so it must have short because we'll have two minutes ... seconds left\nRepeat this back to me that's what they did they go home now and I told them that that's that that's the whole thing maybe they need to bring Trump over there and just for one thing to say to Montgomery you're fired or I mean um how do you how do you pay that kind of money\nAnd make that mistake because the Packer I mean quite honestly the way the league is set up with how many times the Packers get blocks in the back some returns\nYou are much better off on average to take a knee in the end zone because you get the dog on the ball and then to find a yard line you're not going to have anybody get hurt you're not going to have all this stuff you're not going to turn over is that going to get a block in the back so we got it on a ten yard line\nThat's a that's what and if you were listening to the sports this morning and that's what ... said that was the game plan they ever they huddled up and they said listen take a knee and they were going into our\nThat was the name before the game was that they may that somebody get in his face just for that one yes yes so\nThey told them so they told him taking don't take it out at the end zone so what's his excuse it in a well we'll get to the guy that has a cut on that but a bleacher report does know a little bit of bought an hour ago was this story a Aaron Rogers was reportedly at\nThat time a gum right after the game yesterday a mutt um let's see here\nBaron was hot and it's in poor taste a Packers coach told Mike Silver at NFL dot com and he had a right to be he yelled pick up on me it was very very mad\nKnow I mean really the starting point is this is number one way or healthy so I mean the fact of having [noise] you know everybody there for for the whole week of preparation so you're able to get it out of your different [noise]\nAlways internally based on what\nWe think who's going to line up from the forty six so and then you prepare for ... for the other team so it's a so that's that's really you know\nAre products of that I mean there's creativity aspect of it I mean\nYou know not just with the all seasons for the call we got a lot of scheme free food places left with no one's going to do what you want to\nMake sure your players a chance we successful so that's why when you move those guys around up so\nWho's healthy and then what you think they're going to the\nGame so\nHe sounds unusual yeah and uh he sweat it rather than aids\nHe sounds very upset okay we got a caller\nCelebrity look let's go to the call and then we can talk about McCarthy thanks for calling your on Monday morning quarterback\nWith the boys are just Manhattan yeah it is on the Packers odds of winning the super bowl are up while playing the\nWay they are they're doing really well\n[noise] um what was your take on what happened Sunday night\nI'd rather not reciprocate on that\nThey should have played better Viking should've played better but it's good to see everything back on the field first and foremost you know after the mental health issues or not\nThat it's good to see him back on the field um especially a A R D and he's a he's a little jolt hopefully he's a guy [noise] but uh the Packers play one hell of a game I Will say that [noise]\nWell I I don't know if I'd say one how they played a pretty good game um you know and I I it's a game they should have one I think and I think the ... the the rams fans were elated and when that turnover happened 'cause they were they know Aaron Rodgers they know how he can move the ball\nAnd how many games he's done this and they were when that turnover happened that they knew the game was over\nAnd uh you know there again\nAnd talk ...\nTalk about you know smart plane we're talking about stupid play but purely instead of going in and scoring like you could ask\nYeah I don't know that he could is going to games and then you're up to score\nAnd you know you still he says yeah we're going to give the ball back to number twelve yeah\nYeah yeah you know smart you know the game's over there\nAt the end of the game you want to get the ... if you want to get the ball to number and you know I'm a Vikings fan but I I Know a real football and it was it was fun listening to it on the radio quite honestly and\nWhat did Wayne Larrivee and alert McCarron said when Montgomery even before he fumbled the oh what the hell are you doing\n[laughter] yeah I think they think they\nI I Will then the whole Packer nation because as soon as I saw bringing out I'm like what the hell is he doing those exact words\nIn a way what [laughter] you know [laughter] but uh yeah they play the game and it was it was fun listening to it I prefer to do it on a radio rather than watch it because they get a faster [laughter]\nI tell you it was it was a fun game to watch and\nThat's one of those that will go down in Packer history and more and it's probably doing one of the dumbest planes ever made by a Packer morel ranks right up there with that I think with the missed him with the other side and when the onsite kick in Seattle in the championship game\nI Will say this is probably almost worse than that that was pretty bad I mean I Know that get you to the super bowl on talking you got to win a game yeah that was terrible to what he did but this was just like what the hell are you doing\nYeah exactly I I you know what I'm saying you know only you know it costs money honestly he's on he's on the hot seat\nSo I'm In a gimmick ma'am listen how about\nThe uh the pregame game that both you guys probably remember remember that one quarterback from from the Packers screwed up an ending and\nAll the Vikings game uh\nHe was gone the next week was that TJ rule bleeding I think so\n[laughter] you've got hurt and they're supposed to run a quarterback sneakers or field goal range and Frank Winters is the center and he articles out and winter's yells around running it happened play run up and play and rudely passes it interceptions in my teens and if I was in one of the game [laughter] hey\nMike only you would remember that\nWell Karl brought it up but yeah that that that was probably worse than the U.S [laughter] 'cause you're a backup\nQuarterback what the heck are you thinking that's right and all you got to do is run a quarterback sneak and you got your field or in\nAny way [noise] All right Matt thank you very much for the call\nCan I can I make it yeah yeah yeah\nYou're you're fifty three [noise] yeah it is that correct yep [noise] hey three is\nThe number of times the Vikings and Packers a settled on a head to head\nWell you're the clubhouse leader as long as you're eating and call and I think I'm a leader all righty thank you very much at stake here that we got on\nThanks for holding your on Monday morning quarterback\nYeah you guys are talking about time governor he's playing what about the one that led to the touch back\nIn touch back and what you mean to say safety yes\nYeah that was in a good play obviously either but it was that was the lack of execution three they handed the ball off I don't think you know part of me thinks the role Rogers on either throws the ball into the stands on rivers down is just trying to get some room\nBut they they call the running play and we just didn't execute right um it wasn't like it was a ... bone head play were with my ... in my opinion but yeah that opinion\nYeah I would've I would've role Rogers out on that circumstance I think they were expecting a running play\nWell I just think that the score could have been tied at the end instead of a two point\nOh well I don't think that would have been a ... well you might be right because they did do for a to point conversion and missed and then they went for another two point and got it so it\nProbably you know and I think they balanced out they still would have had the lead I\nMean yeah and it's to see if this happens is on the\nBoat quite odd you know you want to throw up another one is that fake pond and good to them I'm sure they looked at it [laughter] I mean these guys run back and what they need to do was rushed to punter more often I think is what they need to do well I saw\nThat with a ... years back when Danny ... was not only the puncture but a quarterback and uh he uh he did that to the Packers were\nUh they got a five yard a game delay and he's do random for like forty seven yards and got the first stone so yeah\nThere are so many times ... yeah I mean there's there's so many variables but the I think that uh\nBut you want to watch a lot of times there is when the punter punched the ball there's some teams that won't even really pressure the punter much they rate a second and then they dropped back in a guy like me with an artificial knee could run for ten years up to middle sometimes\nI mean it just was white ... to me I'm Amazed at the Packers don't try that one was\nGood execution on the ... ah ramps part\nYeah without a dome and they saw something ... saw something in a did a good job and you know what's that other thing that the college teams are doing a couple of years ago like the soccer type\nPlenty more they rugby they run run off to the side as it's called the rugby sad I Know you can't released on the line of scrimmage but I'm surprised teams don't do that a little bit more but I never seen an NFL team do what I should say what do you have somebody else I\nStill think that said he was so attractive\nTo without a doubt [noise] 'cause I don't remember I scored a touchdown to what\nWhat would that thing or the other one I don't like about the safety and that whole sequence at the end of the first hand since I was telling Mike you took away all the momentum you build a yeah you had a ten nothing lead you're going into the first the first half with maybe shutting out one of the uh one of the\nMost important ... million right now and and all of a sudden you get them off the deck like that then that say oh well yeah that\nThat's got to be a morel breaker right there okay thank\nYou I guess in a trivia question ...\nAll right thanks for the call good morning area on Monday morning quarterback\nHey Mike I got a comment for yeah your dog\nYou know I heard my car can in Prescott thought the game plan was for him to stay in their hands on it personally golfing Cal in this day and\nThey ended on some of that that does that she'll team's coach columnist day in and they end up\nThey did that I Would not be on my team one day but\nThat's the big dog well that's what they're talking about ... was it like I said the training deadlines tomorrow\nAnd then obviously we're looking for a match up for\nOutside so drawn to run a little bit of getting them in space and then\nNarrative nice they run the ball\nAnd we got a good situation where they're playing some a match covered and got 'em loose in the same\nYeah definitely we turn around and satellite and there was a picture we looked at and looked like he got on top and ask them\nAnd I said what do you want you want to go around you want to start probably so I don't want to go around\nSo I came back to him and beat them inside respect and it's nice when\nIt sound like a home game at times for the crowd was fantastic um\n\nUh don't really expect to maybe in LA but another five or\n... showed up they're fantastic great energy [noise] just pointed we couldn't get one last drive [noise]\nYeah I mean that's on and that was\nEmploys obviously you know I call them and the two minute but uh [noise] you know when you said open things up a little bit in the second half and [noise] um was working when we went to some one by three ... around and then got Jones from opportunities a\nThat's not my responsibilities by quarterback I'm not inland substitution personnel and [noise] um\nWhen he's in there you know he can be dynamic um the other two guys have had moments as well [noise]\nSo I'm not I'm not thinking about who's now running back I'm just making sure that that guy knows what he's doing\nOkay and obviously also ticked off Aaron Rodgers and ... you can see the look on his face as as\nWell like I said I mean that Aaron Rogers wants to where he doesn't care how it happens he wants to win and I don't and I love a guy like that you want a guy that wants to dream he's willing to put it on the line I mean he's been\nA lot of quarterbacks went the going in after that Chicago game made it might have set up to three or four games who knows 'cause he's get as he gets his money no matter what\nThat being said he wants to win and he does it puts it on the line and when you have something like that\nYou look at a Mason Crosby and know what was that the Detroit game arena told that says that was our guy had a bad day this wasn't like but this was a stupid play is what this was a yeah I mean it was a dump lay o da and selfish player a lady who yeah they're funny but it's funny I was a dumb and selfish yeah just\nLike it reminds me of the ... the movie rain man where uh the lady the trench company keeps senator letters and then they say you must be stupid stupid stupid like Montgomery I mean really what\nThe heck were you thinking I mean the only thing that would make me even remotely want to keep them on the team as if he apologized the team and says the dumbest play I've ever done in my life I all I can say is I'm I'm so sorry I'm mad at myself it was the stupidest football player ever made in my life because that's that's what I think\nI I well I'm Glad you brought that up because that's something uh dreams and I talked about this morning here think he's going to have to make like bleach to report today and said that Aaron Rogers was at ... and the locker room after the game at Montgomery\nYou think there are as you well how would you handle that are the coach here they had cooked how do you handle that\nWent well I mean I Know you're you're saying you heard somewhere where they talk to him just before that I haven't heard that okay I didn't hear it and Mike McCarthy's thing so if McCarthy and the special teams coach of both of them should have been in his face before that you know it's ...\nBut at the same thing they did for the sake of any if you didn't\nDo that if McCarthy and the special teams cage or indoor ... got in his face before this play before the kickoff\n... quite honestly should be it's not like he's Aaron Rodgers you know he he should be gone because first obviously he's not planning that well I mean I don't even know why he's in in some of the places you got Aaron Jones who's just doing phenomenal and it's like we we take him out of the game sometimes ...\n... ... when that question and that's I'm a reporter last question that you just heard hear and respond to he was asked basically well he's he's as ... we like to see her and joins more and\nYou heard the response kind of our Kurt well I mean that's not my job I plan to put yeah buddy you know what that translation sure I Want him in [laughter] but it's not my job\nI I make notes during the game and I'm looking down in this must have been it was just before the first the first part of the fake pump excuse me I have where Jones\nOr you know he he started out play in a while and then they take 'em out of the game and I understand keep it fresh meat but I I mean if this guy is hot keep keep feeding the ball he\nBreak it half the time I'll give you another example like a stupidity and play calling\nThe first touchdown and they got it on the run of that but after that the original touchdown was overturned they adopt what did they try to do for a pass now here in Rogers almost got killed in the ... ... it could have almost an interception\nYou know you've got a one foot to go well I got one foot to you know pass give it to your running neck play they did and when you store as easily I I agree it's just like it was it was a frustrating game there's no doubt about it um\n[noise] I just and you might have high Dick's on a trading bloc and that was I mean he has a he's not a final year of his contract not doing anything to him\nAnd he has said he doesn't expect to be back in and I'm thinking that's what and the Packers are going to while we don't want you back so why don't we trade ya\nAnd get something in our area and but they are that was on a NFL Sunday Morning on the NFL Network their pre game show and they were saying now he's one of the guys that's a rumored to be on the trading bloc is available for the right price what would you get what would you want for Clinton ducks\nWell he was a first round or but I think if you get a ... a fourth or fifth round or right now he's not play like a first round her I mean if he was playing like a first round or we wouldn't we wouldn't think about trading him um we'd be trying to resign them yeah so that being said I think if you got even a fourth fifth and maybe even a six round pick you\nWhat about player that you can do in a position that you could use\nYeah there you go oh pass Rauscher of some kind of want to kick return or just catches the ball in the\nCase I might not be able to catch the ball but I could take a knee Carl for God's sake just put it this way or the Syrian border eighty thought it would I could we we can go up there and other states that will just God or so later\n[laughter] I'll just make sure yeah I agree 'cause it's a free ball so you're going to make sure that you catch it all talk about stupid place there was one and this is one of the joys of the red zone channel\nAnd it happened I think it was in the sense that it was it the Cincinnati Bengals scheme yeah I think it was in the Cincinnati Bengals games but anyway there was a safety\nAnd then of course there's the free kick isn't in New York Giants I think it was New York giants that sounds like an anyway the team that you know I think that I had to kick the free kick you out\n[laughter] one of the guys were on the receiving team raises his hand like it's going to catch so the other guy doesn't catch the ball the ball goes around and the resetting the kicking team the team that kicked a free kick recovered and of course\nIs whether the kicker upon all time whenever it's a free kick it's a free kick actors on a punt is alive all too well this is after a safety yup but after about safety and it's a ... to live ball all they they recovered the bomb that got the ball back wow yeah that is stupid\n[laughter] that was like apparently they didn't understand the rules that's ally ball you just don't in there again on on that I'm sure people are going on with don't they teach these guys the rules are [laughter]\nI get I Know as a culture you're saying these guys have been playing football for ten years or four years of high school for years of college not all ... you know and probably before that they've been playing ten years that we really have to well obviously you do have to say these things\nGo back to you that Seattle game on I have to bring that sort of thing up for a couple of years ago there were so many things in that the onsite kick you talked about the fake field goal that they got it down and then have scored a touchdown and then you've got a Julius Peppers\nOn the interception just don't get down to about take me to the promised land you lay one block list is gay scored a touchdown another definitely the game is over I mean you know you\nWanted to start a peace

today\nWell let me ask you this is he still scheduled for you is six o'clock\nIn the horrors that no bars you know as far as I Know I had to do the job\nBecause I [noise] man you read the report especially the ones that Mike Silver only one in detail about everything\nUh I I started to think bill and this morning when I saw when I read that I'm going to be surprised if you know it's just crazy to say because they've they've invested a lot in Montgomery he's changed position you become a kickoff return or\nUm there's there's there's reason to keep tied Montgomery okay there are reasons to do that\nBut when you are a marginal contributor\nAnd you are openly defying what you've been told to do if that if that doesn't cost a marginal player his job what does\nLike physical errors are going to have those people are going to drop passes people are going to blow up coverage is people are going to have that and that and the quarterback but a lot of reason like physical reasons that you know you just got\nYou know you just got out played by a particular player and a particular play every player has a bad day but what you do the opposite thing of the thing you're told to do and then\nYou know he absolutely compounded the issue by refusing to talk to the media after the game he made that situation a lot worse because of that it's one thing to\nTo make a mistake and to to fire coats and everything else but then it said I I'm I'm not talking I have nothing to say I think it was a big mistake for him to not just own up to it and just do it or maybe he was standing always good stuff for your show tonight I don't know um but\nUnspoken knowledge of here's where the guy's going to be maybe that's when he would have been the I don't think is Randall cop gets his way back so that helps too\nBut there's there's not one the easy answer to say here's why a team can be that\nStrong in charge per day and then that week in points per game so there's a clearly I mean you're about to go into New England they're not as good of a defensive team as the rank one that I was given all team as a as I meant to say that it doesn't seem as the rams um but it's yeah if if that doesn't get solved film\nYou know made me cry can bounce back and have a great year after that showing you had a Detroit and still you don't want every every time you get into the you know in the field position over there and happened to having to cook a ... yard field goal you you need to convert some of those get closer so\nI'll be a very difficult question that uh I think even the car thing to find them but I didn't answer too because it's it's not it's not one thing and it's probably why all of us feel\nSo overwhelming because when it's not one thing that's another one it's not that thing is that you are struggling at that point in the field so I'm good teams don't let Dr style at that point and I think that's a big part of the reason why among many reasons why I think it'd be hard to call the Packers are good team right now at this point in the season\n[noise] good stuff as always him will try to get my hair and a week okay\nI I mean I Would say have fun with them and only

want to make sure we get all of this and a real quick let's do this because it has been on hold a long time I was listening to us in New York Tyler how you doing it and what's going on\nThere and got out of the going wow what's up\nI think there are three big things that the reason why the Green Bay lost the game yesterday I mean I'm not even going to go over the obvious one of the pie in Montgomery and then the special but obviously like that with a\nDime and the benefits and the second quarter and have a third quarter was abysmal\nBecause I mean they come up and an Internet said to myself and you know start banging point and putting them away now because you're not going to hold down for court order the right to God\nAnd second of all I don't know whether it Mike mccarthy with a run calling or as longer than they are ... but we need to get Joe on the ball more plain and simple because\nThey have to walk it Mike mccarthy talked about that during the by we coming out and buy we've seen we've got more than\n... just like it that it touched down is thirty three are no one else on the thing no they're running back is going to give you that touchdown guaranteed\nI mean in my line is it going back but he's not going to do that\nHe had a good one too much type of back into the you're right they need to get the ball in the hands of air and Jones a little bit more I I completely agree with that I don't\nI don't I don't buy the the ... the path walking Maloney because I haven't heard this talked about a lot by on that final possession or better than that\nAnd you don't get that time I got re just completely ... dollar bill and you've got Aaron down one on one whether you are that are starting down back I mean I just I got it off a mess right or\nThe myth rain by the wind but that was absolutely terrible yeah so in that for a path walking off in the same way\nHelp and Lynn Taylor whether there is no rush to be seen\nLike your ... your number one two and three and centered on that\nI Know who Michael Silber was talking to stand in a not far from me and uh and so that's a legitimate quote you know off the record or\nLA or nine unnamed source of player from from the team talking about the situation I think\nBasically the policy is a you know and I ... of course I'm sharing a set of that team and I remember just you know just touch back All right I'm sure that that's what the coach that but as a policy that team\nBecause he says you know we take me one more close to ten minutes here to stay out of his reaction to the game being fumbled away on that kick return\nSo I'm not happy at all it's probably\nOne of the one of the worst feeling knowing that we counted out the way we were and we had a shot at winning the game I mean the game was one already worked on my head how everything's going to happen we need it was more of a disappointing and you know our deepest quite a great game and it's often but at the same time we got finished regardless\nObviously I mean he's not on the phone with a bomb but you got to be smart to choices like that um I Know he'll learn from it but at the same time that doesn't change we're having today\nWho started getting aggressive like we like we need to be in like I said that's that's really what makes it so frustrated when you know you play the great game and the team and then you know some things happened tore day and just kind of crumbling you got you got to complete game in that day to day I mean we're not it's not about building we're like we said or whatever it is now going\nOn that's man that's that's pretty strong\nYeah yeah now what are the things that you saw that they came out with the Jones show\nEight carries in the first time calling for and the second the brilliant\nPlay call on the draw where he got the thirty three are touched down a that's all good but you know you can also get a sense that Aaron Rodgers starts making adjustments in the game some that are very positive\nAnd so and was asked about some of the changes of the fence of calls in a in the play calling in the third quarter\nI mean that's one that was\nMichael employs obviously you know I call them and the two minute to decide open things up a little bit in the second half and\nI was working we went to someone by three so drawn to it around and then got Jones some opportunities\nTo go down to distance\nAnd you know this thing has gone back and forth about you know in my car the sad or after the game I think Aaron Jones that had a good Gary did okay and first and second down\nThere's still some concerns on third down I guess that's still gets packed weather and Jones is a good enough back at past protection I don't know why they just don't just established that and give that got the ball for four quarters on first and second down and bringing Jamal Williams a shift\nBut I Want beautiful play that I Will forever remember with that great opportunity watch Packers rams game no coliseum hold a ranch move the next place is the rookie Marquez Elvis gambling on his forty a touchdown catch down the right hand side lines\nAnd he said that's another instance of Aaron Rodgers drawing up in the dirt\nAnd by the way before and told me to go outside to go around and after that and that's when it's a great ball\nI'm Mike I I think mark was look we were talking about his early I think the talent they have the wide receiving corps\nHe's he's only getting better and it's it's to me it's already really good and then the fact that you have your in Rogers
