gate so midway point could be here I always tell you you have to break down the season in quarters first quarter is your first four games second quarter is your next four games and then you evaluate where your teams are here's what we know\nThrough seven weeks so for the Kansas City chiefs their loss was just a blip on the radar\nThey are one of the most dominant teams right now in the NFL and that our fence can score with any team in the week look at how they lost\nLast week there only lost right it was a final field goal in again that indeed forty three forty\nAnd maybe the patriots and the rams or maybe the chargers I don't know who else or the teams that are capable of keeping up with the Kansas City chiefs in terms of scoring\nTheir defense played better against a Bengal team that has played well off and so we so far this season but a forty five to ten route\nThat says the barest thing is it gets a national prime time so the kids do she's at six in one right up there with the LA Rams who are stepping into\nThe New England patriots who are five into and finally when a road game here in Chicago will get to that and in just a minute\nAnd I would do the New Orleans saints in there who yeah they they did get lucky because that game could have easily gone into overtime and who knows what would have happened in overtime but those are your best teams right now in the NFL those teams have separated themselves from everybody else\nYou look at the other teams with winning records I don't necessarily know what to buy with them the Houston Texans started the season when three and now they're four and three they won four straight games there in first place in the AFC South but they're not look good in any of those four wins\nAnd all four of them have come against teams playing poorly\nEspecially the Jacksonville Jaguars who have now lost three straight games and there are questions as if there weren't already serious questions as to what's going to be of their quarterback position moving forward\nAnd if I'm the New York giants I Am picking up the phone and I'm calling Tom Coughlin and I'm saying what would you give me for Ely maddening\nBecause we need to move on from him we should have done it last year okay doubts are bad we made the mistake but we're ready to move on from him right now because we stick\nAnd you have a team that is capable on going on around here in a division that you are just one game out of wood they defense and opposites of weapons that can get the job done what are you going to give us where you are ...\nThat's the phone call that David Gentleman the giants show manager has to make to Tom Coughlin and say look we'll give 'em to you and\nIt's not just the giants a team around the league that has just\nHey if your the way if you're going to be if you're in the New Orleans saints there was a love affair with tastes them hill\nRight he's he's playing up back in the punk fake puns he's coming at the quarterback position in running the football he's getting the job done for you as the backup quarterback essentially you're trained protesting Bridgewater now it's time to trade it teddy Bridgewater again and send him to Jacksonville\nOr if you're the Baltimore Ravens Lamar Jackson is learning every single week hey our gene three no need for you on a roster send or G. three to Jacksonville\nThere are a lot of teams around the league that have a quarterback surplus their kid crazy to a guy to Jacksonville that can play a head of Blake portals\nEven the Indianapolis Colts with Jacoby ... all upgrades for the Jacksonville Jaguars\nElsewhere around the league the charges are getting hot\nYou know I picked the chargers to go to the AFC Championship game chargers patriots was my AFC Championship game and after the first couple of weeks of the season it didn't look so good but the chargers have won four straight games\nWe love their off as we know that Philip Rivers is never out of the game right\nCan always get it done\nAnd well they've won four straight there five into and just one game back\nOf the Kansas City chiefs and that division\nNow the schedule at one point gets brutal but for now at the sea hawks see what they can do their Melvin Gordon is going to have extra time to rest\nThen they play against the raiders that's pretty easy\nThe Broncos ... we'll see what that game is going to be in LA cardinals that's a cake walk\nAnd then the grind at the Steelers home to the bangles at the chiefs homes or the ravens at Denver to end the year that say brutal way to end your season but the chargers are trending upwards absolutely five into to start\nThis year in the NFC East\nThis division is going to come down to nine when team at best the Redskins or foreign Jew but do you even trust that team to continue to when I have not been impressed with anything they've done anything at all and they got a big defense of playing this game to beat the cowboys and also a missed the field goal\nTo be the cowboys the eagles who knows maybe there's a Super Bowl hangover right\nIsn't that what everybody warns about you know cars and went back to there should be better they had a Seventeen nothing lead against the Carolina Panthers Seventeen nothing\nAnd\n\nHave this one game when talking to my\nMan he was talking about\nYou know obviously the skill position players on a team right and I used to play this for a year to game where I look at the skill position players on any given team and look at the starting five\nI said wouldn't it be called there was an NFL fantasy game where it was just your Iraq you pick one team\nAnd you get there starting five\nSo you get the quarterback the rolling back the too wide receivers and the tight end\nAnd I know that certain teams utilize different pieces differently so maybe you want to swap out a tight and instead make it a third receiver okay or maybe you want to swap out one of those positions and make it a a second running back okay\nBut if you want to look around the NFL right now who has the best starting five\nIn that little game that I was playing\nIs anyone better than the Kansas City chiefs\nYou know I used to say the Philadelphia Eagles back in the day had it when they had a Michael Vick shady McCoy to Shaun ... like they were just they were just loaded\nBut think about this Patrick moms Kareem haunt Travis Kelsey tirade show and whoever else you want to throw fits I I don't care who it is those for a better than at least for the NFL\nWho you really want to give me semi Watkins okay sprints or aware\nChris comedy I'll give it can be sent me walking for sure well that's that works\nWho has a better five then the Kansas City chiefs\nMore homes horns\nKelsey ... and walk ins that is the most dynamic skilled positions set in the NFL\nYou know this is they might have been arguments okay you look at\nThe saints and its Drew Brees Michael Thomas and I guess you would throw in a another why instead of a tight end you know Watson's been okay your problem we throw that you running backs and like ...\nSo you can go Thomas gain Ingram Camaro breeze ... since my bed the rams\nWill you take the tide and out of the rams because as much as you know ... a nice guy I wouldn't consider the wide receivers there the the real weapons so it's golf girly and then the woods cooks and cup one healthy\nTo pretty pretty good five right it's a pretty good five\nWho else has a elites five now the patriots I don't know if I can say that 'cause it's breathing Bronx genes white annulment and Hogan or Edelman Gordon is actually not that bad because\nJames White as more of a receiver then I'm learning back but he is he is a mismatch coming out of the backfield he's an absolute mismatch coming out of the backfield\n\nHow about the New York giants call me crazy but the one piece missing from an elite starting five is the quarterback\nHotel Beck and junior sterling shepherd editing room sake one Barkley but Eli Manning's the the biggest fall there\nI really think the giants need to move on from Eli Manning they will at the end of the season but why not move on from them this season\nWhy not see if you can get a draft pick form train them to the jaguars 'cause I would've bench you I Would have been some you know tomorrow night against Atlanta would have been the perfect time to start the rookie ... that's really what I Would have done because the giants had a lot of time\nOff to prepare because they played last Thursday night and then they play Monday Night so it's like a lemon full days to to prepare for your next opponent\nYou've already binged Eli Manning that was last year got a coach fired but ... says the streak is over there is nothing to protect there's no Im age there's no humility nothing\nYou're benched him last year for geo Smith doesn't get worse than that\nThis year you know one in five and you're thinking okay let me see who ... is this rookie because I'm going to have to draft a quarterback next year or maybe I catch lightning in a bottle and I don't have to\n... ... what's the point of having to rely manning sit the bench just create a third teams out there that would give you something for him might not be what you want but there are teams that would do it\nLook at the embarrassment that there is the quarterback position around the league with Josh Allen hurt the Buffalo Bills turn to Derrick Anderson as their starting quarterback they should just call me I Would have played\nMight have done a better job that probably not but couldn't have been worse couldn't have been worse what was the final score and that one thirty seven to five they scored five points\n... anybody could have done that they could have not attempt at a pass attempt it probably done better just hand the ball off every down just tried to get out of there and the game early CJ bet third not\nIt done for the San Francisco forty niners I'm Sorry one nice scheme last week not getting it done though for the San Francisco forty niners and ... and after the game saying well he's the best that we have in the building right now with Jimmy ... will get somebody in the building\nAnd in Jacksonville this is a team that's got a lot of talent and and yet ... had a great or not it's not great whole season but he had a nice run last year\nGetting them to the AFC Championship game playing well down the stretch playing well in the postseason but\nBased on what we've seen now this season combined with what we've seen throughout his career last season might have just been\nThe best that we're going to see from Blake portals and it's time to face it he is not good and it's that team wants to win a championship and make another deep run in the AFC playoffs\nWith that defense with the young weapons they have on on fence it's not going to be with Blake ... as the quarterback I'm Sorry to play for those experiments has got to be over you have to move on\nOf course now who are you moving on to that I Can't answer because I don't think that guy\nI don't think that the quarterback public jaguars is on that last one is not going to be cold

Sports radio dot coms got that and broke here with you a Sunday evening in some Monday morning we'll take a step away from the NFL for just a second because I got to talk about the incident that occurred\nIn Los Angeles on Saturday Night the wrong if\nTo fight the tree and Raj all around the crust Paul\nSprinting room getting involved\nAs well if you haven't seen it's what everyone's talking about in the NBA was the Lakers against the rockets on Saturday Night the home opener for LeBron James and the Lakers and judge James Horton drivers to lean gets a foul called on a on brand than Ingram\nAnd as James horns are doing what the official which is what he does and honestly I I I gotta say\nFind it difficult at times to watch the Houston Rockets\nBecause I just think that James Harden is so unlike couple he complains city officials all the time all the time so hard and complaining and Ingram pushes him\nLike it was kind of like it was kind of a of a serious push this wasn't just like a minor shove Enron was ticked off about something so shoves\nHim out of the way now that was on one side\nBecause then they got separated and that was a technical founding room and you thought that that was the end of the scuffle however Raj on Rondo and Chris Paul went face to face\nAnd this is where things get all interesting\nBecause what you see initially on the video is Chris Paul pointing a finger in Ron does face and pushing his face away with his finger and then Rondo\nSnaps a left jab wasn't really a hook punch and punches Chris Paul in the face now a male a breaks out brand that interim than Russia's in and he punched his crushed Paul\nEveryone has to be separated le bon has to cool down see peace three and a ball players rejected from the game rough settled without settled settled everything what we found out later on though was that Raj on Rondo\nAllegedly spit in Chris Paul space\nNow I'll watch the video the close up video the slow motion yeah there's definitely some fluid that goes from Raj on round those mouth\nInto Chris Paul space you can even see Chris Paul in slow motion wipe away the spin that landed on his face and we've all been there before right there's been people that have been close talkers that kind of you know say it don't spray it and you're wipe it off your face that disgusted look that you have on your face when you're wiping somebody else's spin off\nIt's like oh come on man said don't spray it\nAnd that's what I'm thinking here because if you're going to spin\nOn somebody you actually spin on them now maybe you don't talk a loop but you you you you know you ... in their direction what looked like was us bright from Raj on Rhonda\nAnd maybe he wasn't trying to spin on Chris Paul but he was popping is he's a little bit maybe calling him a pie word several times\nAnd maybe he was just spraying it when he was saying it\nOr maybe he spit him in a way that was more like [noise] as opposed to\nThose are my great spit sound effects that I did hear on the radio for you\nNevertheless suspensions were handed down as Chris Paul gets two games Raj on Rondo got three games and brand than Ingram gets four games my dating Tony rockets head coach on Chris Paul's suspension\nYou didn't want to know why but [laughter] and the heat of the Mormon somebody does that mean that that's tough I mean that's really tough and you know I don't know what\nTo expect him to do um and if you want us to spending when I get\nA use to make a statement but you know I mean you're talking ... he's paying three times more than the other guys are vying\nFor missing games doesn't seem to be right so anyway that's how it is\nThat true 'cause he makes more money so his suspensions more than the other guys because they're suspended without pay and if they look you get spit in the face you know I don't know how how I Would react that'd be pretty ticked off to\nLead them sure reviewed the video and that's what they determined was the result there and they handed out two game suspension I just want to know was he actually spending or did he say the spray not say\nAlso they did lose that game Lakers so that is true losses now\nIs your accounting at home I told you my favorite preseason bet was Lakers under forty eight and a half wins so I bet it and they have to last is now\nI Need thirty four losses in order to hit that but\nWe are down to thirty two more to go now that they are oh and to just start to hear look forty eight and thirty four are still tremendous season for an MBA Eighteen forty eight and thirty four might get you the three seats in the western conference right what was the last year last year\nThe three seed in the western conference say exactly what it was right now if I I think yeah I think rockets one over sixty warriors were in the fifties and I think last year than forty\nEight or ... or maybe you know maybe he was forty nine and then everybody else was forty eight last year yep trailblazers were forty nine and thirty three that was the three seed and then under jazz and pelicans we're all forty eight and thirty four as the four or five and six\nThis year Lakers forty eight and thirty four could be the three she's in the western conference I just don't think they get the forty nine\nRight now I'm On pace oh until [laughter] as our basement or they do we know that they ate by by three two three four and received eight five by three two three four six to do after the game on Saturday Night LeBron on the fight with Chris pollen Rondo\nDang thing on some of the American during social media anything coming tomorrow you're better\nYeah he's not happy about it uh he's trying to set an example for these guys the younger guys on the team and he is not happy that that happen especially because she beat the races boy ah here was the bra and having to say that you know they're not just not ready to compete in the western conference they still have some grown to do\nFor a long way to go to Iraq to a lot of us have probably been together for so long so\nWe'll have a great and he'll be back next week when a game for some very certain\nYeah it was just shocking to see that happen and I don't know what I don't know deck and goes to overtime to the rams even do the same kind of victory or to the ravens pull it off I don't know how that plays out\nBut that was shocking to see the cowboys missing the field goal what was shocking was that the call on the the the the snap in fraction call\n'em because I didn't really understand that I thought that it was going to be a penalty on the red skins but instead it was a snap infraction because they said that the\nThe holder move the ball here we're season guard after the game\nYou apparently they saw the our lumps not produce something that they think a cause of the defense of all I'm In the bill science\nNot I can't think of I don't know once twice on them and not very often\nYou'll notice he actually live on the ground just to visit [noise]\nSee I don't want to get into the details of of all of that\nNow longtime long snapper for the Dallas Cowboys el deal with this or are on the call\nThey told me that I was uh the one responsible for the fall start\nI did exact same thing I usually do take the ball exact same way\nJust that turn of events there when when you do what you're trying\nTo just position it right on the right way I'm not even try and get 'em ups either\nThat you know al ... or or he made the pro bowl as along snapper the guy who knows what he's doing and to get that call that's just a that's a crush or because they moved it from a forty seven or feel go to a fifty two yard field goal and then my her misses the kick\nAnd the cowboys lose to the red skins there was almost an incredible finish\nIn Chicago the bears a couple of ... plays there at the end just moving the ball a little bit closer to give\nTheir quarterback Mitchell Trybulski a chance to launched it towards the end zone\nAnd he got\nRushed on the play\nWhich I think I'm not a lot of people might be talking about but the fact that she didn't have a clean\nShot down the field the ball still one fifty four yards in the air but he was rushed in Haiti right before he threw the football and that's what kind of\nLimited him from getting into the end zone Kevin White catches it at the one yard line but one yard line and the patch keep them out of the end zone thirty eight thirty one the final score metric ... on the Hail Mary\nHail Mary tried to get a chance to get close to the end zone or offensive on to a great job I mean time stuff to move to last and just Chuck during the ... river series on their government a heck of a catch and it was a lot closer than I Am a show of people's to see saw it but I thought he was from my vantage point on I thought he was then\nYeah there is there had good Maggie\nPlace I'm fortunate because I think overall it all three phases we just weren't good enough and anytime you give up two touchdowns and oh by the way it's the patriots with with Tom Brady your chances are slim\nTalking about the two special teams touchdowns the pets get a caller Darryl Patterson Ninety five yard kickoff return for a touchdown and also don't they hide tower block de pont which have been picked up and ran back for a score to special teams scores\nFor the patriots against the bears and they hold on to the wind by seven\nOne yard I think a lot of people were surprised that the uh Carolina Panthers were able to come back from Seventeen nothing down in ... in Philadelphia scoring one the one on answered points years ...\nOh this is supposed to just because you know the defense exams I mean you you know we were talking about wind beaches where you've got to be those guys and we have that opportunity\nWas very good football team we played against them you know then again there you know they're they're finding their way of we're trying to find our way but you know when you when this type of game coming back the way we do a lot of credit goes to our guys are the players in this room or were were\n... winning on the road\nThis place was as advertised signing a hostile environment for like a lot of things as was was holding us back in and being thrown at us even power but\nAt the end of the day you know we overcame that and and we still kept pushing through and and you know you talk about teens and and and the development of the DNA of good teams when all the roll winning close games is this something that you have to do and we did a thing\nYou know I understand that mentality and everyone says that all the time you win close games and win close games and the mark of a good team but I always hearken back to what I'm Down a more general manager of the Houston Rockets at one time he said that you know great teams don't win ... games they avoid them completely\nAnd I always try to remember that because that's the true mark up a great team right\nYou know you can win all these clues games you could be the the Cleveland Browns in place for overtime games this year and make the argument that hey you know we can easily be five in two team because of all these overtime games that one too and one and over time but when you look at the rams\n\nThat's a great football team the rams are a great football team they won by twenty points in

doing great to step in to be getting up in the morning\n[laughter] you don't my dad used to say anytime you're on the right side of the dirt it's a good day\nYeah it is and the older you get the more you're free shooter that's for sure\nWell I I was thinking about you last night when I watched the all the MBA announcers calling that a huge role in a donnybrook in the Lakers are rockets game last night I was taking that but that was you played in the NBA back in the old days of the NBA that that that's like that's like nothing compared to the ball used to go through\n[noise] well yeah and the old days that are kind of makes it look like it was a social her teeth I'm not much not much going on there\nAnd and it's great because these guys are so big and strong and powerful and you know somebody could really get hurt I mean we go back to the unfortunate situation where St John Fitch and and and the NBA realize that you just can't allow that type of stuff to happiness so that could have been very very hard guy to\nLose their composure and and get into a fight and start throwing punches it's it's just not the right thing so I'm Glad that nothing worse happens\nYou know I Know people out in LA are already starting to panic out here with the Lakers I started out over too but I remember when he went to Miami a few years ago I think they started out what one in five one in six or something it takes time to do when you put a new team together especially with a super star player\nNo question about that you know it does take time to do it and you know other people have to step up I mean rubber on can't do it all by themselves by himself it just doesn't work that way um\nTo bring in some some veteran players do some Rondo coming in there and doing it but I mean they it's just a matter of time and you know your own two was no big thing I mean they were in this game and they just you know lost control of things the late in the basketball game and they almost be one of the best teams I mean those in the\nFinals of the western conference so I wouldn't be overly concerned at this particular juncture\nYou know there are horrible guy one thing I got to put up one thing I heard they they've got to find somebody can shoot the ball will be these are from outside on concrete stuff\nI mean you can't go into again goes zero for Fifteen I'm Sorry and then you know shoot horrific percentage or you got it now in today's game\nHe got to have some people who can knock down three point shot it's a different game that it was back when I played I mean if I took some shots of these guys take now to put on the bench a and now I mean it's becoming a prolific situation of guys are shooting forty forty five forty eight percent crazy numbers\nAnd you can't beat it team if you're not making three point shots nowadays\nWe read my mind right because they were minus twenty four points on planes against Portman it might have Eighteen last night and they were the worst three points shooting team in the late last year ... plus they're horrible defensively they're given up about a hundred and twenty eight points a game so far\n[laughter] yeah well as you say this has to areas that neither one area mainly obviously number one district defense you have to be friends on a nightly basis and make it a little bit more difficult for it seemed to be able to score points\nAnd then you have to be able to score points yourself there see defense wins championships yeah but not if you don't have the assets are going to score some points\nYou don't read the Lakers have again they banned it in the second round me this kid to seize female holy you pronounce his last name whatever it is he was knocking them down in the summer where he is a great sooner he can really knock him in Kansas as well he hasn't played a second so foreign ... I kept saying why not put him in for a few minutes and ... the defense out knock you down\n[laughter] yeah well I mean that's obviously loops decision as to what he wants to do and I'll bring them along slowly starting with the people that he wanted to see how that works if not you start making some adjustments it's kinda like fine tuning in engine you gotta you just have to kind of see how it goes you start out with what you had\nAnd then find to it and I'm I'm sure there'll be some adjustments made if things don't get a little bit better in the areas that we just talked about\nWhat do you think about the suspensions record brand new name from getting for a raise online do getting three and the NBA and ruled that he spent ... which I think sort of ... maybe more than more than three games on the beach where you got to [noise]\nYeah well I'm the anger and definitely had for you to students to get or the entire thing what he did was he started the whole thing yeah there was absolutely no reason whatsoever he fouled hard on the way to the basket I mean what justification did he have for shopping him like that\nI mean it was ridiculous that was just a very immature thing to do and it started all of the other things and then I don't know what the heck it if he did he spit on what the heck was Raj on thinking about it you know that somebody's face I mean the guy I think the get screwed more than anything it was was a cp three I mean you know\nYour natural reaction somebody spits in your face yeah how do you sit there and say okay thank you know what are you\nDoing I mean yeah I mean and he didn't and here's the thing he didn't react by throwing a punch if you saw the video\nHe got his faith finger up there and did some stuff with Enron do threw a punch on top of that and so would ride that which he was supposed to stay and you know sit there and just take them spinning in his face and not respond to that and so I really do think that if anything get maybe one game only for a CPA three for having somebody that gives you a bit of actually throw punches\nAnd then you know ... ... comes in and and and comes in what things are going on when he was pulled away for comes back and it throws a punch you know I mean they'd eat more than four\nFor ... a sucker punch in the back of someone's head yeah you could really hurts them with that thank God it than glance\nRick Perry the hall of fame around with days matured NBC's once we don't want somebody to knock on your Golden State warriors seven right now they're a game of the year against the nuggets and seven minutes to go in the game but and as we always say Rick if they're playing warriors basketball they injury free especially when they get cousins back there's nobody that's going to beat them to see\nIf they play ... basketball everybody's healthy yeah it it seems very unlikely that anybody would be able to beat him and a seven game series however they have a tendency sometimes I play basketball and we don't know what the situation is going to be injury wise or how well they're playing at that particular juncture of the season that's another factor the the three main factors\nAre but you know we saw what they're capable of doing the other night and Utah I mean that was just a great\nComeback on the road to you know against the very good basketball team and they still have plenty of time left in this one to see if they can pull it out but\nYou know playing I can tell you right now playing in Denver and when you're traveling stuff that the altitude hazard impact I get some kind of really truly does a nugget seem to play exceptionally well where they play against the war years they get all pumped up but every team's going to try to do it that's the one thing about the war is the sheer\nThey I think they are and how would you have enough experience enough to understand that every time that they walk out on the court and this season every team that they're playing is going to treat that as an NBA Finals game and it's just the nature of the beast you wanted to beat the champions and in a way I think it's easy as a player to get yourself to know that the

in the Kansas City chiefs scene because Andy Reid has always been a great regular season go\nWhen it comes to the playoffs he's Marty shot and I can't get the job done and be the the the flaw the crack in the foundation the single biggest weakness in Andy Reid is clock management and time out\nAnd he ended this is this is really saying something here uh my Mount Rushmore of horse clock managers of all time Mike mark his first and I thought my mom was so far out there this is like Cy Young winning five hundred eleven games like world scoring a hundred points in one game like a baseball player hitting a hundred home runs\nMe and my Marxist so far ahead of everybody in absolute in total incompetence sit managing the clock and managing his time outs\nThat there's it's just a battle for second place so it's Mike marks first Andy Reid second Pete Carroll third Steve marry people were photo Mike Tomlin the Steelers mean he's in the on deck struggle he is nipping at the heels of us the marry you to be replacing a couple of more screw ups my ... who is\nExtraordinarily bad managing the clock he might jump up there and joined there was those other four great soon but Andy Reid actually pulled up about even with Mike marks and certainly born from the Washington Post and we had on earlier she made a very good point\nAndy Reid has been doing this consistently in the playoffs he's heard his team more than my marked for the rent because Andy readers doing it at the most inopportune times in the ... most important game ... playoff games costing your team wins possible Super Bowl championships\nAnti readers screwed up and made mistakes\nIn the most important games which which could see them ahead and make more than a bad happens that'll be one of the greatest accomplishments in sports history because to me Mike mark had an unbreakable record ... there was no way anybody could ever match him for being stupid but boy had to read in the postseason wow\nAnd you say well why doesn't he learned from it and why it doesn't get any better because he'll never admit he's wrong if you don't want to bet you're wrong and you don't think you made a mistake you're never gonna get any better at it that's why every year he screwed up the clock he screws up his time out any costs his team a game [noise]\nAnd then he found out about it after the game and he always says I'll do this I Do the same thing all over again it was the right thing to do so if you suffered and get it and you can't admit you're wrong\nThat's why he never gets any better there's

current healing for pro basketball talk what's up her\nNot much man you know I went to a staples last night so nice quite a boxing match restaurant\n[laughter] you know I had read bury on earlier on and then he was laughing you know he played in me a BA in the back in the NBA and the reason he said you know back in his day you know that they just keep up the blood and the teeth and keep playing nobody gets better he said that was a little ... party compared to the price they use their\nLegs that they will NBA in the seventies in particular and and even ... really it started to change with magic and Larry as they were trying to where they are just they were trying to do are\nYou trying to make the game more marketable with a mass way but yeah there's some of these games they just I mean Kevin mchale close white and guys when you look back before that if it ... really let the game get physical really like guys beat on each other and\nYou know it's yeah it's very much the case that those guys laugh now the ideas of what just call\nYou know it's funny when when Kevin mchale clothes line to ramp associated for finals but almost killed him a rabbit walk to the free throw line and sought to know suspension no nothing just get up there\n[laughter] yeah exactly it was a very different time [laughter]\nIt was just for the start of something that's good stuff it's a you know kind of like hockey has it away like their duty over time to sort of thing they think they can market that are so\nNow after the ... last night the between Rondo and Chris Paul and Brandon Ingram anger and gets poorer around do gets three and he'd be three gets a two game suspension do you think an adequate or what would you have handled this differently\n[noise] adequate to find I might have even gone a little harder on some of them I mean Ingram was hot he kind of started this whole thing I think we've got ... trouble and they talk about this is that it's the the you know he gets he starts the whole thing with which shoving and he gets the technical and usually that's where all these things die\nWhen the actual fight starts with Ron do and and Chris Paul\nHe comes flying that man was a piece of all that he can scream it back and starts starts\nTo fight and that's where it got really bad and and so he gets the for for that I'm surprised that was about one more guy a game um it's certainly hits Chris Paul really hard he loses I think it's\nAlmost half a million dollars in salary between two games for change or the other two guys who are less her contract so it's about a hundred and fifty but it still stings and I I I get the message or trying to say I thought they'd send a little harsh one because actual punches is something the NBA really tries to avoid\nNow and I would have given brand and make them five because he came back into joining US Soccer ... somebody in the back of the head after starting the whole gang or Ron do you know I didn't know if the the spinning was intentional or not but I guess the MBA thought it was because they said the part I just mentioned was spinning so I think he should have gotten more than three percent against somebody but I\nI kinda feel sorry for every ... guys puts in your face ... and he didn't punch to me that ... what is he supposed to do and that's what's in your face you're going to react to it don't you\nThat it's funny that you are you're almost ... and you trust is like if you I was quoting James Harden ... oh we're talking like James Harden after the game last night was was very much just that was like\nHe spent his face you got to react as a man and like you know the chips fall where they may with the league whatever nobody this locker room has a problem with what Christ it and I you know I\nWouldn't even say it wasn't like he just reared back and spit out in a you know a Seinfeld episode with Keith her dad is here and it was like\nIt was more like blowing spit but when you get a really close up video you ship which is you know we've got it at NBC it's kind of available everywhere [noise] it sure looks like it was intentional it really it's really hard not to tell me it's not unlike with you [noise] he's gotta get four or five games for that and I think I think if anything the league was a little light on everybody for this\nYou know and that's one of the Lakers though I agree with Charles Barkley when he said he doesn't understand why Ron doing TCP are starting a\nYou know a lot of these guys on what your deals aren't going to be here next year I Love to be starting Joss hearts would be starting in the Bronx will be playing with in developing these young guys and the next summer when you get a free agent to go along with the brown there'll be all the better for why why did you starting these these veteran guys when they probably won't be here next year\n[laughter] so I Wonder I Wonder how long it's gonna go I think in in ... case it's his fault came back later and they they just kind of trust Ron do more than Ronald makes good passage he's ... he's played fairly well he's made good decisions um ball's gonna have to get in that spot\nI'd be honest with you why they're starting her K. C. P. over ... I've got no idea I tweeted this out last night like I said I was at the game and I said ... ... and I told this we've talked about this that the goal for the Lakers this season now they want to win some games are going to make the playoffs they want to start to establish some stuff with the going to ultimately what one of the big things you gotta learn this year\nWhich is these young guys can play on a championship level team with about ... who's going to mash who can be their cruise missile pretty good Ingram has had ups and downs in moments\nJust heard is that one guy like you can check the box Josh ... is ready to go that guy is a you know you see a future all start probably not is he a guy who can play\nNBA basketball on a championship team and contribute yeah this year tomorrow he is so good and I I just I I kind of get wider I kind of guess why they're starting KCPT over over him I mean\nThat's Casey peas agent is LeBron's agent is Anthony Davis his age thought at some point you just you got a little heart and their man\nWhat lawns no salt looks a lot better this year I mean is that way over over his left ear the way it was a little bit more conventional these knocking down last night he looks much improved\nYeah he was four of eight from three last night and at one point during the game and I don't know I that is not my ... going to remember what the final numbers where I you know if he was four seven from three finished for\nThe rest of the team was four twenty um once you know the bronze can hit threes but that they really need the shooting and if one is going to provide that people get more minutes state\nFire adapted that are\nVery you how's it going I'm having a stroke or you going to shake my hand or what I'm having a stroke while you're not even moving your arm\nHaving a stroke are you OK I'm happy a screw you face looks weird too I'm having a stroke are you having a seizure or something I'm having a stroke when someone is having a stroke they may not be able to stay with words but their body language will tell you loud and clear\nHaving a stroke you just need to know the sudden signs look for fast is they\nThe stripping the arm witness this speech difficulty than tee time time to call nine one one immediately because as soon as they get to the hospital sooner they'll get treatment and that can make a remarkable difference in their recovery you know the sudden science face\nFarm speech time spot a stroke fast\nVisit stroke association duck poor\nBrought to you by the American stroke association in the coming [noise]\nHey\nNick canning here of course we all know there's a lot of talent in America but unfortunately we miss something else we've got way too much a\nChildhood hunger Seventy million kids struggle with it in this country here that the problem is entirely solvable\nThe history we already produced more than enough healthy nutritious food in this country to be every single one of those hungry kids\nWe just need a way to get it too [noise]\nThat's why the feeding America nationwide network to move banks out there every day gathering surplus food to give hope to hungry kids and their families all across the country\nJoined me in supporting Feeding America and your local food bank at Feeding America or\nThe other we can solve hunger\nTogether we're Feeding America [noise]\nMessage from being America and the council\n\nWhen you were a little kid and you thought about what you want it to be teaching at the top of your personal things changed as you've gotten older teacher didn't seem like the best option I mean [noise] I used to be something else what would your twelve year old does [noise]\nNow you want to be a doctor you don't think teachers save lives [noise] twenty five at a\nI tried playing a different role every time the bell rings about scientists\nOf physics chemistry who do you think teachers teachers today are breaking down obstacles funding innovative ways to instill old left [noise]\nOr beyond the four walls of the class\nTime to recognize the great things are happening in teaching [noise]\nTo me [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThis is what you'd call a bad V. [noise]\nWe just talked about if you have the over tonight I'm told [noise]\nSix this morning and al Michaels was just making jokes on the air that is fifty six and a half\nWhen the game started tonight [noise] forty\nFive to ten which he is leading with so I think most of you know with your elementary school now that would have added up to fifty five so your point and a half away you have the all the teams break awful long run there goes Karimov fifty forty five forty thirty five thirty thirty five forty a looks like it's going to school\nHe tripped some fall on his home with nobody touch that he just kind of ran out of gas or re slipped on the grass and down anyway oh but still we're in good shape right now we're in great shape but just a few go there and feel good rates are going to get at least three\nThey got a first down that was forbidden for on the eight yard by\n... percent of the kicker writes sportsmen for ... plus one through basically an extra point gets up to fifty aides were lightened cigars a twenty dollar bills huh yeah sweet victory\nUh nothing feels a sweet is a victory like that you know the best feeling in the world is really good about one image quarterbacks kneeling down taking a knee and running my clock out that's a wonderful feel\nBut is it fifty five she's from the yard line for them for a but Andy Reid not sending the kicker out first Karim hut falls on his own what it looks like he might score [laughter]\nSend it over and as soon as he fell down I said to myself oh boy that's not a good start that's not a good sign right there fourth and for the eight and Andy Reid does not send in the field goal kicker\nAnd oh no well maybe maybe you're thinking about another record maybe he wants to get Patrick ... touchdown pass but you know it was six minutes to go I you know Andy Reid is really the type to run it up and embarrass somebody I guess he feels like chicken a field goal is is running up the score for some reason\nBut I mean\nOut of Columbus Seattle common decency that are common\nYou've got to think about the people who were playing over fifty six and a half dozen [laughter]\nSo they go forward on fourth down and not only does mom's not throw into the end zone protest down number five not only does Heathrow maybe sort of the end zone but at least get a first down\nA simple throwing up the white flag I don't want or what the score hand off up a little better is of course stuffed\nKansas City loses the ball on down we're still at fifty five\nAnd al Michaels it's as soon as the play ended\nEl Michael says a lot of people out there thinking about the number fifty six and a half that are heartbroken right now I'm On my dad was a very very wide and smart man always said you know only an idiot would bet football\nIt takes all the joy out of the game and you have to go through stuff like this\nNo I didn't have any acted on the game tonight thank God because I Would certainly taken me oh this looks like a high scoring game to me\nBusted sheets might have been a number I think it was one eight and a half if I'm not mistaken in fifty six and a half the total I would've tended I think more than a bit the chiefs to cover than it would have deal but I I Would have been a little on me over as well and it looked like a high scoring game\nYikes [laughter] curry about trips and falls with nobody touching them but it looked like he was going to score [noise] am enforcing for on the yard line I kept waiting for that field goal kicker to run onto the field and we never saw him\nWe lose it on down\nThe other one minute ... seconds to go and the Bengals park in Kansas City territory on the forty eight yard line\nWith two time outs left but they're taking their sweet time getting to the line

just flat out quit yep [noise]\nUm you know first game of the year I'm sitting here watching Michigan Notre Dame on the big screen here in Studio ... the palatial studios out here in Culver City California and they lose twenty four to Seventeen competitive game could have done either way and\nI said to myself you know it's funny because I thought before the season this is the best team or about had Michigan because he finally has a play making quarterback what's he hasn't had this is the best defense he's at and this is his babies are all his recruits no none of the previous goats are so this has to be the year for him this year\nAnd I said you know if they went out there to control their own destiny which sounded ridiculous at the time but\nThey beat in Wisconsin the beating Penn State or the I mean they beat Wisconsin and Michigan State they get Penn State at home next than Ohio State it's funny they do control their own destiny I is there any way you can keep them out if they went out here\nIf they went out I don't think no yeah they go twelve and one their loan losses to Notre Dame I guess what you I really think and it's kind of crazy to say this because it's a head to head\nBut if Notre Dame were to stumble let's say to USC to close out the seat and\nI think you put it in Michigan I I Am champ over Notre Dame and I think you know a lot of Notre Dame folks will get upset but you know you're looking at the thirteenth data point which the committee has brought up multiple times which Michigan would have in their favor um and\nThey would have won twelve straight games so I think I I I think Michigan certainly does control their own destiny and yeah it's I mean for Notre Dame right now other than winning out they are the biggest Michigan fans out there because the rest of their schedule is\nHas not turned out to be bearing a lot of fruit Florida State who they have it in a couple of weeks\nOr isn't very isn't very strong USC gets obliterated by Utah Stanford places Washington state this weekend in Stanford\nI mean at one point as a top ten team they certainly don't look like a top ten team that price love dealing with the\nThe health he has um so Notre Dame is certainly sharing from Michigan because aside from Ellis used when over Georgia that Notre Dame went over Michigan's probably the second most important result we've had in college football to this point\nAlabama is ridiculous good um you know the ... they're always good they always have NFL players all over the field they're all you know winning and winning national championships anyway even though they haven't had a great quarterback in the Nick Saban era you know you look at a\nYou know that they've had good manners they've had some guys backup quarterbacks in the NFL maybe but this kid to its special this this kid is the best quarterback in Alabama that I've seen ... I I think the Heisman Trophy for him is on lockdown right now uh assuming he doesn't get hurt the rest of the year\nLSU I don't think he has enough officers to beat them even though they were at home next I looked at this Clemson team Tim especially with Trevor loans playing the way he did yesterday I I I think that the team right there if anybody's going to be in Alabama I think that the team\nWell and they've got a I mean they've got a pro defensive line yeah yesterday yesterday was an important game for Clemson because you look at their schedule Dave and even if they had just squeaked pass and the state I think there will be a lot of questions about clumps of not saying it would have been enough to hold them out\nBut their schedule just because of the weakness of the ACC in Texas and I'm not being that strong or their schedule really wasn't making up to be that that\nAh that impressive but what they did yesterday was kind of\nUh what what ... told crash Davis which was you know a announces presidents with authority that's what they did yesterday was just they just squashed NC State and said look\nYou know you're undefeated good for you where the real deal and uh this defensive line is is going to be very interesting match up and I I never liked to say they're the only team that can beat Alabama because you know Alabama's tripped up against old miss and in recent years when they\nYou know they were talented but no one really anticipated that but yeah this is Alabama\nOh my God looks like just the cardinals I think\nThey played it let's say in Tuscaloosa under college rules who wins that game [laughter]\nI'll I'll still take the cardinals rather than add that to has been just phenomenal their ... their first half as their first have to have been ridiculous\nMichael Vick with accurate throwing are there it's important I mean he is right on the money with his throes it's unbelievable\nYeah it really is it's it's stunning how how impressive he has been\nNo let me ask you one more question here when when we're talking about final fours and ... and all the different scenarios let's say a couple of teams lose in the top ten here how about\nIs central Florida a dark horse or if they go undefeated again this year and a couple of teams Lewis ahead of him I Know we're going to talk about their schedule here which is an equal the other teams will they keep 'em out again this year with a second undefeated season\nI mean I think they need a lot of things that happened um I I think they need Clemson to lose maybe twice me Notre Dame they get out of there are there's they just need a lot of\nOf things to break their way I think there are very good football team and I'm curious to see when they play South Florida the clothes that the regular season and look I work on the navy broadcast the navy played Houston over the weekend that team is very very good and that\nLast year the conference championship game was central Florida against Memphis double overtime central Florida one sixty two to fifty five I think there's a a C. championship game potentially could be just as thrilling and I think Houston they play South Florida this weekend I think they're going to beat up on South Florida who's currently undefeated\nThis Houston team their quarterback the Eric\nA king is really good he can run he can throw he's got some precision their loan losses the Texas Tech sixty three to forty nine so I I Would watch out for that central Florida\nIn the A. C. G. I. V. chip game against you and that's going to be a tremendous game um but no central Florida with McKenzie Milton they're the real deal um but I just I find it really hard to believe that it's going to break their way this year just too many things have to do their\nGame against South Florida I think it was the last game of the regular season last year that was a ...\nYeah I Want him back and forth yeah I think they're going to lose one here before the season in central Florida yeah\nI think they lose the Houston I really do I I just it's really hard to go on to feed it to straight years I mean the pressure starts to get a new I gave them a lot of credit in the rain ... Memphis they were able to win that game you know come back from down Thirteen\nAnd hold on for clock management I Know you're thinking of that you are by Mike nor villain company in that game but\nYou know it it the pressure starts to sink in on them they've won what twenty games in a row at some point they're going to slip up\nI'm not cheer for it I I I've been pulling for UCF I think this is a good football program you know anyone who says they're not\nThey're not good it is now the thing is that watching football there are good football team I just don't know if they are worthy of one of the four spots in the play\nIf they go undefeated again is it going to be another national championship parade to Disney World am I going to have rings and all the players and have a big ceremony and they put up a national championship black and a flag in their stadium this year you think they'll do it again if they go out for you to\nGo on Twitter right now and Danny White there a D has already put out a statement talking about how this is unfair uh because of the college game day crew was I guess was talking about over the weekend so I mean that's the funny thing you know Tim Brando was fired up last weekend about Notre Dame being in the top four\nWe haven't even had the first playoff rankings released yet we all get them until you know next week let's just pump the brakes folks we don't know where UCF is going to be right a likely they'll be you know under ranks but we just don't know what this committee is going\nTo recognize them as the national champions last year that may

it automatically\nSpeaking the great players speaking a hall of famers let's get out to the guest hotline right now let's talk them National Basketball association of one of the all time great hall of famer top fifty player of all time good friend of the show over the years of course and an expert when it comes to all things National Basketball association\nIs a great Rick Barry what's that Rick\nI'm doing great to step in to be getting up in the morning\nYou don't my dad used to say anytime you're on the right side of the dirt it's a good day\nYeah it is and the older you get more you appreciate it that's for sure\nWell I was thinking about you last night when I watched all the MBA announcers calling that a huge role in a donnybrook in the Lakers are rockets game last night I was thinking that that was you played in the NBA back in the old days of the NBA that that that's like that's like nothing compared to the brawls you used to go through\nWell yeah and the old days to to kind of make it look like it\nWas a social her teeth I'm not much not much going on there and it and it's great because these guys are so big and strong and powerful and you know somebody could really get hurt I mean you know we go back to the unfortunate situation where I'm John ... and in the NBA\nRealize that you just can't allow that type of stuff to happiness so that could have been very very hard guy to lose their composure and then get into a fight you start throwing punches it's it's just not the right thing so I'm Glad that nothing worse happens\nYou know I Know people out in LA are already starting to panic out here with the Lakers I started out oh into but I remember when he went to Miami a few years ago I think they started out what one in five one in six or something it takes time to gel when you put a new team together especially with a super star player\nNo question about that you know it does take time to do it and you know other people have to step up I mean LeBron can't do it all by themselves by himself it just doesn't work that way I'm trying to you know they try to bring in some some veteran players do some Rondo coming and they're doing it I mean they it's\nJust a matter of time and you know zero to Israel bickering I mean they were in this game and they just lost control of things the late in the basketball game and they almost beat one of the best teams I mean those in the finals of the western conference so I I wouldn't be overly concerned at this particular juncture\nYou know there are horrible guy one thing I got to put up one thing I got to find somebody can shoot the ball really these are from outside this Little Rock and create stuff\nI mean you can't go on through can't go there for Fifteen countries [noise] what was then you know shoot horrific percentage you got it now and today's game\nYou gotta have some people who can knock down three point shot at a different game that it was back when I played I mean if I took some shots at these guys take now to put on the bench a and now I mean it's becoming a prolific situation where guys are shooting forty forty five forty eight percent crazy numbers\nAnd you can't beat it team if you're not making for three point shots nowadays\nWe read my mind right because they were minus twenty four points on breeze against Portman it might have Eighteen last night and they were the worst three points shooting team in the late last year ... plus they're horrible defensively they're given up about a hundred and twenty eight points a game so far\n[laughter] yeah well as you know this is the two areas and neither one area mainly obviously number one district defense you have to be on a nightly basis and make it a little bit more difficult for it to be able to score points and then you have to be able to score points\nDefense wins championships yeah but not if you don't have any outfits are going to score some points\nYou know written the Lakers have again they'd wrapped it in the second round the this kid to see the female holy you pronounce his last name whatever it is he was knocking them down in the summer like he is a great sooner he can really knock him in Kansas as well he hasn't wait a second so far I kept saying why not put him in for a few minutes and they can stretch the defense out knock you down\n[laughter] yeah well I mean that's obviously loops decision as to what he wants to do and it'll bring a wall slowly starting with the people that he wanted to see how that works if not you start making some adjustments it's kind of like fine tuning in engine you gotta you just have to kind of see how it goes you start out with what you have\nAnd then you find do it and I'm I'm sure there'll be some adjustments native things don't get a little bit better in the areas that we just talked about\nWhat do you think about the suspensions record brand name from getting for a raise Armando getting three and the NBA ruled that he spent ... leads me which I think sort of ... maybe more than more than three games and see if he's got to\n[noise] yeah well I'm ... I'm definitely had for you to students get or the entire thing what he did was he started the whole thing yeah there was absolutely no reason whatsoever he fouled hardened underway to the basket I mean what justification did he have for shutting him like that\nI mean that was ridiculous that was just a very immature things to do and to try to all of the other things and then I don't know what the heck did he spit on what the heck was Raj on thinking about um you know somebody's face I mean the guy I think that got screwed more than anything it was was a cp three I mean you know\nYour natural reaction somebody spits in your face yeah how do you sit there and say okay\nThank you know what are you doing I mean yeah I mean and he didn't and here's the thing he didn't react by throwing a punch\nIf you saw the video yeah he got to the finger up there and stuff and then ... threw a punch on top of that\nAnd so it would have gone to expect that he was supposed to stay and you know sit there and just take 'em spinning in his face and not respond to that and so I really do think that if anything you know maybe one game only she'd be three for having somebody there 'cause he paid them actually throw punches\nAnd then you know ... ... comes in and and and comes in what things are going on when he was pulled away if it comes back and it throws a punch you know I mean maybe more than four\nFor his ... he did a sucker punch in the back of someone's head yeah it could it really hurts them with that thank God it didn't blame\nThe great Rick Perry the hall of fame around with days matured NBC's once we don't want somebody to knock on your Golden State warriors seven right now there are a game of the year against the nuggets of seven minutes to go in the game but as we always say Rick if they're playing warriors basketball and stay injury free especially when they get cousins back and there's nobody that's going to beat them to see you\nKnow they play worries basketball everybody's healthy ah it it seems very unlikely that anybody would be able to beat him and a seven game series however they have a tendency sometimes I play or yours basketball and we don't know what the situation is going to be\nInjury wise or how well they're playing at that particular juncture of the season that's another factor those that remain factors\nAre but you know we saw what they're capable of doing the other night in Utah I mean that was just a great come back on the road to against a very good basketball team and they still have plenty of time left and just want to see if they could pull it out but\nYou know playing I can tell you right now playing in Denver and you're traveling stuff that the altitude hazard impact on some kind of really truly does not get seem to play exceptionally well when they play against the warriors they get all pumped up at every team's going to try to do it that's the one thing about the worries this year\nSalon pasta ... plus cream or

understand it we don't have all the reasons that people spread this\nBull how painful body\nBut it probably involves hormone disturbances including lowest Erin Toner levels stress\nInsomnia or sleep disorders could be on some genetics it could be passed down by some genetic\nProblems\nInflammation a big factor fibromyalgia often occurs with other inflammatory conditions such as arthritis ruined joins I ruin toyed arthritis lupus and many of those other conditions that are inflammatory\nDo a good dosage\nTo counteract the pain inflammatory markers and the wellbeing of those that are experiencing fibromyalgia would be six hundred milligrams of gr cumin and Boswell young along with two American essential oil with two rounds\nAnd Frank it's in oil at least twice a day and says these are very very safe non toxic and may pay double that does for a few days or maybe a few weeks I like to do what it's called a loading dose\nIf we take certain nutrients herbs vitamins minerals and we take a daily dose age for a healthy person\nWe can expect to get well if we're really really sick I have pain have muscle pain that whatever it might be you can expect\nTo reverse all bad to repair

sure you have fish oil right\nWell we have a number of them may get omega three is that the only one we have omega three omega six\nOmega five omega seven and omega nine and they are all developed under a different change the length\nOf the fatty acids so I'd like to take a closer look at all make us sick there's some complications and some things we should know about omega sex and where does all make mistakes come from well first of all\nOmega six is essential that means I body cannot make it but we can't live without it and they have already investigated what happens to an individual\nGet enough omega sex and there are symptoms that occur in individuals that don't get enough omega six so it becomes essential\nOmega ... fatty acid meaning is required by the human body it can't live without it\nBecause of the body can make it it must be consumed in the diet do we have essential fatty acids that means we can't make them in our body\nWe have to get them from an a dietary source\n\nProteins which are made up of amino acids I called the essential amino acids because we can make some of them\nBut we can't make all of them so they become essential to our help because we need to get them from a food source to make sure that we have plenty of essential amino acids an essential fatty acids now just adds a little bit of a side note there are no\nEssential sugars or a central carbohydrate we can live without them we don't need them\nAnd why is all make mistakes important Wellington belt improper wound healing proper bone density proper metabolism of the body reducing the risk of diabetes\nBut we have to moderate\nOur omega ... fatty acid intake the problem today where they'll make a sex as we are getting just too darn much of it\nWe need it but it's very small quantities and it really should be in a ratio with omega three fatty acids\nWe would somehow get like to get omega six\nAnd a one to one ratio with omega three that made equal parts\nThe same quandary will make a sex as omega three but we can get a little bit more all make us sick then to make a tree without causing a problem maybe like two or three times more omega six that omega three\nBut in the American diet a typical American diet is around Fifteen to sixteen times moral make us think then omega three\nAnd I've even seen reports went up as high as twenty to thirty times more omega six that'll make its rate\nSo why are we concerned about too much will make us sick if it's essential children have more because it's better and since we need it\nIs it more better nothing is better more if we have too much you know you could die with drinking too much water but we could die without enough water everything is a poison determined by the quantity that we consume\nBeing Jacob will make us X\nAnd y omega ... is a threat is because if the pro inflammatory compounds so the more omega sex we get the more information our body will have\nOur joints are more inflamed our heart can be come inflamed our brain which now some experts believe that all the time or disease is an inflammatory process of the brain dimension dementia or depression are all form of an inflammatory process of the brain\nAnd will make a sex for most Americans has increased over two hundred and fifty percent in the last several decades while omega three attack has fallen by forty percent why so much\nWell because they'll make us sick is found in vegetable oils particularly corn and soybean\nBut also in South la ... oil sunflower seeds oil peanut oil all the vegetable oils because they are used in manufacturing almost every package goods in the country\nThey're cheap corn oil and soybean oil we're never consumed oils were never consumed the only oil that was really good zoom for centuries with olive oil sesame seed oil they were consuming for centuries\nBut corn and soybean oil have only recently begun to be used in our\nThere are found in mayonnaise cookies cakes\nFast food salad dressings process for a variety of of foods we consume do they use or make a sex\nBecause of the cheap oil and they have to use some oil in our process they do the more processed foods you eat the more omega ... you will adjust\nThe typical American diet is way out of whack between the amount of all make mistakes and the omega three that we required to be healthy while omega six is essential\nGetting too much can be a complication causing inflammation yes we need water right can't live without it we can go two months without food we can go a few days without water but if you drink too much water you'll die\nFour or more cups of coffee\n\nA day we're forty two percent less likely to have their cancer comeback than non coffee drinkers they were thirty three percent less likely to die from their cancer or anything else any other form of death\nDuring this study one powerful study found that colon cancer survivors just as a way to prevent the un and lower the risk\nOf death\nWho drank four or more cups of coffee a day we're forty two percent less likely to have their cancer comeback than non coffee drinkers there are thirty three percent less less likely to die from their cancer or any other\nCause during this study\nSuch a simple inexpensive way to lower your risk of disease and especially cancer\nHow many people have seizures and now there's a way to treat seizures with diet which has been around for a long long time going back to almost Nineteen twenty\nAnd that is that Quito Jenna diet for seizure control\nI think the Quito Jenna guy it was inappropriate diet for anyone who is sick and healthy and I don't mean sick with the flu or cold I mean always chronically ill no matter what it is\nI think people suffering from arthritis suffering from cancer suffering from all kinds of diseases and they have switched to the ... diet\nAnd well it didn't pure cancer off the bat but it's certainly reduce the risk of cancer spreading it ... people died right it said there are a threat is was improved dramatically significantly\nAnd it has been helping kids with seizures\nThe gender guy it emphasizes\nNatural healthy fats and proteins but not considered a high protein diet some people say oh you don't become a hydrate and you're on a high protein diet you\nKnow I'm On a healthy protein intake not a high but I think I think our intake\nOf proteins should be high or higher than we are today our body squeezed out all the water our body is all protein\nHow do we repair our wounds how do we care our muscles how do we keep our muscles strong how do we maintain good health protein\nWe don't need carbohydrates in sugar we can get all what we need from proteins and\nFats and in fact\nThe level of protein that we require has changed dramatically in the last hundred and twenty five years we always and this this isn't a problem that I have with nutrition in in in general\nWe don't know how much vitamins and minerals we really need today because there is no evidence as there was no reason to study nutrition in fact the drug companies are against nutrition\nBecause they're Christian would make people healthy and healthy people don't need drugs\nAnd the drug companies influence all of our medical training they subsidized medical schools they paid for drug studies all this goes on as an emphasis on\nNot nutrition therapy so\nWe once thought that we needed old point eight percent or grams rather gives me hope point eight grams\nOf protein per pound or ... body weight so we weigh approximately a hundred and fifty pounds that is approximately Seventy five kilos so we would need somewhere between sixty to Seventy five grams of protein to be healthy\nNow is this the new study no\nYes the equation will develop in the Nineteen hundred actually Nineteen hundred talked about a hundred and Eighteen years old and no one has ever change\nHow much protein we require to be healthy at that time they didn't have the equipment does acknowledge the the way to analyze protein intake color and how much you know as as we need it\nAnd now some of the top experts that had been studying\nProteins into eggs believe that we need somewhere between two and three grams\nOf protein per kill a body weight so taking the same one hundred and fifty pound person which is approximately Seventy five kilos now we might need somewhere between a hundred and fifty and two hundred grams of protein per day\nThat's not high that's average do we're not looking at a high protein diet working at a protein diet with bats\nSo the key point although Quito Jenna diet it's emphasized natural healthy fats and proteins and drastically restrict carbohydrates to less than two to four percent of daily calories\nIn fact you could live very very very healthy on protein and fats you don't need sugar absolutely nobody ever need any sugar\nAnd carbohydrates the only way they are metabolizing the body is due converts to sugar so starch grain potatoes pancakes crackers you know that's what most people eat today\nThe emphasis on the American diet is carbohydrates in sugar because we were scared to death\nFor no reason at all that fats were bad for us bats are not bad for us if we emphasize healthy bat can we avoid beyond healthy fats you can't say in a general statement bats are bad for us our pets are good for us\nYou have to look at which bats are we talking about by talking about the good fat then we can have a lot of those good fats are you talking about the bad bad\nBad bad or omega ... fatty acids the good bad\nOlive oil avocado oil macadamia not only on nothing seeds cream butter eggs meat bad all these are good for us and lard they're all good for us stuck back\nAll these are good for us all these are good that still the key point restricts carbohydrates we don't need cut hydrate there are no central sugars there are no a central carbohydrates but\nThey're already central proteins and they are essential fats\nAnd here's a new study on sixty kids with epilepsy that could not be controlled by drugs kids were age three months to seven years\nTo trial lasted twelve weeks\nThe treatment was effective in fifty six percent of participants as a study and fourteen patients were seizure free\nNine had a significant reduction and seizures and six had at least fifty percent fuel receive fewer seizures than before going on in the diet\nThe effects were seeing quickly and in fact in just two weeks of the study they saw the major benefits of the diet stopping the seizures\nSo what happens to a body on this type of diet died of protein that\nYou could primarily live on protein alone because real most protein foods\nContain fat thinking about it have now you meet the all contain fat because we can't digest good proteins consume good proteins and digest them without that\nTalent don't give skim milk or two percent or fast rate breast milk from from the mother to the infant is fifty percent fat how the Peter Jennings die of stops seizures is not ...\nThey don't understand how it works but when carbohydrate diet carbohydrates in general the intake is reduced and fat and protein intake is increase the body switches\nFrom sugar as energy source just flat or key tone as energy source and that is a difference between the primary energy source from sugar fat\nTo him

if they bring them back I don't know that he's going to be one of the top guys\nGiven that we're getting close to the trading deadline any word on any possible trains the Packers might be interested in making\n[noise] well no I mean there's you know you're only be speculation on our part they don't ever talk or trades or to put their hand\nOr anything like that now you know where they make a trade certainly I think if uh\nYou know and I think the trade deadline is is actually a week later this year uh allowing teams to get a ... a week further into their season determining whether or not they they want to make a deal and there are more trades I mean you used to be at a league that you never saw trade\nAnd and now you're seeing more of them I'm at this stage of the season so you know who they are wouldn't they make a deal I I think if you're going to make a deal it's going to be for a pass Russia you know somebody that's going to help you on that that part of the game\nUm and I think what you're looking I I don't remember the guy's name but he's replaced with Arizona in Arizona right now is that there's a sinking ship\n[laughter] and and uh and and so if there ever ... you know the answer in rebuilding team or they've got a guy that I think has a year this year and next year left in his contract and I think he gets paid a lot of money but you know the Packers can certainly uh\nYou know can certainly afford to to sneak that under their salary cap and I'm In and then get a bona fide pass Russia or so I I think that's the kind of if you're going to see the Packers make a deal that's gonna be the kind of thing they they passed the first time around\nUm and and on and on you know making a big splash deal and and I think if they if they're going to be better and making up a little bit of a playoff pushy or they're going to need to probably get some past Rochelle\nBill is ah looking ahead to the rams game as bad as our defenses look with the exception of the buffalo a game and I guess there's been some quarters or houses they looked OK\nI mean my goodness if we can hold them to under thirty five I think we'd be doing a good job but I don't know if I can put up forty points in the game right now\nYeah well that's a question um and you know the whole thing of it is is something many of the teams we played and you know the Packers are played have probably been a little bit better defensively so\nI'm not so sure that uh they couldn't put up a lot of points but you know you're going to have to at some point you're going to have to make a stop otherwise\nYou're probably not going to score at least the next two teams you know and and especially on the road I mean if you get these teams that land will feel it it's a little bit different story but you know you're going to play in Los Angeles and then you're going to play and Fox Pearl and those two teams\nAre having going off and simply especially at their own places so uh I I think it's going to be a tall order I mean if the Packers could figure out a way to win one of these two it would be unbelievable you know in terms of or they would be headed moving forward\nNow but there are any point under ... point undergoing believe right now in the ground game is it ... ... the two which would most likely be the one that they might be able to win\nBrown sorry to say I mean I think that you know the whole thing that is I think you can score points on either one of them you know so\nI I don't I wouldn't be going to be smart enough to sit there and tell you they're going to be this team and not this team or or vice versa but um oh I Know is that coming off of buys Mike McCarthy's record is pretty good\nWhether it be a home game or a road game\nUm the rams haven't had thereby yet they are seven and also they you know I ... you know I just don't know enough about the the opposing teams like the you know as the rams if they got are they getting that fat cat mentality and thinking that they've arrived and don't have to work hard and all that I mean you know sometimes stuff like that happens and now you get a Packers team that's desperate\nUm they're coming off of the pie so they are well rested\nUm you spend an extra week game planning for one team\nI you know ... this this could be the rams gained could be ripe for a Packers victory I'm not predicting that [laughter] but um you know if you were going to win one out of the two that might be the one the other thing about the rams that that I think strikes me even more than the patriots is\nNot only do they have a great passing him but they got a great running game\nYeah and and so there is that that's what makes the rams in my opinion so tough for him in the quarterbacks playing good the receiver of playing God but tore girlie may be\nYou know maybe one of the top three or four running backs and all the football right now and uh and and they got going on on both ends and and then while you know sometimes they struggled to give up a lot of points and they'll sometimes struggle to to stop teams but they also\nUm do have a a really good pass rush and an errand Donald May have the best defensive linemen and all the football he had four sacks yesterday\n[laughter] there's a there is uh\nFor sure bill on ah what do you pick it right now who would you who would you pick to being a Super Bowl you know for me obviously it'd be the rams but other than the patriots I don't know the you had some teams looking pretty strong in the AFC but who you are to picks me to be in the super\nBowl while at the at this point I'm and I would probably throw the rams in Kansas City at you know not to do with that and and those are those would probably be the the two teams I Would pick right now I'm In Kansas City is unbelievable and they're playing with a rookie quarterback that that seems like he's like man I Believe\nFor six or seven years already you know he doesn't make any\nHe doesn't make stupid mistakes he doesn't have any not plane anywhere close to to a rookie and and he is just really a lot of fun to watch I mean I\nSometimes I have a hard time watching the AFC teams I I'm going to end up the guy you know and I'm watching that game last night against the Bengals and it just like Kansas City is a fun team to watch\nOut I agree with you know he's on pace obviously for rookie of the euro may be maybe a MVP isn't the lead to though are you interested in Laredo that rate\nIs going I don't know if there's ever been a rookie MVP but I'll tell you one thing through seven seven weeks or you know you certainly putting his name of the mix\nThat's for sure why one or maybe too quick final questions here where do you uh what do you think it's going to take the when the ... the north and what do you predict the Packers are going to send our well\nWell I mean they're uh you know the Vikings have poor when some of the ... uh you know there there are only a half game in front of the Packers at this point in time they played one more game show\nUm you know they'll have to take their by week off in the Packers will have a chance to get that one back at some point um you know I think the uh I I think the Vikings are the best team in the division\nUm but I tell you one thing I what's making this division difficult is I mean you saw the bears almost knock off New England yesterday\nRight um you know there is a is that\nThere is no ... I mean even the lions who beat the Packers already are three and three and I and I thought the lions and especially after the first week they just look downright ugly against the jets and the and the very first game and then since then they've been pretty good so uh there's so much that the division\nTogether from top to bottom is so much better so you're going to get a game for their ... you know you just can't play Detroit and say well they've got this one you know many lost twice to the lions last year they lost two of them are already this year\nSo um I I mean I still I I I don't think it's impossible to win the division because everybody's clumps right there together but you know they'll get another shot at the Vikings and and this one is going to be in Minnesota and you're probably going to have to beat them on the road and the Packers haven't been very good on the road now what's it going to take for them to\nYou don't have to be at least in contention in order to have a chance well you know they've got to be a little better on defense and probably a lot better on defense because they're going to have to make up for some defensive deficiencies but they're going to have to figure things out on defense my pet and it's going to need to get\nA something going war he devises some schemes that allows these guys to to blitz a little bit more and put more pressure on the quarterback in my opinion that really the defensive side is the key\nOkay well I Know one thing for sure you'll keep us posted a where's your title town reports on what's happening on Lombardi avenue and yeah\nI Know no doubt about it\nI'm Selma over under I mean he went through the Packers\n[noise] um I think you know there was a three wins right now right\nUm I think a ten when this wouldn't be really really good for them right now\nSo that's that's what you shoot for um you know you've got that you've you've got ten left to play in that and that means you gotta win seven of the town I think that as a I think that's the number that I Would put down right now based on what the football team I see on the field\nOkay well I Know you've got to get to work but we appreciate your ah your time on this morning and uh\nAnd we look forward to the future updates on the title Tom report\nOkay sounds good anytime guys thank you very much bill you have a super fantastic to\nBy by the guy from the titles on report\nAnd would that will take our first break and we'll be back with more Monday morning quarterback burn up through these messages\nHi I'm Katie there for me he's after I got to make their flu pregnant a movie and incorporating Packers the sauce and they're never bang bang time to find your dream home by the time are lucky to get down\nLet's put it this way if it comes down to ... versus McCarthy Rogers wins [laughter] there's point 'cause he's thirty four years old and when you're thirty eight ... ... yeah yeah right now what's McCarthy versus Rogers and one of them is going to go back as soon as today and I think that the the\nBalancing act that when you have a superstar like that if you go back to Brett Farr and one of the biggest mistakes and you know much of a fire fan I Am but one of the things I didn't like was one Mike Sherman allowed Brett Farr to train at home during the off season instead of coming for these many camps and suddenly it's like\nThis isn't like he's flying coach you know we're sitting next some three hundred and fifty pound guy next to them that sweaty worries wedged in a seat at his own why is that his own private jets from Hattiesburg\nTo a liberal field he has a nice house here in in Green Bay he wears a red shirt like every quarter back which means they can't get hit right it's not that hard\nSherman should've said Brett from a from a training standpoint I'm okay with that but from a leadership standpoint we need you here we need you here as the leader of this team leader the pack we need you here to tell you what the\nThing that will give Rogers credit for he's at the TAs\nAnd yellow fireball I supposed to wait let's see what happens when he becomes thirty seven\nYears old I was worried about the next few weeks it's going to it's going to be very very interesting um I I from what he said what bills than about them and the reasons why they're slow getting planes off at times [noise]\nThing goes I think after hearing that reinforces what you and I have been talking about they need to simplify things\nWell they had to simplify things and also what it is I I think it was and I don't mean to keep upbringing far but I think the year they won the Superbowl Brett Farr made a comment we're far off as we thought we were so good we could even tell them that plays we're running and we and we would still acute to play\nRight now it's Rogers more worried about it and this is my opinion\nIt's my Rogers is talking idle Rogers are more worried about other receivers going to be in the right places and what is a defense going to do instead of said just come out and do what we're going to do\nYou know what I mean don't don't worry about so much what the defense I mean obviously you got to look and see how they're going to blitz are going to check down to a a quick past play or whatever but what you should almost have you got five guys that are eligible for receiving you should almost have one of them in each player where one guy's going to be checked on guy\nI Wonder are coming out of the by we should I think a cop out when we see common some of the guys who have been injured comeback how that changes I Would think that should change the often quite a bit um because you'll have some experienced folks that he trusts out there\nYeah I agree and I think ... knows you know he's making like eight million a year or whatever he knows he's on a he's got to have a hell of a year and he hasn't had a is that an okay you're one of these measures are two or three games\nAnd I think of all I think they're going to be coming back I haven't seen the injury report for this week yet but I Would hope that they were I thought some of whom might have been coming back last week and so\nThe good thing though like the bill said they found out they got some good rookie receivers and they're just going to get better and this is great experience for them\nYet other than cod that receiving corps pretty doggone young\nYeah yeah and but they'll get better and the other thing I'm worried about is the ... I we didn't get a chance to talk about is the offensive line play\nWell but part of that is riders holds a ball long time ago now that's what there's times that he makes some great place because of that but I got to believe us as many interceptions as farmers thrown Rogers may go down as the most sec player per per game average um\nRogers is miss you know he didn't start play until he was probably twenty three or four or five or because he was drafted in what old five or five or six or seven he sat the bench for the most part and then he's missed another at least a year of his time so that being said\nI Would bet you he'll end up being one of the most ... quarterbacks now some of that you often supplying but\nYou know four seconds in the NFL is an attorney uh as far as a quarterback and you know the idea is to get the ball your hand and shoot a two and a half seconds he holds the ball a long time does make some great things happen because of that but also takes a lot of sex because uh\nUh I think there again that they pick up the pace maybe that helps with that as well as the running game you know you got a runner this used them you've heard bill Scott basically with kind of aspiration you too predictable and you're on science right now\nI forget what game it was Carl we we're Aaron Jones ran ran ran and got like a a first down and then six yards and other first out and then we did pass pass pass part yeah [laughter] it was like are you kidding me\nFeed him the ball and you know there's nothing wrong with doing a play accent in there but why why not keep the run ...\nSays I and we need to establish the game on and so that was the only game\nIn established and then you went away from it that's the only thing that drives me nuts with Mike mccarthy yeah ... he runs he speaks out of both sides of the mouth that air Jordans does not there's no let up in a kid till he's on the ground that's it I mean ... I Do too\nI mean give him the ball give him the rock that will free up passing lanes\nPassing lanes of play accent yes so much more so [noise] um well that will take her last night and went back with

the Packers can play I I don't think that they are going to finish eight seven in one eye there they are better than that on paper I think they're better than that what they're going to you know figure out what they're going to solve\nUm I just I just even if you would just think it's hard to it's going to happen again you know what seemed like an unstoppable rams team or going to New England it happened to beat the patriots because you\nBefore you boy all of a sudden coming out of the by but it's all he was like this team does have it there is there is some missing talent there's no doubt there are sort of been below average position groups there's no doubt about that but I still would think\nThat if if my cardio something up his sleeve to solve all there's something beyond just are rushing attempt that they should turn it around but you're now you're looking up at the\nToughest part of your schedule here over the next month and that's what's going to make it even the more

grab yourself some and get your so\nGood stuff from cars and SUVs they believe in better I'm looking at what's available out\nThere in the market and I know a lot of people are talking more so pitching than anything um but there's a guy like say Patrick or but it ... when you start looking at guys that are under the age of thirty thirty two guys Patrick orbit and they could have all day\nThat's it everybody else's over the age of thirty you're going to overpay for I don't even know if you'd want him\nBut Patrick or but it's kind of a guy that's going to bank I think on on this off these other than maybe ... could opt out\nOf the two years sixty five million remaining on his contract so he can go out and get more money he's still worth the money but I don't know what are you going to get on the open market he's getting right now what thirty two point five a year yet he stayed put he gets a guarantee of Seventy million to the two thousand twenty seats right\nSo as so many gonna pay him forty million dollars a year for the next two years to get him out of LA I don't think so\nWho who have that money I mean the cubs are going to throw that money around looking at the big markets the Yankees yeah\nI don't know the Yankees have kinda changed their philosophy if you've noticed the last few years I was raised to be exactly they would throw the money\nThey're kind of like I mean they are household names but they're kind of building from within junkies I'm the red Sox now that the team that throwing money out of every age they are and there were three hundred million dollar team ... you know they're they're they're which why a lot of people wanted to see the brewers there was one of the small\nVersus the largest payroll you know to have to you know he was in the world series from completely different ends of the spectrum I'm but like I said ... that would be another guy now the ... the other question it and this is from Dave uh let's go to the phone call Dave listening to us in Hartford Dave how're you doing today man what's up\nI'm not a whole lot Albert yourself what's on your mind\nWhich has gone the what you and say the possibility of them yeah I Know they might need to go on welfare pitching like Bryce Harper it sounded like they maybe had a little bit of interest\nAt the trait that line and um but you know Ron getting older is that good and a sign up but if they go after ... ... at first and then they'd have to figure out the situation with a deal are\nYeah I appreciate the phone call I mean that's the other question that's floating around out there in major league baseball who's going to end up with Bryce Harper and his services everybody can thinks that it's just a foregone conclusion he's going Chicago because he wanted to play with Chris Brian Chicago\nProblem is you're gonna have to and I know and I know there's no salary cap but I'm saying you have to pay Chris Brian who reportedly turned down what you know I forgot what the number was an outstanding amount of money\nAnd I think was it ... um well actually they're both kind of his buddy hypocrites Brian grew up together like All right Scott run your dog's name as regularly there both from Las Vegas right their lives are friends yeah but I mean that doesn't mean anything because Bryce Harper command like four hundred four hundred and fifty million dollars without\nMoney hideous take this year and only ... only about two forty nine with an opiate of what eight eighty nine which is still very good don't get me wrong ... mainly because of their home run right\nBut he started out really slow and everybody just assumed it was the pressure of the final year his deal now the team is still could afford it and they could still pay 'em as Washington if they want to commit to that Washington is probably likely place that he could end up staying\nRight you immediately think of okay that eliminates all the small to mid markets for the money is going to come in yeah four hundred million is way too much so where does he go where's he going to end up or\nWhere does he end up if the market just says okay we're not paying that right you know what I mean also does he want to win or did you want to go somewhere like Texas or somewhere where you could get the four hundred million and then kind of just spend the rest of your career to be a mediocre bad feelings go out and do you know I mean\nDoes he say I'm going to break the bank to go to go to a team or does he believed at least some of the bank to say I want to also when\nRight because he had the secret GM come out remember and he said he's he's losing player and losing organization and blah blah blah he doesn't care about winning so\nIs it more about his brand and his money or is it more about I Want to go to Chicago and go to Los Angeles and I want to win some World Series that's the other thing I mean Milwaukee let's be honest I mean Bryce Harper is it necessary Bryce Harper does a lot of cool things but\nThe knock on him is he cares more about flipping his hair around and being\nCool and me Mr little bad as many does about actually winning games so I mean you guys like that kind of becomes\nIntertwined you know once you get that big and you're kind of leading your team you want to win but you're also very much going look at me you know many of a child it was a perfect example those guys are both perfect examples but you look at guys like that and you just look at the history of major league baseball\nThe big names and it's like yeah it's nice to have those guys and they attract the fans and they attract the endorsements but I Want like three or four bends over us guys yeah they're going to go out and hit\nThree Christian yeah which is I Want yeah I got a job that would be a part of the family wants to win takes it to heart you know been quiet on assuming that gets the job done that's what you're looking for life and for people that say well look at Bryce Harper his numbers well look at him yeah you have to forty nine as you look ... Christian yellow just numbers right\nCompletely agree as American right there he he was Bryce Harper was fantastic\nUh in the second half of the season there is no doubt about that I'm not knocking him but you know you go back to June when the cat was hitting one eighty eight right also look at it like this okay so the cubs took a big risk and they sign a guy like you ... four in August she started to turn it around and then down the stretch in September hit to seven the\nProblem is I don't know if the brewers get bounced back like if you sign a guy like Harper and he'd bath to thirty five or he gets injured the first month of the season you're setting yourself back when you're paying all that money whereas the cubs get through all that money ... he misses the rest of the season you could still bring in guys like Murphy and you know other arms\nBecause you have more money I never asked to to have a good year this is the way his career has gone two thousand and twelve one hundred and thirty nine games five hundred plus it back to its two Seventy two Seventy for\nA couple of years later a year later to Seventy three so you figure about two Seventy value as the big here in Washington in two thousand and Fifteen puts them on the map hundred and fifty three games bats three thirty and O P s at one point one oh nine I mean it was fantastic\nNext year goes back hits to forty three now you only played one hundred and forty seven games they said was a little bit banged up eight fourteen O P s comes back last year big year again three Nineteen just smack in the hell out of the baseball he gives you what do you give us your twenty nine almost twenty nine\nFifteen at forty two so three Ninety this year it gives you a thirty for home runs but only hits to to ah to forty nine with an eighty nine O P s so next year would be the year that he gives you a big year but he's had it up and it isn't like he's a constant three Ryan Braun had better start to his career then then I Would say Bryce Harper had his\nThink about that for a minute and Bryce Harper is the biggest name in the market shorter my trout mhm you know you're going to take a quick break more to go Michael show coming up after this\nBreak where in Wisconsin bill Michael sports talk [noise]\nWhen you're hearing live high school sports right here on AM Thirteen Tony W.

CBS News\nNo payments but the house payment that houses a blessing\nWhen you buy a home and got eleven thousand dollars in debt and you have no money left in your savings account 'cause you've cleaned about trying to BP in mind you move in a house broken that Murphy will move in your spare bedroom and bring his cousin the Sallie Mae and they will set up housekeeping and broke desperate stupid in your house will start looking like a country song\nThat's what happens in the house is not a blessing it's a curse when your body is broke so you guys need to slow down and do this right because you've been through some hard times here to\nWhen you've been on a piano and vowed to move to a different city you're living with your in laws for God's sakes ... right\nYeah I I actually moved up here in January and I had to I had to start living with them for a few months but from my life become because she had to teach until April yeah on and then she she gave birth to her third daughter all in may so so it kind of had a lot of treasury made on right now you know what the ...\nTo the point that they they cross the line or a few years ago and contacted Sharon and her husband and said oh now the premium that you're paying one hundred percent of it won't cover the insurance costs so now if you want to keep the insurance not only is zero going to investments\nBut now even more has to be paid to keep the insurance active and that's how far we got in the discussion\nIs what I just said all correct Sharon yeah okay and what is going to face amount of this policy eighty thousand eighty thousand dollars and\nHow much money do we have from\nYou how much you earn your for one k.'s and they're now they're always\nWait we did have retirement account how much they pay total eighty four thousand mhm\nUm\nWe have a ten thousand dollar mark and to find that prayer is paid for good show kind of like\nSo you don't have much is cash value is in this house right now it's six thousand okay so and you have a pension plans as well you know\nOkay and so you're living on Social Security and eighty thousand dollars worth of for my husband\nStill work he he um have thirty six thousand in income mhm and he brings in Twenty one thousand in Social Security okay and that I felt like I don't what\nGot you in the face of amount of this policy you said it was eighty thousand dollars\n... we did look at that time is short for him but number one it really a lot like I said I get paid but number two he has battled cancer a couple of times yeah\nNon Hodgkin's lymphoma and so basically you know but they were like yeah very difficult very difficult but we don't know we we can lower that benefits\nSo what is the premium how much is that a year if\nI don't know how much Seventy seven\nA month yeah OK so eight hundred a year and you make thirty six thousand dollars a year\n[noise]\nUm well here's here's the equation and here's the way it works in your mind okay the purpose of this is to give you an extra eighty thousand dollars\nIf he dies before you do okay and so is that war is eight hundred bucks at this stage it's there's no investment value whatsoever so we're not going to the only question is you know you you don't have a huge mistake or that you you've got a small nest egg and the show to double it basically\nIf he were to die would be very helpful mhm and so keeping the insurance sounds really good with that in mind\nYeah they they don't know if that would only last three or four years anyway and they sent me wonder if that makes it\nOkay and they are going to make you stop any way they are going to pull the plug on yeah oh yeah okay and at that point you would catch it out and one of her cash value isn't there a\nVan and [laughter] I Would like to get it out now\nYou know way to get out and all the way to get out now as close a policy down right which ... which which means that you would you know if he passes away you'd have the four oh one K. money paid for house and be living on Social Security right\nYeah what'd you probably can make it 'cause I gotta feeling you guys are frugal people oh yeah and so you probably could make it on that but it's not going to be a dream come true I'm\nSo they have given you notice that at I'm\nSixty two are I'm sure I Seventy three or whatever Seventy years old they're going to shut the policy down regardless\nYeah well I Know I guess if we can be paying you know that find that would be over two hundred a month\nI think if a guy who can write or we we could lower than that benefit and and keep it going they felt if we can do that which is what I wanted to do it when the cash it out that I'm doing nothing\nYeah there there's not a great answer okay that's why I'm him and hauling a little bit I'm trying to think through it [noise] um\nUh my tendency is an eight hundred bucks a year right now to keep it for a while mhm okay I'm Seventy seven dollars a month even if you use the cash value you can have the cash value is beginning to pay the premium\nMhm and do you know it's going to do it's going to use up some about eight thousand dollars I'm probably going to do that\nAnd let the eight thousand dollars pay the premiums starting today and I'm probably going to leave it in place a couple of years\nWhen it starts being two hundred a month instead of Seventy seven months at that point I'm probably going to join his tribe and say let's cash it out mhm and close it down but I don't think it's going to make sense to keep this long for a long long time we're probably gonna keep a couple more years houses help\nBut then how is his health\nHow is the first time I went to a cancer free for five years and that's kind of hissing cancer free for two years good though I mean he he goes in and get a ... and every every six months or so to make sure it's not coming back or they stay aggressively that\nGood good I'm Glad to hear that ... ... ... ... I'm gonna I'm gonna let the a cash value pay the premiums for the next two years and keep it open uh-huh okay if a ... and I'm going to check on his health at that time\nIt let's say that he's got another episode with cancer going all the time then you pay the premium no matter what it costs and you keep it open if he if he's the cancers come back at any stage right keep you keep putting open at that point but if he's doing\nAnd everything's clean and two years from now you haven't seen a spot nothing's no problems anywhere I'm I'm probably drop and at that point\nOkay so that makes sense to me it wouldn't it wouldn't it be and so yeah\nYou know but I'm not you but but you're also not paying you know three thousand two thousand dollars a year which is what is going to be at that point yeah which is starting to be ridiculous with that kinda money you can throw money into investments to start having some money\nAnd um but but at this stage I I'm\nI'm hesitant to cancel it it's it's obviously a bad policy so I'll be sitting in a bad thing but it's your only option you're stuck with them so that makes it hard to discuss it hard to think about but I'm going to hold it two years like the cash value pay it at the end of that time if he's healthy uh and still cancer free I'm dropping it\nOtherwise I'm going to keep it if it's if it's got a health issue at that time so good question thank you for calling in and I'm Sorry you had this problem\nFolks you hear me yell and scream about cash value life insurance whole life life insurance universal library but life is rip off you just\nExperienced it you just experienced the back end\nWhat happened to see if you buy one of those patients are crap policy\nAnd you're sixty eight years old this is what happens is because the money they put in that that stupid but policy will be three hundred grand right now in mutual funds if I had to put it into that and a good investment instead of getting ripped off by this insurance company\nAnd if she was sitting there with three hundred grand plus the other four one K. of about four hundred thousand bucks plus their house is paid for she wouldn't even call me\nBut instead get through spat sassy instead of her the insurance company\nSo when your whole life agent says I don't really agree with Dave Ramsey because your whole life I just trying to rip you off\nThat's why your whole life agency in that and there's only two kinds of whole life agents ignorant and crooked 'cause if you understand these numbers and that story right there and then you still sell this stuff that makes you crooked\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself and if you don't understand these numbers and you're still showing that stuff that makes you ignorant\nAnd you shouldn't be selling their stuff and by the way folks in case you didn't know you'll get screwed up way more often by an enthusiast enthusiastic ignoramus than you will by a con artist\nSo most of the people out there selling this crap are enthusiastic ignoramus as they're not actual con artist smoke all Charlie sold me there is reason and Thursday as big ignoramus\nThat's all uncle Charlie we just nailed him right there\nBecause he probably not a crook if he'd actually sat down and looked and realize that share your if your brain assurance brand sold her that\nHe's not afraid of my friends like that you don't need enemy [noise]\nYou know he's good at three hundred grand and mutual funds easy for them what they dumped into this\nBrought a [noise]\nWhole life life insurance the payday lender or the middle class\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nHey folks let's talk about finding a ride home for your family the amount of new homes built continues to trend aboard year after year\nWhile this can be a great option it's not that simple you're just not picking up paint colors in an open floor plan there are many potential pitfalls you could run into is the process was not approach with expertise in caution\nThe builder has an agent representing their best interest not necessarily yours\nBut this is why it's crucial to have a real estate professional guiding you through the process who's on your team\nOur endorsed local providers are in the top ten percent of agents in their area who know how to spot a quality builder our email peas can help you navigate decisions wisely and get you the most bang for your buck and the heart of a teacher so you never feel lost in the process\nDon't take a risk on your biggest investment get an agent who looks out for you visit Dave Ramsey dot com slash E.
