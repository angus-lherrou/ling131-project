going on I mean it all ended up in the primetime game a three point between the chiefs and the patriots\nThat was highly entertaining\nOf course the or the Steelers ... uh Bengals game was entertaining as well and I'm a thrilling finish and one of the other games that was really interested in watching\nWas this Jacksonville Dallas game not that I thought it was a marquee matchup but to be honest we a lot of the other games as we can really kinda sucked and it was like oh okay ... there's going to be interesting this Jacksonville team\nLast a week before\nAnd um they're going to Dallas to take on his cowboys team and we'll say Blake bottles can rebound et cetera et cetera\nI never in a million years expected the Dallas Cowboys to post forty point some in Jacksonville Jaguars\nDefense never than a million years tennis I watch this thing I kept asking myself\nWhy the jacks playing so much damn zone coverage against this wide receiving corps\nTo me that makes\nNo sense I mean absolutely\nNo sense I mean we're talking about oh Colby usually this Kobe easily that I'm like really is Coby easily\nAlright he's I mean [laughter]\nIt's not like the guys kill it to be

is it that hey you can't get more pressure more consistently on deck Prescott\nAnd put those two guys on the island and when as opposed to play so I mean they played sauces on there were holes all over that the defense anti man this the fence by the way has given up Seventy point to the last two weeks Seventy\nNow I Know they've struggled a bit against the run up\nAnd I know Zeke went over a hundred yards\nWhich again I don't quite understand\nI mean if you're the Jacksonville Jaguars don't you go in there and go hey boys\nWe got one thing and one thing to do make sure you Eliot doesn't beat us\nAs Prescott beat us by\nWell everybody ... beat him\nBack beat him with his arm back beat him with his legs\nAnd I thought I thought a funny what Jerry Jones is like yeah that's that's what we need to back when he didn't run more and I'm like oh wait a second I mean as he can ...\nOr is he the large accent I mean listen Jerry doesn't care doesn't doesn't really care as long as it's a win he'll sacrifice anything for a while but I was I was a bit shocked\nThe way the whole thing unfold and why Jacksonville played so damn soft those two quarters that makes absolutely I mean absolutely no sense to me so now we look at the uh the NFC standings and you go wait a second\nDallas is right there\nI mean Washington at three and two but\nDallas is only a half game back in the last call at three and three at five hundred along with Philadelphia\nAnd of course and you've got the one in five giants so we'll see how this whole thing plays out but I was just scratching my head I just I I didn't get it at all\nOr meanwhile the Buffalo Bills have a bit of an issue of the quarterback well I mean they had a bit of an issue when Josh ... starting at least\nHe's got an elbow injury\nA challenge us and according to shop and government he's gonna be a week to week\nHe was forced out of the game on Sunday against the Texans and the third quarter\nWhen an MRI this morning\nA McDermott

with a touchdown and then through a pair of interceptions that ultimately kind of sealed their fate Sean McCoy on beat him and said I I still have a lot of confidence in him we just got to play better for him make place and make it easier for him to build some confidence within himself\nListen and appreciates the guy was lights out it was great\nI mean he threw the five interception to guess are the charges last year and nobody wants to give a guy a chance and my guess is when you play that position the quarterback position\nOr with the mindset of\nI can throw the and such I don't want to make the mistake I mean you have to make good sound decisions and try not to put the ball wrist but you can't throw the ball thinking I Can't do this I can throw the interception I got you know bad

Minnesota [noise] uh I don't know if it's a result or not we understand now that he was back and shoot around a practice with a team that he sat down and met with owner Glenn Taylor\nAnd that apparently they've come to some sort of agreement what does that mean how does this thing play itself out over [noise]\nI think the symbols and this is actually what an agent told me a few weeks ago\nOr you just said that there there's no reason you know that she doesn't have to train him you know he he's under contract a U.S all the videos only got a year left but\nHe's under contract and he's with the team currently and you know they don't have to move them if they don't want to or whether he plays and\nI'm sort of things to to be to be determined it sounds like he will play\nUm it'll be interesting to see other team reacts to his presence and and just kind of seen the chemistry there I I think you know if they can somehow resulted in touch it up uh I I think the Minnesota samples or line where it gets easier multi did\nIt's just a matter of like when this trade it happens it happens I I Would presume\nDoesn't mean that took place between Taylor and Jimmy Butler\nWas just about him staying put until they could find a suitable trade off or\nWhat that offer is we don't know and it sounds like they protect a quite a few different offers delights in Miami or possibly Houston so I think that there's a lot to be that's left on the table here tournaments throughout the season but I think\nThing that we always have to take into account um with these teams and how they negotiate this the closer you get the trade deadline the more willing teams are to start with more pieces they see their team on the outside of the playoffs looking in\nAnd day seems to me there's that claim that that can get 'em over the top and that's one of the teams are willing to pay more so I I'm not saying that I necessarily agree with Minnesota's completely I think Jimmy ... the way\nHe's been treated as best quite unfair but if you look at it now and you look at the situation as a whole uh the smart thing to do organization only maybe to sit this out as long as they can until they get a T

course Scott might lose the dirty dozen the picks 'cause he had patriots a mind is three and a half so he did lose but you know we'll get down friday but\nAnd I'm watching Patrick my home's started the game off not well\nHere's the thing about it although the patriots won this game\nThey almost lost a home game like we forget that this was a home game when it comes time for the post season and the AFC Championship game there's a good chance is going to be in Kansas City and not at Fox bra probably could be at arrowhead more so than Fox bro\nThat's going to be an important factor for both these teams if you're Kansas City\nWith what happened Sunday night at NBC you don't want to not have home field advantage throughout the playoffs if you're the patriots and it took a last second field goal for you to be Kansas City and you were the home team you don't want to have to play that game in Kansas City 'cause that result may be different\nI saw two teams that are fun to watch with great off fences there are going to be the two best teams in the last two teams standing in the AFC\nBut I'm not going to sit here and tell you the patriots are the better team right now I'm not\nBecause they rookie quarterback almost out too old Tom Brady think about that well he's not a rookie but he might as well be at one started last\nYear he had one started in the last game of the regular season and this is the first year as a full time starter so by week\nNumber Nineteen or twenty which would be when they would end up I guess it'd be weak number eight to one in every week number twenty I guess to be empty championship game\nPatrimony homes might be a different quarterback and even better than what we witnessed Sunday\nWhat I'm saying is there is no difference in terms right now of abilities when it comes to the chiefs and patriots\nBecause the biggest advantage that you would think Tom Brady of moms yeah that's an advantage but mold is pretty good\nThere's no advantage of doing the best\nReceiving threat right now on the patriots and the comparable guy on Kansas City in fact Sean I'm going to throw you in here right now right right now today would you rather Travis Kelsey this season or Rob Gronkowski to seize Travis Kelsey exactly for health reasons as well\nNow Josh Gordon is the X factor because by the time and they have the championship game to game comes around what's he and Tom Brady you have to be politically like thirty seven to the thirty nine snapped\nOr something like that but how do you stop to repeal\nThe don't fast nothing that secondary witness to stop piracy kill I mean he's just unbelievable I mean it speeds a weapon southern catch laundry and forty two yards three touchdowns so how'd the patriots all if there's anybody that's graded scheming and figuring it all out it's going to be bill ballot check but I'm not going to sit\nHere and tell you the patriots are the best team AFC I don't think anything separate them in Kansas City I think those two are far and away the best teams them see because Jackson who's got an a a guy named ... at the house\nRight so the one thing I'll tell you this Jacksonville not the same class that she's the

built for crying out loud right\nSo it's like I keep wondering because I Want competition I Want to see for football here and yeah college football's great but I watch to see who's\nComparable to the best who's going to knock the best off right the top of the mountains of Alabama\nSo we now down to Ohio State Notre Dame being the two teams\nIn the Michigan will rings credit miserable rain since the last day that played really good football they women close ones and they blew out Wisconsin but it's a big win horrible doesn't beep top Fifteen teams and he finally did give them credit for that and it was a blowout when\nWhen I watch college football Sean and maybe I'm wrong and maybe you do this while I'm watching teams\nSeeing how they stack up against the best right so I watch Ohio State with Dwayne Haskins and I wonder okay does this work against Alabama's defense I watched Georgia I said what's the weakness here and could they exploit Alabama's defense because that's the weakness on Alabama the secondary taken some injury heads with Trayvon digs out and he was as you know the top quarterbacks\nWatching Michigan I was thinking the same thing can shape Patterson move the football on Alabama\nTough to say so everything I Do when it comes to football every single week when I sit down and watch lots of college football is because I Want to have competition it's no fun and I've talked about the show it's no fun for me with the NBA to think okay the Golden State warriors do in the incredibly heavy favorites to win it all get again right\nIt's no fun for me to sit here and say well Alabama so far better than anybody else everybody's playing for second place I Hope that's not the case you are because I Want to have a fun final four in the college football playoff I Do can Alabama beat the answer is yes they can't\nThey've Alabama's defense continues to have struggles here and there and look Michigan Missouri's not attached right as good as true lock is in terms of the NFL qualities he doesn't really have a good team in Missouri\nIt's like one guy's not going to beat Alabama members South Carolina years government the jets had for first round pegs remember they took John Abraham out of South Carolina turn out to be pretty darn good offensive and right you know John Abrahams last year in South Carolina that went like Owens wealth\nSo it doesn't matter if you have a high NFL Draft pick on your team one guy can't do it all it's not a ton of talent in Missouri outside of drew lock\nSo it's not like Alabama got tested\nBut this is the fault with their schedule your college football where it's like I have to guess every weekend watching other teams going how would that stack up against Alabama\nBut man I think the biggest disappointment of them are like Penn State losing the ... Michigan state's disappointing\nYou know what James Franklin I said it after the last two Ohio State I'm going to say it again because you gave that rousing speech afterwards about how uh you know the where a great team or non elite team and what I say show look in the mirror as to why you're not in the league team right because that's stupid play calling I'm In a state again\nLook in the mirror again\nNow it's pretty much surely made us a bone had play and he's such a you know he's a veteran right like what\nIs he doing not going out of bounds I mean it was paying about six years what do you do go out of bounds you stop the clock black and he wanted to stop the clock\nAnd three just put it on James Franco and still have that go to that team and they continue to show why they're not exactly a leap look in the mirror you're a great team not only maybe it starts at the top that's the one that's not a game you can lose if you're Penn State\nYou knock yourself out of the uh the Big Ten championship equation because of that last or bad Michigan State team is not a good team but she says most disappointing top ten team in the pre season rankings until this win right\nBut nobody's more disappointing the Georgia I didn't come on down twenty down sixteenth on nothing at halftime and if you're Kirby Smart ... this is work coaching has to happen you can win based on pure talent he's done that\nBalls in your court what are you doing a quarterback now Jake from is not a very good quarterback let let's get this uh the sheen off of Jake from right Jake from was awful against the CEO came from is how many touchdown passes in that game to in the first ten minutes and that game easy\nI joined it wasn't even in this game I even had a fourth quarter you think maybe there'll be a second have come back you're only down sixteen and college football you could come back from a sixteen point deficit they couldn't do anything he got terrible play for the quarterback position from sixteen of thirty for the allergies defense is good they are that second he's very good\nBut you can't be losing that game that way you give a hundred yard rush or a hundred yard receivers your Georgia you got more talented that who's like twenty\nI'm not ready to call them fraud yeah 'cause I think Ellis was completely misjudged I think we all misjudged us you and here's why we looked at two problems with else you want their head coach Edwards Ron right to\nWe thought either the quarterback not good enough job arose is not good enough if they had like a two hour they would be six no right now they wouldn't be in Florida\nHere's the thing about you that defense better than we thought and they can run the football that's when it comes down to that the fences legit\nSo you look at LSU and you say okay that's one loss Georgia now has a law that may knock that whole conversation that we enjoy having which is what happens if you ah have a one last Georgia\n... doesn't really knock him out though George I can still win the FCC east right they can\nBe there at eleven and one twelve and one at the SEC championship game against an undefeated Alabama that they beat Alabama there's still a woman last team but Alabama's Wal Mart's team it doesn't knock 'em out now but I'm not going to write Alabama there not not after Saturday's perform and lo o Jake from now Jay from you know what I don't know we don't know about Justin Fields\nRight everything we base our thoughts on just the fields or what what he did in high schools the top recruit five star into the limited actually see him in right\nThat's all we are basing it on is is Justin feels going to go in there will be two on what a championship but if Jake from can't beat LSU he's not beating Alabama no it's not just so you might as well go to Justin Fields and see what you have I agree a hundred percent unless you've Kirby Smart will do it\nLet's see if Kirby ... smart will be no pun intended smart enough to make the move a quarterback but here's the problem I I don't know how Justin Fields looks in practice he might be worse than jak from at this point in his development\nThat being said Georgia's finished because if the if Jake from the best thing has a quarterback\nThere's no way there would be the Alabama I'm Sorry that I Know they get blown out might be the case for every other college football team by the way you know as you mentioned the you know what here's the thing not only do they not beat Alabama they get blown out by Alabama so the SEC just gets one team in the voice said she that's what we learned Georgia is not getting any unless they beat Alabama\nIn two weeks Georgia plays Florida that's where the FCC's potentially\nRight I mean think about that how crazy that and I think for the last to Kentucky I mean that he's maybe not as bad as we thought\nThere by the way it's good to have a good Florida it is\nIt's good to have a good Florida and you need a good Florida program unique talent and the FCC east you can't be so one sided look the two best conferences the gospel I have a real problem it's not they're not balanced the actually the west is ten times better than east right look at the big tab beef just ten times better than the west\nHow about the the west in the Big East the Big Ten east playing the same conference how great with that they would that be great [laughter] I mean like the greatest convert to the history of college football\nNotre Dame keeps rolling by the way people you know just thinking about ... keeps do what they're doing and they did struggle against paper they got buying in bulk future more touchdowns in your book continues to show that a boy oh boy with a right to make that switch your quarterback\nHad a brand new ... when that job that's I mean of the most shocking thing to be a brand new ... when that job in the first place\nThey'd be Michigan with brand new moon Bush went to Michigan you're kicking yourself right out of the you know what's going to how do we do not really how we lose that just how do we lose to the brain and when Bush doesn't really matter it does not [noise] they control\nTheir own destiny over in the wool rings to control their own destiny they went out there in the national champions\nNo no no we're not the Big Ten champions there no I'm saying they'll make the policy [laughter] when the two games out there and I said no I meant they went out the rest of the regular season [laughter] I wasn't going so far they've they went out meaning literally went onto buddy may do it [laughter]\nDon't look ahead to far now well I mean most people would think they're not getting in if they went out but of course they get in they went out and listen if they stay in the big tent with one last and that's the Notre Dame and they run the Big Ten table and they win the conference they're clearly into the four team playoff especially the way the rest of this conference is going to mean Oregon is now the last hope of the er about twelve\nHe's the big twelve out of it after what happened this past week we gotta get that next\nThese sports radio when the NBC Sports radio mobile apps\nFor

questions going into it but he's really a season where we don't know what the outcome is our buddy Brian Tyler sounded pretty dark compost series Texans MBA radio of course a contributor at NBA TV as\nWell joining us and Brian obviously the big question going into this first week of the NBA season is will Jimmy Butler play for the Minnesota timber wolves brine what are you hearing\nHearing is going to start the season with them down right now there's no talks with anybody anywhere\nThe gap between what the timber wolves want for Jimmy bother and what teams are willing to offer is enormous right now\nAnd although was narrowed somewhat Miami and they felt they were close for a short time in the end Minnesota still wants to make sure that you know you trade they gave a lot for Jimmy ... they want to make sure that that like bother return something for them and I just haven't offered much the problem is is\nMost executives rental they don't trust the Jimmy bothers that help you combine that with the fact\nThat if you turn him loose on young players right now he's not exactly a guy with what he's done in Chicago and that what he's done in Minnesota that you feel like it's going to be good for the growth of most young players\nJimmy guided expect everybody to do it like Jimmy I listen to and I don't know that that's realistic here in the real world so at one point or another something's gonna happen to give a bother the interesting part about Miami being a built chief pursue or her of him is that they're just cut that culture and the way they operate their\nPitch to butler is so you wouldn't have to worry about in there but there's not a lot of places you would have to you that you wouldn't have to worry about it\nAnd there's a legitimate concerns the getting in on the floor you're seeing him play a little bit early in the season\nProving that he's healthy proving that the legs are underneath them and seeing them kind of function a little bit better among Minnesota's young players will give the timber was a little bit more of an opportunity to get rid of them you would oh that's a good scenario the bad scenarios and look right or he gets hurt at all of a sudden they're in trouble because he made it very clear\nHe is out at the end of the year ... one thing in mind also trained for Jimmy Butler it's not just were training for Jimmy Butler were also committed to the idea\nOf giving him five years and one hundred and Ninety million dollar next summer at the age of thirty and and that's something teams are taking calls with his well\nHere's the thing though Brian is greater player is Jimmy butlers and I'm not denying use a tremendous to weigh talent the way he is with young players\nRight now Minnesota and that seems to be screened relationship he's better off just not having a place for them right now I mean kids who came to be a big distraction in the locker room to where in fact keeping him there regardless of visibility may actually hurt the team\n[laughter] you know I said the other way Dan because here's the thing what's going to hurt this theme and what's going to hurt developing the towns and we're going to not be a playoff game this year\nAnd at one point or other trained brother is not going to be there if you can get 'em on the floor and get some extra wins with his ability on the poor that's only going to kind of help\nMove these guys along a little bit minute and here in Minnesota you want to make progress and the thing that we can't forget is time to go in for a job\nAnd ultimately Minnesota having a better showing them last season is going to determine whether or not Glenn Taylor wants to keep time say they don't want to do so but that was definitely been told listen I expected more with this group of town and the money they're spending on what you've provided and for ... right now\nHe thinks he can help him win games he thinks this team is better with Jimmy bother them without and listen last year they were thirty seven and twenty three with Jimmy Butler\nThey were ten and Thirteen without him okay there and they need Jimmy ... in the worst way this team and they're going to have a chance to make the playoffs or some kind of retirement Jane below where they can fill in around them I don't I don't worry so much about the distraction I get them on the floor and seeing that help you win\nBut stay in the western conference Brian the Lakers making the biggest splashing then of course is bringing in LeBron James Brian what's realistic when total where do you think this team finishes in the western conference you're one of LeBron James\nI say anywhere from forty six to\nForty nine wins and I think that we'll see them around eight anywhere from five to seven seat I think they will host a playoff series at home or advantages in the first round playoff series I don't think they'll be that good I think the west is very very competitive but they're going to be much better I mean there's no doubt that\nLeBron is gonna be able to elevate this theme to being relevant in the western conference I mean because it's it's an idle is obviously James is over on genes we know who he is he's still the best player on the planet the further notice and we know when he did last year with men which may have been one of the best years of his career but\nThey have other young guys that are coming along like LeBron's gonna make Brandon Ingram a legit star Brandon Ingram is going to be a killer\nBut his team and he looks terrific how they've converted who's a little bit to me this new age you know kind of you know threats five pounds of muscle in his upper body will lie in so far it looks like a better and different player here and so you know\nThey're going to be a better team Ron does a guy who was terrific for New Orleans last year and he will fit in with LeBron James great I there's a lot of good pieces on the Lakers are they are they as good as used after the war and they're not even close but when you look at the best of the rest and the west\nThey are right there in the middle of the pack and I think they certainly could add ... I don't see them being as good as a receipt I just not ready for that at this point but I Do think elevated to the playoffs being a mid tier seen I've been getting then there'll be very relevant interesting in the playoffs because when you have a bronze you can't dismiss it team got out of school that LeBron James on\nChina's ... founder proves critic dot com host sensors Texans MB radio also contributes to be TV here on going deep the enforcement NBC Sports radio the Golden State warriors three of the last four years they won the championship that the markets cousins Brian are you on the school of thought that the markets cousins in the way he is often simply\nCould hurt this team and slowing down the fence or is this just the rich getting so much richer bringing in a guy who put up one twenty five and fourteen in a season when a healthy\nI don't think he's a good fit that and I and let's see if he's a very talented player but on a team that prides itself on keeping up all moving fast it's got to hold the ball a lot of this is also a team that's got a turnover problem and cousins is one of the most part over from big big men and the old league the other thing is that\nThe team that that is their whole hallmark defensively switching the markets cousin the guy who for all of his talents he's not exactly fleet of foot on the perimeter when it gets wet shot the guy so the things the warriors doing well\nAnd and pride themselves on doing what the markets cousins doesn't do well listen he's a big time low post right he's a brilliant off as a player and I think a lot of ways he'll he'll he'll help them at certain points in time where they're able to play a lot less minutes with their main players and run off and do causes with a in\nA lot of regular season situations and I think it'll be very helpful there he'll help and be when he comes back a better regular season game\nWhen it comes to the playoffs and then there's going to be times and he's going to be on pliable and that's going to be a problem you combine that with some of the issues you have to worry about within regarding technical fouls and the fact that he has and always got along swimmingly\nWith teammates and with ... and you have you know in an irritant honesty and already and dream on green and you had a big technical problem last year when Trayvon and Kevin Iran and two

I think the tailgate they have a ... getting tradition in Milwaukee right so they wanted to I guess not surround the area with too many like buildings and such but you don't want to think\nOf Milwaukee I've ever been to Milwaukee what I think of a city like Milwaukee things kind of a ... a cozy city where you walk to the ballpark\nAnd then like after the game you walk to a bar you know that's how I come on and you can do that in Chicago yeah regularly could convince you really can't though no ... whatever it's called now\nTrust US Cellular yeah I think so I was a stupid name yeah you can't that's that's a rough for part of town right supposedly yeah I've been there to be convinced that you know you take a cab and you take a cab out you don't like regularly Fenway Park place the impact anyways nice we're San Francisco back that was like right there\nBut I'm sure you walk to bars from their technical you could walk to Mars from San Diego Yankee Stadium yeah city feel not something you can't really really feel you're you're by like car in the car repair places in junkyards and the EU\nIn Miami you can't okay I haven't been to Atlanta I haven't been in the new one and only on the older ones that are up for neighborhood and used it I guess it's not a gray area but you use the ... you could walk to borrow a city\nBut there's not many bars there that said that so you have to go out of town I started going out of town during the final four years to go through the same thing the Texas Rangers you you can't walk anywhere to now let's rich right but you know it's it's it's a it's a lot that they show the parking lot with the cowboys probably do okay Jerry's its it's similar to sort of like an area\nThat I like a stadium where like after a game you don't have to pop in a car you can actually walk to the bar buddies and you like pets do then\nYeah I'd love that I think yeah absolutely beautiful ... that that happens all the gas lander district beautiful I think it's a much nicer atmosphere like after a game right like we want to do\nLike a Saturday or Sunday afternoon game right or a clock\n[noise] young fans in the ballpark which apparently is closing\nI mean you could walk but yeah she is you have to walk a little while to get anywhere like it's kind of you know because they they built all the stadiums in that area I Know ... years old spectrum was there yeah and I don't like to go I'd only been there yeah it's like there's no neighborhood around there you'll like atmosphere no\nBut you can't walk by the state or you'd have to walk a decent amount like at least half a mile or a mile Pittsburgh is really nice\nWalk from there to places right downtown Detroit right on the water can you walk to that most overrated subway sandwich shop pre made all other than the others yeah which I had and I was going to go to other places this love affair at that place\nLike a freaking sandwich for like ... like a sour crowded southern what's so great

it comes down to it is in the western conference can ... it can be used in iron out the wrinkles that prevented them last year from beating the Golden State warriors\nCannot joke in the second half of a game seven of the western conference finals at home or they couldn't have a three point a to save their life\nThat attempt point lead out at the half time right they could have a three pointer and this whole notion warfare Chris Ball they would win frankly there and he bought a win that game they had the game what if they get a pretty borders they just literally one called the second half\nSo can they get over the hump can come out and we're going to be a useful piece to that puzzle\nI think it's interesting when you break it down but it's over or under every sport has been heading into a season the NBA enemies a hard one right when they get sets those over under Z and you'll get a win totals when it gets that here in a moment John but think about this like you look at the NBA season right now needs to be as open amongst three teams\nAnd Boston and my underestimate against him in the west that could potentially give the rockets and the Golden State warriors are run for their money or Portland the fourth best team and there's a third best team and there's a humongous gap between second and third yeah I definitely agree with that humongous gap\nBut I think Houston can give Golden State Iran\nFor you know the western conference finals um other than that\nIn the east you mentioned the three teams Milwaukee with John us who else is a great player who knows if he matures thinks that next step I'm interested to see how Cleveland play this year will Kevin Love return to the Kevin Love Minnesota without LeBron James will\nMatter what I mean by that is Kevin Love as capital of the Minnesota couldn't win much yeah right I mean it Kevin ... in a week east\nAnd the weakest guinea will them to be seven or six how bad will be next v without present guess play a lot of young

that's going to take the bulk of shots 'cause he's got recognition\nBut it does kind of open up the ability for these young guys to develop a little quicker in the sense of their more thrown into the fire where there isn't that poor thing is that you're that you feel you have to throw you know give the basketball to to to shoot thirty times of the game\nSo that helped to Kevin knock this development does it help Robinson in his develop it does help ... develop I Know that will tell\nThem you know I just wanted to bring this up we always criticized baseball for opening up their season\nIn them once in a near the final four like right by the final four March Madness yes the sweet sixteen the elite eight that weekend and the next season twenty Nineteen they're opening up march twenty eighth on a Thursday which happens to be sweet sixteen for the NC double what we always\nCriticize them and say why not open up on a Monday like they used to so they avoid\nYou know I'm kind of voice they vote the final four especially this year they can open up April first 'cause the final four the ... which gives out until April eighth right\nOr they could open up the next weekend the next week after the final four and have the sports world all alone to themselves but this year the NBA is going up against baseball the baseball playoffs so what I Want to know from you you have Philadelphia at Boston followed by\nOklahoma City at Golden State\nHow will the ratings look when we look back tomorrow will the NBA get better ratings for there to opening games versus the two baseball playoff games tomorrow\nWhile I I Would hope not I would really for baseball steak hope that they don't lose out\nTo to everyone under ... Boston is playing the it's interesting the playing the early game so playing out I've owned nine eastern time first pitch at Houston and NATO nine first pitch for game for Milwaukee at Los Angeles interesting again then they're going up against the NBA you got\nPhilly at fault [noise] and I know he's a fun game St under the warriors and now it's eight PM ten thirty PM ah I hate to say it\nI think the NBA Wednesday night because of the warriors and there's interest to see the Celtics the Sixers that's a great match to start the season a pianist for baseball said being a huge baseball fan I Hope baseball does not lose out but here's heading used it will do a bigger number to watch the Astros\nThan the than Philly will do to watch the Sixers now [noise]\nBecause yeah you would think the Sox as you would have there's a lot of excitement with the with the Sixers this year and the Celtics but yeah Red Sox it's a baseball town it's a baseball town puts the number what do you think baseball's going to do better number\nNo I think basketball when I Do I hate to say about oh I don't think I think when I don't I think having [noise] is it on ... what it is on the anti\nThings on the into the baseball basketball basketball what's good about baseball going to be out there not be on TBS five o nine\nOkay Boston at Houston and fs one that's the problem I Know you know like I'm On the network games like this channel four hundred for me it's like I literally it's always forget okay what do you say\nOklahoma City at Golden State you think uh ten thirty eastern is no way it's going to do a better number than Milwaukee at\nLos Angeles police Milwaukee wow\nI you know I I ...

D radio\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nWe live in these sports [noise]\nMonday Night huh\nI had two games coming down to the wire baseball and I don't see as game three Dodgers brewers and Monday Night football which was not supposed to be a close game [noise] factors and the forty niners was supposed to be a laugh or [noise]\nBut no it came down to the wire Packers getting amazing Crosby stills all the time expired as they just keep with a victory limbo thirty three thirty pounds got that it's over time you're on NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports\nRadio dot com you know last night I said on this show I was very curious to find out what the ratings were going to be for Monday nights action\nI wanted to know how many people were watching the Monday Night football game which I expected to be a laugh or and I wanted to how many people were watching the ... with the Dodgers involved playing against the brewers and I felt that would be a good test of NFL versus major league baseball ratings more so\nThan last week when people pointed out that the Monday Night football game with Drew Brees breaking the record\nDid a much better number than the blowout Red Sox and Yankees I thought this Monday Night would be more of a true test comparing the two because if you look at Red Sox Yankees game for\nIt was much closer to the rating the Monday Night football did why because it was Red Sox Yankees was a closer game and it wasn't going up against anything but I was curious to see what it was going to be like tonight but you can throw that\nWhole conversation out the window because Monday Night football was actually a good game to watch back and forth a shootout in the first quarter the Packers and the forty niners go into the half twenty four twenty it was seven teams fourteen at the end of the first quarter\nWe had a shootout or hands after an eighty three point this play on Sunday Night Football at that point forty four points in the bank or you're wondering how high is the thing that I go now to slow down in the second half\nAnd the forty niners held a thirty twenty three lead but you can't keep Aaron Rodgers now\nRogers drives down the field hates the violent they Adams for the game tying touchdown while the extra point tied the game and that was with just under two minutes remaining because right after the two minute warning\nAnd then CJ Beth third who played decently in this game kind of remember that he's CJ battered and he throws an interception\nWhich I kind of looked like it was Bob bowl and whatnot but all scoring plays reviewed and so they looked at it and confirmed it we didn't get to really see it on TV they didn't show us any slow motion replays or or or you know\nLong replays I should say 'cause I'm slow motion to kind of looked like it was bounced around but that's neither here nor there the Packers got the ball they were viewed it\nAlso all all turnovers are viewed alternatives in scoring place and so Aaron Rodgers has no time outs left\nAnd he marches the Packers down the field with just the precision that only Aaron Rodgers could do the throws that he was making\nThey get the ball with a minute left in the game minutes seven the throws that he was making were just on the money\nWhere he was hitting guys as they could go out of bounds and save the clock\nIt was on believable watching him drop those times in the past to St brown right on the money the past the Adams which gets them out of which gets them out of pounds with ten seconds of it just doesn't get better than that\nAnd there was the long run up the mental too for Twenty one yards Aaron Rogers was masterful on that final Dr setting up Mason Crosby who missed five ... a week ago set up Mason Crosby for the game winning ...\nCrosby with three seconds left home down at the Seventeen to twenty something we'll go right down like what\n\nThat was the corn Westwood One thirty three thirty was your final score and a lot of people after the game were focused in on the Richard Sherman penalty that occurred after a third and Fifteen sack of Aaron Rodgers that would have sent the game into overtime\nNow\nRogers clearly was sacked had nowhere to go tripped up by the forest partner\nYou watch the play over again and you see Richard Sherman poll on the violent they Adams\nHe disrupts his rap by the letter of the law is a penalty have I seen less get called absolutely would I have blowing the whistle they're probably not\nI hate when the officials have an impact on the game to that extent and they did that call extended the drive it gave the Packers a chance but even after that Aaron Rodgers still had to be on the money\nHe still had to be on the money because that sack occurred at the Green Bay Nineteen yard line\nSo after the penalty there was forty three seconds left the Packers still had the ball in their own twenty four year old line they still had the march into fuel goal range and so after that penalty you allowed Aaron Rodgers to run up the middle for Twenty one yards that's inexcusable\nYou allow him to pass the ball right to demand a Adams to get out of bounds then pass the ball to St brown allow him to get out of bounds then passing the ball to Adams let him get out of bounds\n\nYou know there's a lot more to blame here than just the refs for calling a penalty on Richard Sherman how about the fact that you took a twenty four twenty lead them to the house\nAnd you're only scored six points in the second half how about the fact that you allowed Aaron Rodgers suffer over four hundred and twenty five yards in this game of aren't they Adams ten catches a hundred and thirty two yards and two touchdowns Jimmy Graham five catches a hundred and four yards\nI mean there there's so much more to blame than just Richard Sherman was called for a ticket tax penalty yeah I get that it was a ... pen a ticking tax penalty\nBut you're deepens had so many other chances to stop the Packers and he didn't and you're often said chances to score and you didn't\nSo\nDon't just look at the one penalty and I think that's what cost you the game if you're a San Francisco forty niners no there's a reason why the team is one in five this year and it's not because the refs are calling soft penalties\nBut um [noise] it was definitely call yesterday and over the weekend the very very very cold\nI feel like that contributes obviously to getting sick so again I don't feel sick but I I Am starting to cough today like at random spots I have that pre sick cough\nYou know like I could wake up tomorrow morning and be like a ... so maybe I'll run out to the drugstore and I'll get that stuff tomorrow make sure that I don't uh uh get sick I did take a multivitamin today try to help myself out it's a good good strategy right pop the multivitamin\nYeah we'll see we'll see we'll see if that works [noise] ah well everything was working for the Green Bay Packers what a Segway everything was working for the Green Bay Packers on Monday Night football especially in their come from behind victory coach Mike mccarthy called it a great victory\nActually burst through when care enough about the number of the individual performance you all think given the first year with with Mason getting a final pick all the through to manage Rouzer ... Rogers the defense of stops the versus the key players will remain\nCalm or just huge well so we also want to go into the ball week claiming and I think we're going we're going to be pretty good shape a medically sore guys have a chance to rest up\nAnd talk about Aaron Rodgers who was just magnificent\nSome somebody she plays all the way down to the end you know or even taking all the time off all the clock ticking civil or three seconds so key players in with connections with the ball they work in the boundary um show him even\nAfter the big big play like Kevin James huge play it gives a chance to even have the last series are there after the after the penalties are on a kick off and do anything for it and it was ... so you know production they would have run so I mean it just so top on stuff\nNow plenty of time we talked about that rams match up coming up at their next game plenty of time to rest for that you know Roger and me\nUh he's been getting better every single week had a little step back last week but he was wearing the small brace for this game not the large brace that you you know he has been wearing before so plenty of time now week off and some\nTo rest up with that knee injury and hopefully Rogers is as good as he has been this season\nThe LA Rams in LA on the twenty eighth now speaking of Mason Crosby who had the game winning field goal a week after missing all of those kicks and what was a disaster performance from him Mike mccarthy called it a perfect script\nBottle think record amount or the ... the way you want to say then you know Frank out what she didn't need to take as many bills as he does and I but I'm the deaf wherever the as the big bounce back their information then really for a football thing we we we needed that when\nI'm you know we've been through the four games song so we improve the night\nAnd Rogers on the importance of the victory\nBut I don't know if it was a seasons they win for us but uh [noise] definitely\nUm for the important one especially with the ah\nPrognosticators going to go on about the type of opponent we have coming up the next few weeks then obviously than being road games [noise] ah this was a newborn game for a number like use the term must win but uh it was an important one\nAnd Rogers happy for his character\nBut he went through last week and a team to stick with them and the guys to kind of wrap our arms around them and encourage him the way that we do for our teammates was a great enemy respond and you know the crowd a month I was very encouraging I was trying to figure out first if it was a\nKind of a sarcastic chair but I've I've felt like it was pretty heartfelt encouragement after remained or you know forfeit all goes in three extra points so he was obviously very happy afterwards and we're very happy for him\nYeah you're very happy but and the forty niners are not happy especially Richard Sherman who did not agree with that illegal contact penalty called on the final Dr against him\nFor that matter if I agree with caught up with a cold you know it's if it's possible you know it is that if you agree with the cost I like it though I I didn't agree with color going to go to\nThat interview with it but there was the right call more from Sherman in the last\nPart of the profit centers are going to do the best quarterback in football um you know you're given a chance of and um I Can't have that put me on fourth Nineteen and give them a shot you know regardless of of you know however you know I might feel about it I got to find a way to to when I play without getting fired and\nFather did miss out you know what I gave them a shot to win the game and and that's all you need you know he didn't do it you\nKnow I said it before I'll say it again I Wish that players like him and fans would would stop harping on just that final play or is that you know that penalty on the final Dr\nBottom line is ... the Packers had their own way with the forty niners and the second half\nThe forty niners defense Yeah Richard Sherman that you included had many opportunities to stop the Packers but you did\nNot he did not\nYou allowed to have ... after that penalty to march down the field with no time left on the clock\nYou want to argue about that penalty argue about that penalty but after the penalty was called\nPackers had the ball on their own Nineteen yard line and forty nine seconds left or forty three seconds left you allow them to get the ball from the twenty four year old line after the penalty to the nine yard line\nCan you are deep and make a stop can you hold them to take any given three now\nYou know in the first happy did a decent job I guess one of the second quarter I guess because it in the first half you know they scored on their first dry scored on their first what three drives touchdown fuel touchdown right so defense couldn't get them off the field in their first three possessions\nAnd then you couldn't stop them at the end\nDoesn't just come down to one healthy eco Rogers throwing for four hundred and twenty five yards and two touchdowns doesn't come down to just one penalty called on the at the end\nAnd how about the forty nine or ... CJ better than company you brought up twenty four points in the first half you only scored six in the second half\nDo something now fence in the second half and it doesn't come down to that final drive\nSo you blame the blame the penalty all you want the game was not lost because of one Richard Sherman penalty there on the fourth down\nAnd I said about all all teams I said about the Packers to everyone claimed that he just had that the the the penalty called on him that cost and the game when the Vikings then went down the field and scored a touchdown descended into the overtime in the game on that being a tie\nYeah that that penalty stunk but you still had chances to stop the Minnesota\nAnd you could have had a situation where\nWhile you just stop them earlier than that\nMinnesota so wouldn't twenty two points that one\nDoggy about just one call and\nWe had all these other places to get the job done the\nSwitch gears heads to major league baseball talking about the U.S with our baseball and stuff that we return Dover dominant she's\nOnly one radio station in central Wisconsin has But Dave Ramsey show back to live here I Am thirty twenty WIP John [noise]\nYour NBC Sports radio updates now\nWe know Aaron Rodgers let the Packers to come from behind victory thirty three\nThirty over the forty niners thanks to Mason Crosby last second goal Rogers had four hundred and twenty five yards happening with two touchdowns bolted about they Adams the latter come in with just the other two minutes remaining tied the game at thirty the Packers got the ball back\nAfter a CJ they're interception baseball the brewers beat the Dodgers for nothing in LA sticking to one lead in the national league championship series on the ice storm king's for one senator about the doors for one as well Canadians rubber right wing seven three in the ... double up a wild boar to the sports world mourned the loss of Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen\nLongtime order of the Seattle Seahawks and the Portland TrailBlazers who passed away after complications of non Hodgkin's lymphoma sixty five years old Scott ... is NBC Sports radio\n\nNFL game on demand NFL game to game replaced [noise] anytime coaches fell\nAre tied [noise]\nNFL football anytime anywhere with NFL game and now it and you lower\nStart your pre trial today an NFL dot com slash game pass certain restrictions apply but his\nMother to pack of Napa night vision had lamb says up to ten dollars off cause with ball comes longer night spent\nVisibility luckily our head lamps up superior elimination which helped reduce the chance of an accident the better drive safer with up to ten dollars off a two pack Napa\nNight vision headlines wildly parts cope with people that don't know [noise]\nThem out that said nothing out it for him okay now you have now you have him and you get Jeff first to get out of that anything unscathed on skate that's the key there\nI think he did not give up a rotten mhm\nI think a big moment in this game was in the fifth inning I Believe was the bottom of the fifth inning where the Dodgers are down one nothing and the robbers decides to leave Walker buell or in Tibet\nWayne yeah got a runner in scoring position and people are strikes outlook\nAnd that was a big opportunity to drive in Iran and tied the game there but instead he hit him because he wanted to get more innings out of him and what happens viewer yes she gets through he gives up one run into six and then two runs in the seventh and\nYou lost all your chance of getting our fence there if you're good at keeping in you're going to keep the guy and you got a bank on him putting up a zero and he didn't\nYou're absolutely right and but there is a different philosophy and the philosophy for the Dodgers is what we're going to bring in is not better than view that that that's what they believe\nSee a lot of people are are accusing the brewers are doing the right there there are how can you win with opening and you've got to start or what are they doing believe me they love to [laughter]\nPay\nThey love it they're not doing this for their health they would love to fix this and they are doing it out of necessity because they believe a few match up ... dollars at this stage the Jews career if you match up to you can do is with Clinton ... Shaw people or or any of these guys they don't match up\nBut if you're only asking to go one through one time throughout the line up the theory is found that they will execute\nTelling us that there were no baseball insiders got sunburn shares over time and NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio\nDot com Dave Roberts announced after the game the Austin Barnes will start behind the plate ... dollars struggled striking out in big spots in both are ordered all passed last year who and the past balls as well as it was going with Austin bonds it'll be rich hill on the hill for the Dodgers\nCurrent council announced that joke in dollars will start game for on Tuesday night I'm sure the leashes going to be short as they look to go to the bullpen early any signs of trouble but\nDo you like throwing geo out there to start on Tuesday\nIt's one of those circumstances where again they're just going to look for once through the line up and you know hopefully what that is is like two and two thirds um you know ... in an ideal situation but you know they're they're fully armed\nOr they'll have Jeff first they can have hate or if they need them or they're going to try to avoid that but they can still do it if they if they need and uh my my attitude has been this\nWith their starters this is what the team is this is what the brewers were why no one took them seriously during the regular season\nWill switch over to the American links that where the red Sox nationals are tied the game of peace and so far in this postseason every decision that al ... has made has panned out for him he decides to bring in poor so out of the bullpen again in game to something that he did in the division series against the Yankees\nAnd therefore he's going to do with Nathan you've all the as a starter for games three are you behind that move\nI Am to a degree you know I think that you know the big thing for them is you know they they don't know what they have with Chris Sale and so you know I there's no way herself and come back\nOn short rest I Would I Would put him as a question mark for game five and that's only if he responds well um but you whatever it is you don't have him at a hundred percent\nAnd so basically how that has changed I don't also know what they're going to do with David Price\nSo they have to plan their they're also taking this one game at a time and I don't know that they have this whole thing mapped out so they need innings from evolving\nAnd that's going to be helpful or you know helpful for them look he's been good don't get don't get me wrong but you know the Astros just throwing tells ... I mean there's this is a guy saw young guy like he's their third starter the Astros are\nSo much better team and it's showing I in my opinion it's it's really showing\nAnd as far as ... out of the hospital he'll be with the team or tomorrow in Houston and our scores that is going to see how he feels physically and then deciding what to do writing on from there but your point is well taken now or with their performance in you know I look at\nUh the the way that the red Sox won that game and how uncharacteristic of more ... than auto to allow to pass the balls and there was a wild pitching that ending to which allowed ... the score or like a little league player without another ball being\nPut into play and that was the insurance run because the actual wind up scoring one of the nights and they lose the game seven five that sixth one was because of all Donald past boss just incredibly owned characteristic of a guy who was an all star\n[noise] yeah it's pretty amazing and you know my very you know on the way the red Sox are you know one during the regular season this is why I said that I thought there when total was inflated I I Do I just look at the red Sox and I don't see\nThem being as good a team and they're they're not and it's just not to take any other Windsor way but if you took ten Windsor way you'd be in the house is on the red Sox is exactly the same\nIt's it it was more a statement about the disparity in the American league with fear and I thought the Astros because of the injuries that they had their numbers not inflated\nI thought that the Astros also had to stave off the mariners in the eighties whereas the red Sox have such a lead on on the Yankees and really what they were doing was to her beating that tar out of the likes of the Orioles\nAnd you know unfortunately for the red Sox in a short series they are going up against a team that their weaknesses the same week that they're using records showing the eighth inning that's the one Achilles' heel for the Astros but if you look top to bottom there is as complete a team as there is in the postseason remaining\nYou see I was pregnant and who had his Instagram story or a video of when the actual head back to back home runs against the of all the when he was with the race\nOr you know\nTrolling Nathan you've all the on Instagram are playing replaying I've been over and over again uh when I went back to back yet Nathan you've only obviously shrugs at all has to answer questions about it during his immediate ... ability but in those days\nAre usually the day before a start so a lot can happen before then but in a circumstance where there's an off day evolving was talking he's the next pitcher for for them but like for example the game for starters we'll talk before game three and like they're supposed to anticipate what starts going to be like but they don't know what's happening\nIt's a weird it's a it's an old set up it's it's it's so funny because that's how they did it and they used to have the starting pitcher speak and during the regular season you never speak to a starting pitcher before I START I I traveled with teams four separate organizations and you would never talk to the starting pitcher before he would\nStart if it was ready to Johnson even bite your head off\n[laughter] he put literally he has said that you follow him on Twitter\nAt stepped on their

C. O. T. T. S. O. N. A. I. R. so that's what's going on here on a Tuesday Red Sox Astros five own nine and then the brewers Dodgers at nine or not you know it's funny 'cause I was pregnant was the one who he was on Scott bendel show\nAnd complained that the Astros games for the division series we're starting at two o'clock in the afternoon\nAt bothered him because he felt the actual for being disrespected because they weren't on prime time well it made sense because the Yankees Red Sox were playing at the same time and you were going to put the Yankees Red Sox on prime time\nHere you've got the red Sox Astros playing at five o nine eastern time for all nine central\nBut there's nothing you can do about it because the Dodgers are playing and yeah Boston the Houston are too big markets but LA's a bigger market and it's west coast that games got to start at nine o'clock can't start can't have that game at four o'clock\nOr five o'clock because that's the five o'clock game you're talking about three\nMoon Dodger Stadium National League championship series\nCitizen Nineteen eighty come on twenty Eighteen we care about TV viewers\nTrust me ever won once that game at nine o nine pm eastern time\nCurious to see what number does compared to the NBA we want to talk about the uh ratings compared to the NFL and the I'm very curious to see what the Monday Night ratings are because yeah OK baseball game and you had a football game which wasn't supposed to be good\nBut actually turned out to be a pretty good game came down to the wire obviously last second fuel when's it for the Packers so I'm sure the football will do a much better numbers and the baseball but Tuesday night is what I'm really concerned about because you have\nThe double header in baseball starting at five as she got five and nine eastern and then you have the double header in the NBA first games in the NBA regular season\nStarts on Tuesday\nCeltics Sixers at eight o'clock eastern and then warriors thunder at ten thirty eastern that's a TNT double header on Tuesday night\nYou know I think there's a lot of fans that are very happy at the NBA is back to me and I'll have the you know up to TV set up running again trying to pay attention to both\nI\nI'm going to pay the NBA because it's too good games but I see this every year the NBA\nHas the least amount of parity in any sport it's the same teams that are always competing for a championship\nYou have to be a top seeded team in order to have a chance to go to the finals you got to be a one or two at the very worst uh three historically if you're not a top seed it's not in your favor you're not making it to the NBA Finals so you look at the MBA\nAnd realistically and I'm ... years as fair as I can realistically in the NBA there are\nTwo teams in the eastern conference that can make it to the NBA Finals two teams\nIn to my disrespecting anybody else by by saying I'm well that there's a third team or a fourth team\nIt's it's the it's the Celtics and the Sixers and I think it's the Celtics who have the best chance and that's all it's going to be I think the Celtics going to finish the year to me that if I Want to be honest with you I think the Celtics\nAre going to finish the year with the best record in the NBA I think they've finished the year with the top record in the NBA okay\nSo now you have the two teams in the eastern conference\nDoes your two favorites to go to the NBA Finals Celtics and the Sixers in the west how many teams and I know people like do will maybe this team can rise up maybe this will have a good year you know how many teams real list typically\nHave a chance to go to the NBA Finals\nThe Lakers now with Ron okay that's to\nYou want to say the rockets and the other\nSixteen realistically I have a chance to go\n\nSo yeah it's just wash four\nDo overtime on NBC Sports coverage of\nRight here I Am twenty to John was twenty four\nStation you were NBC Sports radio lifting\nNFL Aaron Rodgers led

headline\nAnd then the rest of the west I mean everyone's just be jumbled in right jazz or at fifty\nYou know you look at the thunder forty eight and a half ... forty eight I here's my thought on the Lakers I'm very curious how\nMotivated the brawn James is going to be this season now he can say all the right things\nBut LeBron James has a lot of mileage on that body\nAnd I do believe that LeBron and wants to play a couple more years I really do I think that he has maybe four or five he said he committed the four years writes on a four year deal I think he's committed to living out the life and that contract and not playing for two years and calling it quits\nBut he has a lot of mileage on that body he understands more than anybody the landscape of the NBA the Lakers\nKim place solid basketball turn it on turn it up to all live in for certain nights throughout the season and there will be those nights when they play the rockets when they play the warriors when they play the thunder there will be those nights\nWhen they play against the Celtics or the Sixers even the Cavaliers there will be those nights will they will wrap it up but I think for the most part this team is just going to\nBe on cruise control like I said about the warriors I just don't know how motivated the bronze going to be to win as many games as possible this season\nThere might be some games he might set out some games remember last year played needed to for the first time last year played more minutes than he ever played in his career\nThis year the bronze living in LA he's got his production companies got aside businesses\nHe's focused in on the the shop on HBO or the documentaries he's got going on I think what Brian James kind of take it easy this year in\nLA they'll make the playoffs they're going to win between forty five and forty nine games\nBut I don't see them as a fifty when team I might go under the forty eight for the Lakers they'll make the playoffs there'll be the five or six maybe even the seven and then we'll see LeBron James turn it on but\nI I just got to see it first I think that there's too many factors weighing against LeBron James and the Lakers\nToo many factors for this team just automatically assume that they're going to win fifty games and be the two are the three seed will be the three she I should say in the western conference eight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six due to\nAfter the Celtics in the east to the Toronto Raptors fifty five and a half project wins and Philadelphia Seventy Sixers fifty four projected wins ...\nWe'll see how the raptors do you know ... Leonard now ...\nAnd the Seventy Sixers we know that they are right up there with the Celtics as a class of the eastern conference Pacers at a nice year last year there are forty their their schedule doing forty eight games box with the honest forty eight and a half at the high line for them\nUltimately I think realistically the only teams that I Would look at a have a legit chance to win the NBA title Celtics and the Sixers and east and then warriors rockets thunder\n[noise]\nYeah fine I'll do it I'll do it I'll throw the Lakers in there as well just because of LeBron James\nAnd I'm Sorry jazz if I'm disrespecting you but does them all the brakes six teams in my opinion of a shot from the NBA Finals\nSo I'll pay more attention to the NBA once Christmas rolls around 'cause that's when really in my opinion the NBA season truly begins but it does tip off here on Tuesday night a double header you got the two games filled up\nCasey and Golden State to four of the six teams that I Believe have a legit chance to win the NBA title so I'm going to be interesting to watch but everyone's caution overly broad in the Lakers I Would just kind of\nYou know slow down a little bit\nBut let's see what happens is eight five five three two three four NBC it's eight five five three two three four six to do I'm Scott side and burned always on Twitter at Scott's on the air as the O.

and gambling means usually lose money but my goodness are the Jacksonville Jaguars gambling with their season with Blake boils at quarterback he it's hideous two weeks ago yeah it's the jets she looked like Tom freaking Brady\nLast couple of weeks he's looked like public morals and not to blame for all this\nEffort Tom Coughlin dogma roll with all the talent they have on that team to go into this season with Blake corals that quarterback and not only go to the piece of the game and extension for crying out loud makes like Nineteen twenty million bucks\nBasically is what you get for your money or below average quarterback that once in a blue moon will surprise you with the big game he's got some nice games in his career but sadly he's also had some Congress and to lose to the Dallas Cowboys forty seven to now dropped a three and three on the season\nThey put up a whopping hundred nine points in six games and that's an office that has some pretty decent weapons\nWater and ugly game it was and enough of this weight boils experiment\nTo the Jacksonville Jaguars Blake boils cannot win you a Super Bowl and I'm like oh they're just please hold their quarterback lakefront built for Super Bowls and guys like that\nThey don't make stupid decisions the way that Blake portals makes stupid decisions he makes the decisions that should have just been out of this system after his second year in the NFL sometimes he looks like a rookie out there that's how badly ... can be they lost in the chiefs of team that they're supposed to\nThirty to fourteen they get blown out by the cowboys on the road a doubt starring downstairs exactly a tough place to place play these days like the cowboys are great team\nBut I just can't believe the miscalculation on the part of Tom Coughlin but then again Tom Coughlin stuck with the lie for a year or two long so maybe the fact is Tom Coughlin isn't good at judging quarterbacks maybe that's really what it comes down to\nBut when there's an Alex Smith available by a trade right when there's you know piecing quarterbacks and they're trapped obviously Jacksonville trapping later in the first round because they had a nice season last year the reality is you're telling me you don't make a run for an Alex Smith who's a better quarterback clearly the Blake portals\nI'm not going to sit here and tell you Alex Smith the only quarterback but Alex Smith is a more cautious quarterback Alex Smith doesn't make stupid decisions the way that played poodles dots if you need a guy to gay marriage because you trust your defense and you trust your running game Alex Smith your guy a heck of a lot more than play portals is\nAnd just watching blade poodles that Jacksonville Jaguars self employed on Sunday what came to mind for me it was very simple what came to mind was this\nYou cannot win free games in a row in the postseason\nWith Blake poodles is your quarterback now say they they wouldn't have the vision right okay they when they're division they have these out there when it because they have the south is garbage because the Colts aren't very good they're not one in five the Houston Texans are under achievers the terrible coach at an inconsistent quarterback right now and let's get off the dish on watching the MVP talk right\nNow where she wrote a chilling Ramsey on that one right future MVP really cause I'm not seeing if you're trying to be the one I watched the show and watch them play far from it I see an average quarterback who maybe just shocked the world last year and seven starts until we figure them out because they had seven games are filled to watch on the show and watch and it's not that good\nBut hold her horse a little bit here with him right like the ... the older horses when it comes to annoying thing young quarterback the next great thing and saying they're going to be MVPs\nSo what gets to me is the fact is\nThat this is a team with a bunch of talkers in egos led by jailing Ramsey before I get to what really disappointed me even more than Blake boils his performance in Dallas genuine Ramsey who had no problem it was the GQ magazine rip it every quarter back\nHe called jak Prescott All right is what he called them I guess that's kind of kind if you look at the way he talked about other quarterbacks visual Flaco sucks and you've got a big first six games this year by the way Joe flak and whatnot suck this year\nShowed Watson doesn't look like an MVP\nDuck Prescott looked like an old pro yesterday Russia ready to yards and cleanly passing a football on that secondary

said\n\nDuring his best impersonation of Marshall Lynch\nYeah\nWhat a fraud jailing Ramsey is water fraud let me explain that to you there's nothing worse to me when it comes to a professional athlete that yaps\n... yep yep yep when the times are good but that miraculously disappear as one of the times are bad\nIf Jay Leno Ramsey wants to talk and talk about his greatness and the greatness of his defense\nWhen you get your you know what handed to you I respect the guy who talks and admits there were faults and problems right if you're gonna talking call people out when you guys as a defense give up forty points\nI Want to hear you be a quote leader and talk about how bad you guys were and how this is a wakeup call and it's embarrassing and it starts with me and we have to do a better job\nI respect the guy that we'll talk when the times or God and when the times are bad I don't respect the guy who gives you those I don't know answers because guess what\nAmusing is a bridge between

forty hours on a scale of some\nThese five yards [noise]\nGross yeah Westwood One sport that was the Seventy five yard one flavored ... first of all a couple of parts that was ridiculous as the chiefs\nTied the game up only to leave\nToo much time for Tom Brady and you're never going to do well with that he leads them down the field goal ... hits it and that's it forty three thirty forty forty three forty but here's the problem\nHow to type ... get so open bothering old almost overthrew him and there's no one fast and you know all the ... I mean he is [laughter] you know here's quarterbacks are fast in the NFL right those guys like\nI'm ... I had no chance to catch\nHim by the way very classy of those uh Boston fans there to be flicking off ... kill and then one guy to throw a beer in his face mask that was really classy but you know and I hear the Boston meeting people ribbon Yankee fans after somebody through a beer on a Oakland A's fans remember that yeah not\nMentioning stations or anything like that if we would have done such a thing or said that but that was the Boston fans right yeah classics the guys getting charged now what I watched last night and I do have to admit I I fell asleep a little bit during that game I did\nGot up early yesterday right adopt the girlfriend bring like this summer clothing and stuff to her mom's place and get the winter stuff he got to be the boyfriend ... says excuse to south\nNear you actually yesterday but trust tired and like the game was like a blood at one point right he was good comes out of hand a little bit of looked like alright Kansas City doesn't have a chance here they're not going to do anything your next thing you know I mean it was\nI mean the city was down twenty four to tonight at halftime show like fell asleep on the cash a little bit\nAnd I wake up and I'm like wait a minute it's like a game now I was like God Scott might lose the dirty dozen the picks because he had patriots or might have three and a half so he did lives but you know we'll get down friday but\nAnd I'm watching Patrick my home they started the game off not well\nHere's the thing about it although the patriots won this game they almost lost a home game like we forget that this is the whole game when it comes time for the post season and the AFC Championship game there's a good chance is going to be in Kansas City\nAnd not at Fox bro right could be at arrowhead more so than Fox bro\nThat's going to be an important factor for both these teams if you're Kansas City\nWith what happened Sunday night at NBC you don't want to not have home field advantage throughout the playoffs if you're the patriots and it took a last second you'll go free to beat Kansas City and you were the home team you don't want to have to play that game in Kansas City 'cause that result may be different\nI saw two teams that are fun to watch with great off fences there are going to be the two best teams\nIn the AFC but I'm not going to sit here and tell you the patriots for the better team right now I'm not\nBecause they rookie cornerback almost out dual Tom Brady think about that well you got a rookie but he might as well be in one start last year he had one started in the last game of the regular season who is this the first year as a full time start\nSo by week number Nineteen or twenty which would be when they would end up I guess it'd be weak number eight twenty it'd be weak number twenty I get to be empty championship game\nPatrimony homes might be a different quarterback and even better than what we witness Sunday\nWhat I'm saying is there is no difference in terms right now of abilities when it comes to cheap patriots\nBecause the biggest advantage that you would think Tom Brady or moms yeah it's an advantage but mold is pretty good\nThere is no advantage of doing the best\nReceiving threat right now on the patriots and the comparable guy on Kansas City in fact Sean I'm gonna throw you in here right now right right now today would you rather Travis Kelsey this season or ... feet Travis Kelsey exactly for health reasons as well\nNow Josh Gordon is the X factor because by the time and they have the championship game came game comes around what's he and Tom Brady yesterday played like thirty seven to the thirty nine snapped or something like that\nBut how do you stop tight re kill there's no one fast nothing that's secondary we witness that the ...\nMean he's just unbelievable I mean the speeds weapons southern catches larger forty two yards three touchdowns so how'd the patriots all give it anybody that's greater scheming and figuring it all out it's going to be built ballot jak but I'm not going to\nThe best you may have to I don't think anything separate them in Kansas City\nI think those two are far and away the best\nTeams AMC because jak got an a guy named ... at the helm\nSo the one thing I tell you the Jacksonville not in the same class the chief the patriots based on what we went inside we got to get the constable

comes all the way across the ... John at each other and thinking wow there's a rivalry here it's Vanderbilt forgotten out loud right\nSo it's like I keep wondering because I Want competition I Want to see for football here in college football's great but I watch to see who's comparable to the best who's going to knock the best off right the top of the mountains of Alabama\nShall we now down to Ohio State Notre Dame being the two teams in the Michigan will reach credit miserable ... since the last ... played really good football they women close ones and they blew up Wisconsin but oh it's a big win horrible doesn't beep top Fifteen\nCredit for that and it was a blowout way\nBut when I watch college football maybe I'm wrong and maybe you do this while I'm watching teams\nSeeing how they stack up against the best right so I watch Ohio State with Dwayne Hoskins and I wonder okay does this work against Alabama's defense I watched Georgia say what's the week this year and could they exploit Alabama's defense because that's the weakest on Alabama the secondary taken some injury heads with Trayvon digs out and he was a top quarterbacks\nWatching Michigan I was thinking the same thing can shape Patterson move the football\nOn Alabama tough to say so everything I Do when it comes to football every single week when I sit down and watch lots of college football is because I Want to have competition it's no fun\nAnd I've talked about the show is no fun for me with the NBA to think okay the Golden State warriors going the incredibly heavy favorites to win at all yet again right\nIt's no fun for me to sit here and say well Alabama so far better than anybody else everybody's playing for second place I Hope that's not the case here because I Want to have a fun final four in the college football playoff I Do\nCan Alabama beat the answer is yes they can\nIf Alabama's defense continues to have struggles here and there and look Michigan Missouri's not a tax write as good as true lock is in terms of the NFL qualities he doesn't really have a good team in Missouri\nIt's like one guy's not going to beat Alabama I Can't remember south\nCarolina years government the jets had for first round pegs remember they took John Abraham out of South Carolina turn out to be pretty darn good offensive then right you know John Abrahams last year in South Carolina that went like own wealth so it doesn't matter if you have a high NFL Draft pick on your team one guy can't do it all they're not a ton of talent in Missouri outside of drew lock\nSo it's not like Alabama got tested but this is the fault\nWith their schedule your college football where it's like I have to guess every weekend watching other teams going how would that stack up against Alabama\n\nBut man I think the biggest disappointment of them all I Penn State losing the ... Michigan state's disappointing\nYou know what James Franklin I said it after the last two Ohio State I'm going to say it again because you gave that rousing speech afterwards about how uh you know the we're a great team or not in a league team and what I say show look in the mirror as to why you're not in the league team right because that's stupid play calling I'm going to say it again\nLook in the mirror again now I traced back story maybe there's a boat had play and he's such a you know he's a veteran right like what does he do and not going out of bounds I mean it was paying it down to choose what you do go out of bounds you stop the clock blasted he wanted to stop the clock\nAnd it's really just put it on James Franklin still he's head coach that team and they continue to show why they're not exactly a leap look in the mirror you're a great team not only maybe it starts at the top that's the one that's not a game you lose your Penn State\nYou're not yourself out of the uh the Big Ten championship equation because of that lost to a bad Michigan State team is not a good team but she says most disappointing top ten team in the pre season rankings until this win right\nBut nobody's more disappointment George I didn't come on down twenty ... down sixteenth on nothing at halftime and if you're Kirby Smart ... this is work coaching has to happen you can win based on pure talent he's done that\nBut Kirby balls in your court what are you doing a quarter back now and shake from is not a very good quarterback mean let let's get\nUh the sheen off of Jake from right Jake from was awful against the CEO came from Mitt Romney touchdown passes in that game to in the first like ten minutes and they gave me the\nGeorgia wasn't even in this game and even on the fourth quarter you think maybe there'll be a second half comeback you're only down sixteen and college football you could come back from a sixteen point deficit they could do anything we got terrible play for the quarterback position from sixteen of thirty for defense is good they are that second he's very good\nBut you can't be losing that game that way you give a hundred yard rush or a hundred yard receivers your Georgia you have more talented that it was like twenty\nI'm not ready to call them fraud yeah because I think she was completely misjudged I think we all misjudged us you and here's why we looked at two problems ... won their head coach Edwards Ron right to\nWe thought either quarterbacks not good enough job arose is not good enough if they had like a two hour day would be six no right now they would've been Florida\nHere's the thing about you that defense better than we thought and they can run the football that's when it comes down to bet defenses legit\nSo you look at LSU and you say okay that's one loss Georgia now has a lost that may not that whole conversation that we enjoy having which is what happens if you ah have a one last Georgia\n... doesn't really knock him out though George I can still win the SEC east right but you'd be there at eleven and won\nThe championship game against an undefeated Alabama that they beat Alabama there's still a woman last team and Alabama's Wal Mart's team it doesn't knock 'em out no you're right Alabama there not not after Saturday's perform and lo o Jake from now Jay from you know what I don't know we don't know about Justin Fields\nRight everything we base our thoughts on just the fields or what what are you did in high school at the top recruit five star into the limited actually see him in right\nThat's all we're basing it on is is Justin Fields going to go in there will be two on what a championship but if Jake from can't beat LSU he's not beating Alabama no it's not just so you might as well go to Justin Fields and see what you have I agree a hundred percent unless you've Kirby Smart will do it\nLet's see if ... smart will be no pun intended smart enough to make the move a quarterback but here's the problem I I don't know how Justin Fields looks in practice he might be worse than jak from at this point in his development\nThat being said Georgia's finished because if the if if Jake from the best they have a quarterback\nThere's no way there would be the Alabama I'm Sorry that I Know they get blown out might be the case for every other college football team by the way you know as you mentioned the you know what here's the thing not only do they not be the Alabama they get blown out by Alabama so the SEC just gets one team in the voice said she that's what we learned\nIs not getting any unless they beat Alabama\nIn two weeks Georgia plays Florida that's where the FCC's potentially\nRight I mean think about that how crazy that and I think for the last to Kentucky I mean that he's maybe not as bad as we thought\nThat by the way it's good to have a good Florida it is\nIt's good to have a good for you need a good Florida program unique talent in the FCC east you can't be so one sided look that you have coverage is a college football I'm a real problem it's not they're not balanced the SEC west each ten times better than east right look at the big cat beat the ten times better than the west\nHow about you have to see what the Big East the Big Ten east playing the same conference I agree with that they would that be great [laughter] I mean like the greatest ... college football\nNotre Dame keeps roller by the way people you know just think about Notre Dame keeps do what they're doing and they did struggle against paper they got by in your book through two more touchdowns in your book continues to show that a boy oh boy with a right to make that switch your quarterback\nHad a brand new ... when that job that side of the most shocking thing to me that a brand new ... in that job in the first place\nMaybe Michigan were brand new moon Bush where if you're making your kicking yourself right out of you know what's going how\nDo we do that I really haven't loser just how do we lose to the brain and when\nBush doesn't really matter does not [noise] they control their own destiny movers the wool rings do control their own destiny they went out there is a national champions\nNo no no no we're not that big time champions there no I'm saying they'll make the policy and then when the two games without the subject though I thought you meant they went out the rest of the regular season [laughter] I wasn't going so far to say they went out meeting middle to buddy may do it [laughter]\nDon't look ahead to far now well I mean most people would think they're not getting in if they went out but of course they get in they went out All right let's see if they stay in the Big Ten with one last and that's the Notre Dame and they run the Big Ten table and they win the conference they're clearly into the fourteen playoff especially with the way the rest of this conference is going to mean Oregon is now the last hope of the or the ...

the informant NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com the NBA season\nReady to tip off one of the year is going to be a lot of questions going into it but he's really a season where we don't know what the outcome is our buddy Brian Tyler boundaries predict dot com host on Syria's next on the radio and of course a contributor at NBA TV as\nWell joining us in Brian obviously the big question going into this first week of the NBA season is will Jimmy Butler play for the Minnesota timber wolves brine what are you hearing\nHearing is going to start the season with them down right now there's no cost with anybody anywhere the gap between what the timber wolves whopper Jimmy bother and\nWhat teams are willing to offer is enormous right now and although was narrowed somewhat Miami and they felt they were closed for a short time any in Minnesota still wants to make sure that you know you trade they gave a lot for Jimmy ... they want to make sure that that like Bob and return something for them and I just haven't been offered much the problem is is\nMost executives rental they don't trust the Jimmy bothers that helping\nYou combine that with the fact that if you turn him loose on young players right now he's not exactly a guy with what he's done in Chicago and that what he's done in Minnesota that you feel like it's going to be good for the growth of most young players Jimmy's the guy that expect everybody to do it like Jimmy I listen to and I don't know that that's realistic here in the real world so\nAt one point or another something's gonna happen to give a bother the interesting part about Miami being a bill she ... her out of him is that they're just\nCut that culture and the way they operate their\n... butler is so you wouldn't have to worry about him there but there's not a lot of places you would have to you that you wouldn't have to worry about it\nAnd there's a legitimate concerns the getting in on the warrior gene and play a little bit early in the season\nProving that he's healthy proving that the legs are underneath them and seeing them kind of function a little bit better among Minnesota's young players will give the generals a little bit more of an opportunity to get rid of them you would oh that's a good scenario the bad scenarios and look great or it gets hurt at all of a sudden they're in trouble because he made it very clear he\nIs out at the end of the year ... one thing in mind also good trade for Jimmy Butler\nIt's not just were training for Jimmy Butler were also committed to the idea\nOf giving them five years and one hundred and Ninety million dollar next summer at the age of thirty and and that's something themes that that can cause with his well\nHere's the thing though Brian is greater player is Jimmy butlers and I'm not denying use a tremendous to wait talent the way he is with young\nThis team mates right now Minnesota and that seems to be screened relationship he's better off not having a place for them right now I mean kids who came to be a big distraction in the locker room to where in fact keeping him there regardless of his abilities may actually hurt the team\nThat you know I said the other way Dan because here's the thing what's going to hurt this team and what's going to hurt\nDeveloping the towns and waiting and just to not be a playoff game this year and at one point or another drink others not going to be there if you can get 'em on the floor and get some extra wins with his ability on the\nPoor that's only going to kind of help\nMove these guys along a little bit ... and here in Minnesota you want\nTo make progress and the thing that we can't forget is Tom Davis coaching for his job and ultimately Minnesota having a better showing that last season is going to determine whether or not Glenn Taylor wants to keep time typical were aimed at all so that was definitely been told listen I expected\nMore with this group of town and the money that I'm spending then what you've provided and for ... right now\nHe thinks butler can help him win games he thinks this team is better with Jimmy bother them without and listen last year they were thirty seven and twenty three with Jimmy ...\nThey were ten and Thirteen without him okay they are they need Jimmy ... in the worst way this team and they're going to have a chance to make the playoffs or some kind of return for Jane below where they can fill in around them I don't I don't worry so much about the distraction I get 'em on the floor and seeing that help you win\nBut stay in the western conference Brian the Lakers making the biggest splashing then of course is bringing in LeBron James Brian what's realistic when total where do you think this team finishes in the western conference here one of LeBron James\nI say anywhere from forty six the\nForty nine wins and I think that we'll see them around eight anywhere from five to seven seat I Do not think they will host a a a playoff series at home or advantages for example I don't think there'll be that good I think the west is very very competitive but they're going to be a much better I mean there's no doubt that\nLeBron is gonna be able to elevate this theme to being relevant in the western conference I mean because it's it's an adolescent obviously James Bond James we know who he is he's still the best player on the planet the further notice and we know when he did last year with which may have been\nOne of the best years of his career but\nThey have other guys that are coming along like LeBron's gonna make Brandon Ingram legit star Brandon Ingram is gonna be a killer\nBut his team and he looks terrific how they've converted ... little bit to me this new age you know kind of you know threats five with it now the muscle in his upper body Alonzo fall it looks like a better and different player here and so you know\nThey're going to be a better team Ron does the guy who was terrific for New Orleans last year and he will fit in with LeBron James great I there's a lot of good pieces on the Lakers are they are they as good as used during the war and they're not even close but when you look at the best of the rest and the west\nThere right there in the middle of the pack and I think they certainly could add ... I don't see them being as did his three see that just not true they're ready for that at this point but I Do think elevated into the playoffs being a mid tier seen I think getting then there'll be very relevant interesting in the playoffs because when you have a bronze you can't dismiss it team got outta school that LeBron James on\nChina's Brian Tyler founder booth critic dot com host on through sexism zombie radio also contributes them be TV here on going deep the enforcement NBC Sports radio the Golden State warriors three out of the last four years they won the championship dads markets cousins Brian are you on the school of thought that the markets cousins in the way he is often simply\nCouldn't hurt this team and slowing down the fence or is this just the rich getting so much richer bringing in a guy who's put twenty five and fourteen in a season when a healthy\nI don't think he's a good fit that unless you need a very talented player but on a team that prides itself on keeping up all moving fast it's got to hold the ball a lot he's all this is also a team that's got a turnover problem and cousins is one of the most hurt overthrown big big men in\nThe old league the other thing is is that team that that is their whole hallmark defensively switching to mark his cousin and the guy who for all of his talents he's not exactly fleet of foot on the perimeter when he gets switched out the guys so in this things the warriors doing well\nAnd and pride themselves on doing what the markets cousins doesn't do well listen he's a big time post right he's a brilliant off as a player and I think a lot of ways\nHe'll he'll he'll help them at certain points in time where they are able to buy a lot less minutes with their main players and run off and your cousins with a in a lot of regular season situations and I think it'll be very helpful there he'll help and be when he comes back eat better regular season game\nWhen it comes to the playoffs and then there's going to be times and he's going to be an pliable and that's going to be a problem you combine that with some of the issues you have to worry about within regarding technical fouls and the fact that

that they need defensively feel included off that so it was a surge of boxer who you know with ice show off its Larry the roads you didn't get a tunnel looks I look for a little bit of an uptick in his production here especially with a plan a lot of five with them so I ... and when I look at Toronto\nI feel like they're close to Boston and Boston fat a hard time staying healthy and and they don't stay healthy the raptors can be better than that yes it is their coverage for the taking they made are really\nFrankly close to the Golden State in Houston as the game and they are to anybody else I think they can be great and I think they could actually be one or both of those teams and an NBA final if they hit it out the that that go back in the Celtics can be but without healthy or being without healthy Hayward without help you or for everybody that they have it they're just not enough\nAll right so you like probably like Boston what's keeping Philly back\nHome and that's the hope is\nThat and I didn't know that they have been students can't be there will be guarded it's just you're not going to be you'd be a very good team offensive guard you won't be a great Danes fence image has got to be a ... as do the elbow with that he's more of a score that is set up dying a pass or that you put them in spots on the floor where they can't take advantage of the fact that he can't shoot so ... so\nTo me if you if folks can be a guy that can have a ...\nDay I think that you can be very good from that standpoint but I don't know that he is that right now so we asked the scene where they go and the other thing is just being gave us one showed me all the ... okay you're going to do that again I don't know maybe he might certainly\nDoesn't do that again it's nowhere close to me and those are those two genes so I got to take pause and then she where they go on what they do but it wouldn't surprise me if they plateau and we see another fifty two fifty before he went in there is nothing wrong with that they shouldn't be ashamed that as a young team that try to make its way but to me out of the ready to make that major jump quite yet\nI Bryan we asked the question about the western conference you liked the Dallas Mavericks has it seemed to make a big improvement\nI asked the same question about the eastern conference give me that one team if you want to call it a sleeper that's fine we want to call the team do you think's going to show the most improvements we can do that as well Brian which team comes to mind in regards to really both parts that Detroit's\nI I think actually that they're going to have a good ... and got the I think he's one of the best coaches on a quiet but I think the higher if they were going to go away from Stan they add to make a higher\nThat was just a different high just to a different direction a different kind of voice ...\nAnd I so I think you're going to see some different things up and so they I spoke to coach Casey about a month ago and what he had said to me was that you're going to see a lot more Griffin Ramadan the perimeter is that he's just worked on his asking in a\nBig way and drumming because he's such a good off as a marine better he can space before that way he's going to have Blake Griffin play an olive branch like all of handling a heck of a lot and at times you don't listen to he's going to add a little bit less on the ball being and Reggie Jackson that that's what he's looking to happen so I think it's a very interesting plan\nIf they can stay healthy they can win forty to forty three games I mean a playoff game I really believe that they can if they\nDon't have the requisite amount of charge to be able to win the playoffs are just such strong it up there but you know what a boarding Glen Robinson ... they love Reggie Bullock he looks a lot better this year in arch it'd be you're better but Stanley Johnson's recently he got for that and from\nEverything coach Casey told me he thinks it's us ... at that\nYeah so I I think the pistons if I got to pick one in the east I Would think they're going to be the one that certainly you're going to see them kind of climate to the playoffs because again the other seven in the east and you can divide 'em up whatever you want but I but Milwaukee has been a playoff the couple of years you know make a little bit jumped at this point you can't call the sleeper dad you know what I mean\nNo absolutely right about that so they went a couple more games they still want a bunch of games you're right they made the bugs season that's\nNot really a sleeper I Can't preview the NBA season better than a buddy Brian ... to make sure to catch 'em on serious accident NBA radio watch him as a contributed MBA TV of course checkout

think about that everything that you just talked about for the first five minutes of this segment wouldn't have happened had Richard Sherman knock committed a felony which was what was your penalty\nNo it was it wasn't me look do I think the NFL officials are a little too picky tacky yeah just goes to show you how just one can change the outcome a narrative of\nEverything [laughter] here's the other game of a team of of a player you're right you're absolutely right they punted the game goes over time most likely talk about the ... debate or is this your last yesterday if that if the player from the chiefs the defense of Wyman yes ... Reddy let up because he thought Brady had thrown the pass already\nYou know what do I watch them play a couple of times\nI heard that from like a kid but I'm very did he like go because he actually thought he through or do you let go because there's bodies most was taking them a little bit of weight because just coming around the corner on bringing bringing stepped up you can only go by what he says yeah and that that narrative they brought it up yesterday during the game\nAcknowledging today that he let go because he thought the you know the balls out of his hands and that he was going to get a penalty if he didn't like go I might be the case I actually thought the body his body was taking them away from Brady a bit because really stepped up on and that's just coming on the website but\nSo let's say it's true and he let go really speak right saccharin pick out a lot of old mess or something I think Mississippi State Mississippi State around and it's one of the other I ... it's that you know different uniforms same thinking state and they look at it [laughter]\nYou don't miss I miss the state is like that same thing but here's the thing about that though we've had at one point William have towards the field because you have to let up remember\nThat a couple of weeks ago for the dolphins is he's a linebacker mother yeah permissive stages [laughter] you know we haven't gotten there yet\nAll right but that's the thing about it I have you know he uses up tears his ACL because he didn't want to get flagged\nHere you have a guy berry who who's letting go Tom Brady 'cause he felt he had already passed the football this is a problem when guys are so concerned about getting a flag thrown because they're touching the quarterback ... okay\nThat's a real problem but you're right he doesn't let up he gets that jackets different story different game and here's a different stories about Richard Sherman does come into contact is one of the linebacker six three two eighty five\nWith on Kirkland who may be the last one right he was like to establish a six foot two seconds six three two eighty five has not defensive agent wine and even if it was the one that was a woman and I play yes he was he had his hand down\nNot on the line with actor he's an outside linebacker a two hundred and eighty five pounds\nI get is three four linebackers they usually bigger not that it was big not to eighty five and he was tall it rang Lloyd Kevin and green there were listed as linebacker is a big do what they were like yeah but what was big back then to forty five two fifty new green and more of a big um that they were like two sixty\nAbout how poor they brings I bought six three yeah six four eighty five\nSix three twenty five years playing political outside linebacker on that plane that you're right he was down he was a he was a down wind not lines blurred there really is offensive and slashed linebacker okay the three four he's playing the outside linebacker for threes tied down to sense of that\nBut it's it's really a bloodline me like Russia and like a cultural Mac or somebody like that\nIt is a problem do and and now you're right one play one that all the\nChanges so much of a game one non call changes so much in the game you want to talk about non calls Pittsburgh right Pittsburgh in Cincinnati the non called how ... you know just one play either gets cold or does it makes all the difference in the world\nAnd that's why you hope officials get the calls correct you really hope to get a correct because the fact it's so important in terms of that in the thoughts that Richard Sherman here's the problem I have technically it's definitely a penalty right\nExact tic tac picky tacky penalty though I mean\nIf you're an official do you throw the flag on that play the game like that situation like that I Know you're not supposed to take that risk\nToday with Antonio Brown and drape fitzpatrick yeah they were battling old game grabbing one another but at the end the book they called the penalty on fitzpatrick I Believe in\nThat trick I drink trigger factor that that's what yeah sorry fitzpatrick Kirkpatrick\nA ... they called the penalty on mice believe like in the fourth quarter yeah it was late but like they let that go the whole game and now they're going to call it ... in the fourth quarter of all those\nGuys were you guys are you happy in their it and each other here and there I mean there there you know fighting for a body position you're right and they choose to call it an integral part of the game that you hate to see\nLike either you call it every time where you don't call it all and then when the key situation in doing exactly what they've been doing for the first three quarters the game don't start calling it at that point that I don't like\nSo Richard Sherman it's clearly a penalty it is I mean is it a penalty that should be called in the NFL today that type of contact wasn't enough contact ... yeah you gotta throw it okay I'm not going to sit here and complain and say the you know the forty niners got screwed you know what that screw the bathroom to throw in the past\nThat's where they got screwed yeah sort of the you got some of the outside shoulder to your guy only way you can catch it\nBut that's why the bath or do you know that's why Green Bay so nine halfway favor in the game for two reasons one there at all and two is CJ better if Grapel is playing that game they're not an eye on that point favorite I'll guarantee you that you can tell you what Green Bay defence isn't very good\nI said this from day one the narrative for me for Green Bay was and and and Sean you were you know because Aaron Rodgers has return a lot of people high on Green Bay and I could tell why obviously Rogers makes a ton of difference that Green Bay Packers defense really isn't that good well they haven't been\nGood for a while then right and then he dumped capers remember was the coordinator and he's been fired since since then so they've had a bad defense for a while\nYeah bad defense not until the town they all get Mohammed Wilkerson he gets hurt and we do for lots of the season I mean he'd taken off years the jets\nAnyway the factors I mean they gave him thirty points to a CJ ... led San Francisco forty niners and that's a problem they gave a tone or running yards to right we all know the name breeder right we all know map Brita right he mustered\nExactly who twelve carries eighty seven yards for San Francisco for a hundred and Seventy four yard and the team he must have a fourth year player shame on you shot Big Ten guy from Purdue how do you not remember he mustered come on\nNo way he ... well you know why produce probably awful during the years he played there but [laughter] I don't believe he started the game at Purdue Rob me not you know I've never heard of them\nReady for this short he comes into this game on the season six carries eleven yards for his career he came into this game Thirteen Gary's forty seven yards in this game twelve Carrie ... eighty seven years ago but scholars numbers will yeah we'll get brought he must be like for the job or yeah right [laughter]\nWe do have to look this Iraq he mocked or do they have is college numbers they do on football reference they do a duty alright over under two thousand Russian yours in college yeah from the under okay you're ... oh my ... are you ready for this\nAmount of thought that was in his last Cesar ... two thousand and fourteen Ninety three carries five hundred and twenty nine yards three rushed down to I didn't ... I don't remember if we do for years he played they're sixteen carry sixteen ... Ninety three carries players are in college then why Purdue\nNo no no the football powerhouses no it's three years\nIs pretty were power that's what I'm saying you produce yes guys are there for years but you kind of surprised that he was there for years [laughter]\n[noise] well he'll be at a fellow right good for him good friend doesn't mean he's not a good player not unless he's hung around in the NFL he's getting a paycheck I think either of us would kill for an NFL minimum wage pay check right what's that five hundred thousand dollars\nTo sit on a bench be a practice practice type W during the week I'll pay cut then uh you're right oh yeah absolutely but seven figure contract the remedy the sports radio want to give it up for much I'll tell you that [laughter] so Green Bay Packers get the win\nBy the way if you look at that entire division how crazy that NFC North right now\nIn Green Bay\nChicago bad last Miami Minnesota's bumbling here and there had been lost the pills right I'm thinking about that division what are you going to say about the bills they all should we get to do they think\nThey had the titans be or they did they beat the diamond said so and they had to be well you know what I'll tell you what Texans beat that is a legit defense know ever since ... the best thing that happened to build defenses Monterey Davis retiring and a half times\nI bet you the number one defense from that point on to now they probably are because you don't really like top five events right now and that includes the first week drubbing by the Baltimore Ravens right\nYou look at the ... Davis halftime ten now they're probably the number ... felt that point on\nAll the third in the NFL right now in certain categories of course because that includes getting really bad the first six quarter of the year yeah they got pummeled by the ravens and by the chargers I Do want to find out though we're going to get a reaction from our own showing last a mock yeah\nTo a turning point yesterday's game yet no yes I'm not reacting what Peter mid walk and what I Do think this should not be a story what happened when Perry walk so much going on Monday and you want to talk about Nathan Peter Miller I Want to know what was your reaction we walked in\nAnd who walked in the ... coming to the game to a touchdown pass them and let me through temp interceptions they without beat him in the bills or not and that's what [laughter]\nCBS News update secretary of state Mike Pompeo is now in Saudi Arabia for talks with king's Oman seeking answers about the disappearance of journalists Jamal ...

[noise]\nFifty so bond Williams can win the conference LeBron James off the team there'll be lucky to win over thirty five games and make the postseason\nIncredible\nSo the story line for me when it comes down to it is in the western conference can it can Houston iron out the wrinkles that prevented them last year from beating the Golden State warriors\nCannot choking on the second half of a game seven little western conference finals at home where they couldn't have a three point or to save their life\nBetter temp point lead out at the half time right they couldn't have three pointer and this whole notion welfare Chris Paul they would win frankly then of course bought a win that game they had the game what if they get the borders they just literally one cold is the second half so can they get over the hump can come back we're going to be a useful piece to that puzzle\nI think it's interesting when you break it down but it's over or under every sport has them heading into a season the NBA enemies\nAre hard won right when they just said those over ... and you'll get a win totals when it gets that here in a moment John but think about this like you look at the NBA season right now\nHe's to me is open amongst three teams Toronto Philly and Boston and my honor estimate against even the west that could potentially\nGive the rockets and the Golden State warriors are run for their money pours Portland the fourth best team and there's a third best team and there's a humongous gap between second and third yeah I definitely agree with that humongous gap but I think Houston can give Golden State Iran\nFor you know the western conference finals um other than that [noise]\nIn the east you mentioned the three teams Milwaukee with John us who else is a great player who knows if he matures takes that next step I'm interested to see how Cleveland plays this year will Kevin Love return to the Kevin Love Minnesota without LeBron James will it\nMatter what I mean by that is Kevin Love as capital of the Minnesota couldn't win much yeah right I mean Kevin ... in a week east\nAnd the weakest Kinney will them to be a seven or sixteen how bad will be next v without poor thing just play a lot of young kids\nYou know what the starting point for the next you know he's he's he's a guard he not only one who has been terrible now who do you can't shoot probably a ... you know here's the thing though the whole forcing his thing right him missing time for the next bottom line is this\nVery young team no poor thing is there I mean there's nobody maybe heart away juniors the guy that's going to take the bulk of shots because he's got recognition but it does kind of open up the ability for these young guys to develop a little quicker in the sense of there\nOr where there isn't that poor thing is that you're that you feel you have to throw you know give the basketball to to to shoot thirty times the game so that helped the Kevin knock the development doesn't help Robbins and in his develop it doesn't help milking is developed\nBy now that was out there you know I just wanted to bring this up we always criticized baseball for opening up their season\nIn the ... once it in like a near the final four like right by the final four March Madness yes the sweet sixteen the elite eight that weekend and the next season twenty Nineteen they're opening up march twenty eighth on Thursday which happens to be sweet sixteen for the NC double what we always\nCriticize them and say why not open up on a Monday like they used to so they avoid\nYou know I'm always they vote the final four especially this year they can open up April first 'cause the final four the chip which gives not until April eighth right or they could open up the next weekend\nThe next week after the final four and have the sports world all alone to themselves but this year the NBA is going up against baseball the baseball playoffs so what I Want to know from you you have Philadelphia at Boston followed by\nOklahoma City at Golden State\nHow will the ratings look when we look back tomorrow will the NBA get better ratings for there to opening games versus the two baseball playoff games

United states he's a Fox News analyst any of written why we fight published by ... subtitled defeating America's enemies with no apologies\nIt strikes me as a interesting and perhaps unfortunate that such a book even has to be written do we really have to explain why we fight\nUh unfortunately we do off the eight years under Obama where the president started with an apology toward time trying to blame all the world's ills on the United states a world which created helped create the rise of ISIS\nThe remote to rebuild authorized China or Russia that felt comfortable to invade his neighbors yes unfortunately it is time to remind everybody why is that we fight them but the the stories of the heroes who have fought for this nation\nIs it always necessary to fight a war that involves a shooting at one another you you take note of for example in the book why we fight that we won the Cold War without firing a shot cannot be replicated in the twenty first century\nUh yes indeed that song soup called the ultimate victory is a winning without five things so it's it's a psychological warfare its influence operations and during the Cold War\nSo we did a lot of counter propaganda operations and Matthew exactly what we need to do today we have to deal legitimize the totalitarian\nMessage of our enemies be ice this'll be the Iranians or anybody else so yes it it can be done and the good news is we have done it before\nWhen you appeared on my nighttime talk show last night uh there was some callers who were curious about the U.S reaction to the disappearance and a possible a death even murder\nOf that the Saudi journalist show gay\nOr possibly at the consulate of Saudi Arabia in the in Turkey and to some of them were were questioning whether or not the president fully understand the the Saudi Government\nUh your take on the how the United states is handling that whole thing and the extent to which it is even a a vital us interest in the is not an American citizen\nI sort of by the U.S interest but it is the way that the nation such as Saudi Arabia behaves object calls itself a friend and promises to change its ways\nIs important I think the president has done exactly the right thing by deploying one of his\nToughest cabinet members ah Mike Pompeo first in his class at West point and a former director of the CIA by sending him to Saudi Arabia this week he said it's a very clear message to the king that uh we need an explanation even if this person is is not a U.S citizen\nThis is how a nation that calls itself a friend is meant to be have so I expect some on says to be forthcoming very very rapidly from Saudi Arabia\n[noise] you know in the book why we fight the current discussion about objective truth and subjective truth I've always felt that the term subjective truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nAbsolutely right and I thought it was so very telling from the Kavanaugh hearings how you had more than one of the Democrats than it is starting with Cory Booker use the phrase the truth when talking about the testimony of the doctor for there is no such thing as\nA truce or his troops there is only one truth but this is the law you tell yourself and if your eye they post them on a multi cultural relative is done and the truth is but I can only be one version of the truth otherwise the woods truth\nCeases to have any real meaning\nIn terms of of this war we must be prepared to fight and win is modern more conventional unconventional or both\nA great question you have to read the whole book why we fight to get the full of a conventional war is the normally big state on state war such as World War two is normally most of the battles\nPaul irregular warfare whether it's so stay back it was such as ... or whether it's nation states such as

have a great game yesterday statistically you ended up with I think three touchdown\nShe had you know even though you don't\nGet giving them credit for one judge down in the beginning you know you but because the one was taken away from a running back and he drew it to Montgomery on that\nIt was Miami I Believe that one and there are ... even hurt and the game was that he had a leg injury\nCan we move our game up against them or you back with you know the bottom line is uh the Packers right now do not look like a playoff contender much less than a Super Bowl contest\nSuperbowl contender at the start of the year\nI I felt I really felt they would be what are we treat you in one um I thought we'd be a minimum of five and to looking at the schedule and with the way we will Rogers last year I just thought we would be\nUm that that was my five and two minimum for the by week\nI'm gonna try and get Bill Scott to join us again I'd like to get his take since he covers them out on a daily basis sees them every day and that we can raise some of these things but why don't we listen to coach my key and this is one\nFor you play it I can guarantee oh we got we got some things we got to clean up\nCosts he talks about the quote unquote acts but adversity when\nThings get in the final kick out of the two two minute drives her by her Rogers the defense of stops a diversity key players that we made a we're just huge um so do you also want to go into the by week\nClean and and I think we're going to we're going to be pretty good shape by medically so our guys have a chance to rest stop in and get back at it as we know the stretch run we have there are so a lot of good things and I I'm always some things we we we like to do better but that's what the by weeks for and\nI'm sure is a great entertaining game but just love the fight of our football team [noise] and um [noise] good went\nYeah I I mean there's that great ones throughout the years and I I just you know the time and I'm just really the menu the operation that ended up the stairs clinic or owners that are some some of the key plays all worked out to the end you know you don't even take it all the time off\nAll the clock you know kicking the civil there are three seconds so a key place you know connections with the volunteer work in the boundary [noise]\nUm so you know even after the big the big play like Kevin kings huge play that gives a chance to even have the last series there there are after the you know after the penalty there on a kick off you know given the forty niners could feel the ... so you know the first election they would have run so I mean it's just a top notch stuff\nLike\nI don't think we're good I mean I just exactly what you want to see it and you know frankly I Wish you need to kick as many Phil goals in life but um yeah definitely I was a that was the big bounce back gate information then really for a football team and we we we need a dead when\nI'm you know big to Detroit game strong so we improve than I\nWould say that again\nYoung guys are doing great yeah I mean you know with three receivers over a hundred yards\nSo ... that's begun you know we'll just keep trust those guys could give them opportunities so I thought he played a heck of a game to get all\nWas in a Muslim thinking about the ... and all of a thing about one in the game\nYeah I I thought our guys are the you know be friends with a great job I thought were were in position more about the finish it will say the type shows but I thought our our our finished was much better we were you know cracking up the ball more than than we've had in the past you know we took care of the football so you know that always plays a big part\nCat I mean there's you know there's things you make adjustments as far as I call things and you know and high declare but all of our guys didn't get all kinds of sports up front you know you try to control as much as you can tell what the play called the buyer sliding out there you know we really miss a beat them stay away from anything big\nThey don't doubt that some pressure you know after some pressure during the second down and\nThird quarter and to the fourth quarter so you know we had we had some calls earlier that\nYou know do we really had nothing to do with you know that the right tackle position so I thought by and a nice job\n\nWhen you say\nWell you know that's that's really what the way for you know we'll we'll do some will do a lot of individual work with employers\nWon't even do some cross the ... will spend time with 'em you know often some guys visiting with the defense of God's him and vice versa so I'll just really stay focused on the little things because that that that's where the the big improvements come so the answer a question of more detect techniques just the basics\nI work on the basics like somebody [laughter]\nHow are you know\nCarl I said this numerous times in my opinion\nDrawn to quarterback and as far as our office you need to go to the huddle simplify the often more come up with twenty plays that Roger everybody can have a wristband and they know what the you know the riders you just give the numbers that the line I don't know when the\nThe head set up for those I don't know where that the\nQuarterback wears a helmet that as a reason to hold the coach can talk to him for a certain time I don't know if it's when the if it if it stopped when they hit the line of scrimmage or ten seconds before the\nThe clock or what it is but they should be able to get plays in I mean with all the coaches they got I think they have one coach per every two players you know you've got to quarterbacks coach getting off as a coordinator I'm sure they're telling McCarthy\nHey this play wouldn't work for this play one worker or so and so's it looked back when like Dionne Santa are clear Mac hey Quil max out of the game while then we're going to try something a little different um\nYou know so that type of system because\nMy goodness we're in a hurry up other than at the end of the game and look how it works I mean what do they have like forty seven seconds ... marches a\nHere bet you're and I still don't like the fact that I think if you got a young running back there shows a lot of promise let's let that guy work yeah impounded and that's where it late in the game have you got a running back that can pound the ball and you can run out\nIt'd be nice to have a lead for a change\nAt all I Know Enron right where we keep hearing faster and faster it's Rogers wants a faster McCarthy one when they keep doing the same things up\nDefinition of insanity do the same thing over and over again in different\nResult I even on defense okay you got this quarterback\nWhy they were led him to have all the time in the world I Would have started bullets in right away during the game this person's right to start with her first job rattling rattle him I I agree with you I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't be upset with a penalty\nWe'd love to hear what your thoughts are trivia question today to win a treats of pizza from the Dairy Queen store\nOn east grand avenue is how many years what what season is this for

the baseball game to I Know that I didn't miss a good one you have to train okay\nAll right mark thanks for the call okay All right now here is Mr Rogers on last night's win\n\nVery apropos [noise]\nWhen he went through last week [noise] and the team to stick with him and the guys to kind of\nWrap our arms around them and encourage him the way that we do for our teammates was a\nGreat and then he responded to the crowd um I thought it was very encouraging I was trying to figure out a first if it was a kind of a sarcastic chair but I've I've felt like it was a pretty heartfelt encouragement after he made into you know for ... and three extra points so he was um\nObviously very happy afterwards and we're very happy for him\nTo shows a track record in March\nFrom your mind the fact that you've done this as an office before several times op ed official is absolutely\nYeah I mean to be honest there were no time outs um if the run or start to dry doesn't get out of bounds were playing that probably a little differently um but a\nKind of went through an oldie but a goody and I'm David back they are actually suggested\nSo I got to give him credit or else they'll tell me about it tomorrow but he uh he suggested that play an anti obviously random all well and got amounts\nThat was get some parts of your eyes and see how they responded to a three time outs I Believe left so I'm very they might call time out and then we adjust our thinking based on um how many are three on it but\nI was I was going to come to them I was looking to see it or they're released on the backside first and then was gonna was obviously come to come into the ... he was the hot and I mean he walks out of rolls out of bed he's the hot in you know he's he's a talented guy and then I was a\nYou know was was how we ... we need to play moving forward um sixteen targets for volunteering nine for Jimmy that's a that's the way we want to be\nWhere the thing I'm most proud of is when he turned his head that something that we've talked about um\nAt various times um but the awareness that had to shell that he's kind of in that a whole shot area and he turned it said the perfect time or the ball slightly behind him but he made a cat state I've got a balance I mean I was the big player to drive I ever seen them to come back and I'm not really thinking\nWith eleven seconds uh same thing other side but devout they just got off so clean or any was you know smart enough to be close to the sidelines and the ball just actually took him out of bouncing\nEarth\nTime and a half they deserve a they deserve it they've earned it um your quiz is is really a make a big place for especially the last couple of weeks\nUm nice job tonight uh you know the play that I'm most proud of him as a when he stepped up out to the right and he kind of we'll downside lines I throw a ball a little too far inside any kind of fought for American tested a cat that was a very important for us obviously had some little bubble\nUm that he bursts up a field you know normal there were three are getting into a ten year again so I'm proud of him for that probably by becomes a good time for us getting drawn into in a in random back healthy but I feel a lot better better adept um after six weeks and then after a pretty soon you'll be\nYeah definitely felt that way we missed a couple a\nCouple of things you know we had a couple of mental airs I missed a couple of throws and it just not in the same page you know Jimmy around where I'm obviously things turn in and he was thinking about turnout so you know we got stuff to to look back at it obviously is going to feel better tomorrow after her win than uh\nYou know what what what are we felt like being two three months by any\nThere on a ... yard run and and what was the thought process that missile just take off\nWhere they they went to some uh some too man there\nUm after the second last drive when we started kind of hidden devised a on a deep overall\nUm they were playing someone I safety with the backside coverage element to kind of checking the titans released to are trying to Rob that backside deep overall to combat that they've placements I leverage with the safety back a week which means in Forman rush nobody's got me\nSo I just extended to play as I stepped up I kind of felt ah as I was running that time was I was making me look slow but he was coming in for a block 'em and and I you know just kind of took a\nPretty decent shot there and luckily we are\nComing up to the ball and got it spiked and got a couple more good place today\nOkay in the last question for Rogers is up there and how come you guys always use so many time out so early in the game is it your fault or coach McCarthy's owe them will comment to that question every week because of it I don't get it I don't get it\nWell I Am one of the things listening to both of nice gentleman and said they both kind of indicate when they play fast they play better\nThe other thing is this going back to the time oh I agree with you Carl but do both of them say that you know temple temple or you're not up tempo\nBut the other thing is when you don't have a time out you can challenge it could be an obvious played at the rap even knows they made the mistake right that's a good you can see it clearly which you cannot challenge because you don't have a time out to challenge with so I mean this yeah they\nGotta but now on the positive side well like you mentioned he feels better now about their um depth at receiver I Do too after because those young guys have a have stepped up\nWho is the one guy that that back shoulder that actually kind of narrow the defender yeah that was an amazing catch that he made that was ... and like I mean that's what we're Rogers and Nelson made their bread and butter for years but this guy came back the defender was in perfect position and he made a great player coming back\nAnd I was so good to see our favorite ... a defender ... get up a key penalty [laughter]\nBefore the forty niners ... oh yeah\nYeah ... well I got to tell you about twenty eight for the Packers I I Wonder if he's still a Packer today he made that last week he got that Fifteen\nYard penalty and write for a which was stupid and then there's this uh the Annette kick return or we're just\nGetting back into game he pushes the guy when he's clearly oughta bones [laughter] it's like what do you think you're a tough guy [laughter] [laughter] I mean I I don't get it it might not gone I gotta believe if he does it again the third strike he's got to be\nGoing well I think he might be ... with the by and but you know the guys that come off injured she might be gone you know so I mean uh why don't we take our final break\nSome there will be

into this game the problem with the forty niners is turnovers they had five against the cardinals and there was the cardinals twenty eight Eighteen uh when I was watching to see that she Jay ... heading into this game I thought it just gets got a pretty good arm or something to do better I drop off from Jimmy ...\nAnd then as I watch them at the game last night I even tweeted out I go would you rather have this number three for the forty niners and\nSean Kaiser Brett how many as a backup when the guy finished a full game last night in prime time with a quarterback reading of one Fifteen\nTo touchdowns longest sixty seven yards he's finding Markey's Goodwin down field and then in the college\nHe's talking about this play where they had worked on this earlier in the week where they could get good went down to seem like that but he couldn't believe that Russia was on this is the forty niners quarterback CJ breath or we felt like he had let down his whole team\nAnd trying to take a shot play on a third in for and is that Kevin ... steps in front of it and gets to pick\nYeah I mean it was a an all out with and\nSomething new piece of work on\nThey just run by the guy I guess one\nThing to worry about quitting when\nThere to play the hit it\nLooks crazy dolphin around here it's not very but yeah I feel like I was never put the bottom of a spot\nOn her back yeah I'm\nHere is what it is some of your listeners are asking to how can these teams come back like this other games go see something like this well there's no greater example that when the falcons were up in the third quarter the super bowl and the patriots came back and the safety is from Atlanta told me they made us run\nMan the whole game and we shut down Tom Brady and the patriots and then we got gas so we had to take a breather we one out of the gas we went into zone and that's when Tom Brady card to suck you start run those crossing routes you start running genes white on the on the backs\nSing drove down the field got the three touchdowns went on and got the when Kevin king says that they blitzed seven and they were and what he calls the man coverage when he got that pick was just four guys back\n... we're paying zero and we saw dial up before\nThings are going to check if something\nHappened to be on the you know the Olympics the hand and they were lying about that you know that they were lying about that but\nI got to pay it came to me and I was like by the right time and I gave it up or do\nYou know got my hair and ... and a fantasy that around read the eyes right away\nAnd it's a good one was behind them man yeah but but the pressure they brought my petting brings the pressure on her I asked a nose tackle Kenny Clark about that by the way the word that we got for the forty niners lock room as why was the running game so good because they were told to avoid two guys Kenny Clark and Mike Daniels just run around those guys mutton waste the off tackle\nRun you know and the gap if you can get Clarke you know double up or whatever but keep the ball for those guys\nDid a lot of polling last night to guards tackles even center at times\nSo I asked I asked ... about you know you guys came up a lot of ground in the middle but but you had this all out blitz when you got that intersection for Kevin\n... I think it was more more really about where we didn't do well and you know those last couple of jars and are known they tried to get their form in an office on uh we we have to have more conservative and\nMillion bucks you can go for a\nWhile I was playing better\nYou know everybody was everybody was doing his are about\nTo say you know we didn't have great technique in a minute we're going to really honestly [noise]\nBut the good news as\nYour defense force the family get one of the teams and Kevin comes up in the big picture when you\nGet this huge practices every all the time you're going to rip out the boats are going to say about the war or you know we got the ball and then you know kid may want to play the game [noise] you know close friends with your parents and his ... and listeners and he knew everybody into our corners that one on one and all your quarterback\nThought his guy who can make the boy your your situation is thirty for\nYou know they can get a quick or whatever and uh [noise]\nYou know do things weren't going so good honestly or the whole day and [noise]\nBut as he put his trust in us or at the end of the game to make a pie and could made it\n[noise] it's um it's interesting because we talk about the team we talk about the defense is a whole but at that particular play where you have the seven man Russian everybody else's on islands\n[noise] like rats or what [noise]\nNo I don't think because I mean I just exactly the way you want to sit and you know frankly I Wish she they need to kick as many field goals in life but um yeah definitely I was a that was a big bounce back game for Mason\nAnd really for a football team we we we needed that when I'm you know with the Detroit game started so we improve that I\n[noise]\nYoung guys are doing great yeah I mean you know with three receivers over a hundred yards so that that that's begun you know we'll just keep trust those guys could give them opportunities so they played a heck of a game [noise]\nYou know [noise] I wasn't no I was\nThinking about that all of a thing about one in the game\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah I I thought our guys that have you know be friends with a great job of that we're we're in the position more pop up to finish it will send the type shows but I thought our our our finished was much better we were you know cracking up the ball more than\nThan we've had in the past you know we took care of the football so that always plays a big part conductors\nKind of challenges and you're all going on [noise]\nHad I mean there's you know there's things you make adjustments as far as I call things and you know and high to declare but all of our guys didn't get all kinds of starts up front you know you try to control much as you can tell what the play called the buyer slide out there in the\nWorld in the midst of ... to stay away from anything bags get on to that some pressure you know after some pressure during the second and\nThird quarter into the fourth quarter so you know we we have some calls really really had nothing to do with you know\nThe right taco position so hustle bonded nice job\n[noise] [noise]\nWell you know that's that that's really what the ... for you know we'll we'll just we'll do a lot of individual work with our players always just across the hall where we'll we'll spend time
