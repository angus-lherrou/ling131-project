sir how can I help\nYeah I'll Try and keep it straight to the point I'm I've been living in my car on and off for about two months I was homeless for two weeks with my car broke down\nUm and I'm just wondering why they have become one of my biggest tractor and I'm just curious what advice do you have something never in that situation again like five families are financially stable to support me we've always struggle with money\nI'm currently working to grab strong job a lot of damage it caused by ships on the other one\nI don't make a ton of tips has a fair amount about I'm just wondering

wanting for coming by fires in the U.S out of it happening I\nKnow you're you're single yeah OK and when did you leave your parents' home\nAlso have been living a lap and as a child\nFrom a year and a half but I moved to BC and once I got to be the hours in a car accident mhm\nBut my money that I had played one war my vehicle\nWe call them and then it was great in the middle of summer and I wasn't able to secure work until shortly ago maybe on later I was living in a homeless shelter mhm and now recently the shelter I extend it might say like it's been on one\nBut um where is home yeah I I parked by the ocean and I don't know where where do your parents live\nAh my mom lives about three hours away but she has a boyfriend going ... me being the areas that are really\nAh [noise] it's very tough tough\nLiving in a mall or as a ... a ... a health issues right\nYou know living in your car is tough they don't have another bed well I mean you don't take up much space as long you're going\nTo be like a smaller me\nA southerner bicycling homeless to\n[noise] a bite their lives by choice but\nYou know okay\nBut yet but I guess basically where she lives\nShe would bill I live in Korea for about a two and a half hour drive away from each other\n\nBut if the trainers coming at you and run to that obviously right\nAnd and what's the difference in those two events are both light both a tunnel both the situation one is you believe that if you run to the lot you're going to get out of you believe you run to the like you're going to get killed right I mean show that's helping hopelessness\nAnd all of a U.S me included face that or have faced that at times in our lives\nAnd it's amazing to me the power of our brain and our spirit that God gives us to do things that are way beyond what we thought we could do once we believe that there possible\nThat's called hope\nAnd so when I show you what you you know you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you got thirty thousand dollars in debt you feel stock but gosh if we did that at a thousand dollars a month you're going to be out of debt and my ... and a thousand dollars a month out of a hundred thousand is nothing I swam thousand dollars a year you're going to be out of debt and a little over two years\nAnd you suddenly go oh I see it ... it's the same situation you were in but now you can see it\nYou see what I'm Talking about and once you can see it that's called hope I can see my way out one of the things that steals your hope is when you have lost your perspective perspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things\nIt's happened to me it's happened to you know\nI remember one time one of my daughters when she was in high school certain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was very upset by the world is\nComing to an\nEnd her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and comfort her\n[laughter]\nNow why are we standing in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their\nHopeless well we've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been places she hasn't been and have experience is that she doesn't have right so in other words we've been to our twenty year class reunion we know she'll be glad he didn't call\n[laughter]\nThat's why we're giggling about standing and All right so we have perspective and so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it\nThen you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer\nAnd it it's going to grow some things in your future you know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you ... there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in [noise] but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different than when you look out ten seconds\nAnd the man I was just talking to an end folks that have dealt with an homeless situations is one of the problem was the the desperation just to eat and not be cold\nCauses you to have ten second increments of thought instead of ten year increments are thought to I can stand back from that sitting here warm and with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more\nBut he can't see he couldn't see that you don't care that you wouldn't get\nSlapped go go go deliver pizzas go blow leaves go walk dogs go shovel something somewhere you know go do something do you know work all the time because as soon as you do that money comes from work is where it comes from I Can't get enough hours than work someplace else work more\nWork all the time but but because I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does\nI mean when we were going broke two babies and wife houses in foreclosure were that close to homeless ourselves\nSo how we get out of it worked her mind off and well you know you you\nCan't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way out I went bankrupt but I didn't lose the house and if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that well you know ... and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter only thing is just\nPerspective as like I didn't grow up rich\n... had a friend that grew up rich and because he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out considered always worked out and I had the perspective that Bangor guy [laughter]\nIt's gonna be awful ... and ... because he thought everything was always going to work out you know it all worked out a lot because I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes it didn't work out you say you set yourself in these tracks and these rockets\nWith this thing but when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work through it it's when you can't see the other side of it that you don't want to work through it 'cause you don't believe it's going to work that's called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same way different issue is your perspective\nAnd so I'm challenge and some of your another think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you think you're stuck in this\nMarriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're not stuck\nYou're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film strip you're going to turn the pages are males are going to happen better or worse tomorrow it is not going to stay the same you are not stuck\nSo look the other side of it look out there five years look out for three years look out their ten months and say one of I got to do what's got to be true that's not true right now for me to never be here again that's a question he was asking but he was having trouble emotionally buying it\nAnd I don't think I helped him a it's kind of bothered me that's why I Want to talk about a minute I'm not sure he heard me\nBut if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you took my wallet away with everything I have been through I had no identity no I ... you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long\nBecause I don't believe that about me and my future and I know if I Do this this and this that I'll be out\nAnd I I work my way right out of it I don't I don't know how long it'll take but I Would get there and push my way through it and um and I haven't always been that way there's been times that I was so scared to show beat up and so hopeless but I couldn't breathe and I couldn't see what I'm Talking about here is that is is vision site\nThat gives you hope when you lose your site when you can't see the other side of it\nThen then there's no you know that it's hard to take action\nIt it's hard to fix it and the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you've got to do a series of steps you've got to take to become unstuck wherever it is you are stuck wherever it is I'm stuck I think that guy's got to be okay I really do I think he's going to be better off than he thinks he's going to be\nI think it's going to work out great book to read if you already called pizza tiger the guy that started um dominos pizza Mona him came out of the army made some bad mistakes and ended up living in a homeless shelter\n\nAnd then he ends up owning dominos pizza\nYou know it can be [noise]\nYou can choose for it to be All right\nIt's not magic is not positive thinking and it's not easy\nAnd and it's one of the reasons I read biographies of success for people is he lets me know that they went through crap and they made it [noise]\nAnd it and then if I'm going through crap I'm going to make it [noise]\nThat that's what I'm you know that's

it's bad it really is sad the Philadelphia Eagles just dominating the New York giant it is Wednesday for six bats how bad it is just not get much worse than that but\nThat's what it is I mean the reality is the New York giants\nAre awful football team and he like manning is a washed up awful quarterback there's no other way to put it but that\nAnyway man and gets outta ... career he like many will go down as one of the greatest quarterback from the history of the New York giants he's a winning quarterback with two Super Bowl rings and he was part of both the Sims of course one one and ... there was a quarterback for the other but watching Eli Manning\nFirst half tonight forget the rest of the season forget all last year\nHe so evident there's so little left and the fuel tank it makes you still wonder what the heck with the giants thinking back in April and the trap to current\nAnd I bring that up because of this for all the giants fans out there for all the quote unquote football fans who still sit there thinking the New York giants made the right decision in drafting sake one Barclay number two overall in a quarterback rich draft\nWhen the giants aren't exactly a team that usually draft second overall where he put it this way sake one Barclay has been nothing but dominant tonight\nSay Guam Barclay has nine carries for Seventy one yards for receptions for Seventy eight yards dues aren't pays for three hundred yards of total offense himself\nAnd the giants scored six points\nYou get the correct as great a running back and said well I'm Barkley is and might end up being what it's all said and done heck he might be a legendary running back when it's all said and done I'm not going to use that crazy were generational because we over used that word\nBut said going Barkley can become a great back and maybe one day he might be that generational guy I Am a little early to say that now\nBut even with his nomination they're losing twenty four to six at halftime and there were all on their way to going one in five fools out there who want to say bought the New York giants were gonna stink this year so they get another high draft pick they dropped a quarterback ... next year here's my answer to that\nNot every quarterback classes the same\nIf you're looking at drew luck Jared stood on the ... the state\nAs the best quarterback snatched draft I hate to tell you something that doesn't compare to what we just had with Baker Mayfield Sam Darnell Josh Rosen Josh out that may not be Nineteen eighty three with el way in Marino and those all those guys\nBut as a pretty darn good classroom quarterbacks compared to what is being projected to come out next year and if the giants are intent on track your quarterback next year with their high first round pick your mind as well have done it this year\nIf the attention is we're going to draft a quarterback next year you should have done it in a deeper quarterback trapped because guess what there'll be another good running back and next year threat because every year there's good running backs right\nEvery year there's a quality running back somewhere in that first round or second round that ends up having a nice nice lengthy career where you say man that guy might be a future hall of fame esque type player but how often do you have quarterbacks and you sit there going wow this is a quarterback rich scrapped\nVery rarely do you get that luxury\nAnd I think for the New York giants here's the problem that I Want to bring us producer Sean what the market 'cause you watched the first half as well my good friend short run on from ESPN who I've worked with in Philadelphia\nA wrote a great article about look beyond the numbers on the line man and forget the completion percentage forget the touchdowns to interception ratio in fact if you actually break down the analytical numbers of Eli Manning he's one of the worst quarterbacks and football right now\nRight you're reading John you saw that one of the worst quarterback and the NFL today and it's a continuation of the decline of Eli Manning over\nThe last ... years Josh Allen right yeah exactly [laughter] right but he he would literally hit bottom of the ... if not he but he bounces off Josh Allen right now sets the saving grace that's how bad it just because of the Rockies\nHe's exactly one rookie one day what sixteen years Seventeen or sixteen year and a senior fiftieth or even giants yeah Fifteen Years\nAnd he's saved by the grace of you know why because there's a rookie quarterback beneath them right now but the reality is if the giants ended up trapped you know the quarterback in the first round next year Sean he's been dead admitting they screwed up this year because the intent is it a hundred wind ... biggest\nBy dropping say glum Barclay what you're telling us is you think he got at least three years\nBecause if you go in traffic quarterback a year after dropping said while Barclay what'd you then as many as we screwed up he was shot washed up and we didn't see it so now we're going to try to remedy a year later in a much weaker trapped class\n... has the progress of just from the I test and I know you you back it up with the numbers are joined Ron I'm wrote in in in his article on ESPN dot com today but it just the test he has a breast from ... but even last year though you saw regression right I\nKnow when the giants were in the draft and you you were the first one to ... you said the first guess you have to have to drop the quarterback the giants have dropped quarterbacks Eli just doesn't have it anymore and what did they do they have to take one Barclay and and now they're paying for it\nWell and it's and and here's the problem for the New York giants is there's a red headed stepchild it's all the red heads I hate to say that but that's a figure of speech these days but\n... right after they trapped in a guy named Arnold who the giants could have had he stood up and down but overall he looks pretty good and we forget he's the youngest rookie you'd ever start a season and the NFL as a quarterback\nIf he turns out to be not great but really good and wins a Super Bowl for the jets\nThen it doesn't matter what say quote and Barkley does because the New York giants could have had continuity at the quarterback position from Fifteen Years of Eli Manning to Fifteen Years of sand Arnold\nYeah and instead the giant strap became the fourth round that are rich when he's not going to be the guy let's not kid ourselves right now they're going to end up having to take a guy because what you witness and the first half here\nAt metlife stadium is again even more defined from Eli Manning it scans the part where it's sad now right\nBecause you look at quarterback stay in the NFL and most of them have the athletic ability to roll out through on the run right how important is it when you look at the quarterback they were just drafted Sean Mayfield can roll out he's athletic confer on the run Sam Donald can roll out can throw it on the wrong he's athletic same with Josh Allen\nRose and maybe not as much as the other guys but he's certainly more athletic than Eli Manning Jackson's about that either the bunch\nIran manning is a dinosaur in today's NFL\nYou line manning does not fit what the league offers any more at the quarterback position and it is evidence and he does not work that may be\nA message from the national pest management association and the American College of allergy asthma and immunology\nUnexpected reactions to smart financial decisions

Heat in fact they had pretty much worked out a deal they agreed to put Josh Rogers did in the deal\nThen they agreed to put the waiters into kind of feel the cap than they agreed to put in a protected first round pick at that point everything seemed to be done to where the medical information as we're all exchange which\nIn the league usually means that it's a final I feel you check the medical as long as it you know all looks kosher led to Dover\nAnd what ends up happening is then Tim ... calls pat Riley asking for more draft picks Riley promote we are told calls him a mother beeper and hangs up on them\nThe funny thing is I Believe every\nHere's why because the inkling that we've gotten coming out of this story\nIs that Tom ... doesn't want to trade Jimmy ... Thompson it'll have to win games or else he's going to be unemployed looking for a job after this year and he knows that without Jimmy Butler the chances of winning are much much slimmer me butler as much of a jerk as he seems to be he's a top Fifteen type player in the NBA today\nSo if you're talking to somebody you don't want to deal him now Glenn Taylor the owner of the timber wolves wants to be a little bit on Scott lady who\nWant to keep their jobs don't want to deal Jimmy ... or so I can kinda see Tom ... go through the motion All right we want Richardson idle never including oh boy

tough\nQuestion I Want another pack I I Want another first round pick\nMother beeper done that's it I Can't believe that 'cause I don't think Tom Thibodeaux wants to make the deal so I think Tom pivotal did that because he realized oh my goodness I'm about to lose Jimmy Butler the deal that I don't want happenings about to happen let me make sure it doesn't occur so let me make it a deal where I Know pat Riley is not going to take it\nI completely by it\nKnow I I I doubt pat Riley what Mitt that he called Tom ... mother beeper or that Sybil I've met that pat Riley called amen hung up but I hundred percent believe it happened because I can completely understand the premise as to why you would occur because Tom vivid oh doesn't want this to happen\nSo he's going to do everything in his power to make sure it does and and that includes maybe even screwed himself over in terms of working relationships like with guys like pat Riley and maybe getting a reputation out there that you can't deal with them to do because he goes back on his work\nBut it's a bad spot this is like Glenn Taylor the owner of the Minnesota timber wolves have never won anything\nBecause you put the

I was going to be a free agent even at the opt out of his\nHis contract so uh it's tougher ... to to do it that way and they have some young guys but you know you have to\nGuys are to pitch in the Bronx will they bring back the back that would be an interesting decision\nThey have to upgrade that because they're pretty good and every other area even though you know there was the Gary Sanchez thing or is the John Carlos ... uh he wasn't great this year but if you fix the pitching a lot of that stuff falls in allied or at least it's manageable\nThat is you're right I mean here's the problem though the Yankees in I mean they they\nThey are going to be compared to the red Sox obviously as you know Richard and the fact is like the red Sox have won every battle recently that is Alex ... completely out manages Aaron Boone they get real JD Martinez five years a hundred and ten million da ... you know they get John Carlos stand on two hundred and Seventy five million where the heck it is\nYou know they go out get a nice picture Chris Sale a couple of years ago Richard the Yankees are still kind of searching for that and on top of that it's just you know move after move after move

B. you know what you look at the Dodgers team no question Clinton curve shows going to go game one he gets the nod of course pitched wellness visual series how important J. D. or what type of pressure do you think he feels considering the one blemish on his incredible career has been the fact he hasn't been a great postseason pitcher [noise]\nYeah I I don't know how much pressure he feels he's the guy who just so intense on the day that he pitches whether it's in April or may or June or October you really wouldn't know what time of year it is just by talking to him\nAbout watching him go about his business going ... kind of on another level in that regard\nUm as far as the struggles that he thought not Tobar if you look back on his recent record now you want his last words as opposed to you and I remember doing an interview\n[noise] oh boy one of these about four years ago and and somebody asked the question why is the first shot struggles and the post season and my answer at the time was I don't know if it's a an October thing or a St Louis cardinals\n'cause he's never beat the cardinals those\nAre but ever since the Dodgers have been able to avoid that St Louis seed in the playoffs\nPerson been more or less the same guy that he wasn't the regular season and and\nStress to say that his his postseason struggles are behind him\nOr if it's just that he's gotten better match ups the cardinals have not been a good match up for him but pretty much every other team has a this is going to be his first chance to get the brewers in October we'll see how it goes\nYour news or J. P. for him is she's not David Price right so I guess you could always look at that as a measuring stick\nMy daughter I have a worse that is true little bit being very ... David Price\nFor the Dodgers oh what about the pressure for an organization that has one in Thirty years that has been an absolute fortune if you put their last four years combined payroll you're talking right around a billion dollars yet they make the post season but no World Series rings on their fingers once the pressure situation like in LA is starting to boil a little bit\nThat depends on who you ask I think if you look at it rationally if you look at the teams that they had going into the postseason over the last Thirty years it really wasn't until I Would argue the last five that you could really see a World Series caliber cheap coming together\nUm obviously this is your there six ... division title in a row um\nYou know last year they got as close as you can get without winning the world series I kinda feel bad for the fans though there there's a level of cynicism that as bad as just sat in among the fan base that is kind of stunning for a team that is as good as the Dodgers have been in this decade\nUh I I feel like most fans would be happy to have the team that the Dodgers happier and you're out and for sure there are some fans that certainly do not take for granted a this amount of success but the Dodgers have had a but again there's just this\nUnderlying pessimism day here sometimes interactive advance on social media words that they are almost ... expect the team to fall short and that\nAnd it's almost as if they're watching it different teams that you know some reporters in the press box a are watching it's like you see the talent level there on the field\nLike I said this is a team that I think has come close to a couple of times so close that you would almost expect them to have one one by now um and they've been fallen short I think the pressure is really more than\nA I think internally to front office has done a pretty good job putting together a team that can contend maybe this is the year but again like I said if they fall short I think there are some segments of the fan base that are just so jaded by what's happened since Nineteen eighty eight that they wouldn't be surprised\nTo LA LA daily news shape your for joining us going to enforce that NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com and Jamie in terms of the weaknesses were you know the bulk of the stars are really good uh you know I like warm viewer he's a phenomenal young player I like the bats how concerns you about this bullpen moving forward considering how they ran all year\nYeah it's a ... uh it depends on how how long the stars could go really um they haven't been exposed in the postseason yet [noise] um\nAnd and I don't know if that's because Walker dealer Clinton curse Shaw engine review rich show these guys are just hitting their stride\nBut the Dodgers really haven't had to go to their bullpen so early that it's exposed that as as the weakness that it may be [noise]\nUm I I mean I'm with you there if you look at the run up\nIt's a really strong line up if you look at the rotation it's a really strong rotation um the bullpen is the weak link on paper\nUm but even in that game that Walker ... really struggled to find his release pointing in the Atlanta Braves game three the only game in the division series but the Dodgers lost both really wasn't attached in that game so I'm I'm not sure where they are at this point uh there's certainly well rested\nUm it's a question mark and and from where I'm sending it it could go either way I I think a proper it's generally does a pretty good job of getting the matchups that he wants um [noise] but ... council could make a different difficult form a it's a pretty good brewers mine up there to\nLast question J. P. or maybe there is a divide with this question Twain fan base and the baseball people and I want you to break it down both ways in terms of Dave Roberts if this team doesn't go in and let's say when the world series\nDoes he feel pressure from the fan base does he feel any pressure from the front office\nUm I I think it depends on how it goes um you know I mentioned the Roberts is generally handled his bullpen pretty well but I I think if he has you know not to single out here in boot because he's not the only managers met some questionable bullpen cause or both non calls but\nYou know if he had the games are either in this series or in the world series like glued had game for leaving Louis several Reno out there against the red Sox were as hot as any line up as you can see [noise]\nUm I think he could expose themselves to some criticism um although I Will say this you know for the Dodgers ... their bills to ride their rotation into the world series the Yankees were built to really lean on their boat and boom didn't or maybe Roberts would be more heavily criticized for not leaving a starter in ...\nIt's going to be all hands on deck and it doesn't matter if you're a starter reliever you might get relievers pitching longer than starters and it worked with Kevin Cash in Tampa Bay eight teams according to Richard use the strategy now and\nIt's probably here to stay and it's a you know that there's there's a rationale behind it when you think about the fact most runs scored in the first inning a lease runs to score the ninth inning so why not just what but all around I get it\nBut what does this mean in terms of those number three number four number five\nStation when it comes to salary negotiations because aren't they becoming less and less important in the sense of I may as well just pile up my bullpen with pictures\nAnd maybe have an answer to write you have a you know garrick coal and he had just in for a lender and I don't eat Dallas guy call because I just feel his lot with a receiver that'll you know with a a reliever that is going to cost a heck of a lot less\nAnd that's where we are going to do I mean is this a trauma thing he ever going to say\nIt would start happening yeah you would think it would start happening because more teams only ... you said Richard Justin said you know use that strategy this year I Would guess what sixteen next year twenty next year you know these trends ... right now that's a trendy thing in baseball but as a baseball fan then do you like do you like this new friend\nForget about if I if I Do like to do more things to do okay you don't you know why is that [noise]\nUm because I'm a traditionalist when it comes to baseball Sean and I always think you've got to start that goes to give you seven eight innings right the complete game statistic is important statistic right\nYou know what I don't like about it yeah yeah yeah it's been ... yeah I like ... and you know their\nHomes right yeah you can you tune into a game that's not your favorite team when you ... your favorite teams that involved for the starting pitcher 'cause you're always looking at him 'cause the camera's always on that guy right\nWho's pitching but the thing I don't like about it the most it's slow schemes down all these pitching changes I Can't stand it\nAll the all these visits to the mound I mean watching the Yankees and the red Sox and the LDS how many times did the what's that guy named Dana something Dana not Alex Cora\nOr run run or he it was the other guy Dana I I don't remember but he would always be with you know the guy with the grey beard you always got to the mound like every other inning it was just like what now\nI mean they only males the dad is hard you know it's just it's brutal baseball slow as it is it's just that and the pitching changes that they may cause they want to match up from the first ending the Milwaukee Brewers are matching the plane to match up so it just fills the game down I I don't\nKnow and you know what if your major league baseball if you're you know Rob man Fred in your whole goals to speed up the game this kill it\nFish strategy and it works by the way Tampa Bay won like eighty nine games I was I'm eighty seven game show here's the thing about Sean baseball trying to speed up games and here's the strategy that works buddies clearly slowing down games as you put it\nI mean if you Rob Manfred you're pulling your hair out going there's nothing I can do to just be baseball anymore because the trend is now leading slowing down because I Do think more teams are going to do it I Can't take the Yankees for instance All right\nYou have a CC so bath you can barely give you five six innings and maybe they bring it back to the number five start although I'd be stunned if they do but maybe it's easier to bring back a guy like cc because of the fact you you're only going to want him to pitch three or four innings at this point because you're gonna have such deaths as the bullpen and that's how you're going to go out and win games\nYeah you're right ... like they like the ... starters going it up endings to actually be the pitcher of record might be a thing of the past\nAnd the U.S you're not going to pay cc's the bath yeah I ten million dollars if he's only going to pitch three innings right so you can start to see the salaries going down for as you said back in the rotation stars\nWhen they see the money the Phillies and do they will make the money the Jacob ... who make the money the Andrew Miller's will make the money right they already do but they'll make more money\nSo I did have one in ten one inning stars I mean you know what I mean like one in pictures of know what to make money all split it up and there'll be you know you devalue everyone\nSo the worst thing baseball can do moving forward is expanding rosters\nBecause if you spend the rosters you're just letting right\nBrian or just play into that role and that's why when they go to you know they they expand the rosters in September to forty\nYou have teams that literally out to energize they have twenty picture that you know that's got to change do

the boy oh boy what an ugly affair coming to an end in what you would expect from an NFC eats match up usually one of those types of games where it's\nA bunch of a running plays defensive effort not the case at all just so completely disgusting fog league game that we witness there obviously when we saw the New York giants get blown out by the Philadelphia Eagles and it's getting ugly or one in five\nNew York giants team now thirty four to Thirteen they lose the eagles but let's give the eagles some credit All right let's give them some credit and the fact is they deserve a lot of credit because\nThey see me we have right at the ship but what exactly do we take out of an eagles with against one of the worst teams and football right now the New York giants that is one of the worst teams in football\nAnd regardless of sake one Barclay having just a phenomenal game you can't pick this one on him\nThirteen carries a hundred and thirty rushing yards kid average tenure to carry one touch down\nNine receptions Ninety nine yards including a fifty five yard and one is well I mean got targeted twelve times caught nine passes and on the season right now say quote Barclay nine more catches for him he's now up to what like forty catches on the year or something ridiculous like that\nBig one Barkley is on pace for over a hundred catches pretty ridiculous if you think about it and frankly shouldn't be is you're running back\nBoy in the New York giants are falling behind so quickly these games they have to abandon the running game and it's just not going to get the opportunities that you would hope he gets to run the football and instead he has to become another wide receiver but safety blanket for Eli Manning because the office of wind has been so ridiculously bad\nThat he's getting hit hard four times Eli was sacked he was treated like a rag doll by the eagles defense but\nOnce again the question for the eagles or this or they truly back is this the super bowl defending champion team that should be incredibly scary now of course and Wednesday we a hundred percent healthy or is it an eagles team that still has issues that just happened to face the right team at the right time the New York giants\nI think it's a combination of both it's good to see you know you don't ask Shawn Jeffrey missed a bunch of games and start the season Carson was needed a couple of weeks to kind of get back in rhythm\nThey seem to be there they survive today without not having Jay a giant but I'm not sure that's going to continue what do you think about the fact that when when del small would Eighteen carries for fifty one yard that's an adequate Corey Clementa at eleven carries for forty three yards twenty nine carries for Ninety four\nYou think to write home about and are there are some concerns for the eagles considering you know say going Barclay and Wayne gum and combined for a hundred and forty seven rushing yards against that may be\nBut the giants just already good measuring stick because they legitimately are one of the three worst teams in the NFL right now than buffalo and probably maybe Arizona are the three worst teams the NFL right now\nBut it's ugly it is but you have to give the eagles or do I mean that team played well the eagles\nAnd all I mean when people are questioning you and people are wondering what's wrong how is it that you go from being a ... you know Super Bowl winning team to a struggling team getting off to a two and three start\nDidn't have a weight on the road they've had some bad losses that tendency lost his terrible\nYou know see a different Philadelphia Eagles team this is more the team that won a Super Bowl well except Nick falls on the super bowl not Carson ones but you get the draft\nSo given the eagles a lot of credit I certainly do for what they ... they were able to do look they had a lot of weapons we have ... or ALS Sean Jeffrey\nZach or it's that's a good group because you know receiving receivers in tight end hertz is very good out Sean Jeffrey has been really a very solid pick up for them just playing his third game since coming back from the injury\nAnd obviously you know Nelson Aguilar a couple of years back just seems to be totally lost my wife now snag or couldn't catch a cold and his second year\nAnd it just seemed like this was a guy that was going to be a humongous Boston other us the receiver that turned into a bus now I'm not saying Nelson Aguilar has been what people expected him to be considering how dynamic of a player he was at USC and he was a dynamic player no question about he was\nEspecially his junior year he had a huge junior over Thirteen hundred yards and nine touchdowns hence being your twenties overall pick\nBut to see where he's gone from year to to last year in the super bowl campaign to now this year\nAs being a solid target okay great he's not fantastic but he clearly is still a weapon in that off and ... and he got the job done tonight three catches for Ninety One yours including a fifty a yard play for Nelson Aguilar so the Philadelphia Eagles it's all about the defenses\nWell they got for sex\nI mean they wreak havoc in that back field they hid Eli Manning third team times third team quarterback cats that's unbelievable\nThat's an incredible number for sex and Thirteen quarterback kids he like manning was hearing full footsteps makes soldier was the big offseason pick up by the New York giants they paid him at that time the most money given to a left tackle and I'll tell you what\nHe looked like it a highly paid tackle you are very overpaid tackled tonight\nAnd you can see the frustration on Eli Manning's faces Philadelphia Eagles were hitting him time after time after time through one interception just headed off all night I mean forget two hundred and eighty one passing yards ... a lot of that just garbage passing yards at one point he was throwing what fifty percent of his past is complete that's it\nJust an ugly game for them then you just see the difference in town right now between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New York giants but here's a surprising thing to me producer Sean ... you're watching the game as well to me what's incredibly surprising is\nThe offensive line has issues and you know shame on the giants for not addressing it properly it's been three years now at least they finally got rid of Eric flowers\nBut when you have said going Barclay and he's as good as advertised right I mean Eli Manning is clearly on the down swing but he can still at least get the football somewhere I mean I Would think\nHow is it that between ... back in junior and sterling shepherd you're talking nine catches for anyone yards I'm Seventeen targets I mean to me\n... they'll play calling has to be called out here as well right Y Z like bad why is oh back um junior as deadly a deep threat out there is you're gonna find\nWhy is it that hotel backing juniors averaging seven point three yards per catch decent that more play calling then even the office of wind blows right\nI mean I Would think unbelievable\nIt's incredible to me really is incredible to me when you watch the giants inept off and so that's not ... to\nYou got to look at patch shirt or blame them I don't care how feisty is going to be in the post game press conference\nI don't care how much ... going to sit there and you know say the right things and act tough and want things to change but oh back him junior as big a weapon is you're going to find in the NFL today is literally useless in this game\nTo

V. okay\nI don't know the hydrated or cramping up or anything like that it seems that he was doing it on his own volition right when he decided to just jog off\nWhatever I'm not a doctor didn't stay at a Holiday Inn express\nNot going to question the New York giants on that one but it does kind of raise an eyebrow right\nI'm a little skeptical I mean I Would think of no doubt Beck and junior as emotional players years\nWould get upset to where obviously he would just kind of walk off after a very ugly first half the first half was in New York Giants were trailing at that point a you know fairly significant when he was a twenty four to six game at that point\nMaybe needed the ivy maybe it's a cover so he does look as bad considering the New York giants find old job back him junior for last Sunday's conversation with ESPN where he talked about the lack of passion from this demon by the way\nDid they seem to like passion of the lack of passion maybe just a lack of skill\nBut everything you said it's kind of accurate right I mean all the complaints you had on ESPN kind of showed itself reared its ugly head today right Sean I mean you watch the game that we heard his comments last Sunday and I'll tell you what it nothing has changed it's all the same complaints and he's right to complain because you\n... you know needs to discipline or do back him for his antics Amazon or do you think it's a non issue\n[noise]\nIf we find out that in fact O'Dowd decided to just jog off before half time not because he needed an IV but out of frustration and there's no question he's got to be\nSuspended or something right I mean the giants may just stick to that story may be true I I Can't sit here really questioned it may be needed the IV and\nYou know unless it's proven that that's just a a cover story the giants came up with right now to kind of protect him and if that cover story falls apart that I think they have no choice but to but guys or emotional on the sideline I don't think he's going to get suspended more yelling and screaming insurance will track record that's all\nI I don't like it though I I don't like it I don't like with old job back in his ... I don't\nAnd how much of it is an act of sorts in the sense of that's the expectation I mean we'll go back and junior everything he's done his lead to what the richest contract to wide receivers ever gotten the riches sneaker and apparel deal and then of football players ever gotten right\nSo you know after that one handed catch you made against the uh you know against the cowboys in that game on national or national television and far right he became a star and the fact is I think he plays it up a lot and was this was this the kind of passion he had those you I don't remember you know I don't remember if that that is but\nYou know I I just I don't like the way that he wears his emotions on the sleeves then I think it's just getting the point where as great players he is he's kind of annoying right really is\nI get is what do you mean do you think of course and when I was you know we're not given the eagles enough welfare\nWell how Carson look good he looks like he's back but Sean as I said do you know how much of the\nBees do the ... how do they need yeah they do you watch that either running the eagles you you think so yeah yeah I went down to ... to ...\nLike that guy shouldn't get Eighteen carries Corey Clemente twenty nine carries between small wouldn't comment\nFor Ninety four yards against a giant defense that isn't very good that's the problem that is why like as much as Carson went look good today and I don't want to take that away because it's steps and the guy coming back from a torn ACL an emcee I'll write the fact is he is playing the giants\nSo you have to take that into consideration the giants got once that happens to be Olivier Vernon playing his first game of the season that gives the giants a wall full seven sex in six games this year so it's not as if they're getting good pressure on quarterbacks to where it's like wow Carson when's put up to Seventy eight and three touchdowns against that defense you know what I'm saying so\nYeah it's good it's a good look for the eagles I just don't know how to read into it considering the way they played tonight does that beat teams like the rams says that the teams like Kansas City I don't know because this is the giants that one in five and only three and at home for a reason\nDo you think the eagles called the Buffalo Bills tomorrow morning and ... and we're kind of trade\nCalled above but I think they call the Buffalo Bills I'm not sure they get a dirt on nervous plane McCoy on Sunday then you might get injured didn't lose all about ads or anyone that's a great point if you're buffalo I mean right now if the court gets hurt you get nothing for him because he's not coming back next year\nThat's a great point it predicts yeah you have to call it played his last game for the Buffalo Bills and I don't know I mean I I don't want to go into a limit yeah but you know what those showing you ought to be somewhere it makes a heck of a lot of sense yeah\n...

didn't get in the end zone and how we let them in the hands on\nAny concern with Eli Manning in his support performances\nI'm not concerned about it\nLike I said none of us did anything good enough to win tonight\nAs far as Eli Manning uh still still believes you can get the job done\nConfidence in myself as good as they don't know I Know what can we can play just a matter of ... a risk I figure out to be more consistent and it'd be better than nothing\nYeah team are not playing well though you know obviously\nI'm not where we want to be um and are not happy about it frustrated or like like everybody's so\nYou know I guess you know they're all you can do is worried about you know the next game that says ... who ah you know you you look at you know he'll watch this game they'll learn from it you know learn these are things we can do better than what we can work on and are getting ready to play next next Monday nights or in Atlanta\nYou know they'll back um junior said they had a lot of a self inflicted wounds in this game to\nThis is a very good team to spite their record\nAnd they came out and they they they beat us\nFetus on every play 'em\nAnd we beat ourselves we I mean I don't

its credit to that team and and those coaches in there and give a lot a lot of credit or\nYou know it's amazing that uh the stories could have been so different\nIf this game played out in a different way the giants win the story is this the team that his back\nAnd is right in the thick of things in the division in a bad division because you'd be looking at the ... you'd be looking at the eagles sitting here at three and she's me two and four\nTied with the New York giants had they won this game Dallas two and three in Washington too into so you'd be like OK giants right in the thick of things and that division\nAnd also for the eagles you'd be saying well\nMaybe maybe this team has to reevaluate things because offensively they're not getting it done this the team at scored a lot of points last year and this year Carson once is not leading them to that high point total they hadn't scored more than twenty three points in a game until tonight\nAnd maybe maybe they should think about\nGoing back to Nick Boles or doing any sort of other drastic measures trading for Shawn McCarthy\nBut the eagles took care of business\nIn the New York giants and now the story for the eagles is all his right there are three and three there in the first place there often finally got going and for the New York giants it's back to the drawing board a bad football team has to figure out what's

their fans you know not scoring over twenty three points in any of these games it's twenty four points have tonight yeah in the first half so the giants officer [laughter]\nBut it's All right like based on what you saw tonight and I know it's hard because they were playing a bad team in the New York giants but do you think things are now on the up with the Philadelphia Eagles\nHas got that remains to be seen right I mean they have some really difficult games on the horizon they have to go on to the ... are really dominant jaguars defense they still\nHave a road game at the coliseum against the Los Angeles rams who I think\nIt might be the best the most complete team in the NFL right now I have some top pastor remained but within the division I think that after what we saw the the Washington Redskins\nOn Monday Night against New Orleans and and the lackluster ... report by the giants tonight it's got it's safe to say about minimum the eagles are once again the costs of the analogies that it's probably not very close yeah I\nI Would agree with that do you think that they also make a move though maybe to bring in a running back you know everyone wants to talk about was showing McCoy but there's other guys besides will showing McCoy they could be had at the running back position do you see for making the move\nOh it was put it this way they restructured pleasure Cox's contract and bring up something in the area of twelve million dollars and caps race next year\nI don't I don't think they're going to go and you know pick Jonathan Stewart offer waivers or

I I'm a football fan or take it as your your um\nAll I wanted to do every year as beat Texas and this year we didn't but the the silver lining was we got rid of my stoops yeah though how how long do you give the defense to improve or is the season just to wash now and you got to give it a year\nNo this season's not awash because they can still win the big twelve\nBecause you know keep in mind for a rematch yeah all could be a rematch or you can wind up playing against the west Virginia and then playing West Virginia a second week in a row\nAt the end of the you know what I hear West Virginia can go into that game on defeated you beat West Virginia in Morgantown and then all of a sudden you're playing West Virginia again in Norman for the big twelve championships so\nYou know ... everything changed our ... yeah that's you know what I'm saying that everything can change there\nAnd I don't think that the season is lost I think that getting rid of ... was\nIt was overdue Patrick this is a move that should have been made probably before the season but you have to understand Lincoln Riley was under a lot of pressure\nBecause he inherited stoops and it was Bob Stoops is the only reason why Lincoln Raleigh has this job in the first place so I feel like he was there probably gated he felt obligated to stick with them for as long as he did and the problem maybe is not so much on stupid just coaching\nI think the problem might be in the fact that they're just not recruiting the horses\nYou know you look at other schools that are getting these fast athletic defense of front seven guys\nAnd Oklahoma's not getting those players and the real real blueprint than we ... I talked about with Chris Landry er on my college football pod cast rushing to feel the highly recommend that Patrick you got to download download written now and and we talked about the problem there for Oklahoma defensively and what the blue\nFor Oklahoma defensively and the the blueprint should be Clemson\nOkay you look at Clinton who has put together a big twelve offense right what defensively under Britain ... who ironically it ... it was in the lower blood type ... still lives\nHe has built the fastest defense in the country\nAnd so they can live with playing big twelve style football\nBecause they have the players on defense there fast enough to get after the quarterback and cover in the secondary and that's got to be the blueprint for Oklahoma because if you look at that conference the way that you can wind defensively is if you have guys and the front that can get after the quarterback\nAnd if you have talented secondary players that can stop the deep All right now Oklahoma as talented as some of these kids are\nThey're not that great defense away they just do not have that blue chip guy\nThere's no there's no Nick both said there's no at all over you know there's there's you look at the secondary about what she was all those guys are going to the NFL there's there's none of those guys\nOn Oklahoma that's got to be the blueprint for them moving forward but I don't think this season has lost I think that they still offensively can play with anybody in the country calamari is just absolutely insane\nA great football it is striking so\nSometimes I think most of the time for the younger guys just leaving in how talk amongst each other in the house and then when you get out in the media just feeling the generic stuff that will give people something to talk about this people isn't says huh\nLet's get the Pittsburgh Steelers you ultimately field ... levy on bill will play for the Steelers this year or do you see them trading him\nYou know what I have no idea I mean it's a business decision I understand it of course me man a former player I Want him to be on the football field but I understand the business side of it too because when a team no longer wants to their country though are no longer feels that you can\nHelp their team with Sandra shape you're getting cut or we all know what the running back from fishing or you have a short life span and the NFL once you hit a certain age or you're not going to go to a younger guy who's younger faster stronger and a lot cheaper\nSo uh so I get it and I and all I can do but let me off buildings just respected his business\nDecision just like I Would any other football player and and I think that's how we have to leave it at that but until then James Caan or who's done a phenomenal job of filling in a I think you know they've got carried last week and I think they have the kind of get that balance because golf that are pretty bad defense\nYou gotta keep fit him or you can't you got to keep them ... she got to take time will possession you have to have valid so it's all about\nThrowing the ball excuse them your child's okay and when you're the giants like you got to complement each other in one form or fashion I think having James Caan are controlling the ball haven't been and they'd be connect with fugitive Smith and all those guys that's the form of how they try to a fact when are now coming game\nYou know the division I think is more competitive this year than it's been in a very long time especially when you consider the Cleveland Browns have themselves a pretty decent shot at being competitive throughout the entire season what's been the most impressive port to you about the way that they in turn this thing around\nDifferent you know the mindset you know a Cleveland Browns they've been losing for so many years that becomes a mindset a culture of the organization I think they're trying to break that vote you know things start off by having time to Pittsburgh Steelers say hey listen we got a good enough pain we should've won that game\nYou know I'm so it gives you confidence that hey we're not as bad as they say they're you know as I say we are so it's kind of a I think having a guy like Baker Mayfield the guys\nI like his comments swag I guess that's the only in a way but it's impressive that says I mean he's making guys around him play and making them excited to play football so I just love it I mean yeah like I said the AFC knowing that pet or do I look at what scared me I look at the\nCleveland get better Baltimore is getting better Cincinnati and they still have no talent for Pittsburgh we have been I think that the future of the ... or ... or give it up where does that put our team has kind of like where you go from the

Thursday Night Football in New York and it's bad it really is bad the Philadelphia Eagles just dominating the New York giants eighties swing the four to six bats how bad it is just not get much worse than this but\nThat's what it is I mean the reality is the New York giants\nAre awful football team and you like manning is a washed up awful quarterback there's no other way to put it but that\nAnyway manning is that a heck of a career he like many will go down as one of the greatest quarterback the history of the New York giants he's a winning quarterback with two Super Bowl rings and he was part of both those victims of course one one and ... there was a quarterback for the other\nBut watching Eli Manning out there just for this first tap tonight forget the rest of the season forget all last year\nEach so evident there's so little left in the fuel tank it makes you still wonder what the heck with the giants thinking back in April when the draft occurred and I bring that up because of this\nFor all the giants fans out there for all the quote unquote football fans who still sit there thinking the New York giants made the right decision in drafting sake one Barclay number two overall in a quarterback rich trapped when the giants aren't exactly deem that usually draft second overall\nWhere he put it to this white sake one Barclay has been nothing but dominant tonight\nSay Guam Barclay as nine carries for Seventy one yards for receptions for Seventy eight yards dues aren't pays for three hundred yards of total often himself\nAnd the giants scored six points you get the drift\nAs great a running back and say Guam Barkley is and might end up being what it's all said and done that he might be a legendary running back when it's all said and done I'm not going to use that crazy were generational because we over used that word\nBut say quote Barkley can become a great back and maybe one day he might be that generational guy I Am a little early to say that now\nBut even with his domination they're losing twenty four to six at halftime and they're well on their way to go only one in five\nAnd for the fools out there who want to say but the New York giants were gonna stink this year so they get another high draft pick they dropped a quarterback ... next year here's my answer to that not every quarter back classes the same\nIf you're looking at drew luck Jerry ... the ... the state\nAs the best quarterback smack draft I hate to tell you something that doesn't compare to what we just had with Baker Mayfield Sam darn old Josh Rosen Josh out that may not be Nineteen eighty three with el way in Marino and all in all those guys\nBut it's a pretty darn good classroom quarterbacks compared to what is being projected to come out next year and if the giants are intent on track your quarterback next year with their high first round pick your mind as well have done it this year\nIf the attention is we're going to draft a quarterback next year you should have done it in a deeper quarterback trapped because guess what there'll be another good running back and next year ... cars every year there's good running backs right\nEvery year there's a quality running back somewhere in that first round or second round that ends up having a nice nice lengthy career where you say man that guy might be a future hall of fame esque type player but how often do you have quarterbacks and you sit there going wow this is a quarterback rich craft\nVery rarely do you get that luxury\nAnd I think for the New York giants here's the problem that I wanted to bring us producers showing what the market 'cause you watched the first half as well and my good friend short run on for ESPN who I worked with in Philadelphia\nA wrote a great article about look beyond the numbers on the line manning forget the completion percentage forget the touchdowns to interception ratio in fact if you actually break down the analytical numbers of Eli Manning he's one of the worst quarterbacks and football right now\nRight you rented Sean you saw that one of the worst quarterbacks and the NFL today and it's a continuation of the decline of Eli Manning over\nThe last ... years Josh Allen right yeah exactly [laughter] right he he was literally hit the bottom of the ... if not he but he bounces off Josh Allen right now sets the saving grace that's how bad is just like that because the rookie\nHe's exactly one rookie ones what sixteen years Seventeen sixteen year and a senior fiftieth already the giants yeah Fifteen Years\nAnd he's saved by the grace of you know a lot because there's a rookie quarterback beneath them right now\nBut the reality is if the giants end up trapped you know the quarterback in the first round next year Sean he's been dead admitting they screwed up this year because the intent is it out of mind he lies\nBecause by drafting sake lumbar glee what you're telling us is you think he got at least three years\nBecause if you go in traffic quarterback a year after dropping state law Barclay once you there as many as we screwed up he was shot washed up and we didn't see it so now we're going to try to remedy a year later in a much weaker trapped class\n... has the progress of just from the I test and I know you you back it up with the numbers are joined Ron I'm wrote in in in his article on ESPN dot com today but just the test has abreast from what I don't watch but even last year though you saw regression right I\n... when the giants were in the draft and you you were the first one to ... you said the first guess you have to have to drop the quarterback the giants have dropped the quarterback is Eli just doesn't have it anymore and what did they do they have to take one Barclay and and now they're paying for it\nWell and it's and and here's the problem for the New York giants is there's a red headed stepchild it's all the red heads I hate to say that but that's a figure of speech these days but the jets drafted right after they trapped in a guy named Arnold who the giants could have had\nHe's been up and down but overall he looks pretty good and we forgot to use the youngest rookie you'd ever start a

Thompson it'll have to win games or else he's going to be unemployed looking for a job after this year and he knows that without Jimmy Butler the chances of winning are much much slimmer me butler as

Want\nAnother pack I I Want another first round pick\nMother beeper done that's it I Can't believe that 'cause I don't think Tom Fibonacci wants to make the deal so I think Tom pivotal did that because you realize oh my goodness I'm about to lose Jimmy Butler the deal that I don't want happenings about to happen let me make sure it doesn't occur so let me make it a deal where I Know pat Riley is not gonna take it\nI completely by it you know I I I\nDoubt pat Riley admit that he called Tom ... mother beeper or that Sybil I've met that pat Riley called them that hung up but I ... percent believe it happened because I can completely understand the premise as to why you would have ...\nIt doesn't want this to happen so he's going to do everything it was hard to make sure it doesn't and that includes maybe even screwed himself over in terms of working\nRelationships like with guys like pat Riley and maybe getting a reputation out there that you can't deal with top there

on no days rest comes out of the bullpen in Washington and bales down a series that game one of the world series last year he was dominant um you know because of what we remember is game five he he

nightmare to face her shawl because he brings three pitches or to the table that are better than any one pitch other guys have\nMentioned named David Price and look I who am I argue without scoring ... put me are you in their Richard Nathan somehow we'd get three outs the way that his luck has run when it comes to his moves\nPrice game too and and it's not a stretch to say David Rice is the price of the worst postseason starter in recent memory and historically bad\nA strange going games too I mean the Fenway crowd is treating him as if he's a rod and it's the Yankee crowd before a rod finally got over that playoff slump and was that way but the reality is is that the right move to pay the price at home\nYou can avoid it he's going to have to pitch I mean you have you have poor cello and sale and pricing you're not really sure what you're going to get out of Chris Sale and then you have to figure out a game for starter that'll probably be Nathan of all the humidity and go game three\nSo yeah the second guess would be have a role to his pitch better than prize or so is that it's better than prize but you're going to have to use them at some point and I think if he has a good person and you don't have these things work that credible get behind him in a hurry now if George Springer leads off a game with a home run all hills gonna break loose\nI'm David is such a young worthy but you saw that game against the Yankees and it it was not it was just one thing\nIt was terrible the other thing is is tempo his refusal to deliver pitches made you think\nHe's out of confidence so the this postseason thing is in his head and he has said it many times if I'm Owen ten you know until I went in October the other stuff isn't going to matter so I Would say a go get them you know they think they figured it out they've they've looked at everything he died\nThis is why they got him this is why they got Chris we're going to line up sale price and poor cello and we're going to win a World Series\nAnd can do you think I mean there's ... and they\nCan do it now that we're in these two championships series the Dodgers and Astros are heavy favorites I mean I I just looked at the betting out there they're significantly and and the Astros our team without any weaknesses right now and they have\nThe best rotation and these playoffs they have the best bullpen in the playoffs and you know and they have guys like they've been there\nA but that doesn't mean of course sale throws a shutout in game one no the other stuff is going to matter it's as good as you can get Chris Sale against us in our lander that's\nEverything you do you want in a postseason series\nThe brewers are capable of winning I'm you know the red Sox obviously they want a hundred and eight there Cape ... who I\nFound with Richard Justice comments then I'll be dot com here on going deep the enforcement NBC Sports radio the Yankees the disappointment October\nExit the main factor they one game too at Fenway I think many of us including myself thought you know what they've gotten the advantage that go to Yankees stadium that one seven trade postseason games and they got this wrapped up then they of course who sent sixteen to one and I thought they'd come back again for and I get the job done they did not\nIn terms of Yankees in this off season they had money to spend that got under the luxury tax the expected to be big players out there is that the word on the street or you think the Yankees are gonna be patient with the youth movement still\n[noise] no I don't think they're going to be patient a they have to fix the pitching and until you fix the starting pitching nothing else matters so who's out there I mean Patrick Corbyn of the diamond backs he's probably going to be the top free agent Dallas ... all of the Astros whose gonna be ... be a free agent I don't think I\nDon't think type person I was going to be a free agent even at the outset of his his contract so uh it's tough for it to to do it that way and they have some young guys but you know you have to have proven guys\nOr to pitch in the Bronx will they bring back the back that would be an interesting decision but they have to upgrade that because they're pretty good and every other area even though you know the risk of Gary Sanchez saying there was John Carlos Stanton or he wasn't great this year but if you fix the pitching a lot of that stuff falls in the line or at least\nIt's manageable\nThat is you're right I mean here's the problem though for the Yankees and I mean it's it's\nThey're going to be compared to the red Sox obviously as you know Richard and the fact is the red Sox have won every battle recently that is Alice ... completely out manages Aaron Boone they get real JD Martinez five years a hundred and ten million de ... go out and\nYou know they get John Carlos stand on two hundred and Seventy five million where the heck it is you know they go out get a nice picture ... sell a couple of years ago Richard the Yankees are still kind of searching for that and on top of that it's just you know move after move after move seems to be going Boston's way is it a reflection of Brian cash men\n[noise] well I Would say that yes uh but also look at how quickly rebuilt the replenish the farm system\nAnd tour as an end to hire the they have got a terrific young players a and I agree with you go in and the game for I felt the Yankees were a better team but I thought the Yankees were going to win a series I liked the Yankees\nPitching better I like their bullpen better and um [noise] you know they were one at bat from forcing a game five and they didn't you know it was John Carlos Stanton was ... standing at home plate in a position\nThey got him the job they got to do it didn't get it done it it comes down to the smallest things sometimes and now in the post mortem you know I think Brian catch and it's one of the great general managers and the game and I think the ah under house Steinbrenner they have a day of our organizational plan is stability\nBack in the mix again next year are they going to win it I don't know\nRichard you know baseball's a game of inches

B. you know what you look at the Dodgers team no question Clinton Kirsch I was going to go game one he gets the not of course pitched wellness divisional series how important J. D. and what type of pressure do you think he feels considering the one blemish on his incredible career has been the fact he hasn't been a great postseason pitcher [noise]\nYeah I I don't know how much pressure he feels he's the guy who just so intense on the day to pitch is whether it's in April or may or June or October you really wouldn't know what time of year it is just by talking to him\nAbout watching him go about his business going ... shots kind of on another level in that regard\nUm as far as the struggles that he thought not Tobar if you look back on his recent record now he's won his last or just as opposed to you and I remember doing an interview\n[noise] oh boy one of these about four years ago and somebody asked the question why is the first shot struggles and the post season and my answer at the time was I I don't know if it's a an October thing or if it's a St Louis cardinals\n'cause he's never beat the cardinals the post\nAh but ever since the Dodgers have been able to avoid that St Louis seed in the playoffs\nPerson has been more or less the same guy that he wasn't the regular ... and and I don't know if it's too far of a stretch to say that his his postseason struggles are behind him or if it's\nBetter match us the cardinals have not been a good match up for him but pretty much every other team has this is going to be his first chance to get the brewers in October we'll see how it goes\nYour news or J. P. for him is she's not David Price right so I guess you could always look at that as a measuring stick my\nWife has a little bit worse that's\nTrue a little bit being very ... they're going to have a price\nFor the Dodgers though what about the pressure for an organization that has been one in Thirty years that has been an absolute fortune if you put their last four years combine to payroll you're talking right around a billion dollars yet they make the post season but no World Series rings on their fingers once the pressure situation like in LA is starting to boil a little bit\nThat depends on who you ask I think if you look at it rationally if you look at the teams that they had going into the postseason over the last Thirty years it really wasn't until I Would argue the last five that you could really see a World Series caliber cheap coming together\nUm obviously this is your there six ... division title in a row um you know last year they got as close as you can get without winning the world series I kinda feel bad for the fans though there there's a level of cynicism that has managed to set in among the fan base that\nIs kind of stunning for a team that is as good as the Dodgers have been in this decade\nUh I I feel like most fans would be happy to have the team that the Dodgers have you're in you're out and for sure there are some fans that certainly do not take for granted or the smartest success but the Dodgers have had 'em but again there's just this\nUnderlying pessimism die here sometimes interactive advance on social media words that date almost ... expect the team to fall short and that\nAnd it's almost as if they're watching a different teams that you know some reporters in the press box a are watching it's like you see the talent level there on the field\nLike I said this is a team that I think has come close to a couple of times so close that you would almost expect them to have one one by now um and they've been fallen short I think the pressure is really more than\nUm I think internally to front office has done a pretty good job putting together a team that can contend maybe this is the year but again like I said if they fall short I think there is ... ... that are just so jaded by what's happened in Nineteen eighty that they would just cry\nDaily daily news shape you weren't for joining us going to enforce that NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com and Jamie in terms of the weaknesses were you know the bullpen to start as a really good uh you know I like walking viewer he's a phenomenal young player I like the bats how concerned are you about this bullpen moving forward considering how they spend all year\nYeah it's a tense uh it depends on how how long the stars can go really um they haven't been exposed in the postseason yet I'm In I don't know if that's because ... engine review rich show these guys are just sitting there stride\nBut the Dodgers really haven't had to go to their bullpen so early that it's exposed that as as the weakness that it may be\nUm I I mean I'm with you there if you look at the run up\nIt's a really strong line up if you look at the rotation it's a really strong rotation um the bullpen is the weak link on paper um but even in that game that Walker ... really struggled to find is released point again the Atlanta Braves game three the only game in the division series that the Dodgers lost\nBoth and really wasn't cashed in that game so I'm I'm not sure where they are at this point uh there's certainly well rested\nUm it's a question mark and in from where I'm sending it it could go either way I I think David Roberts generally does a pretty good job of getting the match ups that he wants um\nBut ... council could make a different difficult form a it's a pretty good brewers mine up there to\nLast question J. P. or maybe there is they divide with this question to wean the fan base and the baseball people and I want you to break it down both ways in terms of Dave Roberts if this team doesn't go in and let's say when the world series\nDoes he feel pressure from the fan base does he feel any pressure from the front office [noise]\nUm [noise] I I think it depends on how it goes um you know I mentioned the Roberts is generally handle is bullpen pretty well but I I think if he has you know not to single out here in boot because he's not the only manager's bitch questionable bullpen cause or bullpen non calls but\nYou know if he had the game either in this series or in the world series like mood had game for leaving Louis several Reno out there against the red Sox were as hot as any line up as you can see 'em and I think he could expose themselves to some criticism um although I Will say this you know for the Dodgers are they're built\nIt's going to be all hands on deck and it doesn't matter if you're a starter reliever you might get relievers pitching longer than starters and it worked with Kevin Cash in Tampa Bay eight teams according to Richard use the strategy now and\nIt's probably here to stay and it's a you know there's there's a rationale behind it when you think about the fact most runs scored in the first inning a lease runs scored the ninth inning so why not just flip it all around I get it\nBut what does this mean in terms of those number three number four number five starters in a rotation\nWhen it comes to salary negotiations because aren't they becoming less\nThe sense of I may as well just pile up my bullpen with pictures and maybe have an answer to write you have a you know garrick pole and he had Justin Vernon lander and I don't eat Dallas guy call because I just feel his lot with the receiver that'll you know with a a reliever that is going to cost a heck of a lot less and that's where we are going to do I mean is this a trend that we're going to say it would start\nHappening yeah you would think it would start happening because more teams only ... you said Richard Justice that they use that strategy this year I Would guess what sixty next year twenty next year you know these trends ... right now that's a trendy thing in baseball but as a baseball fan then do you like it do you like this new friend\nForget about if I Do like to do more things to do okay you don't know why is that [noise]\nUm because I'm a traditionalist when it comes to baseball Sean and I always think you've got to start that goes should give you seven eight innings right the complete game statistic is the important statistic right\nYou know what I don't like about it yeah yeah it's yeah it's been ... yeah I like what orders and you know their\nHomes right yeah you can you tune into a game that's not your favorite team when you ... your favorite teams that involved for the starting pitcher 'cause you always looking at them because the camera's always on that guy right\nWho was pitching but the thing I don't like about it the most it's slow schemes down all these pitching changes I Can't stand it\nAll the all these visits to the mound I mean watching the Yankees and the red Sox and the LDS\nHow many times did the what's that guy named Dana something Dana not Alex Cora or run run or he it was the other guy Dana I I don't remember nine but he would always be with you know the guy with the grey beard you always got to the mound like every other inning it was just like what now\nI mean everybody mails came down his heart you know it's just it's brutal baseball slow as it is it's just that and the pitching changes that they may cause they want to match up from the first ending the Milwaukee Brewers are matching the plane to match up so it just fills the game down I I don't\nKnow and you know what if your major league baseball if you're you know Rob man Fred in your whole goals to speed up the game this kill it\nThis strategy and it works by the way Tampa Bay won like eighty nine game doesn't worry eighty seven game show here's the thing that was Sean baseball is trying to speed up games and here's the strategy that works buddies clearly slowing down games as you put it\nI mean if you Rob Manfred you're pulling your hair out going there's nothing I can do to just be baseball anymore because the trend is now leading to it slowing down because I Do think more teams are going to do it I Can't take the Yankees for instance right\nYou have a CC so bath you can barely give you five six innings and maybe they bring it back to be the number five start although I'd be stunned if they do but maybe it's easier to bring back a guy like cc because of the fact you you're only going to want him to fish three or four things at this point because you're going to have such depth of the bullpen and that's how you're going to go out and win games\nYeah you're right ... like like I like the like starters going it off innings to actually be the pitcher of record might be a thing of the past\nAnd the U.S you're not going to pay cc serve at the high ten million dollars if you only going to pitch three innings right so you can start to see the salaries going down for as you said back to the rotation stars\nWhen they see the money off ... and do they make the money the chicken to Grimes will make the money the Andrew Miller's will make the money right they already do but they'll make more money\nSo that you'll have ... ten one inning stars I mean you know what I mean like Clinton won in pictures you know to make money ball split it up and there'll be you know you devalue everyone\nSo the worst thing baseball can do moving forward is expanding rosters\nBecause if you spend the rosters you're just letting right\nBrian or just play into that role and that's why when they go to you know they they expand the rosters in September to forty you have teams that literally energized have twenty picture as you know that's got to change too because that\nThat's kind of being conducive to their strategy because you have so many pictures now you literally can pitch a different picture for nine innings and then

it's all over at metlife stadium the boy oh boy what an ugly affair coming to an end in what you would expect from an NFC eats match up usually one of those types of games where it's\nA bunch of a running plays defensive effort not the case at all just completely disgusting fog league game that we've witnessed there obviously when we saw the New York giants get blown out by the Philadelphia Eagles and it's getting ugly or one in five New York giants team now\nThirty four to Thirteen they lose the eagles but let's give the eagles some credit All right let's give them some credit and the fact is they deserve a lot of credit because\nThey seemingly have right at the ship but what exactly do we take out of an eagles win against one of the worst teams in football right now the New York giants that is one of the worst teams in football\nIn regards to say quote Barclay having just a phenomenal game you camp and this one on hand\nThirteen carries a hundred and thirty rushing yards kid average tenure to carry one touch down\nNine receptions Ninety nine yards including a fifty five yard and one is well I mean got targeted twelve times caught nine passes and on the season right now fake one Barclay nine more catches for him these now up to what like forty catches on the year or something ridiculous like that\nSay going Barkley is on pace for over a hundred catches pretty ridiculous if you think about it and frankly shouldn't be he's running back\nBorn in New York Giants are falling behind so quickly in these games they have to abandon the running game and he's just not going to get the opportunities that you would hope he gets to run the football and instead he has to become another wide receiver a safety blanket for Eli Manning because the offensive line that's been so ridiculously bad\nThat he's getting hit hard four times Eli was sacked he was treated like a rag doll by the eagles defense but\nOnce again the question for the eagles or this or they truly back is this the super bowl defending champion team that should be incredibly scary now with Carson when seemingly a hundred percent healthy or is it an eagles team that still has ... has issues that just happened to face the right team at the right time the New York giants\nI think it's a combination of both it's good to see it on el Sean Jeffrey missed a bunch of games to start the season Carson when it's needed a couple of weeks to kind of get back in rhythm\nThey seem to be there they survive today without not having Jay a giant but I'm not sure that's going to continue what do you think about the fact that when when del small would Eighteen carries for fifty one yard that's an adequate Corey Clementa had eleven carries for forty three yards twenty nine carries for Ninety four yards he's in anything to write home about\nAnd are there are some concerns for the eagles considering you know say Guam Barclay and weighing bomb and combined for a hundred and forty seven rushing yards against that maybe\nFor the giants just already good measuring stick because they legitimately are one of the three worst teams in the NFL right now than buffalo and probably maybe Arizona are the three worst teams the NFL right now\nBut it's ugly it is but you have to give the eagles or do I mean that team played well the eagles\nAnd all I mean when people are questioning you and people are wondering what's wrong how is it that you go from being a ... you know a Super Bowl winning team to a struggling team getting off to a two and three start\nDidn't have a winner you know on the road they've had some bad losses that tendency loss was terrible\nYou know see a different Philadelphia Eagles team this is more the team that won a Super Bowl plugs up Nick falls on the super bowl not Carson once but you get the draft\nSo given the eagles a lot of credit I certainly do for what they were able to do look they have a lot of weapons we have ... al Sean Jeffrey Zach or it's that's a good group because you know receiving receivers in tight end\nHertz is very good out Sean Jeffrey has been really a very solid pick up to them just playing his third games is coming back from the injury\nAnd obviously you know Nelson Aguilar a couple of years back just seem to be totally lost my wife ... couldn't catch a cold and his second year\nAnd it just seemed like this was the guy that was going to be a humongous Boston other us the receiver that turned into a bus now\nThe law has been what people expected him to be considering how dynamic of a player he was at USC and he was a dynamic player no question about he was especially your junior year he had a huge junior over Thirteen hundred yards and nine touchdowns hence being a twentieth overall pick\nBut to see where he's gone from year to to last year in the super bowl campaign to now this year as being a solid target okay great he's not fantastic\nBut he clearly is still a weapon in that off and ... and he got the job done tonight three catches for Ninety One yours including a fifty a yard play for ... or so the Philadelphia Eagles it's all about the defenses well\nThey got for sex\nI mean they wreak havoc in that back field they hid Eli Manning third teen times third team quarterback cats that's unbelievable\nThat's an incredible number for sex and Thirteen quarterback kids he like manning was hearing full footsteps Nate soldier was the big offseason pick up by the New York giants they paid them at that time the most money given to a left tackle and I'll tell you what\nHe looked like it a highly paid tackle you look at overpaid tackled tonight\nAnd you can see the frustration on Eli Manning's faces Philadelphia Eagles were hitting him time after time after time through one interception just had an awful night I mean forget two hundred and eighty one passing yards ... a lot of that just garbage passing yards at one point he was throwing what fifty percent of his past is complete that's it\nJust an ugly game for them then you just see the difference in town right now between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New York giants but here's the surprising thing to me producer Sean ... you're watching the game as well to me what's incredibly Surprising Use\nOf the office of wind has issues and you know shame on the giants for not addressing it properly it's been three years now at least they finally got rid of Eric flowers\nBut when you have said going Barclay and he's as good as advertised right I mean Eli Manning is clearly on the downstream but he can still at least get the football somewhere I mean I went to think\nHow is it that we do know del back him junior in sterling shepherd you're talking nine catches for eighty one yards I'm Seventeen targets I mean to me I ... the play calling has to be called out here as well right Y Z like bad wives or do back um junior as\nDeadly a deep threat out there is you're gonna find\nWhy is it that old job back in juniors averaging seven point three yards per catch isn't that more play calling than even the office of wind blows right\nI mean I Would think unbelievable\nIt's incredible to me really is incredible to me when you watch the giants inept off and so that's not ... to\nYou got to look at ... blame them I don't care how feisty is going to be in the post game press conference\nI don't care how much pattern was going to sit there and you know say the right things and act tough and want things to change but oh back him junior as big a weapon is you're going to find in the NFL today is literally useless in

I Do they need yeah they do you ... yeah they are running the eagles you you think so yeah yeah I went down to ... to ... illusion or carry\nThat guy shouldn't get Eighteen carries Corey Clemente twenty nine carries a twin small wouldn't comment\nFor Ninety four yards against a giant defense that isn't very good that's the problem that's why like as much as ... look good today and I don't want to take that away because it's steps and the guy coming back from a tour an ACL an emcee I'll write the fact is he is playing the giants\nSo you have to take that into consideration the giants got once that same happened to be Olivier Vernon playing his first game of the season that gives the giants a wolf all seven sex in six games this year so it's not as if they're getting good pressure on quarterbacks to where it's like wow Carson when's put up to Seventy eight and three touchdowns against that defense you know what I'm saying so\nYeah it's good it's a good look for the eagles I just don't know how to read into it considering the way they play tonight does that beat teams like the rams that the teams like Kansas City I don't know because this is the giants there one in five and three and at home for a reason\nDo you think the eagles called the Buffalo Bills tomorrow morning and ... and work on a true\nIf you build it called above called the Buffalo Bills I'm not sure they get a deal on nervous plane McCoy on Sunday that he might get injured then you lose all that it's a great point that's a great point if you're both I mean right now if the court gets hurt and you get nothing for him because he's not coming back next year\nThat's a great point it predicts yeah you have to put on the court played his last game for the Buffalo Bills now I don't know I I mean I don't want to go out on the ... yeah but you don't want those showing you ought to be something that makes a heck of a lot of sense yeah\n'cause ...

laugh a lot to Atlanta so again the brewers or without the Milwaukee and the state of Wisconsin was without baseball so it's a unique story\nThere absolutely number two behind the package there there's no doubt their own pet owners above the Milwaukee Bucks from Wisconsin crowd for universities to call it\nJust doesn't compare the brewers are numbered soon it would be ridiculous Milwaukee hasn't had a world's championship since the bucks in Nineteen Seventy and not since before that the Braves in Nineteen fifty seven\nSo if Aaron Rodgers walks down the street in Milwaukee everybody recognizes that Christian yell at you by all means should be the national league MVP walks down the Milwaukee Does get recognized\n[noise] yeah I think he does now you wouldn't have in July I'm now he is rarely a his his persona has exploded he's under contract for the long term to any young he's twenty six year twenty seven so he's going to be the right and the peak of his prime right now he's found a home\nUh I think is really interesting series to offering them because Los Angeles is home\nFor Ryan Braun Los Angeles suitable for the owner of the ... mountains in July so he's still in his home um this is a unique book yell at you can he can walk down\nYou know he could have walked through downtown Milwaukee in July and not have anybody that and I now he's a he's going to see a different view of his uh his stardom in Wisconsin has taken off\nDo you guys might send repeated thank you notes for the stupidity of Derek Jeter trading infer Lewis brings sitting in that that he has been a couple of other dues I mean it's going to go to the dumbest trades over the last Twenty years in baseball when it's all said and done considering as you said he signed for an incredibly reasonable contract about five years fifty million dollars\n... it was hard to do\nAnd here's you know here's the deal to and if you look back and I think both ... and on January twenty fifth inning Lorenzo came in and getting across the aisle in the trade\nIf you looked at the the Twitter comments from you know\nTwitter also smart people on Twitter the day after that training on all the it had mixed reviews why trade in for a lifetime to Seventy hitter or perhaps and had great upside ... there's just an average out there\nAnd ah and then he has turned into ... beans is so ... girls or David storms that you know huge ... at its first blush there are a lot of people didn't think he was going to win that trade it all\nAmazing my Keller the big nine twenty Milwaukee the Big Ten Seventy Madison joining us we're going\nDeep bench worts been NBC Sports radio how important is it for the brewers to get off the hot stored knock around cleaning her show in game one\n[noise] yeah ... it's it's pretty important that you know certainly you can't\nYou can't do worse than a split at home and that's not like the best the five where are you better when you're home games right out of the gate or you're going to be in trouble um the ... you know that this is talk match up going against her shop the brewers did beat car shot during the regular season\nAnd ... councils Barry first managerial wind came against Clinton car saw the brewers are pregnant right handed hitting the line up and and first shot has been susceptible although not in his only post season starts so far this year\nUh I don't get out of his fight all but uh but you can't get slapped at home because then the ... that this year is very well could be short\nUm you've gotta you've gotta when one of the chewing certainly helps during the first one the other side on all that and then wrote him they haven't lost in more than two weeks on the calendar or they haven't won for ten or twelve in a row since they began the Nineteen eighty seven and at her team in a row so these are pretty heady times\nRight now from Milwaukee don't nobody taught or they want their last seven games or the right person and the one game playoff the taps and swept the rocky so this team is is it all and I think they're very well could keep it going\nNow it's a fun team to watch I Do enjoy watching them Christian yell at an absolute

this morning we'll hear yeah\nWhat we see what you're doing Dave he met no doubt they wouldn't do that but we we will be getting Dave's they of course and have him in the standings and we do that and everything but um Christ is God Arizona air a Minnesota thirty for Arizona ten\nMinnesota as well and kind of an interesting side note Larry Fitzgerald coming home that's coming back to Minnesota and everything I think that's kind of cool I I Hope he has a good game he's had a very rough season\nArizona's not good right now at all ah one of the worst teams in the NFL looks like but uh I I still

a lot of state\nKerry China's likes the bears Pam as going with the fish and Randy is going with the barracks\nChrist is God Chicago twenty seven Miami fourteen I of course have sweet home Chicago on that one is going to be interesting seeing them in warmer weather or right now at this point with that team that's so built for winter and everything that I'm a little curious to see how that defense holds up in the third and fourth quarter but should be a good game\nAnd then we go we got our Monday Night football game in San Francisco at Green Bay\nAnd then we have this story on the other end of the specter of what the bucket Hamad assuming Fleetwood Mac for kicking him out of a band\nHe alleges that his bandmates conspired against them and fired him without warning or a valid reason they also claims that he would have heard around fourteen million dollars just from the north American dates on their upcoming tore\nBuckingham was lead guitarist and singer for Fleetwood Mac from Nineteen Seventy five to eighty seven and again from Nineteen Ninety seven to twenty Eighteen\nThis is a it was just getting worse and worse you know this is ... ... it really is and I didn't realize that even though as much as I've done my homework on that band and I've heard the stories I asked my dad a little bit about it he told me some more that I didn't even know\nAnd I got I gotta feeling you got somebody with a soap opera yeah I guess I guess I you know when you hear it when you have all that evidence it kind of makes sense that this is the way it would end this is the way that this was going to go [laughter] I really hope that it isn't and this way I Hope that the ban somehow reconciled a little bit even if it's just that\nYou know there's a better ending to this but this would be the fitting ending for that bans\nOn some really good news here as it before we get into our new releases in theaters scarlet Johanson has done six marvel movies as the as black widow and now she is cashing in the Hollywood Reporter says she's going to make Fifteen million for the upcoming standalone black widow moving while\nFilming will begin somewhere next year which means to move we probably won't be released until twenty twenty\nScarlet salary though is significant for the equal pay movement hum it's the same amount as Chris Chris Evans increased ... worth who play kept in American thorn Avengers and all those as well as the upcoming uh vendors movies and and that's that is the beginning of the standard you're going to see this more and more\nAnd hopefully this gets to a point where it's not even a story anymore it's just the norm is the norm that scarlet would make the same amount as Chris Evans what I'm you know and so it's not even a story anymore that's what we're that's the hope here and had been she deserves it or not to be you know one thing that is not mentioned enough when this conversation comes up\nAnd it it's not you certainly everybody you know would regardless of sex should be paid for what you do work you do that I think everybody can agree with that I'm really wants to be paid for the job they do\nBut it's not to be left out of the cold here how darn talented she is in so many of these people are in this day not just actors but an every industry you know I mean that that kind of seems to get lost in ... a little bit that bothers me because they're ... if not more tail to just as talented as their male counterparts [laughter]\nI'm looking at new in theaters this week in bad times that they ... it looks like a really interesting twisted movie which is right up my alley Jeff Bridges stars ... when John ... is also when at Dakota Johnson the aforementioned Christ him was worth a Nick offer men has an interesting casting in it as well be cast casting the trailer for it\nLooks weird or does it looks weird which is right up my alley I as soon as they saw the first trail like I have to see this I don't know if it will be good or not often times to be fair these movies are you know don't live up to it but you know see it late night on some are channeled the news very probably year or two from now you have to be exactly\nA goose bumps to is it in theaters as well perfect time for Halloween and it's called haunted Halloween Jack Black is back in the RL Stein classic rated PG for all your kids out there and the big one hitting theaters this weekend that looks amazing and now get ready for the Oscar buzz talked to start\nAnd it's called first man is rated PG Thirteen Ryan Gosling plays astronaut Neil Armstrong the first man to walk on the moon and Ryan Gosling as one of the better actors\nIn the top five I Want to put him of of American actors out there when he takes the role there are few actors that go to the extent he does do play this character\nAnd this is probably going to be one of the most realistic telling Mr Armstrong's life\nAnd one of the closest jobs will ever see somebody playing him um y'all Buzz Aldrin is played by Michael collins a there's a bunch of other great actors in this movie\nI'm excited to see a I'm a I'm a sucker for anything involving the moon landing that ... you know a space in general I'm ... and just see these kinds of actors and he's kind of people involved in it\nI'm really curious to see I I I'm a little nervous because of that\nThe trailer it looks like it tries to tell the overall story of the space program leading up to the so I'm going to go they noticed there was a scene there were there's they recreate the fire and kill the astronaut or during a test\nYeah yeah yeah that was big at the time because that was a setback and it's something that I haven't seen addressed too much in movies but I'm I Know it has been you know it's interesting and fleas you guys if you see any of these movies let us know what you think\nWe haven't gotten one movie review you know that\nNow my buddy I Know not only won all five were looking for him so uh we're calling you guys that

talk about the birds and the bees and flowers and the trees the motive above and the thing called love or maybe not but they'll have good stories I don't think there's more popular person\nIn terms of

yeah there are people who just like real but there's something about it\nThey just flaring journal is dirty 'cause I don't\nKnow what they're it's it's something about him friends of mine ... never forget this my mom and I belong to the uh to 'em and historical preservation group\nAnd so with lots of little old ladies and on and they're very very Republican\nAnd I remember years ago when I was a kid they had met somehow they met Bill Clinton\nAnd both both these two little Biddy they said you know we're you know we we didn't vote for him we never would but you know what when when we met him we kind of got it like [laughter] like they had like they figured out settled on create\nThey said that they like really like when you meet him in person he's got this magnanimous kind of aura about him and they said that they they definitely were swooning up a bit\nAnd so the question him about the sexual assault stuff because our capital the be all that kind of a story this week\nIs that you know they're going out on this tour and bill really should be just kind of laying low right now and waiting for all this to blow over before he comes back out\nBecause I Know unfortunately this has

screened yeah had dug they're going to be having today Fred back in the third row bleeds right they ask you a little bit on or some news channel the other day and he got a little testy with them\nYeah well the he pushed on Monica Lewinsky recently that and so I I think that's where he said look you know either be ... to ... yeah because of the movement on she's now the Monica Lewinsky has labeled herself as an activist\nOn so she's kind of been a little more visible recently but [laughter] you know I look if they're going to go out and be on tour together I don't think it would be Hillary's and go to back away from those questions maybe bill doesn't want to answer them but I think Hillary would I really do\nWell it'd be interesting what you're going to say\nPower covered or whatever they

H. R. dot com it's time for another word county health department updated\nThen today we have Jean Rhodes grams or ... and all that money to you is the environmental\nHealth assistance and uh we are going to be talking about a serious off topic here is on childhood lead poisoning prevention\nSo with that morning getting your morning or tastes so uh [noise]\nUh I guess the topic that we keep talking about a third or is this something that we're always going to be talking about\nIt is um we're find a lot of old houses painted with lead paint so as long as we're seeing those old houses um\nIt's always going to be a topic there are other sources of lead um so yeah we're gonna continue to talk\nAbout it okay so you're wearing his what his childhood lead\nSo childhood lead poisoning is the ingestion or the inhalation or inhaling of um small amounts of lad I'm like I said it can be inhaled or ingested and are most\nVulnerable population are our children on because children are um they don't absorb and get rid of lead as well as humans are as excuse me as well as adults so that's why we're concerned about children um the other thing is\nLed dust I'm from like we said the paint tends to settle\nOn things in the home um children's toys floors so children have a lot of hand to mouth activity trying to put everything in their mouth so if there is led dust on\nUm you know a toy and they put it in their mouth or they're crying on the floor and there is led dust on the floor and then they you know put their hands in their mouth so it's really easily easy for um a child to get lead poisoned um you know there's some\nLead exposure at home so and the reason that we're most concerned you know the reasons we're concerned about lead is because it can have some um damaging effects of its elevated damaging effects on the nervous system I'm so it can affect the brain that can interfere with gross\nUm it can from hearing lower I. Q. scores have some learning problems behavioral problems so there are some pretty serious consequences with elevated lead or to others wonder some symptoms\nSo it's part of their release checkup thing\nSo if we do find I'm a child that has elevated lead level and they're renting it is up to the landlord to mitigate that led so\nRetarded renovation that ride granted\nWell not necessarily as freedom or any doubt yeah I mean sometimes it's as simple as you know painting putting another quarter pain time but it's not something attendance response building and the landlord yet\nAnd bell eighty to take care now if you work out an agreement with your landlord say say I'll do the painting you buy the paint and you knock fifty bucks off my rent is well you know that's a choice you are making\n'em we can't prevent that but the landlord should do this themselves I often say the landlords to you on the the legal responsibility of not doing this right\nAnd they often think about it and say okay well what how do I avoid that and I say you hire someone who certified and they do the work for you and then you're you're protected\nDo you have a list of people who can do that kind of work out\nYup I'm there there's a list of certified renovate hitters um anybody who has that also carry certificate with them but um\nYeah so I mean we're saying we're saying that renovation\nIs a term different than abatement worker or different than like if you want to do your own work in your house versus hiring Logan to come there to renovate for you that's a different thing right Logan is a is a is a business and you're doing your own work\nSo there are differences um renovation work is is a\nIs an activity that that disturbs paint a in a child occupation facility and those activities um can result in\nMe they're intentionally or accidentally that's the funny part right there either either you as the landlord know you're hiring Logan to get rid of those old led windows\nRight intentionally or unintentionally or to remove her repaint the doors or things like that and the funny part about renovation as if you're a guy doing renovation work\nOr you need to know that anytime you remove a window it automatically counts as a process that you need to be certified to do a lot of guys doing these handyman jobs don't know I Am just you're just doing a cheap window job\nNo you need to be certified and that requires you to spend some money to get certified and trained to get certified so\nLong winter a lot more investment and watch and I guess what makes lead paint such a hazard\nSo we talked about you know you were bulldozing Donald houses right after doing the opposite we're fixing 'em up or renovating them so lead paint as a hazard when it's cracking deteriorating breaking down you'll see the cracks and chips falling off\nUm and just because the chips fall fell off doesn't mean the lead has or doesn't exist so some places you'll see that all the paint fell off\nYou know put a drop of that um liquid from the check swab on that there would still turns bank\n'cause the lead paint absorbed into the surface of the prayer would and it's still a friction of both surface so that friction impacts surfaces as another risk\nThe the edges of the old doors the slider is on the old windows great you painted it and that you use it two or three times and you just shipped off all your paint on the sliding surface\nOkay so we talked about the people that can do these the fact that the people I Would do work renovating for fixing these problems out to be certified or the talk about the certification levels what's require yeah\nSo you know any if you're doing work or if you're going to hire someone to do work on your homes built ... prior Nineteen Seventy eight [noise] than than a certified individual needs to do that renovation and there's different levels and ... there's the certified led renovated her\nAnd then the abatement supervisor so renovation an abatement two different things renovation is on their modeling my house and um hiring you to do it abatement is you gotta order\nFrom the health departments because you're renting a home that a child was the lead poison that and so you're doing something called a beat Mitt which is removal since you're at you're not just kind of painted this time you're actually removing the tram and replacing the door with an entirely new door [noise]\nUm and then let abatement worker so he got workers they're trained at one level you gotta supervisors trained at another level and then they do on

here and to a to Z checkout cranberries and what's this wonderful fruit all about\nBut you know what we often say on this segment Morsi it's fun to be a tourist in your home town and and so\nIf folks want to have um ... we want to educate the kid we want to learn about our cranberry culture because some suggestions for folks and have some fun\nWell for sure for sure we do and it actually it starts in the elementary schools are fourth grade classrooms every year learn about Wisconsin and cranberries being the state fruit\nAnd locally here in what county to schools can focus on that so so nicely we actually have to um books one specific children's book at the store\nTime for cranberries it's a great way to educate kids and when when families know their fourth graders are learning about our local cranberry industry it's a great opportunity for the families to get out and say okay so you've spent some time in class with us let's go out and explore we have people that local people that come to the store\nThat have lived here for years and have never seen a cranberry marsh\nMaybe don't even know that the cranberry is their state fruit and because of a recent interest maybe they want to know where can we go to see that and it's really fun not just to talk with people from out of state out of country but the people that are local and the excitement that there is for our cranberry world\nAround us okay so there are a couple of things going on right no orders\nYes definitely and through the visitor's center and throughout the really well published um public hated of visitors guy

fill schools\nThere are ways to sign up for those tours they run I Believe through the end of October specific dates and that's a fantastic program you get on a bus you're educated by the FFA professional students there's actually I'm a chance to see every step of harvest\nSo they specifically tailor the tour so that you a visitor can see every step of the way which is not something that everybody gets a chance to see so that's a fabulous program and we've had visitors to ruby reds who went on the tour\nWe've got so excited about it they want it to do some more shopping and pits they'll send them to our store they're able to shop and take home with them some of the things that are connected to the tour they just had they went they raved about that high quality of the tour

fun way to educate yourself but there's other things you can do is\nYes definitely there's an for visitors local or if you have family that's coming to town and you you're not sure how to share the cranberry harvest with them\nCome see us at ruby red or visit to visitors center or if you're looking for a place to for them to stay you can um\nGo I'm through with little stone cottage glacier lake

had for bus tours come to ruby red this week while one from Meryl I'm too from the west bend Milwaukee area and one from the Green Bay Fox valley area\nAnd each of them were coming for a different purpose and and part of their stop was ruby red which again is great we meet lots of new friends we get to talk about cranberries they always have so many questions and if they've been on a tour\nThey're so impressed with the acres and acres and acres that they've seen along the roadside and on their tour of cranberry beds and cranberry marshes\nAre you just said something to you notice

love her out for all kinds of\nUh so tell me what your thoughts are and first of all those Dodgers team coming east and then in essence a matching up against the brewers team and the al ... they call them in the way they do things\nI tell you what man it's going to be a great battle or I think if you look at it on paper or you look at the Los Angeles Dodgers and the first thing that really pops out to me is that of that line of the all stars the caliber of talent that you can break off the bench\nAre obviously starting pitching could be a questionable thing you've got Clinton curse all who is definitely a guy\nWho has done his business over his career but then after that you've gotten your young pups you know you got your Walker viewers who are kind of an X factor uh you know what I'm telling you writers get a great start the other night which was awesome and he's done great the second half rich hill as well uh but I think if there is\nA certain um I guess you could say something to be worried about for the Dodgers\nIt could be that either that bridge to get to the back into the bullpen and cabbage asking because he looked good the other night and we all know about his struggles early in the air but\nOn paper it looks like the Dodgers are the better team but then again if you look at the swag the excitement level of the Milwaukee Brewers how can you not jump on board with that how can you not be excited each and every night when you watch the theme take the field so I think it's going to be a great match up I'm excited I'm super so\nThat the Milwaukee Brewers have made that leap made that step to get themselves back into the playoffs and would cry got that Christian yeah like low paying for on the stock is come on man these guys are excited to be there no doubt about it and they have the talent to meant\nNo I'm listening to a lot of national talk and it just seems to be that everybody is hung up on this starting pitching versus he quote out gutters\nAnd if you watch to see mostly as long as you just the way they do it I mean there's nothing different they're not it's not like all of a sudden they got to the postseason went oh we'll use our ... they've been throwing guys for two and three and four innings with eighty sixty Seventy pictures\nAnd then going to the bullpen and letting the pan handle it all season long why is this such a hard a philosophy for some people to just grasp\nBecause it's new and people are a little hesitant to change a baseball game that has been the same for almost a hundred years and with the with the new

up\nThis Monday Night to prior to the Packers and the forty niners getting underway that's all brought to buy our good friends over ... him so hope to see up there logical to kick off and then after the fact\nGoing to be over hinterland afterwards and doing the Greenville post gives us a lot of stuff coming up on Monday but until then pretty much all brewers all the time brewers into the N. L. D. or announced yes taking on the Dodgers\nAnd that gets underway coming up or shortly as though we're now down to ours and minutes rather than you know days and and people just eat look you can't wait ah right now we focus our spotlight on Ryan Braun and he talked about his excitement level\nA ten I Can't wait you know I think all of us feel the same way um I think we're all having so much fun right now it's such a special opportunity um I think we all just feel so thankful so blessed and full of gratitude that we're in this position it's really fun for me I think that putting asleep for a long time I know that doesn't come around every year [laughter] Hi I'm enjoying it so much fun with it\nThen you also talked about it means allied playing for you know that for the brewers but against the team that he grew up watching\nYeah I mean I Can't wait I think ah I you know grab a Dodger fan live in LA and the off season on such a special place for me to play 'em and as well for making this August for Christian yell at each or market out there there's a lot of LA connections on our team ah and the weather obviously we'll be beautiful which is nice so I'm really excited I Know everybody else as well\nEverybody gets about this did not expect a franchise hum this franchise to be back in the situation so quickly after they kind of decided to tear it down to rebuild\nIt yeah I mean I said that at the time that it would be more meaningful to me to eventually when here than to go anywhere else and and when multiple championships and I've met that I've obviously been here for so long I've been through so much here in the city as such a special connection to the city to the fans for the organization [noise]\nUm I I honestly didn't think we'd be back in his position as quickly as we are and I don't think anybody else that either um that's a tribute to everybody here that we've made it back here as quickly as we have and\nUm you know again for all of us were so excited about the opportunity and and I really just the right to everything that comes with it\nAnd in addition to that ever since the winning streaks started um it gets pretty much been as Kevin Kennedy said a little while ago and you just heard from Nick Swisher before this has been playoff baseball me down the stretch they've been talking about a lot of must win games and you're you're talking about more must win games now\nYeah absolutely I mean not only the first round for us the playoffs started that last day in Pittsburgh right I mean we've got an eleven game winning streak\nUm and we've approach every one of those days with the understanding that it was a must win a we approach the game and in Colorado the same way I think it was so important for us to come out put the pressure on them bring the fight to them scored early on but everybody here to adults do well especially all our relievers who have basically zero causing experience to see all of those guys continue to throw the ball so well\nI'm a lot of guys contributing all kinds of all ages really doing a lot of things well is uh it's it's been impressive and it's encouraging moving forward because one of the biggest challenge is that when you playing games I guess there's always control your emotions and unless you've been through games like we've now played for the last couple of weeks [noise] um there's nothing you can lean on to say I've\nBeen through that before and I know what to expect so ah you know again it's it's been impressive it's encouraging I think for all of us will lean on that experience as we play um you know some some highly energized contends baseball over the next couple of weeks\nNow let's be honest I mean and it's not us saying it but it to Beijing the national punish who've said that this just wasn't gonna last year was going to continue to happen and it goes on and on and on and you know the one thing that Ryan Braun stages we just loved continuously proving people wrong\nI liked it but the shore and you know we've been in that position all year I think\nEntering spring training nobody thought we had a chance and when the division and we did that and nobody thought we'd have a chance to do much damage in the postseason and we just swept in the first round\nThe Dodgers are obviously an incredibly talented team um you know they've been in this position I think this is there a third straight into the U.S and the fourth in the last five or six years so there's a reason their favorite but I uh I really like or I I think we all feel confident about the way we're on right now\nThey uh they should I mean they've been playing some some really terrific baseball and they got a street that continues to go on I had mentioned that to the Dodgers a streak of their own the last nine storage for Clinton Kirsch up for the Dodgers they have not watched the game they have one every one of those and Ryan Braun talks about how really great ... it is\nYou know to me is the greatest picture of our generation and on the short list the greatest pitchers of all time [noise]\nUm and it starts with the way the pizza night at night out whether he has his best effort I from the first pitch to the last you know that you're in for a battle with the faith and ah and then I did appear stuff was really good people make a big deal about his fastball velocity being down [noise] um but he's probably had better control and he was when he was younger and the philosophy on his slider has a decrease that also\nFor me here he is as good in a tough it's ever been and and it starts with his his level of competitiveness which is a it's\nA also last but not least T he also talked about the Dodgers in the starters in the mid starters against the blue ridge starters in such and is there a significant difference here\nYeah I mean all started with about really well I think\nOur hands fully recognize what's going to be difficult with their starter but we have a lot of confidence in in our interest as well and are starters don't get any love but if you look at what these guys with guns\nYou know released through an incredible game for us at Wrigley great game for a year ago [noise] um yeah the first round way Miley went to court feel\nAlive crushes season shut 'em down provide any so our started while even been getting the job that was well I'm a process that often we know we're not going to get a kind of opportunities against those guys so we've talked about the importance of tried to cash in the opportunity to get one\nMore and that is nothing much right now the guy to play next to him in the outfield nothing surprises Ryan von Braun about Christian yell at each\nOther to let these righty starters relievers velocity off to be there's nothing he doesn't hit you such a great pure hitter that it doesn't surprise me I think you know obviously child he left the other quality time\nAnd again all year he's he's just elevated game on to a level where there's very few players on the planet that are as good as you know is that just came\nTo doesn't surprise me to see with these had to get what we've seen it all year and and that's frankly we expected to continue

college tutor Lex two years\nWell ... maybe stuff for five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement five is kids college what you want or cash flowing in this case\nAnd a six is payoffs mortgages how are you know rentals in the house and so forth a but really um you know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to pay on your mortgage is\nYeah which is\nIn an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo it just takes a lot of our consumer that we should go save up a a a three maybe four month alerts eight five and then\nAnd then and then let them stop taking out student loans\nAnd clear them out and then do the same with the other two and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids it's there's money above that then we start throwing it at your\nEither your mortgage or your rentals one of the two that sound like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn a house is tiny and then around your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about about fifty sixty Seventy thousand a piece\nOkay or the ... the cars you said to Fifteen the yeah yeah and for what is the only ones only twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year when I was going to feel good and my son is do I take out a loan\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay Hannah there was one in there somewhere to make that math work All right Ah yes still I'm just going to plink along on those minimums and take care of college without that first\nOnce we got college without that then we find money we throw it at the at the probably go knock out a little twenty five one out and then among next knocked my house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\nAnd then how about ... back in the four oh one K. or not\nDo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now now okay yeah well no says you get your emergency fund right\nYou know emergency fund is maybe step three and then maybe step forest Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack maybe steps four five six in order\nTo actually three four five six cars you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then if there's money left we keep going down the list in the next thing on the list is mortgages ... is that there's so there's still a prioritization even though it simultaneously that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead but for ... for
