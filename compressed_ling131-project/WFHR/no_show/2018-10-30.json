and ah probably when the stadium opened at Seventy three was the bills quarterback\nAnd I tell you a little bit of a tit bit because my senior year at Stanford you know it's the off season I'm running

they had Alex Smith they send out like with the Washington\nHe had a plan so many people with a good quarterback like he had an alec Smith are ... afraid to plan for the future and and then to pull the trigger to move forward to say okay we're going to go with the young quarterback\nAnd we're going to give them a year to kinda get season and we're going with it you know now you you drive to the top ten and given the cap on draft day\nAnd that's the highlight of the season because after that he comes into training camp and you say well you you don't have to play you're going to be the third string quarterback and then we two or three you're in the starting line of ... and you know anything you don't even know half your officer playbook so\nThe way that they got Patrick homes ready and

Patrick no question about and we've seen that time and time again these are you going to Fifteen here in the NFL or as a seventh round pick out a Harvard okay no one ever thought that's the case and the reason why it last as long because he's a great backup you needed to start here and there you can get the job done\nAnd he's the guy that again people seem to want to run through a wall he seems to be a really good teammate\nBut he's ... by by the way that that beard to come on\nIt's like he's chin strapping his beard it's like he's putting a dome over a forest doesn't quite work just looks ridiculous like he's on one side or watching Arab went on a game and he's got this ridiculous looking ...\nAren't the wives of girlfriends like cliche that you look terrible you don't make a

jump forty feet in the air and my take on an army of a thousand with your hands tied behind your back then you don't deserve to have a beer like that it looks ridiculous\nI mean come on my wife is Patrick just he looked ridiculous\nYou know dirt cutters tried to keep his job and he wants to win games and I get that I totally understand that\nAnd you know Jason what's his name light or you know the the gym of that team he's trying to keep his job too\nBut if you're on the Tampa Bay buccaneers don't you have to play\nSeamus twins spend the rest of the way to see what he is before you decide am I going to really pay this guy twenty some odd million dollars next year after we picked up his option it's only guaranteed for injury by the way\nOh you got to pay twenty some odd million dollars next year but tend to give a hundred and fifty million dollars long term or is it time to start thinking the James went through the experiment is over when he's a bust of a first oval Beck and it's time to start thinking about the next franchise quarterback for the Tampa Bay buccaneers how are you going to find out if James wins in the manner not if he's not\nPlaying it might not look at what does that factor going to do is going to maybe have another good game or to blow up that's what we have a reason why I write for Saturday's Denver played in the postseason\nDo the Buffalo Bills member of the jets week Seventeen all they needed to win against buffalo he's thirty one touched down that year and what happens\nAfter interceptions in that game play terribly they don't make it\nBut I think the answer is best maybe they already know Seamus twins who is not the answer maybe they read you know in Tampa Bay the James ... is not a guy that you want to invest long term a because we all feel issues and be because it's just not that good see here's the problem there and I'm just going to say what y'all think okay\nWhat's your all thinking is this and you're absolutely right Seamus Winston is trouble and to a point he's a criminal okay but if Jay miss Winston was Aaron Rodgers\nEven a mat Stafford or I can Newton type player\nOn the field regardless of what his discussions have been off the field you\nChoke it up and you say I'll still sign up right like Ben Roethlisberger is no sane and been robbed a stronger maybe a criminals well heck you might be a rapist but Ben Roethlisberger is a elite quarterback who's one Super Bowls in his on his way to the hall of fame\nSo sadly the talent to that wins out when you decide do I keep a guy or do I not keep a guy right me better authors burger is not a good dude buddies I give a quarterback and that's why he stayed with the Pittsburgh Steelers this law if Ben Roethlisberger wasn't a good quarterback trust me they would have gotten rid of a\nGene is Winston is he good enough to put up with this is the good enough to not only pay a hundred and fifty million dollar deal but it's good enough to put up with the fact that his laundry list of indiscretions is walk just starving\nGrabbing the crush of a newer driver I mean there's a lot of problems here right and if he's Aaron Rodgers you say yeah I don't like the guy but I'll put up with it because he's a great quarterback if he wins games but he doesn't win games he's not a great quarterback\nSo does Brian Fitzpatrick get the story you know I mean he's going to get to start here many he's not getting treated by\nTuesday trade deadline tomorrow is Seamus twins on the block and I know you know that's been brought up the Seamus twins it on the block here's the problem with that who's training for James Winston\nWind their right mind would you trade regimes Winston one he just got bench because he threw for at least on can interceptions since coming back from\nHis suspension from week number four ten now in by the way it looked like half of the game with them or for ill now he's thrown ten packs\nHe also of course has all that baggage it's the beach to era you also inherit that fifth year option there is no money in this league I Believe dumb enough to trade for James Winston right now\nYou can dangle him out there for a fourth round pick who's dumb enough to pick up Seamus twins you're not good\nSo maybe what Tampa Bay telling us at this point is hey\nWe know he's not and that's why we're going as Patrick rather than deciding and given eight weeks for us to figure out of James Winston is truly worth the investment next year on the fifth year option a and B\nIt's worth the investment of a long term contract rights because they were so sure that he was he playing next week against Carolina and not be sitting on the bench behind Ryan says Patrick the ultimate journeyman\nJohnny Sean I mean are they telling us\nWhat we are kind of thinking\nOr are these just the actions of a desperate GM in a desperate coach trying to keep their jobs by winning games and saying ripe is Patrick's their best option at this point\nI think you're right I think they're trying to keep their jobs\nBut I Do believe they've seen enough from Seamus Winston to know what they're gonna do after the season\nSupplying Jim is when ... and the rest of the way\nDoesn't really benefit those guys ... corner and and uh she didn't want them\nBut we don't we know if it's Patrick is\nHe'll be good for game or two games for for three and then he'll go back to being ... since you're not just you know ... years\nWho throw picks but he thinks chances but he just doesn't have the arm strength to get the ball where he wants to be and that's where he throws picks all the time how surprised or you because I Am a student\nThe fact that James winter has not worked out for me too I thought James Winston was going to be a star and this guy thought here you know coming out of Florida State and we remember those Judy while his record sophomore year he wasn't great\nHe was just red shirt freshman year he was fantastic he had that opening game against pit where he went like twenty four twenty seven three hundred yards were watching the ... were just our mouths roping going my goodness I see why he was the number ... top quarterback of the nation\nHe should have been an absolute superstar in the NFL by now and he's not he's not even remotely close\nIt may be hard to believe but people just like you are already sending money to feed the big dot org

eventful time\nIn London [noise]\nMore so before the game the actual game may lose yet again and it's just going from bad to worse better team that was supposed to be potentially the best you know\nThere wasn't crazy to think that the Jacksonville Jaguars are the best team in the AFC\nGoing into this year and let me start off through it all they look great right\nThe last four straight to three and five the gets scored they've scored a hundred and thirty four points made games off for that is probably done for you know what\nAll that talk about for that it'd be back you'll be back betrayed recall those hot at this point he's got a thing where for net he's not coming back this year reviews is going to be late and you know what you have to start wondering if you ever get to stay healthy two years in missed what four games six games last year whatever it was that he was four games last year\nHe's winning a ball you risk your bowl or the games this year not sure he can say all the soldiers last year at LSU now how much was injury how much was it self preservation leading up to the draft\nSo they lose the Philadelphia in a close game it was close it was entertaining if you want to get up at nine thirty eastern time if you're on the west coast six thirty AM to watch that game it was twenty forty teen\nBut for players on the Jacksonville Jaguars\nGet arrested at four

soon and cornerback DJ hating were all arrested by the metropolitan police\nBecause they tried to skip out on a bar tab\nOf sixty four thousand dollars church was the only one of the players who was

British right oh Piccadilly sick is\nSo they were arrested for suspicion of fraud by false representation what they lied about being Jacksonville Jaguars be misunderstanding was they went to this club\nThey were given bottles service and you know you go to a club the rich the fancy club just like the hot club by the way in London\nAnd bottled store like five hundred Ninety five bucks or something like that and they're just getting bottle after bottom think myself for guys right I think there were nine to begin with a K nine and some are smart enough to get out of there before the bill came I mean yes right\nSo even nine guys sixty four thousand dollar barked at how many bottles you get a thousand dollars probably did thousand dollar bottles as well but even so nine guys each have a bottle said she had a two thousand dollar dollar bottle of champagne it's Eighteen thousand bucks\nWhat are you getting to make it a sixty four thousand dollar tab like how much caviar and drinks can you possibly consume oh night before you know two nights before the I guess two nights before a game show they get up to leave and they're like\nWait a minute you know they were told hey you didn't pay the tab and they're like well we thought it was all Compton then they get into the bouncers and then the cops called they thought because the drinks for coming out I guess they're flowing that they were on the house\nHere's the problem with being a a ... I guess a high priced athlete\nWhile you may think everybody thinks you're awesome and wants to give you free drinks\nAlthough I don't think there's a stolen England who knows any one of these four guys because most Americans have no idea who DJ hey Ronnie Harrison buried shirt and this other dude are like honestly like they're not exactly a household names\nYou know church and maybe Harris you know the biggest themes Harrison because he played at Alabama that people thought he was our buddy Rodney Harrison kid which is not\nAlready were joking it'd be like hey you're someplace banks you did it's hilarious out\nSo here's the issue though\nDo you really think so I ... that just big yeah hey sixty four thousand dollars on us fifty thousand euros on us\nHey great thanks for showing up you really help the or the image look hard because Barry freaking church we're thinking here like ... to advertise a full blood the Jacksonville Jaguars drank you last night to bury church you know that guy no profiles you mean like\nI don't know like you really think that a copy of sixty four thousand dollars I don't care how rich you have a club you are here in New York yeah a lot of risky clubs right even ...

he was gearing up to take that ball out right away now here's the thing is he doing it because he tried to be in subordinate or is he doing it because he's trying to be the hero it's a big difference there\nBecause here either way it's wrong and either way you are apparently going against what the coaches want\nBut if you're doing is trying to be a hero while it's wrong it's understandable if you're doing it to be in support it because you're upset that you were taken out of the previous series and you get into the coached on the sideline\nThat's a fine of all and it's to spend the whole offense that's as bad as it gets there is a fine line there Sean between the two\nAnd it's a fact these whispers get louder and louder and louder into rumblings and it turns out that time a government

that has yet to it on the road by the way the Packers old three on the road\nA little upset or ... little testify if that's the case that's unforgivable if that's the case you go from having a ball\nWith a minute fifty some odd seconds or so to go plenty of time for the best quarterback in the NFL or at least the second or third best quarterback in the NFL barrage at the top but if you want for Brady fine I'm not going to fight you on that the way he was able to find\nGuys but he's finding guys I mean look who's making catches I\nYeah I have a problem though with players complaining to Mike Silver\nYesterday a media like gr writer about tied Montgomery and speculate as to why he took the ball out of the end zone like stop keep it in house and I hate gossip\nThe clock oddly behind it yeah pretty name behind it yeah that that bothers me you know what if you have a problem with it talk to a time of gum or a you have a problem with it keep it in the locker room go at the guy don't be bringing it out into the media so it becomes big news out there now but on the other side's missile but Sean\nIf players that upset they want to embarrass time a gum rewrite so why not right so why not bring it out publicly like that right\nThat's what they're doing no bringing out publicly but put your face behind it put your name behind it\nBut are they just speculating or is there something where they actually say like ... or ... how do you know they're not in time Montgomery is head well buddy ... you know here's the thing that time a government say anything that he would already be interim according\nTo this player on the sideline because where I get out of the game and they speculated this player on the Green Bay Packers that the reason he took defied the coaches was caught because he was angry\nI got a hard time believing that I Do I mean he's a professional\nThat that's\nIf it comes to like maybe you can't prove you're right you got against time of companies had only time in Montgomery understands why he decided to do that and you can always stick with the story of I thought I was right there at the goal line I don't want to take an e because I was worried you know I'd be at the half your whatever it is I thought I had to run it out at that point\nIf you just expect store you will never know you never going to miss their coaches it Mike mccarthy cough into the office and says hey type ... thinking ties I could be like hey I was really mad at you guys for taking my call has serious I screw you coach I'm running this one out\nOil say listen coach you know what I kept up I thought I was going to be here I tried to play the hero or to get a scrape your position I really thought I saw a whole here and this is the problem with that\nIf you're talking about government is saying that and saying what you just said I Want to be the euro you've Aaron Rodgers ripe as your quarterback submitted fifty to go ... so that's a stupid thing [laughter] you know no need to give the ball to iron Rogers yeah\nBut him deal with that he's writing and guys like more cash sales gambling we we talk about\nThe numbers game that's the numbers game there I wouldn't be analytical and everything now it supports the numbers suggest that you have a better chance of winning the football game or taken in the and letting Aaron Rodgers do his thing down two points right now in time on camera taken the ball on the end zone and returning it\nFor a [laughter]\n... unbelievable it's unbelievable I couldn't believe when I'm watching that going what is the doing and what is he doing and then the phone bullets oh\nHe must feel really bad but he has to he was a fire is required to and then what happens I guess guys come up to the locker room and worry about it I don't know that everyone was angry at how how well they should be some bad football players one up one pack or coach\nAaron was hot and he had just talking to Mike Silver and he had a right to be a take a blank me he was very very bad I mean will come on blank you mean take a ... [laughter] I mean come on that\nBut that's just a suit off following them like silver why Mike Silver like well he's got this job I understand like why are so like water is a coach why if you're a coach\nWhen I talked to a medium that by I don't know like Mike Mike mccarthy like don't you call them all it'd be like who's my lead like what are you going on there like can you can hear I got to school [laughter]\nLike one of my name is Mike Silver pay and I'm like well you get out of this year the Packers coach like what do you get out of being like this anonymous source right\nBut what did it for you shaming Montgomery that's what they're doing okay you're shaming time on guard but no one knows who it is dry like which assistant coach who's just go do you like to\nMe I mean if you're talking about governor now you're like really so he he he reads is yeah say wow so play that is how it is we are talking talking and I really I I play running back\nFor you guys when everyone's injured and we're running back and I was a wide receiver and and and no problem and this is the you know and this is how you treat me I'm worried over eighty eight to ... running back [laughter] I've been with this team for how many years he's been there for a while now I'm ... years right just ... I don't I don't like it\nYou don't want I don't like it at all guy made a mistake I don't know what I can give me more and I honestly don't know what I Believe\nDuring the break right trying to help but see he lets the rose what it was well\nHe thought he could rotted out and he probably thought no one expected he wouldn't do it because everybody's taking these down the and the only thought hey maybe I'll catch the rams sleeping here and I'll run as he did say that he always listen to the coaches and it wasn't trying to do that here's the thing like it's not like he's some rocky like being a hothead right time of governments but in this league long enough I'm sure he's had an issue with coaches before\nIt's like five years in four years any that are going to be in subordinate and do this I don't think so the big game like this well he wants to make the playoffs while he was throwing a coat tantrum according to the source so he's been go back and junior okay fine you know it doesn't mean full that's not cool but just because he thought you're going to cost you team again\nBut you said that he's Iraqis level headed you know he's not gonna make a rash decision but ... but he was taken out of the football game and attention okay and let's not call it's not but we sometimes you just said his his emotions were getting the better of him at that point\nBut does your emotions during the ... the better of you know and decide to not you know to lift your coaches that's a that's a stretch\nThat is a ... he did it on purpose right just to defy the right ...\nThat's a stretch I Do think that that's OK with them right\nI understand you can draw the lines to it but I think it's a stretch in regards to what you're saying that his time and what what what are these anonymous sources are saying is that time of garbage doesn't care about winning and he would just do that just to kind of get even\nI have a hard time believing that a guy who's been a competitive football player to try and find all you know no I don't really know but you know let me take the need to take the need to get the ball erasures right yeah there's no chance of fall if you've taken the in the end zone\nYou know what the weather anonymous sources told a chef de that uh you know ... bells going to come back to buy week right well guess what did he come back no I don't buy all these I always have a tough time he's anonymous sources that making up\nNo but who are these guys is like the the assistant quality control guy like pulls videotape during the week or standing on the sidelines begins hearing so\nThese guys get used to\nThe media guys yeah absolutely the toll false things in a just a it's out there in the media and maybe that's what this maybe they'll leave your belt camp said hey shifty he's going to come back and for the ... you know\nHe ran went into like ha ha ha ha I got on end up we got 'em but you have to beg id something good next time you know you got to be the motivation behind that I I don't like I don't know maybe on both can't be the motivation behind that\nMakes no sense [laughter] because it doesn't matter like why would they say is coming back and then he doesn't right\nAbout that in the Steelers cap\nMake them look bad back could be there you go so chef de should know better\nOr shut the doing the math in your well it makes sense for him to\nCome back well this is the same guy who didn't he or the medical records of GPS laser them yeah yeah ... that's right ... yeah I don't care he did not get enough blame for that all the ...

Tampa Bay buccaneers announcing already very white spry and fitzpatrick Guthrie yet in the store for ... against the Carolina Panthers [laughter] here's what I don't understand is why\nYou know Ryan Fitzpatrick is so it's not kid ourselves arrived fast he may look good here in there and you know what\nGuys are run through ... Patrick no question about uh we've seen that time and time again these are us Fifteen here in the NFL or as a seventh round pick out a Harvard okay no one ever thought that's the case and the reason why it last as long because he's a great backup ... start here and there you can get the job done\nAnd he's the guy that again people seem to want to run through a wall he seems to be a really good teammate\nBut he's ... by by the way that that beard to come on\nIt's like he's chin strapping his beard it's like he's putting a dome over a forest doesn't quite work just looks ridiculous like she's on one side I watched the ... the game and he's got this ridiculous looking ...\nOtherwise the girlfriends like cliches that you'll terrible you don't make a fool\nLike there's nothing remotely attractive about having a beer belly shirt Confucius magical powers it makes no sense to have a beer like that like the Chinese shall when like temple guy can I jump forty feet in the air and my take on an army of a thousand with your hands tied behind your back then you don't deserve to have a beer like that it looks ridiculous\nI mean come on my wife is Patrick just like he looked ridiculous\nYou know dirt cutters tried to keep his job and he wants to win games and I get that I totally understand that\nAnd you know Jason what's his name light or you know the the gym of that team he's trying to keep his job too\nBut if you're on the Tampa Bay buccaneers do you have to play Seamus twins spend the rest of the way to see what he is before you decide am I going to really pay this guy twenty some odd million dollars next year after we picked up his option it's all a guaranteed for injury by the way\nOh you got to pay twenty some odd million dollars next year and potentially give a hundred and fifty million dollars long term or is it time to start thinking the same as when to experiment is or when he's a bust of a first oval Beck and it's time to start thinking about the next franchise quarterback for the Tampa Bay buccaneers how are you going to find out if James wins in the manner not\nIf he's not playing by now look at what does that factor gonna always going to maybe have another good game or two and then he's gonna blow up that's what rivalries the wind rises Africa's never played in the postseason\nAnd when he's not opportunities you who's do the Buffalo Bills remember the jets week Seventeen all they needed to win against buffalo he's thirty one touched down that year and what happens\nAfter the interception game play terribly they don't make it\nBut I think the answer is best maybe they already know James Winston is not the answer may be getting ready no in Tampa Bay that James ... is not a guy that you want to invest long term a because we all feel issues there'd be because he's just not that good here's the problem there and I'm just going to say what y'all think okay\nWhat's your all thinking is this and you're absolutely right Jean miss Winston is trouble and to a point he's a criminal\nOkay what if Jamieson wing spin was Aaron Rodgers or even a mat Stafford aura Kim Newton type player\nOn the field regardless of what his discussions have been off the field you choke it up and you say I'll still\nSigned them right like Ben Roethlisberger is no sane bet robs drug or maybe a criminals well heck you might be a rapist Ben Roethlisberger is a elite quarterback he's won Super Bowls and his on his way the whole thing\nSo sadly the talent to that wins out when you decide do I keep a guy or do I not keep a guy right we've been robbers burgers not a good dude buddies I give a quarterback and that's why he stayed with the Pittsburgh Steelers just walk it better authors burger wasn't a good quarterback trust me they would have gotten rid of a\nGene is Winston is he good enough to put up with this is the good enough to not only\nMillion dollar deal but it's a good enough to put up with the fact that his laundry list of indiscretions is walk\nJust starving grabbing the crush of a newer driver I mean there's a lot of problems here right and if he's Aaron Rodgers you say yeah I don't like the guy but I'll put up with it because he's a great quarterback and he wins games but he doesn't win games he's not a great quarterback\nSo does Brian Fitzpatrick get the story you know I mean he's going to get to start here many getting frayed it by Tuesday trade deadline tomorrow is Seamus Winston on the block\nAnd I know you know that's been brought up the Seamus twins sit on the block here's the problem with that who's training for James Winston\nWind their right mind would you trade for Seamus Winston one he just got ... because he threw for at least on ten interceptions since coming back from his suspension from week number four ten now and by the way we played half of the game with them before so now he's thrown ten packs\nHe also of course has all that baggage it's the beach to era you also inherit that fifth year option there is no money in this league I Believe dumb enough to trade for James Winston right now you can dangle him out there for a fourth round pick who's dumb enough to pick up Seamus twins you're not good\nSo maybe what Tampa Bay telling us that this point it\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nTerm contract cry because if they were so sure that he was he playing next week against Carolina and not be sitting on the bench behind Ryan Fitzpatrick the ultimate journeyman sometimes Sean I mean are they telling us\nWhat we are kind of thinking or are these just the actions of a desperate GM in a desperate coach trying to keep their jobs by winning games and saying rivals Patrick's their best option at this point\nI think you're right I think they're trying to keep their jobs\nBut I Do believe they've seen enough of Seamus twins to to know what they're going to do after the season\nSupplying James wins and the rest of the way\nDoesn't really benefit those guys ... corner and and not just one yeah\nBut we know we know if it's Patrick is\nHe'll be good for a game or two games for for three and then he'll go back to being ... since the eighties the tea is what he is\nPro picks but he thinks chances but he just doesn't have the arm strength to get the ball where he wants to be and that's why those facts all the time\nHow surprised or you 'cause I Am a student\nThe fact that James Winston has not worked out for me too I thought James Winston was going to be a store and just like I thought you know coming out of Florida State and we remember though is Judy while his record sophomore year he wasn't great\nHe was just red shirt freshman year used paint past you had that opening game against pit where you went like twenty four twenty seven three

good will be good news for retail stores it'll be good news for people buying online now\nHowever there is some new research\nThat has been released this week from the national Center for the middle market\nWhich provides a a retail industry forecasting Thomas stewardess here who is the executive director of National Center for middle market I guess I Want to first find out from Utah Thomas what the National Center for the middle market is it's an intriguing name\nWell we're we are a research organization Research Center at the Fisher College of business at the Ohio State university\nAh we exist to study companies that are mid sized ... uh the middle of a third of the private sector which is companies tales between ten million a billion dollars a year big and small smaller than big\nAt that actually are uh as I said it's about a third of the economy but it's the lion's share of economic growth the biggest growth is in these companies and we're the only guys out there putting ... serious resources into studying who they are or how they're doing and what they can do to do even better\nSo let's answer those questions who are they and how are they doing I guess the why they may not be described to do with the dollar amounts but are they doing\nWhether that you know and what they are there at all sectors retail medical care a financial services I mean any industry you can think of\nAnd they're doing really well I mean you know revenue growth in the in the last twelve months in the middle market has been more than eight percent and and job growth has been more than\nMore than six percent I we estimate that more than that about sixty percent of all new jobs come come from mid sized companies so they're doing really well [noise] uh they're looking forward to

which is the whole cybersecurity question so\nUh you know there are also increasingly concerned about cyber security defending their customers their business their data or against a mounting mouthing cyber threats\nAll right so what's the news this year to protect people that wasn't around last year during the holiday season\n[noise] well what's new is the concern I mean I mean the thing is that that the the attacks constantly mutate it's like the flu virus at yeah that is that they're the bad guys out there always coming up with new ways to sort of try to get into your network new ways to try to hold the at ransom for five\nThousand let me ask the question in a different way than if I mean this district and the problem is that big retailers have had I\nThink you can name any of them

spotlight on trombone playing ... go ahead do some break you know why Trump trombone us should get some more respect\nYou know I I think the trombone really deserves the most respect because we don't have any ... we don't have any partners so we have to do everything all on our own with the slide and you know and think about it I mean if you're a musician trombone as\nA lot of money but we can't play in a tiny room so that would that would that fly you know hitting a wall so Trump or made all the law so we can afford an apartment big enough to\nPractice really what what uh what else what else

a Sally so I wanted to give you the chance to say thank the folks that make it possible to get this affordable for folks here in our area\nAbsolutely need Witter foundation is the sole sponsor of this shell\nOkay and they're going to be doing that community outreach with the students how do you how do you choose to students are or do the music departments at the schools or\nWhat I Do is contact um the music and drama instructors at area high schools um we go as far as an interest in Adams friendship in the area and out from there so there are any schools out there\nWhom we haven't contacted please call the arts constantly if you're interested in getting involved in these outrageous\nUm right now I'm getting a pair of tickets for the concert on friday November sixteenth seven thirty pm if you're into brass music I'm just going to give them away to the first caller someone five four to four twenty six hundred\nAnd the first caller that calls just the tickets simple as that\nBut let me see here I'm going to go since they were the first ones on the line\nYour caller won congratulations you're going to pursue the old brass who is this do for cupcake fad Donald you are you are going to enjoy the show on and uh you know how to get the tickets right if it was like an interesting program will be you can pick them up here at the\nAt the radio station and I enjoyed you and your day to enjoy the show you're sure well thank you You're welcome not\nA one thing we wanted to talk about is the performing arts center at the first concert of the year\nYou present it to Eric\nRather symbolic big check wanted to talk a little bit about that and then I Want you to talk about the importance of that\nThis was the second year that we brought kids from Wisconsin here um that the arts ... comfortable sponsored it with the intention of taking the proceeds from the show and donating I'm back to the performing arts center to be used in whatever way they need it most maintenance whatever\nAnd we beat last year's total by I think about five hundred dollars so we were extremely pleased and we're hoping to continue to do this every summer\nEric how do you put that money to use\nSo you know as the facility director there are a variety of things that I look at one is you know I'm a maintenance that definitely needs to be done and and we're kind of facing some challenges right now with um gear that is aging and maybe we'll beyond\n... you know a a lifespan of of you know some of these pieces of electronic equipment but you know aside from those general maintenance things that come up and I also look at ways in which you know what can we buy 'em as a facility that's going to benefit you know the larger kind of clientele that we serve\nSo in the case of like the arts council kids from a ... and you know local bands companies um [noise] you know you name it whoever comes into our facility what sort of things that we don't have can we buy you know to benefit the greater good\nSo last year with a you know about eleven hundred dollars we bought platform riser skirts um because um for for years we've just been using literally cut up black bed sheets that we would tape onto the front of the you know the platform rises\nAnd the platform rises like a drum rise or or you know in San will rise or a horn riser et cetera\nAnd it was time that we dress up you know the appearance of the stage a little bit and legitimately get some you know nice hemmed um you know for real um\n[noise] you know stay skirts that easily clip on the front of the stage that we're not wasting consumable expensive tape and then having you know labor tied up in in taping these things on the front of the riser\nSo furthermore you know with a with the amount that we got from the earth's council this year I haven't quite decided\nUh we do you know there are some things that have come up we didn't have a spotlight just go down and so it's likely that you know some of these dollars are going to be used either repair or to be used to buy new um so you know it's really just a matter of you know addressing what\nWhat needs are most important to the facility in what's going to keep us taking you know here forward\nAnd in the case of the spotlight you know many many groups use the spotlights there's no question about it and so we need to make sure that those are functioning and so you know this partnership that you know kind of been created between your counsel the kids from scouts and and you know the performing arts center\nYou know it's really valuable because you know the support of our patrons out there who are buying tickets to come and see these shows um you know that support is really important to continue to do the things that you know we want to do here\nAnd further you know our kids\nOur students are the ones who are working the tech and so they're they're doing audio they're doing lights\nAnd maybe these kids may or may not you know get into this line of work and Mr Bledsoe made a mention of it in his interview a earlier a few more tuned in but\nYou know it's really important that you know these kids are involved in something that they're getting a look at you know something they may have never even thought of as a career\nAnd truth be told some of the kids who graduate from you know our program do go into you know technology or you know into the arts of some sort whether it's playing music you know whether it's you know working behind the scenes\nAnd and this is true that you know the technology is going to continue to evolve and we need to have kids who are you know willing and ready to accept you know the challenges they get out there into the workforce\nSo your sponsorship of the arts council and coming to see shows it's vitally important to the arts and with our community and also too you know ushering in the next you know that\nYou know our children into the you know into the workforce\nAnd know how can folks took it then it's not too late to get season tickets for the remainder of the great concert seasons\nCorrect you could still get a side show a season ticket I'm at a ten percent savings that feel like\nThe tickets for ... thirty dollars a piece and you can get them through the arts council's website\nSavor the arts dot org or give us a call Monday through Thursday tend to to the thirty or seven to one side four to four to seven eight seven or visit us at ten forty eighth street south in Wisconsin Rapids\nI think this is going to be a very fun and interesting show and as you heard was a

friday\nFrom your letters that are wrong with that Jennifer sheets and\nWe can say is ... friday right now for the most part mostly cloudy and forty seven and a Thirteen twenty welcome back to the morning magazine and part tumor visiting with Kerry held a branch from come for an air\nAnd as we always say there were the folks we want you to call and get some help but first of all tell them about your location Kerry and how they can reach you\nOkay we are at eight eighty highway Seventy three south Wisconsin Rapids you can call us\nIn the Wisconsin Rapids Nick who support outwards areas at seven one five three to five three nine six nine and for our Steven's point employ over three four two zero nine one one or visitors visit us on line comfort air dot biz\nNow folks are there might be some folks who are we need to get rid of ... dinosaurs way past due that burning up money and that well first off when should people start seriously thinking about replacing her unit\nWhile the average life expectancy expectancy of a furnace is about Twenty years and uh you can even mean industry ad average might be a little bit less than that so you could suggest maybe Eighteen years\nAh but ah probably the average life span of a furnace might be slightly less because when you're at that Fifteen to Eighteen year mark you and you have a major repair require it sometimes doesn't make sense to put five or six hundred dollars into a\nPiece of equipment that's Fifteen Years old it's kind of like\nThe refrigerators these days it's not quite as bad as you know the refrigerator appliances and that those types of things are becoming more and more disposable where you're from us is not necessarily\nBut to the parts in pieces in these furnaces are becoming more expensive and once you get to a certain age and you do have to put in a significant amount of money\nIt might make sense to put that towards the new furnace that is going to be more efficient both from my gas consumption and electricity consumption standpoint and two it's also going to be quieter and more comfortable um most most likely I mean so depending on what your current furnace is\nUm we'll make some of that determination but definitely if you're\nHaving a twenty year old furniture or have a twenty year old furnace I should say\nUm you know it's something that at least you should be aware of and maybe starting to save for it and so maybe it's not this year um but you know that you're furnaces twenty plus years old and it's something that you really should be considering the next five years\nAnd you start putting away for it so that it's not a surprise and um you know it comes up and all of a sudden now you have that money to to replace it instead of it being a a bird and although there is you know financing and in those sorts of things to\nAh to make it as easy as possible because\nA lot of times especially this time of year people aren't necessarily planning to spend you know twenty five to thirty five to forty five hundred dollars on a new furniture system or depending on what they choose and it's not you know you just don't have that laying around\nNow now so ... so you make the decision is one thing people are real lives is that the new year and a lot smaller and then have you got all of them are different as as a pretty big you and they're going to be amazed at\nA lot of comments as to that little thing is going to have my house\nAnd it actually has the same or a very similar to use to what the old furnaces I'm In some cases the older furnaces might be\nLarger much larger than what's required for your home a but really the physical size and the furnace doesn't or does it change a whole lot with the Wii U capacity so\nFor the most part they are going to be very similar in size but basically thirty five inches tall with any new furnace that's that's out there so whether you have the forty inch tall furnished right now the forty six inch to offer us right now so there's another one if you're furnaces forty six inches taller taller\nIt's a good bet that it's over twenty and twenty five years old so uh that that could be a little a check to but even the forty inch tall furnaces are there's a lot of ah twenty plus years\nTall furnaces but if you're over forty inches tall with your furnace it's most likely are older than twenty five years\nSo you make the decision and you're going by I don't know what to do or what type to get ... that's where you folks come and we would\nCome into your home and give you a multitude of different choices I mean talk about uh you know what your wants and needs are for your home or in put together a furnace system that meets your budget meets what your desires are\nUm and then also you know like I said we have the financing available to is very simple I mean\nIt's an online application right from our website\nAs so we try to make it as as simple as possible um even if you're you before you talked to us you can go on there and you can fill out the application and and you know\nMake sure that you're ready to go um and so there's some different choices as to the terms as to what you want to do uh on the financing type things or like I said if you've been saving for the last to\nA year or two or or more um and you're ready to go you just a matter of fit in your budget to what you want to want to spend on it\nUm that leads into to how you use heat your home to a people might say well the kids are gone and we don't need the heat these rooms but do you\nGot to be a little careful not that you can't close up some registers off to a certain degree in some ... you know outer rooms and so forth but\nEar furnaces size for or should be at least size for your entire home and so if you start restricting the Airflow buy clothes you know a bunch of the registers\nAnd it's almost as bad as letting the filter get dirty and it goes by adding that restriction whether it's at the filter being dirty and restricting the Airflow there or if your closing too many of the air vents and restricting their floor there\nUh the furnace wants to see a certain amount of air going across the heat exchange or and or by reducing that Airflow you're you're upping the temperatures that it's designed for and making the furnace work harder so you're going to have some failures at some point down the road or because of that\nThinking or saving money and they're really not\nYou're you're potentially not I mean a again if if you have a a room that's you know and you're shutting off one room you know it's probably not a real big deal but if you're saying hey I've got these three bedrooms that we don't use overhear what shut all of 'em\nWell that might not be the greatest idea if you're starting to reduce the overall Airflow flowing through your duck work and through your furnace and you actually create more problems are in and out the mentally\nYou know your installation as an outside wall and so yes you're you're eating a little bit more square footage [noise] ah the better play would be as to\nUh buy a couple of more sweat shirts and keep the temperature two or three degrees cooler\nThere you go okay now of course like me I like it that certain more ... I I I say I'm not going to be coal in my home right yeah and it's\nIt's too you know each one's uh [noise]\nUh what they what they want to have and you know a lot of people do is they'll put in a gas fireplace in a particular room that they're going to be in for a good majority of the time\nFor America in the morning is am Thirteen twenty W F a jar Wisconsin Rapids weekday mornings at five AM [noise]\nCBS News all the hours presented by capital one bank\nI'm Steve Case in a constitutional battles on the horizon is President Trump vows action aimed at illegal immigrants White House correspondent Steven port nor the\nPresident tells Axios on HBO he'll sign an executive order re interpreting the fourteenth amendment which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United states and quote subject to the jurisdiction there up\nA person comes in hasn't maybe and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states ratings ideas with all of those benefits ...\nBut there are a few legal scholars who believe Mr Trump has the power to do that on his own he says he's consulted with the White House counsel's office that is prepared to proceed Steven port noise CBS News the White House\nPresident Trump goes to Pittsburgh today three days after the synagogue massacre CBS as bill Red Cross says it comes as the first funerals for the eleven victims are taking place in the\nFirst lady Melania Trump are expected to stop at ... pm see Presbyterian Hospital to visit wounded victims of the shooting including police officers who were shot while trying to stop the gunman the\nPresident may also visit the synagogue itself tree of life's rabbis says the president is welcome to visit there is no pressure\nBeing applied nearly a month after the killing of journalists Jamal ...

there right now when you get teeming athletes overflowing probably three hundred in there it's it's crazy I should have a cigar smoker at my house but the guy that built the house\nI'm prior to us buying it was a contractor who smoked cigars he put in a true vent fans system okay so you can sit below it like two or three people smoking cigars and you'd never smell it in the house while it sucks it right up and out of the house it's fantastic so tonight's popcorn be all twenty two a beverage a cigar that's mine I\nOnce we get everything put away that's my night as a perfect direct so in the bar we've got a the electronic Harley Davidson dart board we've got to the food ball table we've got karaoke the popcorn machine and then I went out and I finally figured it out thanks everybody by

that but I got I've got in the bar three TVs all different all different cable yeah okay and then I mounted a forty two inch above the bar table okay that is strictly the Atari\nIs just is like a ... it's like a video game you're sitting at the table doing whatever kind of it's a video game table that's all it is I Would never leave the house that'd be my bad at all it is so it's absolutely fantastic so that that that's what I'm going to do tonight\nYou know that's it [noise]\nAh eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight five five a three zero eight six for eight give a shout or we'd love to hear from you but that's going to be my nights and it's going to watch this game I'm gonna watch last night's game between New England and buffalo and get ready for that I still after watching portions of the game last night I still think the Packers can beat them\nI think they do I think that when that game I ... when the game is it a must win game yes it is yes okay it's a must when you go to three foreign one\nI mean you can win out don't get me wrong because they can certainly be Miami they can certainly went on the road against Seattle I think a beating Minnesota's going to be a tough task going into Minnesota must be a writer that I think the schedule ease up a little bit [noise]\nBut if you're going to prove yourself to be one of the better teams in the NFC or even in the NFL you gotta you gotta when you can't go on the road against LA and New England and lose both of those games\nAnd keep saying close but no cigar you eventually have to win\nNow is it a must win in the sense of if they don't win this when they're out of the playoffs no but it's going to be hard [laughter] it's going to be hard to win out the rest of your season I just don't I don't think that's going to happen\nEight five five eight three zero eight six forty oh let's go back to uh go back to the phone call was supposed to do a Jeff is in baroque with Jeff how you doing today man what's going on\nI'm good I'm I guess I'm calling on behalf of Montgomery\nGuy I think a lot of Pakistan forget what he has done for the team in the last year a and a lot of people are forgetting about ah [noise] Chicago in two thousand\n[laughter] and it was I think he had like a hundred and sixty seven yards to touch down and ever and it was a hero and now that he\nHad on Fort Hood farm boy and a big game I along every other Packer fan wanted wanted a snack I it was a toxic situation all over again and everyone hated him but\nRefreshments will be served by Rome makers home and community

board today Thanks so much as always take a listen to us we certainly are always appreciate you hanging out been a lot of great discussion today the box we're going to chat a lot about tomorrow as well and\nObviously the brewers making some decisions is going to be more brewers news where we continue to break down at the Green Bay Packers getting ready to take on the New England patriots speaking of the patriots Michael Jr already beautiful network covers the patriots there as well joining us down the Schneider orange outline Michael how are you doing\nI'm well Oreo\nWhile so I guess my question is the packages come up with a lot to the LA Rams and everybody considers LA to be\nIf not the best certainly one of the best teams in the national football league pound for pound player prepare a ball player Brady tip the scales but how would you compare if you could LA to what they've got going on in New England with the personnel packages a cause I think the Packers do have an opportunity to come in and maybe get a win maybe steal wanted Fox grow even though it's a tough place to place\nYeah I mean I don't think the patriots has anybody a video of Todd ... so you have that right out of this you know a girl\nArguably the MVP in the league that's my dog in the background I don't know if you\nDon't care what friendlier [laughter] um\nSo yeah I don't think that anybody quite like him obviously Brady greater than golf greater than just about anybody except for maybe the guy is going to see on Sunday at Gillette Stadium I'm\nPerceived or I don't think that the earliest downloaded drunk house ski while a great player has not been himself all over the last few weeks missed the game against Chicago didn't look like himself last night I'm\nHappy I don't think there is much of a comparison talent wise I think yeah I think the rams are the better team down\nA look at what Brady is is it's been doing as of late we all know that that that team gets better as a season goes on what is made the difference for them since early portions of the season\nFor the first three weeks without Adelman and with no outside threat to speak of he was really handcuffed um\nControllable outside the numbers are they going to make the trade for Gordon 'em and they you know they force fed him quickly on he's made he's made it clear in fact the getting Edelman back to just mean that spraying security blanket you know he knows the jury is going to get up and he knows he's going to get up and quick night like last night where\nThe bills are such generating some good pressure\nNow and I'm In his ... there's no coincidence there he gets hoping he gets open fast and break he has a lot of faith in that so I think just the idea of getting Gordon outside he's got to pay attention to him or they maybe didn't have to focus as much on Chris Hogan Philip door set now getting Edelman back is a really makes a difference without asking off and\nWe have seen here in Green Bay and here in Wisconsin that the the Packers at times has had some uh I Want to say just functionality there's been some sniping between the quarter back in the head coach and it seems like sometimes there's a little bit of drama that the the patriots have had their fair share of it over the last year to\nHow they've been able to kind of a squelch all of that and still concentrated just on football\nYeah and then I think it it linger and you know it was just throughout the end of last season and they went into the off season and brain doesn't show up for parole TAs other than the the mandatory three day part which is that's not something that he's ever done um\nEspecially when you know there there are a couple of years where he was in LA when his son was born out in LA where one and um but when as soon as they got into the more heavy part of ... and they started throwing the ball a little bit more he showed up\nI'm so this was something new I think it definitely language but I think one of the things that you can\nSay about ... Brady and dollar check is\nYou know all that stuff that that they may not be best friends and then I'll always be out of high\nBlood what they closed the most is winning on Sunday or Monday or whatever the hell they're playing you know when I say new they're able to sort of put that stuff aside and say well look I Know Tom Brady if my quarterback is the best chance to win a Tom Brady says I Know\nFor all of bills issues he gives me the best chance to win on Sunday so let's\nPut all that stuff off the side and we'll deal with that at some other point but right now let's go in a football game\nDefensively speaking we know what Brady and company can do we know what they can do in an office of science the defensive side they still have guys like gone to high tower they still have ...\nAre they still have some quality players over there talk about the defense in in the match up against a pay a Packers team coming down with Aaron Rodgers and a lot of young wide receivers that he's starting to rely upon\nYeah I I think the patriots had been frustrated center every um last night not withstanding against that terrible bills off and that's\nAbout their inability to sort of string together for good quarter isn't\nTalking that ... last week before the game on friday and he he just said you know do you think some of these things that you're struggling with their more self inflicted then\nOpposition inflicted and he said absolutely you know you you know seeing that I call skiing for instance I have a twenty four points are twenty four to three at one point and then the next thing you know they're in a barn burner thirty one twenty four and a brief throwing up that prayer to Gordon and he pulled down over to defenders have just had like three place\nAnd look you got to play the game but there were three plays in that in the ruined the outcome of that game for for our from our vantage point of the defense same thing with Kansas City you know they they frustrating Kansas City in the first half homes with a little bit rattled and then the second half\nOf one big play then there was another big play then there was a third big play in the next thing you know again you need ... to go down the field\nWith two minutes to play and and and get the field that when the game so I think that there\nThere's talent they're but they're not put it altogether consisted of late last night was again and good they get what they were supposed to do last night so I'm going to give them credit for doing what they're supposed to do 'cause there'd be killing and if they gave up twenty points\nTo the bill's I'm Still think we need to see them against it all stems back to you then execute for four quarters 'cause we have obviously that's what is it they're doing really well right now\nUh [noise] I don't know that there's one thing that they're doing really well I think it's definitely Gilmore planning a high level he's their number one corner he's been getting he's been shadowing the opposite\nUh and he's been pretty pretty lockdown especially over the last month or so he's just growing confidence in\n... that it's growing confidence in him I mean the pain of a big amount of money and she got off the slow start last year picked it up late\nAnd I think it's sort of carried over here this year and he's been he's been a key and then I trade flowers when he's been healthy has been a tough guy is probably the best player on the field last night defensive and sometimes kicks inside of defensive tackle in Russian situations but\nBy and large I think there's just a bunch of guys that are played the average football and I think uh the expectation is that some of those guys are better at that the hope is that they're going to be able to honor some more of that here is to go forward\nThe uh the ... this this matchup I this is a big one for the package that this is almost a must win mathematically they're not eliminated from anything if they lose his ball game but this is almost a must win the way the Packers played last week in LA I thought to give them a lot of Koreans to say we can go on the road and beat anybody\nA how big do you think this game is being viewed in New England\nUh I think it's pretty big I think first of all I think I Know I Know I don't think I Know from a defensive standpoint there oh amped up to face our Rogers yeah you'd like to\nPlay the best you can have your best and against the best Sunday nights but he's going to be watching especially because of the quarterback match up so you festival either they're pretty ... to see\nThe sea Rogers and I know you know ... a super competitive guy and you know he's not planning Aaron Rodgers\nBut in somewhere in his brain he wants to prove that everybody once again that I Am\nThe best and he's a second dust and we'll go at all um I think that yeah I think there is a general enthusiasm for the game I think it'll billed as the week goes on I think\nYou know they're going to be very self critical after after last night's performance offensively only score will only putting up a team they got the defensive touchdown and again I'm and ... the\nFirst time and you know just drawing for twenty yards are more apt to touch down past I think they're going to look to sort of his own in some of the red zone issues from last night and incorrect but to me a big part of the

the tournament a pension plan you're not putting in anything\nAnd\nKnow what I mean control over what happens with a pension plan you don't choose the investments you don't get to um you know if the ... municipality in your case is poorly run they could break the ...\nIt's happened before doesn't happen very much\nBut um no I think you need to be voting Fifteen Percent of your income away in\nRoth IRA raise route four one K. is whatever you got to do along those lines and and that's the thing I Would tell you that the reason is is that what you've got that's money you choose where it invested\nAnd if somebody mishandles something at work it doesn't mess up your four one K. it doesn't mess up your Roth IRA you are controlling your destiny are not waiting on someone else\nThe people you work for it affects your life\nThat's a big deal Johns in Pittsburgh hey John welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHow are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm a great reason I'm calling is here's my question [noise] um my wife is sixty five I'm sixty two for just now into getting on the on the snowball we have our emergency fund saved up mhm\n... we're looking for a new place to live the house was rent right now is just way too big for my wife and I got bad knees bad backs mhm an up and down the stairs opinion about all the time okay um my question is\nUm do rentals around this area now are skyrocketing because there's new cracker plant going in so people are coming in from out of state sucking all those up [laughter] [noise] but I found a couple of houses that I could purchase\nAnd the pay my rent right now it's eight Seventy five a month or my payment would drop to about six hundred and thirty dollars from up mhm [noise]\nUm the other part of it is [laughter] I when I retired from the post office I rolled mine a ton of savings plan into an IRA and good\nThat I can borrow enough from right now we're already just to be able to put towards ... percent down on the house so I wouldn't have to pay the ... law mhm\nBut you know when you're by the American idol down twenty percent [noise]\nNo you're you're you're turning your to broker buying a house here in day out here you are in debt you get your borrowing against your retirement I mean you're straining every corner to pull this off okay um and besides that you if you're moving from an eight Seventy five rental to six hundred dollar payment you're moving down in the house substantially\nSo we're going to move down and how substantially moved down to a different rental and let me tell you if the rental market is squeezed because of a plant that has come in the buying market is squeezed as well\nSo what you're telling me is not logical you're using this as a rationalization to buy out of order I if I were you when you call me and I ask what you should do it I Would rent something else move out of that rental moved to a cheaper rental that'd be fine\nAh for a short period of time that while you clean up your debt your debt free you build your emergency phoned up three to six months of expenses then you have a good down payment and you can do all of that in a few years if you're careful and watch what you're doing and then make your purchased\nBut when you buy a house and you're broke you're asking for trouble I mean a Murphy will move in your spare bedroom bringing his three cousins broke desperate and stupid owning a home when you're broke and be a financial curse\nRather than a blessing\nSteven is in Virginia Beach Hi Stephen how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI just wanted to know what would be smarter to do it right now I have a higher rate and my name and I know you can only put five thousand five hundred into a year yes or no hypothetically at me and my wife only had\nThat with my mouth that amount of money five thousand five hundred to go toward the ... what would be smarter to put all of that into my IRA is portion I open up a lot from my and my wife's name and then flip the five thousand five hundred and put two thousand one hundred and fifty at each other and to watch or go that way\nWhat's your household income\nOr a household income and fifty thousand\nOkay Mm\nSo Fifteen Percent of that going in it baby step for into retirement is more like\nA ten thousand no it would be more like Seventy five hundred okay um [noise]\nAnd so you wouldn't fully fund to but you could put some ... ... it doesn't matter\nUh which one you do mathematically let's say you chose the exact same mutual fund and you put three thousand and one and three thousand another\nOkay one in one Roth IRA and your name one rather and her name or or um you put six thousand in the same mutual fund it's going to grow exactly the same so it really doesn't matter a\nHill I even had like a thousand dollars I can I could open up ... ... ... five hundred in my name and five hundred her but you know the guy that\nIt doesn't it doesn't have you any mathematical advantage whatsoever the only advantage is just a relational in that if she feels like that you know you're fully funding\nGot anything for retirement which is not true because if you ever got divorced or died or anything else\nShe's going to get half of that money even if it is and your name okay that's how it is not true but sometimes people just you know like she just wants some and her name that's okay so you could do half and half if you want you need to get to the point you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement that's baby step for\nAnd that would be after you were out of debt and after you had your emergency fund and ... which may be why\nYou don't have the money right now\nThat's why we put baby step for after getting out of that and after having emergency if I went to the folks temporarily not to save for retirement until you clear\nYour debts that way you have the money to put Fifteen Percent away and a Fifteen Percent is more than one Roth IRA for you guys but conceptually if you just even if you did Seventy five hundred thirty seven hundred fifty bucks each\nAh that'd be fine or if you did fifty five hundred and two thousand and the other name that's fine if they're in the same mutual fund you're going to get the exact same results whether you split it or not doesn't change a thing\nAnd James is with us in Fort Smith Arkansas Hi James how are you\nGood thank you for taking my call sure what's up my wife are planning to all next year and we're having a little trouble deciding or or agreeing on the house with them or to get kind of outline and towards getting a fixer upper\nThere'll be a cheaper house with a lower mortgage payment ... and that gave me the opportunity to learn\nLearn how to deal with our parents myself mhm and she wants to move and ready house\nMhm okay and uh be your first home\nThey are sick at all and we had a house for a while ago and then we moved and within ... printing well over a year now\nThe other home that you had was at a fixer upper it was not able to live and ready okay and um so what is her fear\nI bought a ticket you know and it kind of a hassle to her house mhm\nDidn't want anything major just out this a minor cosmetic type stuff\nBut I couldn't you do it for you moved in\nA financially I'll think we'd be able to afford rent and a mortgage\nNo I'm saying oh yeah okay sure what you're saying that you use the fixer upper would take a few months maybe and you wouldn't have to do that I got you\nI'm a part time real estate agent so I live in a house for two years and then turn around and sell it\nI can sell it tax free [noise]\nShelter anyway about a month ago because sales tax free anyway\nThey're they're real estate I show how strikes for your personal residents will be living in two years' tax free growth on that anyone for anybody [noise]\nI don't think there's a I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to this is just a question of what you guys want to endure it is your home and we are homeless topsy turvy because it's being renovated all the time I get to\nSome valid point on her you're not going to make as much money on it to your point so it's a valid argument\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches or being reported every\nDay and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy now I've seen first hand when people are stressed\nAnd freaked out when they become an identity theft victim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans find out really quick how unprotected they are in so many ways that's why ...\nId theft plant to our benefit package was such a smart move the Sanders plan covers all types of ID theft takes over all the work and even covers your bank account if it gets act I know my team is getting the brought us to\nProtection a bailout and can focus on their family and there are other priorities disturbing freaked out whether\nYou're a family or a company looking to help out your team you need to check out the Sanders plant in a quick easy quote at ... dot com or call I'd under three five six forty two eighty two it really is the best value out there ... dot com or eight hundred three five six forty two eighty to\nGood shape and you can probably do it this way um I Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\n\nYou're you're in a way above average shape I'm In good shape is ... is is way above normal cars normal just sucks okay you got to weigh rather than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life for the next forty years is going to get old\nAnd you don't really have any income coming in other than that because your investments aren't big enough to create it and so I\nWould you know you can do it you can do it but I think you need to have in the back of your head you may be going back to work at some point\nI'm considered that I thought about it for the health insurance and I'm I'm In a part of these mega share programs do you\nThis is not driving this for me for what's driving it for me is you don't have much more\nRight and you got the pension but understand you know think about what what are you\nKnow forty thousand dollars is going to buy in forty years when you are Ninety\nNothing nothing\nThat's the problem I've got here so it doesn't have a good long term prognosis of you guys just being able to live and we can figure out how you could live without a million dollars a mutual fund this becomes like a no brainer\nAnd said you got like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe even a scrape everything together episode around properties and\nYou know the farms got value but it's not producing any money so what might what I'm thinking is ... and again you can do whatever you want to I'm just talking at through with you OK I'm not saying you're you're you're you're wrong or you're bad or something but that's my concern of what I'm hearing\nIs and so I probably would think about what we always call an encore career and say what could you do that would be really fun\nThat you could make fifty grand or a hundred grand doing for the next five or six seven years and you enjoy doing it shorter business you'd have fun doing it and make some bank\nAnd bank all of it and health insurance as part of the day I don't care if you're working for somebody else you start a business but just do some what you're doing out and make your smile anymore so you need to get out of there\n[laughter] you picked up on her and so you know but but I mean when you're you're young you have a lot of uh a lot of\nService to humanity left inside of you that you could get paid for ideas concepts things you could do I don't know what it is but it's something that just I mean I'm just a little bit older than you I'm fifty seven of them do and I plan on work\nAnd it's not 'cause I Need money I don't have the money I got money coming in my ears but I'm working because I have a vast\nYou ought to find something like that and then you can work and hunt and fish and worked in the hunt and fish and farm and you know\nBut but you know I'd like to see your bank another five or six hundred grand and the next eight years and have fun doing it that's what I'm saying that's what that's the only challenge I've got is I think there's God's got something inside of you there is something you could do more than hunting and fishing that\nNot that that's more by this law you've earned the right to do that and you should get out of the place you're getting outta but what's your encore career you take a bow and you come back out on the stage for the encore that's what the encore careers and a lot of people in like a lot of money on that Richard\nSo and and it's not that money's everything but I I just want you to have a little more pad between you and Murphy then this scenario gives me here\nAnd I think there's some magic left inside of you\nKnow that we all need still that's what I'm saying and it might be you take a year and you do nothing behind pressure and farm and then usually at the end of that year I'm going to go do X and that's okay but but Ninety ... for for the next four years you're going to get tired of fishing [laughter]\nYou know bottom fishing [laughter] so [laughter] so find something makes you smile and that's all I'm saying so uh I'm gonna send you a copy of a book that I get on George\nCalled start because you're starting a fresh chapter\nI don't think you'll enjoy the thank you for calling him shoulder to talk to your shirt [noise] this is that Iran to show\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make
