remember that\nAnd it was it's got ... came by practice today and he's talking to our guys and he talked about big games in the games are when he was here as a quarterback ... you know what the only games I remember the Michigan on the Ohio State was\nBecause they were big ones the rest of the game that really you know and the way that they weren't important games at the time\nThe ones that he has with them and said he will forever for those games against those teams\nAnd that's exactly what North Dakota and Minnesota and and the the games that rivalry games at\nThe community and school and and the history of the programs you you just get so excited when when you know when you get an opportunity plate North Dakota so that message to our team was a really well received by by\nScott brought that up today so I thought that was really cool to have him there and it's true I remember that North Dakota games and I remember the battles that marriage Reno against Minnesota yeah um and you know that's why you play sports just to get in to get on the ice you know in situations like that one uh it's not just a regular\nGame yeah some fans aren't sure don't know I don't think there's still a rivalry you disagree disagreeing\nWhich some fans are the ones that I haven't seen that with Lewis is there a lot of ... when when when the LDC ha broke apart the Big Ten started and all of a sudden you lose the north Dakota the text to dilute Denver's the CDC's fans took a step back and this is not what I signed up for I don't\nKnow that the the games last year against North Dakota I thought were the two games of the year that I thought were the most intense from the trap of the puck even not even a drop in the week leading up to all the way until it ended\nI edited out of respect to both programs I think I think we were specs North Dakota for who they are I think they respect us you know for all we are and I think that's what's really cool about it\nI Want to go to lunch with Bradbury on friday and it's going to be three hundred and fifty people there screaming at me and yell at me as funny stuff and you know I just think that is so cool and college athletics to have all rivalries which they think he's still alive and I think our fans\nYou know we're going to try to get them on the schedule every year we won't have my next year it was news to catch something issues that we couldn't\nYou couldn't to both a have a weekend available next year to plan but put hopefully in the next two or three years we'll have mine for ever will be a cap words came in and uh and\nI think that would be setting for everybody on and on\nAnd I'm just I'm anxious to see how you're young clubs was the heart and energy and you know intensity that it has another and how it's going to play the oh yeah right against the north Dakota team doesn't matter who's coaching or who's in that sweater you know they're going to come with energy in a tent city in heart right\nUm we get an at large paid like we had this year which I Believe was the second time that's only happened\nI'm Andy three college history to have three teams from one conference get it and so for us it was great for our conference it was great for our guys and um our guys represented our university to the best of their ability I could have been more proud of them\nHad go to the ... men's hockey program and that again are still wants to marry and have to offer for student athletes they're\nMarried has a lot to offer married as a place that if you want to come and you want to get a first class education you want to sit in classrooms are average about twelve to Fifteen students are less um and most importantly married the place where everybody knows who you are and they know your name and they really care about you and they want to see it succeed\nThat something that we take a lot of pride in here I'm not only amongst our faculty and staff but our students as well as just the camaraderie amongst every one um and it's for us it's exciting for our players and the fact that their biggest fans are they're cheap\nWith and they love the fact that we have a hockey program that's doing well and\nI'm Mary is also a place that uh people truly invested in who you are and they understand that this is a four year commitment with old summit goal of making sure that you're ready to take that next step in your professional development and to be set for life um and so for us we understand here as a hockey program as well that\nUh with my job yes a hockey is very important but I also use hockey as a catalyst to help see my guys through and to make sure that their sets are prepared for life after hockey as well\nVery cool that gain or head coach and Marion whether it's on the Wisconsin hockey our I Know after making the NCAA tournament this happens in college hockey and college sports in general there is some turnover you lost an all American defense minister Gianni a man going forward Derek thorough good as well he had like a hundred and seven points in his career hunters steward at a hundred and eight\nHe's now moved on but you return goalie hunter ...\nWho had twenty wins one Ninety three goals against the nine twenty more said presented last season good place to start this year in it\nIt is absolutely a we couldn't be happier with the guy that we have coming back a hunter ... he and my opinion he is all conference gold center he played in every game last year gave us a chance to win a stood on his head and she wanted some games which is what good teams need 'em and then we return for a four to find someone\nAnd then we have a whole three lines and change up front as well so for us we have a lot of death and then we have some high end a new freshmen recruits coming in but if I can say this for us uh they'll never be another senior class like this last one that we had\nTo have you already mango need all American a hunter Stewart and all American as well um they they brought something special\nEd everything there was coupled around our team kept in a Kurdish Bloomington and so for me I felt kinda spoiled to have the best kept that I've ever coached in ten years and have him for only one year for my first year beat a head coach was a pretty amazing thing but\nAt the same time I know every year is going to be different in this next group will now have the opportunity to kind of get out of those guys they shadow him to step up and\nI didn't know how to have the opportunity to make their run\nOught to be all conference at all American players as well yeah so we're very excited here\nMary and also as six Wisconsin natives on a broad through counter blanche from ... located Mitchell bounding from cedar bird Johnson the pier on Nick ... gosh golly Kyle caring and he's from Oregon and lean Belmont from whitefish bay nice to have a ... said the ties are due isn't it\nOh it is absolutely absolutely I mean there's nothing better than to be able to bring recruits on campus or a to have people that come to visit that can meet some local people hear it helps us bring and not only a good fan base by having people come to watch those players as well but\nYou know for us we also want to represent our state to uh we do have quite a few international students employers from several different states but you know for us as one of our goals as a hockey staff here is to build also recruit some of the high end\nA Wisconsin kids that we can and we also the hockey here in Wisconsin the most high school hockey and triple a is some of the best in the country so we try and keep track of those players as it progresses well and\nUm even notice I'm sure as you look at our roster and our staff pages well those guys are at the top of our roster here as well as far as production\nMarian is part of the northern collegiate hockey association maybe the best division three conference in the country is it\nBack [laughter] it's a very loaded question in my\nIn my opinion yes it is a last year we were the only conference to send three teams to the national tournament we've traditionally every year we have anywhere between four to five teams are now she writes the top fifty in the country along with a few other schools that are also receiving votes um so for us it's\nWhat we saw last year or two we uh our copper and swept the Y. ac uh we uh swept the ... as well and I'm not a lot of success against all the different teams that we played and we even saw they hear this last weekend too as far as opening weekend here in the west so for us we take a lot of pride in the fact that our conferences as good as it comes but\nAlso the same time understanding that\nI'm with certain expectations comes in e for certain results and for everybody to perform into recruits their very best to make sure that our teams are ready to play against anybody that may step into our door\nAnd as I mentioned the norm or do one at the national championship last

M. subtle and our Rehman\nLimited dream how are you I'm terrific All right I Want to start with a wide receivers a lot of what a wide receiver move but over the last couple of weeks including just before the trade deadline today might cost you to us who benefits the most from both the Golden State and the dumb areas Thomas French\nI think that the name you have to really look at is Courtland ... who is a rookie for the for the Broncos\nThere had been many and the fantasy community clamoring for him to get more look to get more targets in fact you're not going to find a dry amongst people like they took all the dumb area Thomas's traded\nA Courtland sudden has been kind of hit or miss he has made some mistakes but he's been making big plays down the field and now he steps into at worst but number two role\nIn Denver as often we've seen both he and the Marriott Thomas kind of together combined for over thirty percent of Denver's target it's unlikely the button that many but are you going to step into a pretty big role here I think he's a talented player and I and he's a specially good in the red though where I mean the Broncos have\nKind of struggled case you know has twenty attempts inside the tent yard line the season but he's only completed eight of those ads is only a sport touched down\nSo they need some help down their Courtland ... get certainly do that so I think that he'd benefit the most as for Thomas I I don't think that his is value really changes that much I mean we'll see\nHow much work he gets he wasn't getting that much work in Denver for the trade so you know it's not great for him on the golden tape trade you know it's interesting situation I think it probably hurts paid a little bit you know we have to learn a new often said it's coming to a situation with back or the house John Jeffrey but you know I don't know if it's a big deal for him it is a big deal and Aguilar who\nI mean already was kind of struggling to shut down for a pack wasn't doing much with the targets he was getting lots of getting as many target as he was early in the season\n... is a player especially with the eagles on by this week that that you can send to the way for wired\nBurn up most of the trade deadline pass today so there there are a lot of fantasy football weeks out there that have their own deadlines the next couple of weeks so some of the potential trade target your mind for a playoff force\nWhy I think Ken Allen is is one of the more one of them were under rated wide receivers you hasn't really been getting in the end zone\nBut if you go and look at is underlying number is still getting the target is often hasn't been throwing as much recently because they've been able to have been really beating pretty fat teams I think there are good team so I'm not saying anything bad about the chargers\nBut they've been beating pretty bad teams they haven't had to throw it as much that\nCould change here coming out of the by they get Seattle this week and I just think you know now it is one of the best receivers in the league he's playing with Philip Rivers he's a clear number one receiver the touchdowns are going to come eventually and when they do I think he's going to be a lot more valuable than maybe maybe people look at it right now\nAnd another guy that kind of been one thing a little bit lately is ... Schuster I think he's going to bounce back I'm really not that worried about him maybe those two receivers or somebody you can buy low on right now\nWe're talking Raymond settled on our fan of Super Bowl expert who joined us every Tuesday\nStuff over wrote a world of NBC Sports\nAll right let's talk about some of the top running backs or in a way to get in some guys that have been on the sidelines for me to to return to help improve their teams running game Donovan Cook what and foreign debt ... Freeman which one of those top running back these to return in hopes of improving the running games\nWhy I think you know the the jaguars are really hurting for illiterate for net to come back and there are you know there have been reports that that's going to happen after that are by their by this week after the wanted game they're bitter report that's going to happen and we said he's going to be back\nBut we've kind of seen this game now it's for net throughout the throughout the year he's play what half of two games now essentially maybe not even one whole game he's had some setbacks with his hamstring injury they traded for Carlos Hyde would suggest that\nThere at at best not not sold that he's going to be back and wait ten so I'm worried about what's going to happen here was for that obviously you're keeping him on your team I mean especially if you held at this long you're you're waiting to see what happens but we'll see we'll see what happens within asked her down and cook\nI mean that's been one of the weirdest situation he has kind of a similar situation for that tries to come back as a setback tries to come back as a step back he it didn't sound when he was talking with reporters on Monday like he was he was confident he was going to be back this week so both those situations it's just it's just kind of wait and see ... you mentioned rich Freeman\nThe Broncos might be better off with Philip Lindsey Lindsey looks great and the fact that he was able to get a T carries in that game back or they were able to use them as much as they did in that game that might be the way they want to use their back bill moving forward even what Freeman comes back so I think the Broncos are fine when the U.S off his shirt\nOr something about the Oakland Raiders for a second because I you know I [laughter]\nI said no matter what John group says over the next several weeks is simple team is trying to even been looking you know two thousand Nineteen and beyond\nAnd then we see them get rid of a morning Cooper more strong lunch apparently is going to be out for a month and John ... today is a little bit you know he might not have been back for forty years over so I mean with the raiders worth plane and fantasy football after you get a look at their office without without those guys\n[noise]\n\nYou switched from selective very little\nThe swing\n\nBack everybody as we roll on the streets Dave spending so much going on in the national football league today she said of course the\nCollege football playoff all by the way coming up at the bottom of the hour we'll be talking about different ... ah give us a his perspective on what all this means today\nUh but we haven't really been talked about the money back and not that the you know it was earth shattering it was a field goal fast as a matter of fact\nI'm dying free for much of the game that died six men are all of a sudden I'm throwing the patriots\nSprinted away if you will twenty five not our twenty five six excuse me all the final in that game uh what what's interesting about this football game from my perspective\nIs the fact that a Sony Michel who continues or you know to be on the sideline what they are the injury um has put\nThe New England patriots and kind of a strange position [noise]\nAnd uh your point of your point of division opponent in Buffalo who by the way it always\nAlways plays\nNew England patriots tough they don't want to live but did they play them tough\nDecided to play a lot of ... for the most part\nI didn't play a lot of press man a lot of zone and two great estate a extent flustered vis a vis patriots office a little bit and and kind of held their\nTheir production done no use for Darrell Patterson a wide receiver he was leading Russia James White was a guy that they tried to use but didn't overuse matter of fact I think he ran like I don't know Fifteen routes or something like that are targeted for the times of the passing damage crazy and what's the ... that's his specialty I get it he's capable\nThe tackles but that's not something that I think that the the New England patriots want to do moving forward\nBut I'm thinking to myself okay so\nWhat does this mean mean Rob Gronkowski who had a couple of nice place in his football game or teams have been able to take him away and are now Julian Edelman coming back you would think that you'd be able to line up\nRight with that crew\nAnd join element and now Josh Gordon and\nAnd uh robbed and ... and just pretty much have your way in the past him and that really wasn't the case last night at all\nAnd I'm thinking to myself is that a good thing or a bad thing to Bill Bill a check is found a way\nTo use you know wide receivers\nAnd the like in the running game until Sony Michel gets back\nOr does it\nMake us think that now all of a sudden the patriots were vulnerable team\nUm I mean you know you're judged by your record clearly and\nAfter a slow start their own I sort of win streak right now I get it\nOr by the way I was watching Josh Gordon last night and that football game and it happened a couple of times during the broadcast that it might have mentioned in passing it happen again a couple of times after a while I was out on the patio watching the second half of the game [noise]\nYou know everybody has shocked about how quickly he is integrated into this office\nAnd there were a couple two or three times last night where a he was unwilling to just bend his knees we're not talking about lay out like Superman just bend his knees and pull up a little bit to catch up all of a slightly under thrown that could have been a big play that her happened earlier in the game\nThere was a big route\nOr that he ran for the left side a man to man coverage or this is bizarre to me so he's running a Seventeen to twenty or dig around and in route comes out of it is a break and just kind of throws a down like yeah\nThey're not throwing it to me well Brady had thrown it to him and he was surprised by he was able to go to the ground and make the cash but I'm thinking to myself wow\nThere were reports apparently to build build check now has refuted that I'm Josh Horne was late for some meetings in late for the bus et cetera was going to be disciplined and then after the game very a bill just like I don't know anything about those who have to ask the reporter will ever which again I think it's a bunch of crap given this guy's history I'm sure if there are some smokers some fire here\nUm but if you could get Josh according\nTo play like he's just freaking interested more than anything else\nBy the end of the year this guy could be perhaps maybe the biggest office of weapons to pass a game that they had on that football team\nBut doesn't seem to be the case right now and and despite the fact that they keep piling up wins I keep thinking to myself wow okay and let's Sony Michel comes back and you carry the load will be forward how good is this football team\nReally going to be [noise] meanwhile you got the uh [laughter] you've got the Buffalo Bills by the way God Bless the bills fans I mean the most entertainment last night was watching term is Thomas get his Jersey retired at half time one of the greatest of all time\nAh but in the process\nThey lose another quarterback Derek Anderson who was a sign off the street but a week or two ago\nA ends up starting because of course ... shall under prize first round draft pick has got a a UCLA injury in his ah right throwing arm and his elbow he's going to be awhile before he's back\nThey bring a Derek ... go by the way it gets the crap out of him\nAnd he goes down\nWith what they're calling a concussion they put them in because of protocol wasn't hitting the head of California was hit in the back or the shoulder or whatever but whatever I'm an off comes Mr Nathan Peter I by the way out I could just hear you you know\nI'm ... I'm surprised my phone didn't blow up in a computer and came into the game I'm Peter meant of course is a guy that played really well in the pre season was giving the starting job and gave it up this was after he threw five interceptions and a half\nOf last year by the way anyways um\n[noise] he played pretty well I think it was a I think it was what was it a third down and thirty when he came to the ball game\nAnd I think he completed to passes for twenty two yards\nOf course it was thirty thirty nobody's started anybody underneath a so anyways he you look at his numbers he's completed only forty one percent of his past is\nHas a touchdown and foreigners sections or this year and um [noise] there was a report now that I'm Matt Barkley\nThe former quarterback who's been out on the street is I'm expected to be in Buffalo for a workout at a meeting on Wednesday that'd be tomorrow\nBecause they don't know whether or not there and it's just going to come back apparently they don't have a lot of confidence confidence and they compete Herman Josh Alice not going to be around so um\n[noise] the days the days of Jim Kelly used to play there are long gone ladies and gentlemen I mean there've been a lot of guys run through there they might be second only the Buffalo Bills with regard to uh trying to find\nOr to replace the whole favor\nAnyway by by three two three four NBC as I told you out of college football playoff poll at least a week one has been released I won't come back and talk about that little bit of what's you know who to talk to an hour\nAnd we'll talk with our\n... voice not ours is actually the publisher called football new struck down but\nWe are for about eight or ten minutes and uh I forget his perspective on what all this mean for all natural under

that's really good news to get your first order for just five bucks you need to go to this exclusive address for him dot com slash hope\nYou know it's fine if they're all kind of put in the same but they did a job with that said that overall though it seems like the ... the first couple of years I worked with he's got the college football playoff committee and I knew of like those kind of know them and I know it when they first started this thing it really was based\nAs much on okay we want the teams that have been great when the big splashy things in there as opposed to being just an eye tests we want to you know really a little more teams for resumes\nAnd part of the problem with that is the okay it's easy to fall for example Alabama number one obviously there's no argument against that they're having a historically great seizing but\nClinton's beat no you know more teams in the college football playoff top twenty five Alabama has only one win\nOver a team in the college football playoff top twenty five you know and then on the flip side they reward LSU with the number three ranking because of all the big thing it's been able to do and then it punishes Florida a little bit with putting them at eleven it's just\nThey're they're combining several different theories and practices all at once here and when you put the whole puzzle together it just doesn't work\nThat you mentioned the Alabama obviously Alabama she's a game of the week this week down in Baton Rouge a ... and you know you're talking about this historical season I keep hearing people say oh this is big savings best team and I'm like I'd like to see a place of buddy\nUsing the I tested pretty damn good and to his made them and it's something that I don't think you know ... really ever had there in Alabama a against as LSU team their top in Baton Rouge\nI I Would expect that I think I was a two touchdown favorite in this game I Would expect them to win\nBut um what what surprises do you think the tigers can spring on the time\nOr just that defense I mean it's all of a sudden you're dealing with the deal is every bit as good as everything Alabama's got your office of line with everything as good as a Alabama's got the problem with LSU and it just doesn't have those skills guys I mean it's two versus Joe borough and it just it's not fair play\nSo either the defense is going to have to rise up and really screw up the oil and make him make us a little big mistakes\nOr or else Alabama is going to be fighting you know Alabama is great I mean to look to the general point and it's just you're mixing UCF in Alabama arguments together it All right you're ... you're right you know they're just getting the elderly scheduled an awful by any stretch I mean they're playing the C team there\nYou know but they're destroying them so if you want to say okay your schedule not amazing\nWhile they go on the beat everyone by forty and end the game and after three drives All right well that's exactly what Alabama is doing so and that's the kind of UCF argument we're All right you are not play anybody so why aren't you annihilate him everyone by the first quarter and not you know struggling so much against Memphis\nYeah a mixing it will think of any ideas myself here but at the same time\nAlabama debt exactly what you're supposed to do it now okay you're going to get tested they're going to get you on the road is still going to have to play all burn up at the end they're gonna have to play a Georgia or even a Kentucky and the FCC championships though those big cuts are coming to look and see what the how it is in the event you know as good as it's been so far\nDown I guess that's where I was going to go with my follow up here a pie because when you say you know they're they're just destroying people now all of a sudden\nWhen they get tested in a close game and I'm assuming that doesn't mean it's going to happen that uh this LSU de France which by the way I think leads to the country and interceptions they uh fourteen only given up about Fifteen points per game all of a sudden when you test them you wonder what the response of Alabama's going to be a championship team or bond to continue to score but we haven't really seen that yet\nThere are so many ways you if you're asking coach do you want your team to be tested in the fourth quarter of course you would like to have a point where\nAre some point in the season you you put them through the paces just so they're used to it the flipside of that is we are now in ... entering into November and there has it had to play a meaningful snap and really the second quarter of any game yet this year which means\nThat you get all your ... developed which means you get a rest your star guys you know that your body punches you're Tina the tape the fewer hit a nobody will have to take\nInto the on the flip side I think most coaches would trade\nThe idea of being tested for having a fully rested team\nThat is going to be healthier than anybody else in the country ah for this time of year so if you're good yeah handle it and you're just fine and you know I I the argument in theory makes sense except for the fact that the guy under center was thrown to the world and the national championship\nDown as a freshman and ended up winning a national title of coming out of the bigger call off the bench cold so\nIt it there's no real argument but I'm going to say that probably the way things are working are exactly the dream alternate coach\nYeah All right let me get you out of here with is when you look at five fruit through town right now are those teams we got Michigan and there you got Georgia Oklahoma who really is going to be tested by West Virginia at the end of the year\nUm you've got Kentucky you know how some of those five teams six teams uh from from five on down to ten or who do you like uh to to perhaps come out of there and end up at the college football player\nI still think Oklahoma and seven and Ohio State tend to get there a ... he's gonna cannibalizing itself a U. L. S. U. L. U. or Alabama or going to lose but even if that if you're a fan of Michigan or Notre Dame of Oklahoma or ... states\nYou need Alabama just to go Alabama and ripped through everyone what you don't want\nIs for LSU to win on Saturday and for Alabama to go all of that one because what we do know\nIs that this committee is going to put in Lebanon in Alabama it just will our wealth is happening so that\nIf you do that and you have let's say Georgia versus LSU for the SEC championship the MDC champion getting in Alabama's getting in and all of a sudden you're squeezed not a couple of spots\nYou need Alabama to knock out to you you need Georgia to get knocked off at some point during the SEC championship you basically along the way of saying you need Alabama to go there you know and you eat everyone else and you have to see to have to losses\nA Clinton losing would be a would hurt it would be a killer nerdy and going to lose at some point\nOr whether it's at Northwestern Oregon Syracuse or even at us either they're going to drop one game a tremendous good come come down I think to the Michigan Ohio State winter\nAnd then the Oklahoma if it can get to twelve and one with the big twelve championship I think it gets into the final four pretty much no matter what unless you have to see the options\nOn the table and five seconds who do you trust more Michigan or Ohio State\nAnd that the lower trust Michigan a heck of a little more than I\nThink Ohio being it's been my friend we haven't talked in a while it's awfully nice for you to give me a couple of minutes I think you have a good rest of your week and I'm sure won't touch base announcers\nWho you're throwing devils are going to be right there and\nYeah one of these barricades out that one [laughter] do you think

side deadline\nI must tell you a pretty robust pretty surprising\nUsually about trade deadline is ho hum yawn away\nNot the most interesting nor fun just kind of comes and goes and not a lot of teams doing much but this year it's a little bit different that I have to be honest I think it's a little strange the moves that some of these teams have made that you can look at every deal from both sides obviously and\nYou can then decide who truly got the best of a deal and why it trade was made let's start out with well being of the north begins to be four teams in the end of the north were very active at the trade deadline and the other students\nBy one game Chicago Bears Minnesota Vikings both foreign three Green Bay Packers three three and one Detroit Lions are three and four from number one to number four there is a separation of one game\nYet both the Green Bay Packers and the Detroit Lions were sellers at the trade deadline today\nGreen Bay deals not one but two starters\nOut\nTime Montgomery two days after taking that kick off at the end zone and some believe it was at a spike because he was taken out of the game to series before it had a\nVerbal altercation with the coaching staff because of it and some believe he took that kick out just to spite the coaching staff he then of course proceeded to fumble it LA Rams recover it the rest is history Packers lose that game by two points so time on ... out the window\nAnd also how how Clinton decks the safety out the window he heads to the NFC East and the first place Washington Redskins for a draft pick\nSo here's the way to look at this\nFor Green Bay in two days to trade time on guard me a guy that by the way let's not forget a couple of years ago when that team was absolutely just desperate for a running back right absolutely desperate\nHe's the one that they move that's why he was wearing that number eighty eight Jersey right as always kind of strange to see him wearing that number eighty eight Jersey\nBut time a government who is in his fourth season stepped in three years ago at running back are really two and a half years ago and got the job done there was a necessity and it was a productive plan is not a great player he's a productive player after a storied career at Stanford he was a heck of a player at Stanford really was he was a wide receiver\nKind of a Jack of all trades is great on special teams one of those types of players ends up going into third round\nBut for them to deal a player who is pretty productive in time a gum ready for a seventh round draft pick in twenty twenty\nDoes it leads you to believe that maybe the front office believes that time of Germany in fact did run that kick out of the end zone more so out of spiked and tried to play hero or as he put it I wasn't sure how close I was the goal line and I kind of thought I was in between so I thought I had to run it out\nBy them moving time a government so quickly\nDoesn't it tell you that the front office actually believed\nThe rumblings saying rumblings that a disgruntled timely gr MRI pretty much said to heck with it screw the coaching staff I'm going to do what I Want to do at a spike in a close game against the LA Rams on the road when that division is being separated by one game\nAnd the time of dirt retake standing in the end zone which is what the coaching staff had wanted this time Montgomery get traded today to the Baltimore Ravens\nMy answer is probably not that crazy is that\nBy the way he goes to a Baltimore Ravens team that as a serious problem you know that serious problem is for the Baltimore Ravens\nThey don't know how to run the football right they don't know how to commit to the run it's a team that seemingly is allergic to running the football\nYou know Alex Collins in his last five games or you could even go throughout the season look at the Carey total for Alex college fans have been that productive the often said why not open to the polls\nBut it's like a very Christian McCaffrey ask seven carries nine carries Eighteen eleven twelve\nNineteen Lebanon eleven so it's not as if John Harbaugh committed to the ... this is purgatory right he's going to a team that does either on the football much and so I guess I'm not sure does it do they move them do they move into wide receiver I guess maybe the issue\nBut it's also trade hot Clinton disc ... what is the message being sent by Green Bay like what are they saying here\nAre they saying that even though we're three three and one\nWe don't believe are really good enough to compete so let's accumulate more draft picks are they just kinda cutting fat just kind of strange for that to happen meanwhile Detroit one game out of the leader of the NFC North dealing one of the most productive players that they have they have traded\nGold in taped to the Philadelphia Eagles for a third round pick\nGolden tape leads that team\nEven reception is he leads that team in yards\nAnd in his career since coming coming over to Detroit from Seattle\nHe's done nothing but produce Ninety nine catches Ninety catches Ninety One catches Ninety two catches on pays for another nine to catch this year and another thousand yard season which would have been his fourth\n... is Detroit to throw it in the towel they that confident and Kenny go away and Marvin Jones in I mean is that what they're looking at\nWhat they'd be better served by still having Matt Stafford throw the Golden Gate a guy that he's got a great report with that's what's so surprising to me with these moves the fact is these teams are to appoint throwing in the towel when they're not exactly out of it\nLook I understand the Denver Broncos trading to marry as Thomas I mean the Marius Thomas is not helping the Broncos and the Broncos aren't going anywhere right the Broncos are four games behind the chiefs they're two games behind the chargers in terms of a wild card race yeah mathematically they're still obviously but let's not kid ourselves they're not a good team\nSo John Elway is looking at that saying look we're gonna lose their various times to free agency I don't want to bring it back he's kind of lost the step here and there the hands of never been great if I can get anything for them areas Thomas right now let's move up I'm keeping Emanuel Sanders I'm getting ready to marry as time has and they're out of it there for games out an F. C. west\nThis is not a situation like Green Bay or Detroit where they're actually in it\nSo I you know Denver I totally understand that makes perfect sense why they would go out there and moved to Mary's Thomas absolutely it makes sense\nSo I just [noise] you know I'm just I'm just kinda dumbfounded for Green Bay\nReinstated head football coach DJ dark and who was play play started

thirteenth\nJerking is reinstated\nThe athletic director Damon Evans told the team with dark and present today jerk and met the players nor the coaches were there before they had to practice the reports are that several players including some starters on the team walked out of that meeting with darken\nMcNair is family outraged Marty make near Jordan there's father said quote\nFelt like I'd been punched in the stomach and somebody spit in my face\nWow I mean this is incredible the governor of Maryland getting involved as well seems very surprised that this ends up happening I have to tell your Sean I Am ... donned\nThe Maryland is bringing back DJ Dirk and now let's get every fact out their jerk and it was not present at the ... during that practice we're drawing McNair suffered the heat stroke his\nHand picked strengthen conditioning coach his close friend the number one higher that jerk and brought with him the first guy hired after getting that job after being understaffed or what Ohio State I Believe it was right\nShe\nIs responsible for the people he hires a guy that he brought in was a bully drove the players over the edge and including by the way driving a player in the heat stroke and ultimately sadly yes\nWell BJ jerk in's not directly responsible because he was in their DJ Dirk in the one that has to fall and the sword because his right hand man his henchmen was directly responsible to a point for the death of one of his players this is studying news that DJ Dirk in his back\nSean how does this guy recruit had as you walk into a potential recruits home suit with the parents didn't say I have your son's best interest in mind when Jordan McNair is six feet under the ground it makes no sense Sean\nIt makes some sense also considering what has DJ dark and accomplished at the college level of coach\nSo why would you if you're Maryland why would you bring this guy back what benefit does does it serve at the interim coach Canada's ... done well a win over Texas five and three\nThey're Maryland football I mean that they're not going to compete in in the eastern division in the Big Ten with Penn State with Michigan with Ohio State Michigan State so I take this risk it makes very little sense to me\nSo here is what the University of Maryland board chair James Brady said at this news conference quote we believe that coach dark and has been unfairly blamed for the dysfunction in the athletic department while he bears some responsibility is not fair to place all of it as feet\nWell yet they also said that Evans will keep his job so who we then apparently to blame for the dysfunction in this athletics department because well on record is Soviet lane are responsible right\n[laughter] this is ... personal here's the thing\nYou know women didn't Meyer got suspended showing we talked about and I said look he's not going to get fired because these urban mind you cannot replace urban Meyer who's the second best coach in college football today only behind Nick Saban there's value with urban Meyer I'm not saying it was the right decision on it\nStand why Ohio State didn't fire you know urban Meyer you're not going to get a better coach said was leaving Alabama to go to Ohio State tomorrow but if you're in Maryland you can kick PJ jerk into the side and no one's going to say boo because no one's gonna care in the sense of oh he's a great coach how are we going to replace them\nRight and you don't want them to to be fair should even come down to that you know it's right or wrong I mean who cares if there are good coach or not they if they did the wrong thing they should be out right right we all agree with that\nWhat we're trying to get into the minds of the people making these decisions and if you know urban Meyer by keeping urban Meyer you could say All right they're keeping him partly because he's a great football coach right that's what we're saying we're not saying it's the right decision because it reminds of the court right\nBecause you don't go away so that would teach jerk and you're throwing that out of the equation because he hasn't accomplished much as a head football coach so why would they run the risk of bad PR at the very least bad PR\nWith keeping him as as the head coach the football team\nHonestly there's no explanation for this and what's amazing is the president to the university also by the way was brought back although he is retiring on his own I Believe in June\nHe even came out with that unprecedented press conference back in August where he accepted pug with publicly quote legal and moral responsibility for what happened\nSo for no heads to roll except for the lonely trek you know the lowly athletic trainer is ridiculous so you want to talk about a botched investigation you want to talk about a bunch of people sitting in a room who are absolutely clueless which is stunning had no idea how anybody could be this clueless\nAnd just to think that Marilyn felt that this was the right decision where anybody in any sort of a power position he's not being held responsible is utterly insane oh player is dead\nPlayers are walking out of a meeting with the coach because there are disgusted one of the players even on social media outlets in the county writes quote every Saturday my teammates and I have\nTo Neal before the memorials are falling teammate you had a group of people do not have the courage to hold any what accountable for his death if only they could have the courage that Jordan had never the wrong time to do what's right oh my goodness by the way\nWhat do you know the the other side of it is is\nThe athletic training staff\nThey didn't properly treat Jordan\nSo if you want to look at it from courts perspective right had the athletic training staff done their job Jordan would be alive today it wasn't because he was pushing them too hard\nRight it was because the athletic training staff from the right\nDidn't do the job\nWell here's the problem is they don't carry I did not apply in cold water emergency treatment I don't know did you watch the real sports interview with the parents\nAnd they had one of these experts on I forget his name and he is he a trainer or what have you or what have you and he said that had they properly treated Jordan you'd be alive today\nAfter his death ... got you shouldn't\nHe doesn't know on but that's the problem was there was a complete failure in every aspect won the signs of Jordan\nAnd what it was the proper techniques of getting his body temperature down cooling tubs things like that right not a single thing was done correctly by training fat that you would\nLeave is obviously well trained that's obviously not irresponsible fail everybody's response will be anger in the right place to be

NC State Florida State made it sound as if they played this great schedule yet their number to Dan what's up\n[noise] or if you want to look at it\nFrom a resume perspective you might have a point or the thing is though when you look at a college football the last several years there are two programs in the country who have\nRisen above the crowd not only in terms of recruiting but also developing players\nWanted Alabama the other as Clemson nobody else is in their weight class and times of tuna running it'll opera and this clumps of team ever since they made a quarterback change Kelly Bryant to Trevor Lawrence\nI live in Atlanta forever Lawrence is the best quarterback prospect who has ever come out of the state of Georgia that is\nQuite a statement I've given the amount of town that has come through the state but it is true Harvard Lawrence is a transcendent player and when Clemson finally made the decision to put him in as the store or they do nothing wrong or they dominate the people and\nThey're getting better tweak and so\nWell I Would agree with you in the sense that Clemson maybe\nHas not had the schedule ... teams they're undefeated\nThey have dominated people since they made the quarterback change a and their amount of talent whether it's orange a quarterback ... in the ... ... ... defensive lineman who we're going to be first round picks\nYes or no cost round NFL Draft picks on their defensive line um\nIt's Alabama it's ... and everyone else is a ... glow I I don't care who they be that's what it is right now so clumps Alabama Alabama clubs however you want to do it\nI'm fine but but then isn't shouldn't the resume count in what I mean by that it shouldn't\nThe competition who you've played results that count rather than you are right in terms of pure talent Clemson right up there I don't deny Clemson some more talented team than Alice ... is a more talented team the Notre Dame\nBut if we're just going to do that and who cares about the games they played right shouldn't that matters strength of schedule strength the conference things like that why isn't that going to be taken into consideration and we're just going to get to say yeah they played nobody an ACC stinks but they've got a lot of talent\nWhere you're missing two things one that was just got off and comes into\nThat matters to\nThis is a very subject to process the ... job is to identify the four best teams ... for most deserving it's up for best resumes for best resumes Alabama would not have been in the playoffs last year was made that very clear\nIt's for best and Clemson is in any measure is the second best in the country out if they lose somewhere on the line that may change but\nThe only team in the country right now as a good chance to beat Alabama on a new group field is causing so for them to say the number two okay no problem with that and I think frankly drawing the minority here\nShe's got a loss\nNo I agree with you absolutely I Do believe I Am in the ... minority but I'm just saying is I I'm trying to look at resumes you know besides you know just saying a team as all the onto they don't\nEat here's what I Would tell you is\nClemson is better defensively then I was you and they're better off at school is an issue I mean I I think Ellis defense is very good Clinton's defense is just a little bit better their bottom up front that was probably a little bit better in the second era\nBut ostensibly you're not even talking about two teams that are in the same strategy for I mean\nShe was a limited offensive team joke borough has been a\nAs good as he needs to be he's done some nice things but when you talk about the kinds of potential ... got to follow the ball down fuel from Lawrence you're talking about school players Travis each ten a running back you're talking about two totally different classes of teams\nThe off fence of potential the Clemson has is just\nFar better than anything else who puts on the field\n[noise] alright easier conversation in terms of LSU being ahead of an beating Notre Dame are you okay with that\nWell and so it's interesting one of those things that I really noticed about what the committee did today is in every situation where there were teams that were kind of close they seem to favor the team that's better defensively and\nI I think that's probably a smart thing to do a you know everyone seems like they can score points right now I Would argue elite defensively maybe the separate and um you know you look at LSU I I think they're probably just a\nTad better defensively the Notre Dame um you know you look at Michigan there are a tad better defensively right well maybe not maybe more than they are better defensively than Georgia you look at Kentucky in the rankings at number nine really good defensive team you know some questionable offensive\nUm numbers but their way to the head of Ohio State by this committee Ohio State really good often simply not good defensively so again I think it's consistency from the committee or they seem to have a philosophy going into this about what they value what they think makes for a\nGood potential playoff team a and it's nice and so if if you kind of follow that logic then I don't think you can have too big of an issue as LSU and the truth is they play Alabama this week if they beat Alabama than they\nDeserve to be there are ... they'll probably be number one if they lose a little bit behind dollars you could do or don't leave behind the ... they have to last so\nTo me it's kind of like whatever I I you know we're we've still got several more weeks to go um the ratings right now don't mean that much you want to put all those you had an Notre Dame it's fine we'll find out Saturday whether that's valid or not\nChatting with Dan walk in USA Today college football writer Dan last question when you look at this a first ranking that's come out is there one team that stands out that you think he's ranked higher than you thought they would be in one team that you feel it's been under ranked [noise]\nI got to be honest I I have not paid that much attention to it because again I mean this is just entertainment the committee's putting out there I uh it doesn't really eat a whole lot and you get into the last month of the season all you know again I think Kentucky at number died is is interesting because\nI'm not sure that if you went around the country to say was Kentucky a top ten team or not that you'd have a whole lot of people who really which the fact that there and talk to him team I mean they they literally needed\nA gift of a pass interference penalty or an all time down\nTo to beat Missouri last weekend so you know I think maybe some people would say that there are a little bit over rated I I don't know that anyone is under rated push say that I think you look at the top ten and\nEverything kind of falls to fall of Oklahoma's there are number seven I think they're better than the number seven team in the country\nUh but again they're going to have to prove that they're gonna have to go out the rest of the season to be people there have to play\nThe kind of defensive played the last two weeks ever since Mike Stoops got fired\nI'm you know I just think when you look at who's dangerous in a playoff scenario like Oklahoma and Tyler Murray the potency of that often like your your you know they they are not the kind of a team you want to play I mean we saw last fall I forget what they did the Georges ...\nSo I I think Oklahoma's\nBetter number seven they may not deserve to be higher the number seven right out based on the schedule they have lost everything like that but if they continue on the same time they'll do the right to match\nThere you have a lot of fun God's football you're right it's entertainment value on these rankings come out but we tweak they will take care of themselves and walk and USA Today costs the brighter Dan

Golden State and of course Rob pulling getting hired as the GM of the LA Lakers this past offseason but surprise surprise the Mets they go the unconventional route but is it the right one our baseball insider\nSets ever join just enough so that you know a lot about this Mets team first of all surprised that this is the move that they've made going the direction of bringing in a guy who's never been a front office person Brody bandwagon and then are you a fabulous\nI wouldn't say I'm a fan or I'll take a wait and see attitude about it I'm not rushing to judgment but I made this analogy you tell me if you disagree with this analogy\nYou wouldn't hire a dentist to do open heart surgery [noise] to me it's just like saying that just because you're a big sports fan means you can host a radio show or just because you like music doesn't mean you can be on a stage\nYou know what I'm saying ... excellent agent and he definitely notice negotiations and he represent ... or represented ... you know seven of their players\nBut to understand the new era baseball and to you know all of a sudden be able to command a franchise is an unchartered territory he has as much experience is Rocco bell deli does managing the twins\nAnd I but I think it's less because he's not been in management and you know I learned something a long time when I met with Tony carpet head of the union ... years ago but we talk about very rarely\nDo players go into management you know Bob Watson went into management\nManagement but it's very rare that a player goes into management usually that go work for the union well it's the same thing a player agent has never gone into the front office\nAnd why would I Believe that a franchise that has botched so much over time is suddenly going to understand how to do it\nThat's the surprising thing for the Mets the hard questions that has to be answered a meanwhile Jacob the ground is one of those he sign through twenty twenty as he's Asian Brody bandwagon and said hey emerge freedom right so now he's on the other side of it correct so what are your expectations for Jacob ... because again this was like unheard of\nWhere a guy representing the top player on that team with an ultimatum said team is now actually running that team in I guess would run the negotiations on\nThat and he addressed that and he said you know now it's time to you know first of all I think they're going to try to pay him\nBut here's here's the question Brody bandwagon and had a number in mind when he made those comments at the all star game right like chicken to grow knows that\n[laughter] and so he knew that number and my question is did he meet with the well ponds and say it will take this number for him to side and the willpower and said sure if that's the case then what they do to send the option\nTo think of sending all of a sudden they didn't have that checkbook you know oh I mean I didn't have the checkbook right\nSince made off they have not given open checkbooks to their general managers they have asked their general managers to be much more creative and the fact that Sandy all this and got that team to the twenty Fifteen World Series is a testament to his ingenuity\nIf broadly bandwagon and has money the Sandy all this and never had well then that's a ... and then suddenly the will puns or good owners I'm shocked\n[laughter] ... studying to be I mean it's so ridiculous in the sense that they're not surprised by this but I don't want\nTo sound like I don't like the guy I I Do like him I met him before it seems like a really nice guy\nI'm rooting for him and I like John ... who was you know I guess going to be his right hand man\nAnd I I'm ...

bringing in ... before that Bob Meyer of course the GM of the Golden State warriors [noise]\nMy worry is this when it comes to a guy like Brody bandwagon easy very very successful age right Brody bandwagon and\nIs he is a super agent that's what it is not the way to put it he is a super agent the guy is\nThe real deal the guy is the you know I mean he's he represents a bunch of hot shot big name players he makes millions of dollars in fact you have to believe he's taken a pay cut to become the gym or the New York Mets\nAnd that's why I have to ask why is he doing it is it just a challenge for him\nYou see Brody bandwagon and could always go back to being an agent of this doesn't work out right I mean somebody's gonna hire to be an agent of course the ale take 'em right back and he'll go back to making a fortune\nSo so like I don't understand is why in fact he would want this job\nAnd you can't tell me it's more than just hey I'm going to be a a you know I said it's it's a ... book it's a ... to me it's fun and games for him it's like hey I can prove I can do this\nAnd I'm like a guy that already has a great job that's going to take a job outside the comfort zone\nBecause I just feel honestly like you have to to wonder about the motive as to why he would do it see Sean that's the big worry that I have with this Brody bandwagon and his what's his motive to do it they are making millions\nA new way to ... you you mentioned it a challenge it's a challenge he's accomplished a lot as an agent already you mentioned just some of his clients to ... send the guard another one so why not try this or not\nBut that's the thing why not try it it's not a contest it's not a game right why not just try to give it a shot seeing what hasn't been done before this isn't something new\nYou mentioned the name's Dave steward failed he was an agent by the play I don't count him from a ... and you mentioned the other ones with the ... the warriors GM and um [noise] who are like the Lakers and without the jury's out on pointer but you know Lincoln played too\nI Know he did this guy Brody played baseball at Stanford so he play like well\nHe's a white guy no question about it I mean look he's obviously they're very talented guy what he does and that's great that he wants this challenge\nI just think if you're the New York Mets do you want a guy that's doing it for a challenger you want a guy that\nMay have a real background in this from the aspect of actually being in a front office and not being across from you in the negotiations that's the issue that I have with this and hey for the New York Mets what surprised me it's a totally fails because for the Mets a lot of things fail right but that's usually find a way to screw things up\nAnd I just think in this case it could potentially be a catastrophic move for the New York Mets I really think so I mean it's so to me I have the Yankees the Yankees go after case to close\nThe cash and decided to call it quits one of these days because he's not going anywhere and cash and it's really not going anywhere absolute ... if the Yankees don't win the world series actually done I don't think so yes

com slash hope\nSenior I'm a writer for police report Howard ... joined us going deep enforcement NBC Sports radio Howard there's been an incredible offensive explosion so far in this league in fact there's just one team in all of basketball\nAnd that team at the Boston Celtics that have allowed fewer than one hundred points per game to their opponent what is going on in this league why is this explosion just taken off the way it has\nAgain small sample size we're early in the season and teams are adjusting to some rule tweaks ah that that took affects just this season um primarily a crackdown on holding grabbing hugging\nOr an ... an otherwise impeding people's uh players progress or you know it's basically the defense has been banned from doing anything other than stand in front of your guy and hope to stay in front of him so anything that's\nGrabbing clutching hugging all that stuff the league is trying to get out of the game um infant for you know obvious reasons I mean more often says is is exciting um and you know the league has been trending his way for Fifteen Years already all going all the way back to when they eliminated\nA hand checking on the perimeter and a\nAnd a throughout the legal defense rules the league has been favoring rule changes that open up the game that allow for Boleyn player movements\nAnd that ... you know a spike the the scoring that's what's been happening in this latest round of changes in including the ban on on grabbing an impeding progress and everything else I think has led to another spike in scoring in the early part of the season but\nWhat often happens in the NBA is rules crackdowns things get or or you know officiated tuned to an extreme early on and then the players adjust the referees back off a little bit and things start you know settled into some sort of a\nMiddle ground um and and who knows\nWe'll see I mean maybe maybe the scoring will stay this level the whole season maybe this is the new reality I'm I suspect it will creep back a little bit of defense is figure out other ways to uh to slow up their opponents\nHoward there is complete dysfunction in Washington look the names are good you got Bradley billion John Wall kill you bring into port is making a ton of money Markey more is there one in what six right now what's happening in Washington how deep is the dysfunction in they gonna blow this up anytime soon\n[noise] it's been almost an annual question for them um and\nYou know every year that question takes on I think increased urgency\nAnd you're right on paper look to all stars in ... one of the best backwards need to be a ... a really good player great three point shooter and he's big use long you can defend multiple positions Kelly Hoover is made some strides Markey Morse is a good player\nUm for whatever reason and again it goes back to what I was saying earlier about the rockets in chemistry\nSometimes guys just don't mix well you know sometimes it's not about the talents it's it's about whether or not they know how to play together and want to play together um\n... it's it's a strange thing and sometimes it's hard to put a finger on but the the and the chemistry there's always been a little bit goofy the wall built dynamic has always been I think a little bit tense I don't think they dislike each other I just don't think that they necessarily always loved playing together and they've kind of set it at times to um there was also the wall versus court taught issue that was\nAffecting the last couple of years so they trade are taught and they bring into white Howard who hasn't even been a factor for them yet because of injury as part of the early season struggles right now is that you know they got rid of their starting center and and the guy that they got to replace him Dwight Howard hasn't even been healthy\nSo you know maybe they need a little bit of time to straighten things out but look the chemistry there's always been kind of off\nAnd you know yeah eventually at some point you got to think that major changes are coming whether that's\nPeople getting fired or whether that's blowing up the roster of breaking up that back court and just trying something new because if you keep you know if it every year is like is this the breakthrough year and instead you're fourth fifth sixth seed and at first round out at some point you got to try something new\nChatting with our back senior MBA writer for police report here on going deep bench horsemen NBC Sports radio you take out the Marta rose then you add in quiet Leonard and you have a seven and one Toronto Raptors team you're buying into this team is the best in east\nYou know there was a lot of folks are around the league who before the season began sought Toronto should be the best team in the east and it came with some ... of course which was as to why Leonard still the same guy who wasn't MVP candidate just two seasons ago um you know we didn't see much last year with that that injury\nAnd you know it'd be physically right as he mentally engaged does he really want to be in trial was going to give them their all\nAnd so those are the questions coming in and those are the things that for some of us you know kind of\nI've been for me I was cautious about it I I didn't want to put too much stock in what's wrong could be at their bet you'd you'd think they could be phenomenal and of course that are quite hundreds of much better players and the heroes and which has noticed respected heroes and they're just different different levels um and Danny green was an underrated\nPickup in that trade and so defensively you knew that could be dominant but it was all again based on his co I let her right physically entity fully engaged mentally and emotionally in this team\nWell the early ... the answer to that question isn't bad ugly yes and they've gotten off to a great start and if this is you know if the if co why is as healthy and fully engaged\nYeah this was a really dangerous group and they've got that nice deep bench that that you know had been a kind of come together over the last couple of years they could be the best team in the east Boston still has the best talent one through eight one through nine\nAnd the Celtics have stumbled a little bit in the early going here it looks like they're starting to find their stride but the the Celtics have so much firepower\n... I still think they emerge as the best team in the east but Toronto absolutely has a shot at it\nCleveland Cavaliers have a whole at head coach Tyrone Lou ease fired after six games ironically they go out and when the one game without him a tyrant loose scapegoat it and who's the best fit to take that job\n[laughter] [noise] yeah he was absolutely scapegoat it and look this is another indication of just how dysfunctional that franchise is liberals presents the last four years masks the fact the Cavaliers are one of the most dysfunctional franchises in the NBA Dan Gilbert as owner has never given a GMO second contract so he's always replacing as GM\nHe's gone through as many coaches as as any uh owner and the last you know\nTen years or whatever um\nAnd this was this was too soon to pull the plug are by far or they convince themselves and the off season that by signing\nResigning Kevin Love to max deal and bringing back the same core and not blowing it up not tanking says that they were somehow going to remain relevant and still be in the U.S for the playoffs like that was their message\nAnd I think they bought the ... their own hype I think Dan Gilbert bought his own hype that they could still be good because he's always wanted to stick it to the broad and show that he doesn't need him which is what happened in twenty channels you know same same attitude now [noise]\nUm it was unrealistic to think they were going to be very good and Kevin ... been hurt besides so yes Toronto there was absolutely the victim of I think unrealistic expectations and I'm at a roster that's just not really built to win and that should have been blown up and and probably still will be blown up at some point\nA word that leaves them who knows uh Larry Drew was elevated to what the team called interim head coach Dru anything no I'm not [laughter] not in the team right\nYeah give it give me the contract that that indicates that and so now they're in a dispute with the guy that they want to be their interim head coach I mean this is just that this is not the way a good or a girl gonna station runs itself\nUnbelievable that somebody ... you know LeBron the bottom has fallen out our good friend Howard back senior NBA writer for bleach report always is a great job Howard always appreciate you taking the time to join us my friend take care\nAlways opposed to Dan thanks for having me\nAlways great stuff from Howard back about that do we believe in the Milwaukee Bucks the only undefeated team left in the NBA what's up with Washington hand\nAre the Toronto Raptors is quite

our\nNumber three the college football playoff rankings we want our house real shoppers per se and really if there's any sort of controversy coming off of this it will take care of itself and we'll take care of itself very quickly by the way that's because just\nFor those out there who think LSU is over ranked number three in that or Notre Dame undefeated at number four should be a number three now she was one last should be number four\nThat's fine but unless you is home this weekend a death valley facing Alabama and that was you is a fourteen point under dog at home that doesn't happen often where LSU a tiger stadium is eight to touch down the underdog and frankly I think that's the proper spread\nThink Alabama is at least two touchdowns better than LSU\nIn every facet of the game except I Would say secondary play Alabama's just flat out better than LSU about being a secondary banged up they've lost a you know digs broke his foot he's out the rest of the year that was used got a lot of good players the secondary a lot of NFL talent greedy Williams will be a high draft pick\nThat the edge that they have put a secondary are just going to win the game what do you think about the Heisman Trophy front runner in to our faces Ellis used Joe boroughs used up more than a game manager and frankly he's a fairly shaky gay manager so Alabama LSU that's going to sell itself\nBut I Want to get insurance to some scenarios here let's have some fun with this west\nBecause it's all preliminary obviously but there's a lot of big match ups I mean Notre Dame and we all believe is going to run the table but they kind of come up against a tough opponent this weekend they have to go to northwestern northwest beaten Michigan State northwestern was beaten Wisconsin northwestern was\nThree points away from beating Michigan\nNot an easy place to play going up there to Evansville, Indiana northwestern played well they're Notre Dame\nIs kind of to a point I think play down to opponents at times I think that Notre Dame could have its hands full with a pretty decent northwestern team this week and now that's not a gimme when they're I'm not ready to just pencil Notre Dame and nine to know that could be an interesting one Sean\nI think it will be definitely a an especially when you go to Evanston it's going to be a tough place to play although Akron I don't know how they did for three this year they beat northwestern at Northwestern so which northwestern team is going to show up I think the good one Notre Dame is going to be in for a fight there\nNo question about that going to be that that's going to be an interesting fight Michigan Penn State you know what Penn State as not being good this year Penn State's been under achiever this year I think you could directly point a finger at a\nAt a at Franklin for that one I I think there's got to be somewhat your questions if he is a big game coach he can recruit\nHe can get the players to show up and happy valley\nBut is he getting the most out of the guys in really is he a good enough play color for Penn State to take that next step to as he put it elite status he's not sure that\nThey're not not just you know how to not after seven ... mission is on The Revenge door down here I'm going to bitch yeah the coming off of a by Penn State struggle to get the Iowa last week at home yeah I I got Michigan big in this one what about you\nI I agree with you but here's the worry that I have and this is going to be the big question for me different Sean Gary play this weekend I don't think he will but he doesn't play this week and I think he's done for the season\nI I agree I think I don't think it'll hurt Michigan against Penn State per se I ... it didn't hurt them against Michigan State\nI think it will it will hurt them against Ohio State though and and and the teams if they were to go on further than that but yeah a ... that that or does he come back for our state no we're going to come back just for one game that would be done when it\nWell I'm not your highest you come back for the ball game could be a playoff game of so you'll have you know possibly two games to win the playoffs I mean there's a possibility but you're right if you're going to come back you come back against Penn State right I mean this was a a you know a top\nFifteen teen Penn State some people believe can go in there when the game you want all hands on deck Russia and Gary one of the top defensive players he's got to be a sure fire first round pick up central top ten picking the NFL Draft he doesn't show up for the Penn State game I don't think you can count on them but there is some cryptic stuff coming out about that and that's the funny thing\nJim horrible came out pretty much put the onus on Russia and Gary said\nRussia and felt that he couldn't play last week or two weeks ago you know it was kind of interesting the way he put that\nAnd we're Shon Gary's mothers come out and she says reports that you know he's just he doesn't want to play because he's trying to maintain his body obviously for the NFL Draft that's not true he's part of this team some of his teammates have come to his defense but I found Harbaugh statement to be kinda cryptic\nWhere he said it was up to Russia and Gary not the medical staff thinks he's banged up or touched showy still banged up it was that Russia and Gary kind of seemingly made that decision and harbor is not a guy that doesn't speak without thinking as to what he's saying I find that interesting\nYeah but you know yeah I I agree but you know what Don brown the defense according to the mission come over and to figure out a way to play without showing Gary has floats past few weeks so I I don't think\nIt will hurt Michigan against the Penn State is weak part other\nBig match if there's a lot of mayors some really interesting matchups it's a fun weekend the college football to say the least again Alabama LSU Notre Dame at Northwestern Michigan home for a Penn State's a big one obviously who never thought that this game would be such a big game\nDid you ever in your right mind think okay\nThat Georgia Kentucky at kroger's field\nCould potentially be for the FCC east title and a chance to play Alabama in Atlanta in the S. E. C. championship game who the heck ever thought Georgia Kentucky\nCould be that match up to determine that Sean that's absolutely insane as much as as as I've enjoyed Kentucky this year and I'm sure do and I picked Kentucky or you know going deep dirty dozen picks on friday shows\nReality is I think Kentucky loses picky right they they're all they're offensive that terrible offensively it's Benny Snell and a bunch of guys they're a heck of a defensive team\nThey got a great special teams play last week to steal a win against Missouri but you shouldn't have to steal or will they win against Missouri if you're a top ten team\nAnd I just think this is what it all like the day of reckoning shows up this weekend I think Georgia walks into Lexington, Kentucky and absolutely roles Kentucky and his dream season that they've had it's been a great run and Mike stoop should be up for a you know college coach of the year I think the run ins right here so I Can't see them being competitive against George I really\nLike Jake from plays the the way he played last week yeah there's no chance for Kentucky and in this one but\nI don't know they seem to have a rabbit for this year I shouldn't have one last week he gets Missouri\nAnd they get that ... or turn touchdown and they win the final seconds so you never know you don't you know it's one of those years for Kentucky did everything is the ball's bouncing the right way so I could see them squeaking out a win but George has the most talent in the SEC other than Alabama so it's going to be tough for them to win this one\nWhy you

much\nBetter is what I'm saying they're not Kansas City they're not the patriots you know they're not ... they're not going to win the or the you know they're not going to win the the the AFC they're not going to be the super bowl rep out there see bought in terms of winning their own division\nIt strengthens him a little bit in a in a wide open division I mean look there their game up right now in the Tennessee the other two games up on the Tennessee Titans there\nYou know what to a game to game the two games up on Jacksonville in Indianapolis their game and a half about Tennessee wind up making a move like this get themselves a little bit more offensive firepower at least you don't want you got into a nasty south and I think this move house this move helps them to sell them for the ... much doesn't help much\nJobs too many passes we mentioned that\nAlways has but he was productive player though is to have it in a senior this year yeah but you know what it is not the type of year that uh you know\nForget had some huge years in Denver you did\nYou know he's on pace for like nine hundred yards eight hundred yards not like he's having a big season and obviously a Thirty Years' old seems to be an old thirty but we forget that five year stretch for dumb areas Thomas fourteen hundred yards fourteen hundred yards sixteen hundred yards Thirteen hundred yards eleven hundred yards\nAnd that was a hell of a stretch from two thousand twelve to two thousand and sixteen he was unbelievable ten touchdowns fourteen touchdowns eleven touch downs\nYou know the guy put up some big numbers he did he's not the same player he's clearly on the down stroke of his career\nBut the Mary's towns will tell you well look I don't think he hurts will follow her to go wherever they were going to go to compare to for well for her to marry as Thomas I think in terms of not having to give up a lot like I'm already Cooper bringing back a first round pick from Dallas\nBut I think in terms of just giving up a fourth round picking and swapping seventh round pegs it's among the Houston Texans had to make it gets a little risk potentially higher reward pick up makes sense\nCan't kill for that by Packers don't get it there half game what had one getting out in a very tight NFC North time a governor you train them two days after that boat had play\nMaybe what that does that justify that whisper coming out saying that time of garbage just despite the coaching staff after being taken out the series before and getting into a verbal altercation with coaches on the sideline maybe this kind of gives us that uh you know credence that that actually occurred\nThat he took it out from the end zone just because you want to uh you know pay the coaches back two days later he's gone\nThey also trade safety ha ha Clinton picks no one's taking more snaps and then him since he came into little league in two thousand and fourteenth for that team\nAnd I just you know I don't understand the two teams in the NFC North them in the Detroit Lions the lines are right in the thick of that race as well for that conference or says you for that division and they treat golden tape their most productive wide receiver no idea what the Packers no idea what the lines are doing to me those are some surprising move Sean did not understand I think those two teams losers\n[noise] yeah I don't know about the Packers being a loser but they had to get rid of time Montgomery it wasn't a great situation that he was in after all the controversy that he caused so\nOn Sunday so they had a dumped him for just a seventh round picking twenty twenty I mean [laughter] basically stumped them for nothing um Hochul index [noise] yeah I mean these are\nProductive player he pick three steps exist year he's got one more than anybody that stuff yeah but listen to their second there has been a problem he's probably the most solid plan that secondary now you get rid of or\nI guess Mike bitten a could play with them I don't know well let's see how that works at a lot about what they think of them\nYeah no you're right about that absolutely first round but he's only twenty five twenty five years old so you know he's been there forever yeah\nIncredible Detroit Lions both of us agree no idea what they were doing they were your personal foul agree hundred percent they're the biggest losers\nFat this NFL trade deadline getting rid of gold and pay when they're still in the thick of that race in that NFC North alright the player of the night and the go to the night and we don't mean greatest of all

rankings\nWhich will cause so much of a stir in the college football world we'll all get settled the\nNext week\nLeaves rankings are going to change it is a process you can't overreact to the first rankings that get released which we saw here on Tuesday evening but you can sort of project\nAnd think about where the committee goes from here\nIt's got to work here it's overtime NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio dot com and to join the conversation at eight five five three two three four NBC\nEight five five three two three four six to do it hit me up on Twitter at Scott's on air as she ... she she passed away in a A R here is your college football playoff rankings for the first week\nOf the playoff rankings week ten in college football we one of the college football playoff rankings Alabama is number one no surprise Clemson is number two no surprise there here's where the first shakeup comes in\nOne last LSU is number three a head of undefeated Notre Dame which is number four now before you say how is that possible keep in mind it's going to change next week Alabama plays LSU on Saturday So it doesn't matter\nWhere LSU is ranked right now but if you want to project forward if you want to just use this as kind of a way to figure out what the committee feels about LSU well here's what they feel about LSU that they're good team\nThe committee chairman Rob ... soon as the athletic director and Oregon he said quote was use resume\nTheir six wins against teams over five hundred quality wins against the Georgia and Mississippi State and just the close last a Florida we're impressed overall their body of work was clock and that's what the committee's tell them you know\nThe media is telling you that the overall body of work for LSU a stronger than the overall body of work for Notre Dame and I would tend to agree\nThere's nothing wrong in saying that keep in mind that of Notre Dame finish their season undefeated they are one thousand percent in the college football playoff\nOnly quality when they have on their schedule right now is the first game of the season against Michigan\nNow Virginia Tech can help their case out if that winds up going to the ACC Championship game short they can help\nNotre Dame is resume and then all of a window on the road here at Northwestern would be good for Notre Dame a win against Syracuse at Yankee Stadium is going to be good\nFor Notre Dame but right now their schedule is weak because when you look at a schedule it normally is really really tough\nTeams like Stanford and even USC at the end of the year Florida State coming up they're having bad years\nSo their schedule is not going to look as dominant as it would in a normal season meanwhile we mentioned LSU with the close lost the Florida but big wins against Mississippi State the best when probably in the country the game against Georgia\nAnd win against all burn when Auburn was a top ranked team in a win against Miami and recording when Miami was considered to be a top ranked team [noise]\nI think I was you had the talent you pass the test but it doesn't matter\nBecause with a loss to Alabama\nOn Saturday which is what is expected I don't think I'm speaking out of turn here\nBy saying Alabama should win that football game\nYou gotta realize Alabama is a fifth keen point rude favorites\nA Fifteen point favorite at\nThat means if this game were played at Tuscaloosa, Alabama would be a team points favored\nTwenty one points they'd be Twenty one point favorites\nOver the number three team in the country\nThat's how much respect Alabama gets they are far and away the best team in college football head and shoulders above everyone else\nNow if LSU can pull the upset that's where things get really interesting\nBecause then everything gets flipped upside down\nLSU that has the inside track\nTo represent the FCC west and go to the SEC title game\nAlabama would still in many people's eyes be the best team in college football they would just have that tough loss\nLike let's say they're losing a close game to LSU Alabama's gonna fall down in the rankings\nBut I bet you they still have a case to get into the college football playoff\nAnd you might have a situation like we saw last year\nWhere Alabama doesn't play in the FCC championship game\nYet goes to the college football playoff improves the committee right by blowing everyone out of the water and winning the national championship\nThe national championship you know obviously they needed to attend to buy low to save them in the second half of that game but still\nMighty impressive this season\nIf they should lose to LSU\nIf they should lose the LSU\nI think they still have a good chance to make the cultural playoff the\nOnly scenario\nAnd I tell you right now\nThis is the only scenario\nThat Alabama does not get into the college football playoff\nIs if they lose\nAnd LSU wins out\nAnd then Clemson wins out\nAnd Notre Dame winds up\nOr ... and then uh either Michigan or Oklahoma winds up\nBecause then you're in college football playoff is going to be an undefeated Clemson team and undefeated Notre Dame team a one last LSU SEC champion\nAnd they won last Michigan Big Ten champion\nAnd Alabama's going to be on the outside looking in at number five\nThat's the only way they don't get into the college football playoff\nBecause Michigan would have an argument there only last it'd be the Notre Dame\nAnd they would have wins or Penn State and Ohio State and whoever comes out of the west you know Wisconsin probably\nAnd for the Texans its ... year the Andrea Adkins is the number one but after losing will fuller I think it wasn't important move for them to make to bring in another big time wide receiver and now that team is ready\nTo win that division and there will be will be the best team right now in the AFC South\nMontgomery leaves the Packers and goes to the ravens in I guess there in Rogers was really upset that he took the ball on a Sunday\n[laughter] ah I don't mean to laugh but yeah a guy takes\nThe bar to the end zone doesn't get the chance to win the game\nHe's out of town [laughter] ah yeah well he's going to be a free agent at the end of the year anyway and Louis they got to pick forum and Montgomery now goes and can fill a void in the backfield there for the Baltimore Ravens but\nAnd even as a slot wide receiver but that's that's that's tough the less surprising when I think was the Packers sending hot Clinton decks the Redskins\nSo Redskins look like they want to win this energy east they show up their defensive secondary and the Packers acquire some picks to maybe benefit themselves\nOr next year and looking at the future a little bit but there are still competing this year but they gave up two pieces they were willing to part with in order to get some picks to build for\nThe future mother moved to talk about the rams get better on defense it's hard to imagine the best team in the NFL gets a little better Dante Fowler who's been a disappointment for the jaguars you know goes to the rams and now the four players\nOn that defensive line\nAll former first round picks\nWho was the thirteenth picking twenty four team\nWho is the fourteenth pick in twenty twelve\nAnd Dominic ensue\nWho was the second overall picking twenty ten\nAnd Fowler who is the third overall pick in twenty Fifteen\nFirst picks on\nWaiting Philips has just licking his chops can't wait to see what these guys do on the field together and and there'll be tested\nTrust me they will good test coming up this weekend to see I think it's our can slide in quickly because there's not much to learn there for a pass Russia right they're just going to say go in there and watch the ball and go ... Drew Brees\nMaybe doesn't play a full game but that's there's not much to learn in there\nFor for\nLet's hear from some general managers shall we talk about John Elway\nTalking about are traded away training away dumb areas Thomas\nWe were not hell bent on bond trading to marry a survivor was there that we felt that I was there we felt that it can help us that way as far as the draft next year and and that we thought that within your guys behind them that we could make up for the for the space that uh you know he would do with a lady when so when we got the value that we thought was fair\nNow here's what I Want to know\nThe Broncos ... students\nIn Denver on Sunday\nDoes dumb areas Thomas fly\nTo Houston\nAnd then back to Denver for the game\nDoes he get because let's say if let's say let's say you didn't leave on\nDoes he fly to Denver does he fly to Houston on Wednesday and then fly to Denver on friday\nThere was a way I'm playing the Texans the next game\nI thought about it yeah I mean obviously um but you know I think that ultimately where to look past that and and uh you know thought that it wouldn't affect our game and affect the outcome of the game that we felt that we can make up ... percent of the Texas though could you imagine if he scored a touchdown this weekend\nWouldn't that be something\nAnd few fantasy players out there the name that you want to take a look at right now\nIs Cortland Sutton\nCortland Sutton is going to be the biggest winner\nFrom this dumb areas Thomas trade\nAnd I'm telling you this rookie now he's going to be one of the top additions on the waiver wire Elway on the rock\nYou know we felt that uh you know doesn't give them a chance to get out there play more than and become a bigger part of it because we think he's ready to go and have always play well up to this point in time so\nHopefully this big celebrations maturity\nMhm mhm but it'll it's already majority for sure let's go to the Philadelphia Eagles to acquire a pretty good wide receiver in their own right and golden tape and here was Howard Rosen\nWe traded today for golden pay interest charge lines were really excited to bring in the Philly fits well we do our fence silly to totally do from a character perspective and um can't wait to get 'em in here and for everyone and telling me to see that what we're getting\nMen are getting him into the by week\nCertainly helps I mean this isn't a situation where we're getting a guy on Tuesday and he's got to come in and play on Sunday and we have a little bit of time to get them up to speed and um during the season the playbook gets a little smaller because it's all um game plan specific signing up to\nHow about a tape being afraid that the in the year\nThat part of our analysis and certainly when you're looking at it you have to balance the fact that he's going to be a free agent we have a bunch of free agents here we did all that research and background onto the ramifications of which way they can go we're comfortable with it at the end of the day\nVery comfortable now what does he bring to your audience\nHid inside out versatility and same with Nelly his inside out versatility Palestine lined up inside and out in\nA coaches have a game plan for all those guys friendly are tight end and the mental field and the damage they can do a and we're going to get some guys back too so we want to be multiple off and we want to be a handful for defense coordinators and and there's this guy is a heck of a fire and uh I think our fans and we really excited to see him and he was very\nYeah he is an exciting player and he will provide a another weapon now for Carson wins and that eagles often\nI kind of like the eagles the way they look now\nYou know kind of disappointed to see 'em what has become\nOf notes and Aguilar\nRight you know I'm trying to think of a guy who had such promise right he was\nReally a really good year last year on break out here but\nIt's just

in line with\nThe way I thought this season was going to go for them and and my reason being is last year\nThe Houston Rockets made it a point okay they\nWanted to be the number one seed in the western conference it was so important to them that they gained home court advantage\nIn the western conference playoffs\nThey wanted to have that series with Golden State in their home court for game seven and they did and they lost now yeah there were injuries of course Chris Paul and whatnot but still\nI think\nSeeing what happened last year\nAfter they did everything they could\nTo get that number one seed\nOnly to see it not matter\nI think that's disheartening\nAnd I think that they go into this season\nThinking back to what happened last year\nMaybe conceding\nThat doesn't matter where they finish\nThat they know they're going to be\nA top three seed top four at the very worst\nIf they take it easy\nThey don't necessarily need to go a hundred and ten percent you don't have to go all out you don't have to sell out to win sixty five games this year just make sure that you are on top of the western conference and they get into the postseason healthy\nBut I think that's what they're focusing on\nRight now they're just not playing with the same intensity that they played with last year and I think a lot of it has to do with the way the last year finished for them\nBecause last year they played with such an intensity from the start of the season to the end of the regular season\nThey can be the number one seed and still lose\nThere was Mike then Tony\nClassroom replied

maybe a little bit surprised but I think\nListen I I think it's close I think they look at the fact that they beat in Georgia they beat Mississippi State they've just beat those are quality wins more and more ... more quality wins the Notre Dame to this point and it's like I\nDon't I just don't know how much they say this subliminally but\nI say some of it as hey look you know they play Alabama this week and it's close\nIt really is a moot point because LSU\nWhoa you know if they lose there'll be out of it so I think you can make a strong case in fact we'll get into it um I I wouldn't have

with it in you know it's not one of those things just sit there and worry about because you you just got to take care of business in the LSU Alabama game I think\nSays just kind of sets up to where look that game's going to be decided and Notre Dame moves up to three if they're able to beat northwestern and that is not a given because there's northwestern team is good and I think\nWe you know we've talked about this a couple of times with Notre Dame this may be the toughest challenge for Notre Dame the rest of the year depending upon what type of shape clay health in his in at the end of the year USC and how necessary that game is to\nMaybe save his hide 'em that that's you know but to me this noted this may be a difficult game I think Notre Dame or when it but it'll be a challenge I expect Notre Dame to be three next week 'cause I expect unless you\nHave to go down to Alabama but I think that\nThat they just looked at the resume here's what I I look at though if Notre Dame and LSU played who would win in my opinion Notre Dame would win maybe they look at it and say it's a little ... it's in I think it's close but I think Notre Dame would win I think they looked at the resume and that's why they put LSU three Notre Dame\nThe yeah I think so right now and and look things are going to play themselves out Alabama plays LSU this weekend Notre Dame you mentioned that game against northwestern on the road\nAt Michigan pleased against Penn State you also have Georgia against Kentucky so a lot of games this weekend will determine the way the ranking shake up next week when they're released next Tuesday now want to ask you a question about a potential scenario\nWhat does the committee do with Alabama if\nLSU beat them this week how far does Alabama's then Trump let's say they lose a close game against LSU and no game in death valley is a gimme so let's say Alabama falls it'll be a road loss\nAgainst a number three ranked team in one of the toughest environments and all of college football\nHow far down that Alabama full\nWell and we need to make some more sanctions now remember it's a close game right\nYes I'm saying the quote unquote lost that they lose close game\nI think that uh I think they could drop the four I think that's where they would they they think they would stay in the playoffs right now it would depend upon how impressive Michigan is in their win against Penn State assuming they when\nGeorge's win against Kentucky assuming they when can we agree that they would not drop further than five acres maybe exactly exactly I listen no I I think Alabama is still in the position because\nOf how they look vi tests however you want to call it their football\nI'm a ... you know look on film I I you know much like last year I Can't see them falling out of the top for now whether it's you know this week or not I you know in the next ... rankings I don't know but I still think that they would end up uh because remember you know we forget this we tend to look at it\nBut they would just have one loss so will everyone else was em Clemson now I you know what would be interesting as would they put Clemson at one analysis you too would they put ... LSU one over ... I mean I think they probably put Clemson up and then put LSU to than Notre Dame up to three if they win but\nYou know then you know we can answer that question but we have to throw in what happens in these other games you know that's what makes this week so great because it's not just Alabama LSU\nOr is Notre Dame going to be northwestern ... makes you couldn't going to be Penn State what good so what happens if north western beat to Notre Dame club or did they all live within the guess why Alabama might drop the two evils\nYeah that might be Glenn Close male is I mean you know who knows you know if Notre Dame loses then it'll be it'll be it'll be Alabama clubs and LSU in Oklahoma but yet I mean it's an allergy to Alabama in Oklahoma I Know I and I think you know hockey right on the outside looking at you will hockey\nWould make a tremendous jump Georgia would make a job I could see Georgia jumping in there with one loss on the road but you probably have the comparison of\nAlabama's loss at LSU Georgia's lawsuit LSU and look and see maybe that might factor in\nWho might um you know or they might say well you know Georgia's beat in Florida or they just beat Kentucky and you know assuming that happens they might have George ahead of Alabama but what would that you know I mean that we would see how that would play out\nUm now that would be interesting because in that case if Georgia where to win out than who wins the conference championship game if it's George Janelle issue then then that becomes an issue that it's very possible that dislike last year out the winner\nOf the S. E. C. championship game gets in an Alabama and you know but again remember there was an opening last year\nIs they're going to be an opening this year but we don't know we're discussing a myriad of possibilities we'd probably make people's heads you know we don't know what's gonna happen so sure Notre Dame is in if they win and I\nThink a a a one last Michigan Big Ten champion is in a one last big twelve champion Oklahoma those teams are in over ... all one loss Alabama that doesn't even make the conference championship game but\nAnd that's where it becomes you've got the\nProblems inside that led do okay you know we're not going to deal with this we're going to move on from the head coach and we're going to move on from the coordinator\nAnd ... will move up call placed Gregg Williams will be the coordinator and\nAnd also we go and we're going to figure this out and we're going to try to see if we can't get a spark and then obviously they're going to hire a coach and the off season and like they did\nAs an early a jump on getting a look at general manager candidates Chrissie Hi John\nDorsey in the middle of the season last year they're not going to be able to hire their head coach to the end of the year but that can get their ducks in a row and figure it out\nBut I think this is just a case of they weren't having success on the field Scott and then it became a little bit of contentious of you know power struggle even though the head coach always has the power of the coordinator there's a little bit back fighting and that to the owner into the general manager said hey\nWe don't want this dysfunction we're trying to be the new Brown's we've got a new quarterback that's you know struggling right now to learn and get things going and then now he's in the middle of the head coach and the coordinator of they went\nNo no no we're we're done with that work cleaning this side of it up we're going to get new voices to speak on that side of the ball we're going forward and we're going to see where we are it's it's up in some ways the same old Brown's but they're trying not to be the same old browns and I think this is a positive move to clean out\nThe contention by cleaning up all parties involved\nThere was a lot of talk this week and I laugh at it because I I just think it's funny that people automatically assume\nHey let's get the quarterbacks college coach just that'll be the right fit\nAnd I took some heat on Twitter because I said look as much as I respect Lincoln Riley the guy hadn't spent the minutes in the NFL and I don't think he would be a good choice to lead an NFL program I think you need to have\nAn understanding of what it's like the coach millionaire athletes as opposed to college kids need to know what that room is like\nWith other coaches who spent their entire careers in the NFL as opposed to at the college level of course the media has to ask Lincoln Riley his thoughts and he said you know I'm not no age to go in the NFL but you can't shut the door right now I thought it was a very politically correct answer from Lincoln rally but\nIn your view after two seasons of coaching it Oklahoma wouldn't she qualify to take the jump to the next level and just your overall thoughts on coaching at either level\nI think he would qualify would he be the best fit though is always the thing that I always look at and in my coaching shirt to work um [noise] here's the thing about\nThe NFL game and the real key of success and everyone's looking at you know what Sean McVeigh still and then people that are great quarterback teachers and had innovative authentic Sean has been around the NFL botch but let me just say\nAll thirty two NFL teams had certain staff members coaches went in to Oklahoma this off season to study what they were doing offensively he's that well respected I think a lot of people see him as a potentially another Sean McVeigh\nYour point my point is that look if I if someone wants to hire them is not as important there I think that's a slam dunk I just don't think he's ready right now the twelve or a franchise of the head football well he's\nThere's there's no chance that he would leave for an often coordinator job but he's got a job at Oklahoma there's a debate I mean I don't think he believed to go to Cleveland\nBecause I think you know he looks at Oklahoma job as a great job and it would have to be the right head coaching job in the NFL and I think a lot of people thought that I I don't think there's any there's much doubt\nBeing successful as an NFL head coach is it the right fit I don't know obviously the tied to Baker make deal I can tell you that you know that's what they need\nIn ... in Brooklyn I'm In Cleveland to I think get their off at school and they need to get a ... guy not as a coordinator I mean I think you need to get the right ... guy is your head coach at great length because you can go get a really good defensive coaches a head coach and he hired a bright young ... coordinator\nIf he's really that good in two years somebody's going to lock him up as it had got children I think that Lincoln Riley would be a really good fit\nI'm I Do think that there's some other guys that are you know are are good fits I mean I think if you're like everyone's looking for the next on McVeigh so to me\nYou know ... in my mind it could be a Lincoln Riley\nBut it could is easily be a John ... agrees who's in is into the NFL up there on ... Taylor who is with the rams as a quarterback coach Shane Roadrunner who's with the rams are ... floor is what the titans guys like that\nThat I think have him and to what the what the chiefs are having to be near me whatever yeah yeah no I think I think he's good I think he needs a little bit more season I think my cats go would be a that the enemy's a good guy that's working under Andy but but I I\nTo me I think you know cast because maybe the the bright not next you know Sean make gay type I think it's fair to say to put them all and that lump them in that but I I can tell you this Lincoln Riley is on the shortlist\nOf NFL people so whether he's ready or not he will have an opportunity to jump and be a head coach\nAnd I think you'll have it this year if he wants it\nDoes he want it does he want to take the right opportunity I think you'll listen I I think that they absolutely would listen but I think he knows he needs to get in the right situation to where and you know and just because Baker may feel they're I think you would probably look at the brown situation and say\nDo I want to get into that I don't know um those are all interesting questions but I Do think he has the pedigree to be the quarterback or a sport that most people are looking for [noise] does he have the experience in the NFL no but but some of those things I think organizations feel like they can help them with\nThey're looking for the guy that again they're getting into Oklahoma to look at how this all fence is being run and they're looking at what but Sean McVeigh is done with the rams and what Jerry golf and turning things around and that's what everybody wants Scott so\nThat's what's drawing everyone fair unfair right or wrong so I think he's on the shortlist um for a lot of people will have some openings we've got one in Cleveland\nThink we're going to have one in Denver I think we're going to have one in Tampa\nAnd that and obviously they're going to be potentially a few more I think he's going to be on people shortlist they're going to at least want to talk to\nLook forward to breaking down all the college football playoff stuff each and every week here on the program and of course folks you got to download our podcasts rushed the field but it's a must listen to each and every week into impress\nAbsolutely must listen the love college football folks you're going to allow that we really get after it and it's so much fun now one day weekend of college football uh action and we've got the first of rankings out but we got a lot to get into the no ... it's a great lesson talked in extra crust thank you but I\nLove talking football with Chris Landry that guy is absolutely locked\nIn got a lot of connections in the industry that a lot of consulting work for a bunch of NFL teams in college football programs as well get hit me up on Twitter at Scott's on their S.

there that we felt that I was there we felt that it can help us that way as far as the draft next year and and that we thought the with the guys behind them that we could make up for the for the space that uh you know he would he would leave and so when we got the value that we felt was fair\nNow here's what I Want to know\nThe Broncos ... students\nIn Denver on Sunday\nDoes dumb areas Thomas fly\nTo Houston\nAnd then back to Denver for the game\nDoes he get because let's say if let's say let's say you didn't leave on\nDizzy fly to Denver does he fly to Houston on Wednesday and then fly to Denver on friday\nThere was a way I'm playing the Texans the next game\nBut I thought about it yeah I mean obviously um but you know I think the whole summit lay where to look past that and and uh you know thought that uh it wouldn't affect our game and affect the outcome of the game that we felt that we can make up moving send him to Texas though could you imagine if he scored a touchdown this weekend\nWouldn't that be something\nAnd for your fantasy players out there the name that you want to take a look at right now\nIs Courtland ...\nPortland Sutton is going to be the biggest winner\nFrom this dumb areas Thomas trade\nAnd I'm telling you this rookie now is going to be one of the top additions on the waiver wire Elway on the rock\nYou know we thought that uh you know just to give them a chance to get out there playing more and become a bigger part of it because we think he's ready to go and they always play well at this point are so\nAfraid this accelerate his

today for Golden Gate and just short lines were really excited to bring him to Philly they totally do offensively to totally do from a character perspective and um I Can't wait to get 'em in here and for everyone until they see that what we're getting\nMan they're getting him in order by week\nCertainly helps I mean this is in a situation where we are getting the guy on Tuesday and he's got to come in and play on Sunday and we have a little bit of time to get them up to speed and um during the season the playbook gets a little smaller because it's all um game plan specific signing up into\nHow about a tape being a free agent in the year\nYet as part of our houses are certainly um when you're looking at it you have to balance the fact that he's going to be a free agent we have a bunch of free agents here we did all that research and background onto the ramifications of which way they can go we're comfortable with it at the end of the day\nFrom very comfortable now what does he bring to your audience\nHid inside out versatility um salmon Nelly his inside out for ... inside and out in a coaches have a game plan for all those guys certainly are tight end and the mental field and damage they can do now and we're going to get some guys back too so we want to be multiple off and we want to be a handful for defense coordinators and and there's this guy is a heck of\nA fire and uh I think our fans and we're really excited to see him and he goes green\nYeah he is an exciting player and he will provide a another weapon now for Carson wins and that eagles often\nI kind

how it in the ad council\n[noise]\n\n\nEvery I just want to go\n\nTo the point\nOut that the other filtration says I'm actually looking like a train line the amount of deals occurring today by the forefront of eastern time deadline I must tell you a pretty robots pretty surprising usually the NFL trade deadline is ho hum yawn away not\nThe most interesting nor fun just kind of comes and goes and not a lot of teams doing much but this year it's a little bit different than I have to be honest I think it's a little strange the moves that some of these teams have made now you can look at every deal from both sides obviously and\nYou can then decide who truly got the best of a deal and wide trade was made let's start out with well the NFC North\nBecause two of the four teams in the NFC North we're very active at the trade deadline and the NFC North by the way it's separated by one game Chicago Bears Minnesota Vikings both for three\nGreen Bay Packers three three and one Detroit Lions are three and four for number one to number four there is a separation of one game\nYet both the Green Bay Packers and the Detroit Lions were sellers at the trade deadline today\nGreen Bay deals not one but two starters\nOut\nMontgomery two days after taking that kick up out of the end zone and some believe it was at a spike because he was taken out of the game the series before and had a\nVerbal altercation with the coaching staff because of it and some believe he took that kicked out just despite the coaching staff he then of course proceeded to fumble it that way rams recover it the rest is history Packers lose that game by two points so time on ... out the window\nAnd also how how Clinton decks the safety out the window he adds to the NFC East and the first place Washington Redskins fray draft pick\nSo here's the way to look at this\nFor Green Bay in two days to trade time on guard me a guy that by the way let's not forget a couple of years ago when that team was absolutely just desperate for a running back right absolutely desperate\nHe's the one that they move that's why he was wearing that number eighty eight Jersey right as always kind of strange to see him wearing that number eight eight Jersey but time a ... who is in his fourth\nStepped in three years ago at running back are really two and a half years ago and got the job done news in the city and he was a productive plan is not a great player he's a productive player\nAfter a storied career at Stanford or lack of a player at Stanford really was he was the wide receiver kind of a Jack of all trades is great on special teams one of those types of players ends up going into third round\nBut for them to deal a player who is pretty productive in Montgomery for a seventh round draft pick in twenty twenty\nDoesn't lead you to believe that maybe the front office believes that time of Germany in fact did run that kick out of the end zone more so out of spiked and try to play hero for as he put it I wasn't sure how close I was the goal line and I kind of thought I was in between so I thought I had to run it out\nBy then moving time a government so quickly\nDoesn't it tell you that the front office actually believed\nThe rumblings rumblings daddy disgruntled time uh gr MRI pretty much said to heck with it screw the coaching staff I'm going to do what I Want to do at a spike in a close game against the LA ramps on the road when that division is being separated by one game\nAt a time of dirt retake spending in the end zone which is what the coaching staff had wanted this time of gum re get traded today to the Baltimore Ravens my answer is probably not how crazy is that\nBy the way he now goes to Baltimore Ravens team that as a serious problem you know that's serious problem is for the Baltimore Ravens\nThey don't know how to run the football right they don't know how to commit to the run as a team that seemingly is allergic to running the football\nYou know Alex Collins in his last five games or you could even go throughout the season look at the Carey totals for Alex college fans have been that productive offensive winds not opening the polls\nBut it's like a very Christian McCaffrey ask seven carries nine carries Eighteen eleven twelve\nNineteen Lebanon eleven so it's not as if John Harbaugh committed to the run so for time a ... this is purgatory right he's going to a team that does either on the football much and so I guess I'm not sure does do move them to remove him to wide receiver I guess maybe the issue\nBut and also trade hot Clinton disc ... what is the message being sent by Green Bay like what are they saying here\nAre they saying that even though we're three three and one\nWe don't believe are really good enough to compete so let's accumulate more draft picks are they just kind of cutting fat just kind of strange for that to happen meanwhile Detroit one game out of the lead of the NFC North dealing one of the most productive players that they have\nThey have traded gold and taped to the Philadelphia Eagles\nPray third round pick\nGolden tape leads that team\nInterceptions he leads that team in yards\nAnd in his career since coming coming over to Detroit from Seattle he's done nothing but produce Ninety nine catches Ninety catches Ninety One catches Ninety two catches on pays for another Ninety catches this year and another\nThousand yard season which would have been his fourth in five years in Detroit\nIs Detroit thrown in the tower they that confident and Kenny Galloway and Marvin Jones in I mean is that what they're looking at is\nWhat they be better served by still having Matt Stafford throw the Golden Gate a guy that he's got a great report with that's what's so surprising to me with these moves the fact is these teams are to appoint throwing in the towel when they're not exactly out of it\nLook I understand the Denver Broncos trading dumb areas time is I mean the Marius Thomas he's not helping the Broncos and the Broncos aren't going anywhere right the Broncos are four games behind the chiefs they're two games behind the chargers in terms of a wild card race yeah mathematically there's still obviously but let's not kid ourselves they're not a good team\nSo John Elway is looking at that saying look we're gonna lose their various times to free agency I don't want to bring it back he's kind of lost a step here and there the hands of never been great if I can get anything for them areas Thomas right now let's move up I'm keeping Emanuel Sanders I'm getting ready to marry as time has and they're out of it there for games out and they have see west\nThis is not a situation like Green Bay or Detroit where they're actually in it\nSo I you know Denver I totally understand that makes perfect sense why they would go out there and moved to Mary's Thomas absolutely it makes sense\nSo I just [noise] you know I'm just I'm just kinda\nIs back they have\nReinstated head football coach DJ ... newest play play started administrative leave painted administrators believe back in August this on the heels back on may twenty ninth of all kinds of Lyman Jordan McNair are suffering heat stroke\nHe passes away on June thirteenth\nJerking is reinstated\nThey're Damon Evans told the team with dark and present today jerk and met the players no other coaches were there before they had to practice their reports are that several players including some starters on the team walked out of that meeting with dark in\nMcNair is family outraged Marty McNair joined make their father said quote I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach and somebody spit in my face\nWow I mean this is incredible the governor of Maryland getting involved as well seems very surprised that this ends up happening\nI have to tell your Sean I Am ... donned\nThe Maryland is bringing back DJ Dirk and now let's get every fact out their dark and it was not present at the ... during that practice where Germany there suffered the heat stroke his\nHand picked strengthen conditioning coach this close friend the number one higher that jerk and brought with him the first guy hired after getting that job after being understaffed or what Ohio State I Believe it was right\nHe\nIs responsible for the people he hires a guy that he brought in was a bully drove the players over the edge and including by the way driving a player into heat stroke and ultimately sadly yes well\nDJ jerking not directly responsible because he wasn't there DJ Dirk in the one that has to fall and the sword because his right hand man his henchmen was directly responsible to a point for the death of one of his players this stunning news that DJ Dirk in his back\nSean how does this guy recruit how does he walk into a potential recruits home sick with the parents and say I have your son's best interest in mind when Jordan McNair is six feet under the ground it makes no sense Sean\nIt makes no sense also considering what has DJ dark and accomplished at the college level as coach very little\nSo why would you if you're a Maryland why would you bring this guy back what benefit does does it serve at the interim coach Canada is ... done well\nI went over Texas five and three they're Maryland football I mean that they're not going to compete in in the eastern division and the Big Ten with Penn State with Michigan with Ohio State Michigan State so I I well I take this risk it makes very little sense to me so\nHere's what the University of Maryland board chair James Brady said at this news conference quote we believe that coats dark and has been unfairly blamed for the dysfunction in the athletic department while he bears some responsibility is not fair to place all of it at his feet\nWhile yet they also said that Evans will keep his job so who would then apparently to blame for the dysfunction in this athletic department because well on record is Soviet Wayne or ... right [laughter] this is stunning\nFirst oh here's the thing you don't want her Meyer got suspended showing we talked about and I said look\nHe's not going to get fired because he served in mind you cannot replace urban Meyer who's a second best coach in college football today only behind Nick Saban there's value with urban Meyer not saying it was the right decision all I'm saying is I understand why Ohio State didn't fire\nYou know urban Meyer you're not going to get a better coach savings aren't leaving Alabama the Ohio State tomorrow\nBut if you're in Maryland you can kick PJ jerk into the side and no one's going to say boom because no one's gonna care in the sense of oh he's a great coach how are we going to replace him\nRight you don't want them to to be ... should he become down to that you know it's right or wrong I mean who cares if they're a good coach or not if they did the wrong thing they should be outright like we all agree with that\nWhat we're trying to get into the minds of the people making these decisions and if you know urban Meyer by keeping urban Meyer you could say All right they're keeping them partly because he's a great ... that's what we're saying we're not saying it's the right decision because it reminds of court right\nThere's a great ... ... so what does your turkey and you're throwing that out of the equation because he hasn't accomplished much as a head football coach so why would they run the risk of bad PR at the very least bad PR\nWith keeping him as the the head coach the football team [noise]\nHonestly there's no explanation for this and what's amazing is the president's university also by the way was brought back although he is retiring on his own I Believe in June\nHe even came out with that unprecedented press conference back in August where he accepted pug lip publicly quote legal and moral responsibility for what happened\nFor no heads to roll except for the lonely trek you know the lowly athletic trainer is ridiculous so you want to talk about a botched investigation you want to talk\nTo people sitting in a room who are absolutely clueless which is stunning had no idea how anybody can be this clueless\nAnd just to think that Marilyn felt that this was the right decision where anybody in any sort of a power position he's not being held responsible he's on early in the main player is pet\nPlayers are walking out of a meeting with the coach because they're disgusted one of the players even on social media Ellis mechanic he writes quote every Saturday my teammates and\nI have to Neal before the memorial of are falling teammate you had a group of people do not have the courage told anyone accountable for his death if only they could have the courage that Jordan had never the wrong time to do what's right oh my goodness by the way what do you know\nThe the other side of it is is the athletic training staff\nThey didn't properly treat Jordan for heat stroke\nSo if you want to look at it from records perspective right had yet but a training staff done their job Jordan would be alive today it wasn't because he was pushing them too hard right it was because you have training staff from the right\n... didn't do the job\nWell here's the problem as they did not apply cold water emergency treatment I don't know did you watch the real sports or interview with the parents\nAnd they had one of these experts on I forget his name and he's he's he a trainer or what have you or what have you and he said that had they properly treated Jordan you'd be alive today\nAfter his death prompt you shouldn't he doesn't know drawn but that's the problem was there was a complete failure in every aspect won\nThe scientists who are in their suffering Heathrow was not seen and what was the proper

Today college football writer Dan walk and joining us going deep Dan Schwartzman NBC Sports radio to move on to the week one college football playoff rankings no surprise Alabama is the top ranked team\nWhy does Clemson getting all this respects Notre Dame got his signature win over Michigan Tech even LSU with one last day at the time they played teams they beat three top ten teams you know they they demolish the Georgia team that people hold in high regard\nWhy is Clemson just their number two when you look at their signature wins and frankly what's the signature when we look\nNC State Florida State made it sound as if they played this great schedule yet their number to Dan what's up\nOr if you want to look at it\nFrom a resume perspective you might have a point or the thing is though when you look at college football the last several years there are two programs in the country who have\nRisen above the crowd not only in terms of recruiting but also developing players\nOne of the Alabama ... nobody else is in their weight class and times of tuna running it'll opera and this clumps of team ever since they made a quarterback change Kelly Bryant to Trevor Lawrence\nI live in Atlanta forever Lawrence is the best quarterback prospect who has ever come out of the state of Georgia that is\nQuite a statement I've given the amount of town that has come through the state but it is true ... is a transcendent player and win Clemson finally made the decision to put him in as the store or they've done nothing wrong or they dominate the people\nThey're getting better each week and so\nWhile I Would agree with you in the sense that Clemson maybe has not had the schedule ... somethings over teams they're undefeated\nThey have dominated people since they made the quarterback change ah and their amount of talent whether it's Lawrence a quarterback ... in the white person ... wide receiver ... defensive lineman who we're going to be first round picks\nYes or no cost round NFL Draft picks on the defensive line [noise] um\n[noise] it's Alabama it's ... and everyone else is a ... glow I I don't care they be and that's what it is right now so clumps Alabama Alabama clubs however you want to do it I'm fine\nBut my dad isn't shouldn't the resume count and what I mean by that it shouldn't\nThe competition who you've played results like that count rather than you're right in terms of pure talent Clemson right up there I don't deny Clemson to more talented team than LSU comes in is a more talented team the Notre Dame\nBut if we're just going to do that and who cares about the games they played right shouldn't that matters strength of schedule strength the conference things like that why isn't that going to be taken into consideration and we're just going to get up and say yeah they played nobody and ACC stinks but they've got a lot of talent\nWell you're missing two things one else you've got a loss incomes and doesn't\nThat matters now to\nThis is a very subject to process the selection committee job is to identify the four best teams ... for most deserving it's up for best resumes for best resumes Alabama would not have been in the playoffs last year was made that very clear\nIt's for best and Clemson is in any measure is the second best team in the country out if they lose somewhere on the line that may change but\nThe only seen in the country right now as a good chance to beat Alabama on a new group field is causing so for them to say the number two okay no problem with that and I think frankly you don't mind or to your to say that they should be behind somebody like LSU who's got a loss\nNo I I agree with you absolutely I Do believe I Am in the ... minority but I'm just saying is I I'm trying to look at resumes you\nKnow besides you know just saying a team as all the way onto they don't\nYou here's what I Would tell you is Clemson is better defensively than I was you and they're better off at school is an issue I mean I I think Ellis defense is very good Clinton's defense is just a little bit better their bet on our front\nThat was probably a little bit better the second era but ... you're not even talking about\nTeams that are in the same strategy for I mean she was a limited offensive team job arose has been a\nAs good as he needs to be he's done some nice things but when you talk about the kinds of potential ... got to follow the ball down fuel from Lawrence you're talking about still players privacy TNN it running back you're talking about two totally different classes of teams\nThe off fence of potential declines that has is just\nFar better than anything else he puts on the field\n[noise] alright easier conversation in terms of LSU being ahead of an beating Notre Dame are you okay with that\nWell and so it's interesting one of the things that I really noticed about what the committee did today is in every situation where there were teams that were kind of close they seem to favor the team that's better defensively and\nI I think that's probably a smart thing to do a you know everyone seems\nFour points right now I Would argue elite defensively maybe the separate and I'm near you look at LSU I think they're probably just a\nTad better defensively the Notre Dame um you know you look at Michigan there are a tad better defensively right well maybe not maybe more that they are better defensively than Georgia you look at Kentucky in the rankings at number not really good defensive team you know some questionable offensive\nUm numbers but their way to the head of Ohio State by this committee Ohio State really good often simply not good defensively so again I think it's consistency from the committee or they seem to have a philosophy going into this about what they value what they think makes for a\nGood potential playoff team a and it's nice and so if if you kind of follow that logic then I don't think you can have too big of an issue as LSU and the truth is they play Alabama this week if they beat Alabama than they\nDeserve to be there are ... they'll probably be number one if they lose a little bit behind you or don't leave behind the other day they have to last so\nTo me it's kind of like whatever I I you know we're we've still got several more weeks to go on the ratings right now don't mean that much you want to put hours you had another name it's fine we'll find out Saturday whether that's valid or not\nChat with Dan walk in USA Today college football writer Dan last question when you look at this ah first ranking that's come out is there one team that stands out that you think is ranked higher than you thought they would be in one team that you feel it's been under ranked [noise]\nI got to be honest I I had not paid that much attention to it because again I mean this is just entertainment ... the committee's putting out there I uh it doesn't really eat a whole lot and get into the last months of the season all you know again I think Kentucky number nine is is interesting because\nI'm not sure that if you went around the country to say was Kentucky a top ten team or not that you'd have a whole lot of people who reach the fact that there are top ten teams I mean they they literally needed\nA gift of a pass or fear it's penalty and an all time down to to beat Missouri last weekend so you know I think maybe some people would say that there are a little bit over rated I I don't know that anyone is underrated per se and I think you look at the top ten and\nEverything kind of falls to fall of Oklahoma's there are number seven I think they're better than the number seven team in the country or but again they're going to have to prove that they're gonna have to grow up the rest of the cease to be people there now to play the kind of defensive played the last two weeks ever since my students got fired\nI'm you know I just think when you look at who's dangerous in a playoff scenario like Oklahoma and ... Murray the potency of that often it's like you're you're you know they they are not the kind of thing you want to play I mean we saw last fall like we'll get what they did to Georgia's effect so\nI I think Oklahoma's better on the number seven they may not deserve to be higher the number seven right out based on the schedule they have lost both just everything like that but if they continue on the same time they'll they'll be right\nThere you have a lot of fun God's football you're right it's entertainment value on these rankings come out but we have to wait they will take care of themselves can walk in USA Today costs with writer Dan appreciate job but on the show yeah no problem awesome stuff it's fun talking about this up my thoughts does LSU belong\nAhead of Notre Dame the one last team at the un beaten next enforcement NBC Sports radio in the NBC Sports radio mobile apps [noise]\nListening to the radio in the morning magazine would be Tuesday through Fridays that ten AM here on central Wisconsin twenty more our information Beijing am thirteenth want to tell you every jar\nIn the morning is am Thirteen twenty W Abyei jar Wisconsin Rapids weekday mornings at five AM\nCity of news operators Pittsburgh colds funerals for those killed last Saturday at the tree of life synagogue President Trump has come and gone he paid his respects do demonstrators forever and Susan Rothenberg lived just a few doors away she joined\nUs very rod day was the first funeral\nFor our Jewish brothers and sisters we and I went to the actions of people who are just trying to correspond bill recall\nPast the president visits the synagogue inside down the street there are protesters who are here who are chanting no division in Pittsburgh [laughter] no division in the United states they are being kept a distance away but their chance can be heard up the street where the crowd has gathered to watch the president pay his respects to those who are falling here\nMr Trump did have his supporters too\nMuch on and to have him in the first lady said\nCBS News update on top forty\nHere's your forecast from the weather I weathered center Mimi ... overnight with a bowl of thirty\nFive in northwest surely win by two ten miles per hour me be clear tomorrow high level up around ... to close it down to about thirty one night partly cloudy skies temperatures and your average Thursday and friday would hide from the mid ...

Lincoln getting hired as a G and all the LA Lakers this past offseason but surprise surprise the Mets they go the unconventional route but is it the right one our baseball insider set Debra joins us in a sense you know a lot about this Mets team\nFirst of all surprised that this is the move that they may go in the direction of bringing in a guy who's never been a front office person Brody bandwagon and are you a fan of this\n[noise] I wouldn't say I'm a fan or I'll take a wait and see attitude about it I'm not rushing to judgment but I made this analogy you tell me if you disagree with this analogy\nYou wouldn't hire a dentist to do open heart surgery [noise]\nTo me it's just like saying that just because you're a big sports fan means you can host a radio show or just because you like music doesn't mean you can be on a stage\nYou know what I'm saying Brody on wagon and as a excellent agent and he definitely notice negotiations and he represent ... or represented hey you know seven of their players\nBut to understand the new era baseball and to you know all of a sudden be able to command a franchise\nIs an unchartered territory he has as much experience as Rocco bell deli does managing the twins\nAnd I but I think it's less because he's not been in management and you know I learned something a long time when I met with Tony ... union this was years ago but we talk about very rarely\nDo players go into management you know Bob Watson went into management Joe Torre he went into management but it's very rare that a player goes into management usually they go work for the\nIt's the same thing a player agent has never gone into the front office and\nWhy would I Believe that a franchise that has botched so much over time is suddenly going to understand how to do it\nThat's the surprising thing for the Mets the hard questions that have to be answered and meanwhile Jacob the ground is one of those he signed three twenty twenty as he's Asian Brody bandwagon and said hey him or trade 'em right so now he's on the other side of it correct so what are your expectations for Jacob the ground because again this was like unheard of\nWhere a guy representing the top player on that team with an ultimatum said team is now actually running that team and I guess would run the negotiations on that and he addressed\nThat and he said you know now it's time to you know first of all I think they're going to try to pay him\nBut here's here's the question Brody bandwagon and had a number in mind when he made those comments at the all star game right like ticket to grow knows that\n[laughter] and so he knew that number and my question is did he meet with the well ponds and say it will take this number for him to side and the willpower I said sure if that's the case then what they do send me all person\nWho think Sandy also didn't have that checkbook\nYou know oh I mean I didn't have that checkbook right since made off they have not given open checkbooks to their general managers they have asked their general managers to be much more creative and the fact that Sandy all of a sudden got that team to the twenty Fifteen World Series is a testament to his ingenuity\nIf broadly bandwagon and has money to send me all the ... and never had well then that's a ... year old and then suddenly the will puns or good owners I'm shocked [laughter]\n... studying to be I mean it's so ridiculous in the sense that I'm not surprised by this but I don't want\nTo sound like I don't like the guy I I Do like and I met him before and it seems like a really nice guy I'm rooting for him and I like John ... who's you know I guess going to be his kind of a right hand man\nAnd I I'm ...

beneficiary of at the met fan\nYou know what I'm saying like the the the ... ... if if this was a will move because we'll pond still cares about what's on the back page of the New York tabloid\nLike they are obsessed with it they care what they are employed truck trust me I Know first hand they care about every word that their employees say in the public if this is so to create spin\nAnd they

is he is a super agent that's what are you know the way to put it he is a super agent the guy is\nThe real deal with the guy is the you know I mean he's he represents a bunch of hot shot big name players he makes millions of dollars in fact you have to believe he's taken a pay cut to become the gym or the New York Mets\nAnd that's why I have to ask why is he doing it is it just a challenge for him\nIf he broke the bandwagon and could always go back to being an agent of this doesn't work out right I mean somebody's gonna hire him to be an agent of course the ale take 'em right back and he'll

... look it's a ... to me it's fun and games for him it's like hey I could prove I can do this\nBecause I'm a like a guy that already has a great job that's going to take a job outside the comfort

they are making millions of dollars he's got a new way to ... you you mentioned it a challenge it's a challenge\nA lot as an agent already you mentioned just some of his clients to ... send the guard

John Wall kill you bring into port is making a ton of money Markey more is there one in what six right now what's happening in Washington how deep is the dysfunction in they gonna blow this up anytime soon\n[noise] it's been almost an annual question for them um and\nYou know every year that question takes on a think increased urgency\nAnd you're right on paper look to all stars in wall and the old one of the best backwards need to be a ... a really good player great three point shooter and he's big huge long and you can defend multiple positions Kelly Hoover is made some strides Markey Morse is a good player\nUm for whatever reason and again it goes back to what I was saying earlier about the rockets in chemistry ... sometimes I just don't mix well you know sometimes it's not about the talents it's it's about whether or not they\nKnow how to play together and want to play together um\n... it's it's a strange thing and sometimes it's hard to put a finger on but the the the chemistry there's always been a little bit goofy the wall built dynamic has always been I think a little bit tense I don't think they dislike each other I just don't think that they necessarily always loved playing together and they've kind of set it at times to um there was also the wall versus court taught issue that was\nAffecting the last couple of years so they trade Gore taught and they bring into white Howard who hasn't even been a factor for them yet because of injury so part of their early season struggles right now is that you know they got rid of their starting center and and the guy that they got to replace him Dwight Howard hasn't even been healthy\nSo you know maybe they need a little bit of time to straighten things out but look the chemistry there's always been kind of off\nAnd you know yeah eventually at some point you got to think that major changes are coming whether that's\nPeople getting fired or whether that's blowing up the roster breaking up that back court and just trying something new because if you keep you know it it every year is like is this the breakthrough year and instead you're forced to sixth seed and at first round out at some point you got to try something new\nChatting with our back senior MBA writer for bleach report here on going deep bench warrant NBC Sports radio you take out the Marta rose then you add inquire Leonard and you have a seven and one Toronto Raptors team you're buying into this team is the best in east\nYou know there was a lot of folks are around the league who before the season began thought Toronto should be the best team in the east and it came with some ... of course which was as to why Leonard still the same guy who wasn't MVP candidate just two seasons ago um you know we didn't see much last year with that that injury\nAnd you know it'd be physically right as he mentally engaged does he really want to be in Toronto is he going to give them their all\nAnd so those were the questions coming in and those are the things that for some of us you know kind of\nI've been for me I was conscious about it I I didn't want to put too much stock in what's wrong with could be\nAt their bet you'd you'd think they could be phenomenal and of course better quite Leonard's a much better players and the heroes and we just noticed respected heroes and they're just different different levels\nAnd Danny green was an underrated\nPickup in that trade and so defensively you knew that could be dominant but it was all again based on\nHis co I let her right physically entity fully engaged mentally and emotionally in this team well the early ... the answer to that question isn't bad ugly yes and they've gotten off to a great start and if this is you know if if ... is is healthy and fully engaged\nYeah this is a really dangerous group and they've got that nice deep bench that that you know had been a kind of come together over the last couple of years they could be the best team in the east Boston still has the best talent one through eight one through nine\nAnd the Celtics have stumbled a little bit in the early going here it looks like they're starting to find their stride but the the Celtics have so much firepower are so much versatility I still think they emerged as the best team in the east but\nAbsolutely has a shot at it Cleveland Cavaliers have a whole lot head coach Tyrone Lou ease fired after six games ironically they go out and when the one game without him a tyrant loose scapegoat it and who's the best fit to take that job\nYeah he was absolutely scapegoat it and this is another indication of just how dysfunctional that franchise is ... pretzels the last four years masks the fact the Cavaliers are one of the most dysfunctional franchises in the NBA Dan Gilbert as owner has never given a GMO second contract so he's always replacing as GM\nHe's gone through as many coaches as as any uh owner and the last you know ten years or whatever um\nAnd this was this was too soon to pull the plug are by far uh they convince themselves and the off season that by signing\nResigning Kevin Love to an ax deal and bring back the same core and not blowing it up not tanking says that they were somehow going to remain relevant and still be in the U.S for the playoffs like that was their message\nAnd I think they bought them that their own hype I think ... is on hype that they could still be good because he's always willing to stick it to the broad and show that he doesn't need him which is what happened in twenty channels you know same same attitude now\nUm it was unrealistic to think they were going to be very good and Kevin ... been hurt besides so Yes sir on there was absolutely or the victim of I think unrealistic expectations and I'm at a roster that's just not really built to win and that should have been blown up and and probably still will be blown up at some point\nA word that leaves them who knows uh Larry Drew was elevated to what the team called interim head coach there is really saying no I'm not\nAlways the same rights\nYeah give me give me the contract that that indicates that and so now they're in a dispute with the guy that they want to be their interim head coach I mean this is just this is not the way a good or a girl go station runs itself\nUnbelievable that somebody's got list you know LeBron the bottom has fallen out our good friend

great stuff from Howard back about that do we believe in the Milwaukee Bucks the only undefeated team left in the NBA what's up with Washington hand\nAre the Toronto Raptors is quite Leonard really

Michigan on The Revenge toward them you're going to bitch yeah they're coming off of a by Penn State struggle to get the Iowa last week at home yeah I I got Michigan big in this one what about you\nI I agree with you but here's the worry that I have and this is going to be the big question for me for Sean Gary play this weekend\nI don't think he will love is a place where you can I think he's done for the season\nI I agree I think I don't think it'll hurt Michigan against Penn State for say a ... it didn't hurt them against Michigan State\nThink it will it will hurt them against Ohio State though and\nAnd and the teams if they were to go on for them that but yeah uh that that that would actually come back for our state no he's not gonna come back for just for one game that would be done when it\nComes out your ... you come back for the ball game could be a playoff game of so you'll have you know possibly two games to win the playoffs I mean there's a possibility but you're right if you're going to come back\nState right I mean this is a a you know a top\nFifteen team Penn State some people believe can go in there when that game you want all hands on deck Russia and Gary one of the top defensive players he's got to be a sure fire first round pick up central top ten picking the NFL Draft he doesn't show up for the Penn State game I don't think you can count on them but there is some cryptic stuff coming out about that and that's the funny thing\nJim horrible came out pretty much put the onus on Russia and Gary said\nRussia and felt that he couldn't play last week or two weeks ago you know it was kind of interesting the way he put that\nIn Russia and Gary's mothers come out and she says reports that you know he's just he doesn't want to play because he's trying to maintain his body obviously for the NFL Draft that's not true is part of this team some of his teammates I've come to his defense but I found Harbaugh statement to be kinda cryptic\nWhere he said it was up to Russia and Gary not the medical staff thinks he's banged up or tests show he's still banged up it was that Russia and Gary kind of seemingly made that decision and horrible it's not a guy that doesn't speak without thinking as to what he's saying I find that interesting\nYeah but you know yeah I I agree but you know what Don brown the defensive coordinator for the mission I'm over in so figure out a way to play without John Kerry has for the past few weeks so I I don't think it will hurt Michigan against up and say this week five\nOther big match ups there's a lot of mayors some really interesting match ups it's a fun weekend the college football to say the least again Alabama LSU Notre Dame at Northwestern Michigan home for a Penn State's the big one obviously who never thought that this game would be such a big game\nDid you ever in your right mind think okay\nThat Georgia Kentucky Kroger Field\nCould potentially be\nFor the FCC east title and a chance to play Alabama in Atlanta in the SEC championship game who the heck ever thought Georgia Kentucky\nCould be that match up to determine that show and that's absolutely insane as much as it as as I've enjoyed Kentucky this year and I'm sure do when I picked Kentucky and are you know going deep dirty dozen picks on friday shows\nReality is I think Kentucky loses take your eye they they're all they're all sense of their terrible offensively it's Benny Snell and a bunch of guys they're a heck of a defensive team\nThey got a great special teams play last week to steal it went against Missouri but you shouldn't have to steal will win against Missouri if you're a top ten team\nAnd I just think this is what it all like the day of reckoning shows up this weekend I think Georgia walks into Lexington, Kentucky and absolutely roles Kentucky and this dream season that they've had it's been a great run and Mike stoop should be up for a you know college coach of the year I think the run ins right here so I Can't see them being competitive\nAgainst George I really can't move Jake from plays the the way he played last week yeah there's no chance for Kentucky and in this one but I don't know they seemed to have a rabbits for this year I shouldn't have one last week he gets Missouri\nAnd they get that part or turn touchdown and they went in the final seconds so you never know I you know it's one of those years for Kentucky did everything is the ball's bouncing the right way so I can see them squeaking out a win but George has the most talent in the SEC other than Alabama so that seem to be tough for them to win this one\n\nSomeone at a party jumps into fully dressed everyone cheering them on and jumps into just a you know in real life parties nobody jumps in after you just look

opportunity and and how the game plan and shakes out that's more for Sunday night I'm not going to get into who's playing where because that's that's more ... scheme driven\nOut of the team taking ... stronger and get nothing immediately in return for\nMe that's that's that's probably more question for that Bob but I think everybody understands el ... the business aspect of it and and but most importantly you know the culture and and holler walk Rome operates as as as always part of those conversations but you know um this is more about the New England we were really\nIt's going to dress for Brian I'm I'm I really don't have any more it's just talking about something like\nWhile and I guess it's clearly going to be right there or or maybe the best way to Montana John Elway was something I was\nFortunate to be around Ninety three Ninety four and they aren't just call you on the Monday Night game up there or you know we we um without scored an adult with Kansas City and John put us read don't always go back and scored and\nShow took to chase right back down to score during the last place or you know might be a little bit of the game we played against San Francisco so um but yeah I think I think ah\nYou know the evidence they don't play against each other I mean I think we all recognize that but the you know that have Aaron Rodgers Tom Brady and it's definitely a a contest absorbed by some ...\nWe look at you in the challenger was means you look at a stance yards are not very good these racial or not very good points they aren't going to get on a\nLaw that I mean if you want to get a statistics that may not think you've made your own point but I got to watch the path of their football team or the ... clearly are are getting better better each week and I think they're playing or bus football protect the last two weeks so I'm I'm a ... they they they do a very good job of you know\nWhether it's in Iran protection or pass game on there they're going to they're going to attack the things that they that they they feel can compromise you make you go on a different direction so it's it'll be a fun challenge\nLike when it comes to the newly culture and all those things do you think that the locker room was younger\nI think it like everything we do around here you you make decisions hum you move on and it's always you know we feel it's in the best interest of the Green Bay Packers so it's not a personal flight or you know they're trying to create an angle here of of\nYou know of negativity it's this this was part of the business\nI'm In but more importantly when when opportunity arises we're more focused on the culture and the people in that culture taken advantage of this opportunity\nLongtime sports fan and getting the free\n\nWhile you're just said to the best time I took to the best of all time about I think they really appreciates a not only\nWhat they do on the field and from the quarterback position but we are really the contributions to the game of football and and then on top of that with what they do is men outside of the game of football but I mean this is a dog if you if you wanted to study how to play

their culture take advantage of this off into [noise]\nThat is Mike mccarthy and he's talking about the culture of his team [noise] diluted that a couple of times in his presser today [noise]\nIt's the culture [noise]\nAs much as we want to talk about [noise]\nGuys inside that locker room and the play on the field it's the culture by which some of these decisions are made in other words if you're speaking out against the team\nYou're not along for the team how else do you put it you know what I mean\nThat's it simple as that you're speaking out against the team you're not going to be long for this team\nAnd the Packers made a made a move yesterday moves yesterday and they just they let it go said talk to you later we don't need it\nNot in our locker room so therefore the Green Bay Packers went ahead and cut loose time Montgomery and are they cut loose talk Clinton Dix they pick up a a fourth round read by the way people were really upset about the whole fourth round draft choice thing\nFor ah Clinton decks I you know I honestly it's about what you expected\nI don't think there's many people that thought differently of hog Clinton decks or that or you were going to get some kind of great draft choice for him\nSo I I I don't know I I I thought they got about what they should I didn't have a problem with it I guess some\nPeople do they think they just throw them away I don't yeah he was a higher round draft choice but he wasn't playing like the same reason you didn't want him around at the same reason a lot of people are going to just take 'em off your hands and say here you go we'll give you anything for them it just doesn't happen that way\nSo they they got what they could\nHave five five eight three zero eight six four eighty five five eight three zero eight six for eight give us a shot want to get your opinion on all of this but uh you heard Mike mccarthy speak their\nLike karate basically saying they look as a culture is what we do we don't ... we don't you know it it's it's all what is inside this locker room and then we move forward pay five five eight three zero eight six for eight want to hear your opinion on this eight five\nFive eight three zero eight six for eight has the Green Bay Packers continue on to get ready for the New England patriots and a lot of questions about the match up with Tom Brady and Bill Bill a check and such and and that's great you know don't get me wrong but today is about and Mike mccarthy was not really going to get into he said I'm not going to get into player personnel decisions\nBut today is you got to start thinking about who's going to be playing where\nI think it's a legitimate thought who's playing where because the Green Bay Packers got to figure this out I mean I'm sure they have a thought process in in mind but you know who's who's playing the said who's ... who's going to be the guy calling the plays back they're paid\nFive five eight three zero eight six right man if you try again via social media today as well\nAnd I do want to get to some of the some of the tweets that were coming our way I'm Larry tweet says we're listening to him at a press conference I'm reminded of the mash episode where a Hawkeye and trap or asking the colonel about an incubator this is a press conference so the last thing I Want to do is answer a question\nI'm Randy again said fourth runner was not enough to me for hog Clinton should have been a third or hire a Sean says ah how was the first round guy to matter who was going to pick him\nWell yeah but he's not playing like it now that's the point he not playing like it right now\nUh this is from Chris he writes in when he's email inbox was already see time a government always seems like a very sincere individual however there's enough witnesses on that side line\nThat said he became selfish maybe it was a bad moment in time for him maybe it was just a split second decision that ultimately cost him a ticket out of Green Bay we wish him well seemed like a good guy ha ha Clinton mix I have no use for he quit playing hard in like a first round draft choice years ago\nThat is from Chris Chris appreciate the email\nThis is from Matthew Matthew rights or how much better is this team today I think they're really good I'd love to see Josh Jackson become the next safety I think he's got all the jobs to do what he's got good sized good speed and he has a nose with a football let's be honest we haven't had a ah we haven't had a lot of interceptions other safety position\nSince Charles which left could he be that kind of player ...\nCharles which it was phenomenal when it came to being an athlete or now could Josh Jackson morph into a really\nGood a secondary guy yeah I absolutely there's no reason he said he couldn't I I Would be shocked if he didn't but I Do get into the comparison of him being said Charles what's a mess I mean no that's that's\nJust as you're not going to happen [noise] eight five five eight
