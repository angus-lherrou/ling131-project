Will talk to you so\nBowl game but it's certainly had a little bit of everything in it from big defensive plays do a couple of big authentic catches some Koch kicking\nUp three hundred yards past er into Sean Watson but the thing that's going to stand out for me the most tonight Jason is the struggles in the red zone for both of these teams specifically the Houston Texans who made six trips to the red zone and I\nHad one touched down to show for it\nYeah I Would call it ineptitude almost an ear and the red zone and if people say well they went and read though they are six times I got one touched down for fuel gold points and it it it is but it's [noise] you know you're going to think about the time so they were inside the one yard non stop before the house\nAnd we can feel goals they were kicking field goals that were shorter than the old NFL extra points I mean it just\nGets to decide the red zone ... infamous either five yard line below brown and talked about a half time how he needed to make better play calling and it's been in the area but\nIt didn't happen in the second half it was there was the same old story in the second half it was it was tough to watch but you look at the other side of it and you could come in Dallas and the fence but the way they played it don't foresee middle school goals and they're really winning those situations the ... the team in the game all night\nReally gave him a chance to win even at the end with the interception gave them a chance to win in the Dallas and the other hand goes in the end zone or goes in the red zone twice and needs to get one touchdown one field goal but\nIt was used to be friends hung in there long enough to make a no place to put the ball and the offices hands long enough that eventually the odds word NFL player was going to make a play to get in a physical range\nAnd we get it out here ... his thirty six year he'll go that wanted the longest field goal of his night his other three made field goals Nineteen twenty and twenty wanting to get it goes back to that red zone where they really struggled tonight in February and had to settle for three chip shot field goals\nTo keep the Texans scoring going to shut a lot to do this job that I'm thirty three of forty four\nThree hundred Seventy five yards a touchdown and an interception the first the interception of the year for any cowboy out for blue filling in for Lamar Miller who was active but did not play twenty carries for forty six yards Watson had ten carries for forty yards in LA at the Knight twenty carries fifty four\nYard not a great night for his ... really bottled up by that Texans deep jak Prescott two hundred and eight yard touchdown and two interceptions in protect Prescott two hundred yards has been sort of a harbinger of good things in his career when he's under two hundred yards he's seven and eight when he goes over two hundred yards in his career\nHis record is now Seventeen and five just the fifth time he's lost the game throwing for two hundred yards are more this one two hundred and eight yards but not enough to get the wind swam deleting receiver three catches\nFifty five yards for the cowboys ... nine catches a hundred and fifty one yard no touchdowns to lead the way for the Houston Texans Jason let's select the guy go drive of the game\nBut I think that's pretty easy comes out of the time period there was an eight play Seventy two yard Dr took three minutes and forty three segments kept off by the game winning field goal by ...\nThirty states shores for the win that's the drop of the game\nAt is the drive of the game brought to you by Geico great news there's a quick way you can save money switched to Geico Geico dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance you look at these two divisions but the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans around because really this came as a once every four years game played\nThey like it to call it a rivalry especially in Houston because it gives you a chance to knock out the Morse tablets kid on the block the Dallas Cowboys and they do that tonight so they're excited but it really comes down to where these two teams fair in their divisions in the AFC South\nThe Texans are now right back in the mix in this division jaguars and tightened its volt flus today and so the Texans despite starting oh and three Jason there just to their two and three now just one game out of first place to the AFC South\nThat's crazy how much things are still within reach you know is very difficult to make the playoffs and we started over three I mean is this week so they're it's it's been proven for many years but it doesn't mean that over it but I Will say this while there's optimism because they found a way to win the game tonight and they're sitting there in the thick of things in their division\n... football team the way they're currently playing has no chance of William is to lose that are going in the playoffs if they don't get to face straightened out but if we all kinds of ways I understand the more ... wasn't it wasn't in there the night and he's a big part of their officers I think he really

as you get a ... car spark an effect guard dance and we had so many of them on a Sunday when Joseph ... juggle juggle juggle sixty four yards on a fumble return\nFor a touchdown Cincinnati sworn to defensive touchdowns a fourth quarter alone\nIt was just an exciting day all around for the defense is in the NFL and exciting day for the rookies\nThat's right rookie quarterbacks ruled the day I remember when they were old and four and everyone was talking about the losses for these rookies well for the first time in the super bowl era\nRookie quarterbacks once for and ... in one week the same week they all want Josh Allen for the Buffalo Bills ten of Nineteen just eighty two yards one interception one rushing touchdown but it didn't matter\nHis stats did not matter in this game the Buffalo Bills\nPlayed a smash mouth game with the Tennessee Titans and that's become the type of game that the Tennessee Titans have been playing this year and with the exception of that game against Minnesota the kind of shocked everyone this has been the type of game that the Buffalo Bills have been playing all season long\nAnd maybe that's how they're going to have to win games is not ask Josh out to do too much and instead just control the game control the clock makes them please when you need you don't turn on the ball over if you do limit your turnover she had that one in perception\nAnd pounded into the end zone when you're close and he had that Russian score\nTheir defense held up didn't allow the titans to do anything and you know what\nBang Thirteen twelve victory over the

Mayfield who got his first start at home in Cleveland fans ... already though on that Thursday night but this was his first\nOfficial starts in Cleveland may feel goes twenty five or forty three passing three hundred and forty two yards one touched down one pick made big plays in overtime\nAnd you want to talk about you know just whatever hey he threw for three or four to judge it was against

went through the upper rights and Mary habit\nThe browns get a victory huge accident is starting to get used to these overtime games\n\nUm three overtime games in five games that\nI haven't been

what I told them and they'll continue to a picnic coaching working hard to keep doing the things we're asking them to do a will have many more these victories I'm and I'm proud of the guys because things that always happen and we want him to but they don't blink at all\nThis is a tough team that plays close games and you know what they are just there on the cusp of something there's Baker Mayfield\n\nCommunication decision making almost invisible making sure we are seeing the most opportunity when you know chance or you know so little detail you know we\nWere very very close to being a great and we're not\nClose to being a great theme not there yet but close she says and the final rookie that won a game well it was Josh Rosen in the Arizona Cardinals no longer when no no longer when lists I should say\nAnd it wasn't pretty but you know what got the job done no interceptions which was Big Ten and twenty five passing a hundred and Seventy yards end a touchdown\nAnd uh it was a big play the Christian Kirk\nOn the very first played from scrimmage that kind of set the tone for\nThis game Seventy five yard pass and he says hopefully first of many many more wins for this cardinal sorts ... cardinals team\nTom sent us like this\nEvery every time I mean uh I mean we all got things to work on 'em and a long road ahead for us is the first one of many\nSo that's just some of the

that he's not happy in ten certain words that he's not happy with their situation and called out the team's heart\nSaid they're just thinking and don't get which is something that I've said the throwing the ball twenty yards that's on the ball down the field something that I've said as well\nI'm watching the game and I'm tweeting you guys can follow me on Twitter at Scott's on air as the O. T. T. S. O. N. A. I. R. that it was the same problems that we've seen from this New York giants ... a month\nAnd the problem has been at the quarterback position everyone wants to criticize the all kinds of one and yeah they they're bad but you know what go watch the all twenty two if you if you're fortunate enough\nTo have the NFL game pass they they allow you to watch the coaches film if not you can find clips on line just search it on Twitter I'm sure you have guys posting it I retreated opposed from Brian balding or the NFL Network posted something last week\nYou I had time he's had a lot of time as bad as the opposite of what has been there have been moments where you had time and he is not throwing the ball down field he has made the decision to shut down\n\nIt's on ... it's it's kind of telling the way that this fence is gone\nBack is not taking the shots down the field when he has the opportunity to do so and so player by go back and juniors growing increasingly frustrated\nAnd you know it was also frustrated about oh do back from juniors the mistake touched down in this game where you absolutely should have had it was right in his hands\nAnd then he catches one that's like ... it should have been a nickel we pass any caught it\nAnd to me he he catches that passed but he drops the one that was right in his hands you know that that's hey that do do back in ... and the way the giants kind of came back in his game and took the lead only lose because of the six three or he'll go [noise]\nRoss talking to his is out I'm not going to take credit for it he did that game was like a microcosm of Eli Manning's entire career\nWhere he'll throw the bad interceptions till Dinkins dog to frustrate you to death but then all of a sudden games on line he drives his team down the field and scores of ... when you when they need to that is ... career\nTheir students going to go into the hall of fame and he's not even a hall of fame quarterback but you will never take away the fact that he is a two time Super Bowl MBP and at times was one of the most most Koch quarterbacks in the NFL never take that away from from\nAs far as all do back from juniors concern and his comments head coach pat ... after the last of the Panthers\nPart of salmon after all the drama questions right now\nThat I'm gonna go back to what I said\nBye addressed it without a doubt\nBy addressed it with our team\nPublicly declared that I didn't agree with his comments\nAnd I asked anybody that was interested if they want a clarification go to a hotel 'cause he's a big mess\nNow I'm not going to give the public a pound of flesh on this\nThat would make me small not strong\nAnd these are the kinds of things in my opinion when you have the locker room that we have that will help galvanized you know

did show fight in this game because they were down and you know Panthers could have played a couple of things differently but they did show fight they came back they took away lead in a in Carolina

was it who is that somebody was ridiculous if you go from like sixty yards I think it was yeah I think it was called the party with the game when would this career long field or fifty four or something like\nThat um but yeah very similar but\nThis Giants' team now you know do back from junior can talk about how you know they play with heart\nThis this ... this is going to transform their

O. C. D. S. L. way\nAnd a A R well I asked the question\nI'm\nI'm reading you know written a tweet from Warren set up a no not once up this\nHas worn sharp or funny orange crap worshipped there was a guy who um you know one of the one of these analytical guys are guy newly Scruggs retreated that and he's bringing up the\nThe cowboys punting it on fourth and one and over time from the forties your but\nIt's an absolute tremendous point you know everyone\nFrank Reich last week the Indianapolis Colts head coach for playing to win the game\nYou know he decided to go for it instead of putting it in overtime [noise] there was a little different because that was in his own territory and well the Texans just would have had you know when they didn't get it sections just completed one pass and kicked the film won the game [noise]\nThere was you know that they punted just for the game would ended in a tie\nI kind of criticized it but I understood it after he explained himself right but they weren't playing for a tie and I get that if they get the first down then they have a chance to set up in a theory with the game winner but instead they don't get it the Texans won that game\nJason Garrett here on Sunday night and I found myself questioning it while I was watching it on TV\nShe played that cheap laid it to to not lose\nAnd I always hate that there's one thing to be conservative right and to be smart there's another thing to be scared and so if Jason Garrett didn't want to be aggressive and go forward there okay\nBut he has to think he has to think about what the situation is at that point the only thing he was thinking about was I don't want to lose this game\nHe wasn't thinking well I have a chance to win this game I get it aggressiveness not as nature he's not going out there saying we are playing to win this game but he's not even thinking about having a chance\nHe was thinking about how do I not lose he was coaching scared and that bothered me and I knew that they were going to lose I knew the minute they punted up all the way\nThat ... got themselves as a victory good for them to Sean lots in what they are real gutsy performance taking shot after shot after shot\nAnd there were two plays in this game ... Elliott now does he go the um the ... got a escape play\nAnd then there was another play were jak\nAvoids the stack and completed a pass down but the one play though it was like the bazaar one you know where the the it looked like he was just done done for\nEveryone praised or at least the announcers columns worth of my goals and people on Twitter praising jak Prescott for not going down and the strong legs and the strong core and the capability\nBut to me those two plays were a direct result of the new sack rule in the NFL\nBecause if\nJay Jay was was was not concerned with getting a penalty he wouldn't care about his technique was slammed into debt Prescott\nPut these players now have been trained to tackle the quarterback differently and so you saw him go in there and try and armed tackle instead of jumping on him\nAnd I know I'm not saying that he's thinking about a penalty at that moment I'm saying this is the way that pass rush hours are being trained the seasons\nGo after the quarterback with your arms and put him down don't land on him don't hit them high donate them low it's very difficult to sack very difficult and not get a penalty\nAnd I think that those two places where I direct result of that rule because Jay Jay ... is being taught to not go in there and not get a penalty here was Jason Garrett meanwhile on the loss\nOf a say that not not sufficient enough in the past and game tonight a lot a lot of different parts to that\nThey did a good job rushing the quarterback guys around deck of a lot in this ball game or I thought it was made a number of really good players and the game to keep drives alive or big players give a scoring opportunities but again we start strive for more consistency more efficiency more explosive innocent are passing it\nWhile they definitely have to do something but you know what\nThis NFC East and I mentioned it before\nIt's not out of reach no one's running away with it now through the first five weeks of the season no one ever won and we thought they'd beat each other up right but everyone else is just beating them up [laughter] [noise] giants are wanted\nRight they will in and they've only played the one division game against the cowboys\nCowboys are all or want to know\nThere are two and three eagles or two and three they have included division game yet\nAnd the Redskins or two in one and they are under dogs on the road in New Orleans on Monday Night could very well be too into the first place do you look at this they're still they're still being first placed by but I'm saying the em all of this division was that all these teams are going to beat each other up and then nine and seven was going to win it well\nEveryone else beating them up they haven't played the division schedule yet I'm starting to think that they might win this division this year oh no seven eight in one\n[laughter] because I was going to tie [laughter] I mean we were we were ... it's almost a guarantee to tie\nWell that's the new NFL rule and overtime shortening overtime for ten minutes that is basically\nWhen you combine that with the rule of every team must have an opportunity to possess the ball of course you're going to get more ties because teams are going to milk the clock and ten minutes might only be one possession for each team\nWhat happened today rare when you have them yeah it's rare when you have them go back and forth and have multiple possessions with a chance to win\nSo lowering it ten minutes I get it players safety all that stuff but you open yourself up to more ties and we've seen it and ties suck they'd do no one wants to see a tie Cleveland Browns almost had a second one [laughter] I don't know is that a ... has that ever happened\nThat's true that's true that's a sterling doesn't have that happy but once you hit it you'll feel [noise]\nUh it's what the funniest part about that was that oh do back and junior was like the one trying to calm down sterling shepherd he's a cap and maybe he was trying to tell you that maybe he was trying to tell them like hey man why don't you try beating up the net\n[noise] how 'bout uh\nAll the tweets after all do back in June or through the touchdown pass and I even through I even put went out there just go to some of the time it was\nYeah that was the low hanging fruit man it was so easy I treated out take out back and junior is about a quarter back in the light [laughter] it'd be great\nIf over do could throw the ball and run and catches himself if you get through and we catch and and catch the ball ...\nWhat does he think he is a the perfect Tom Brady or [laughter] or remember which is also had my husband cancer on catches himself well oh there was to be at a bank so there for a little less than that catches himself\n[laughter]\nAh what other storylines we watch it and how about the Kansas City chiefs five and oh I had of their match up next Sunday night against the New England patriots and I don't know if I can if I'm ready to call the Kennedys used the best team in the NFL\nMaybe if they beat the patriots next weekend Fox grown but I have to do it right now I got the rams number one and then I'd have the Kansas City chiefs and number two\nI Would love rams please Superbowl\nThere would be exciting the highest score\nI have the rams in my NFC championship game I Do not have the cheapest in my AFC Championship game I Do have the chargers do in my AFC Championship game the ... volcano is surely that might come to fruition\nRight chargers just that you know when he ... he usually\nLose early in the season now\nAnd he had to try to do is they're still waiting for both do\nMhm mhm why haven't in the levy I get a ... will be talked about and everything that Tom Terrific and and you know do what he does is always going to be talked about Jacksonville guinea a pub Kansas City than getting a lot of\nThe charges will slowly\nJust creep up up up and before you know it you'll you'll feed 'em at during the end of the season at the team that you don't want to put the faith in the playoffs\nNo and here's the game that I'm looking forward to them right so they play the brands next week we'll see how they handle that Greta Gregg Williams defense uh titans against a to Bob Hope defenses they play against Seahawks I don't think Bob a problem with because we just all ramp score thirty three points against that Seattle team that that's not a problem\nA raiders you know we've already seen that no problem there Broncos the jets just handled them cardinals no problem there\nI'm looking forward to and the Steelers that go up a ton of points I I'm really looking forward to the next time they play the Kansas City chiefs\n'cause I actually think that the chargers\nMight have a chance in this AFC West at that point so they take on the ... and it's late in the years or you know what's going to be cold there might be some snow in December ... usually play building those games\nYeah but this is what I'm saying but in a week or what does that explain Fifteen Fifteen\nOr Seventeen sixteen probably we Fifteen\nThat game against the chiefs we could be talking about a a chargers team that might be again back\nOr maybe even meet maybe tied well sheep's at that point wait a minute what\nGames do you see the cheese losing interest of disease\nNow they're going to lose next week and Fox borough I think they went on Sunday and Fox for oh I think the women's game they very well could they've won that game historically I guess you know everyone everyone remembers the everyone remembers the Monday Night game right they they have shown that they can Andy recon when vox ... uh but I think the patriots are getting healthier\nJulian Edelman being back changes things and I think the patch coming off this eleven day rest because they played on Thursday night and they won't have to play until Sunday night\nThink it's going to help them and I think the patriots were gonna win that game on Sunday against Kansas City chiefs\nI think that the bangles game is not a gimme because of the way the bangles or played off ants\nAnd uh they play the rams as well which I think in ... and it's in supervising arrowhead which is good for them but it very well could be a Super Bowl preview against the ravens that is not an easy game\nNow they have some type of games along the way they ... they could potentially before they face that chart the charters again they could have three losses yeah but the the the chargers okay who the face charges already up to bear the browns and what I'm saying that all of the charges for losses\nRight\nSo there'll be one game back\nSo I don't I don't think it's on the losing four games\nElementary\nOkay three games\nPatriots bangles Broncos Brown's cardinals rams raiders ravens\nI think they lose three of those games\nAnd you said the charges can beat Seattle Seattle\n... ... you can go to Oakland and beat the raiders\nDenver goes to LA that's when they go to Arizona that should be aware at Pittsburgh not an IRS look\nLook look look at the shark look at the charger schedule written I Am looking at they will be I mean next week against the browns I don't know what the point spread is going to be I haven't looked it up yet probably going to be close\nRight there but at least in October instead of December\nI Know I Know against the titans at home they will be favored against the Seahawks on the road might be a pick 'em game there'll be favored in Oakland there'll be favored against the Broncos W favorite against the cardinals ... there'll be under dogs but\nBut but you know what it was a way that the Steelers were playing defense who knows and I may be way beyond those backyards different there'll be favorites over the bangles at home\nAnd then Thursday night game against the cheese they got to fly to Kansas City\nThe change of things that I just changes things now right\nMhm yeah yeah\nThat changes nicer than it is not good for the roads dams okay and an end to this is nearly cross country are you calling from Los Angeles the gate the\nMhm\nI think the ... done it calls for but I Would love for the job but I still do the charges might be the most dangerous team in that conference and by the when it come December I think that the team nobody wants to face in the playoffs so you have in the ... the championship game is not really crazy\nAnd winning the games that they usually in gangs\nI ... I guess it all depends where they have to play in the postseason\nThey got to go to Pittsburgh I don't think they're afraid if they got to go to Jacksonville think they're afraid matter of fact I don't think any teams are free to go to any\nOther other teams play in the ... the defense is a very uh you don't ... you don't want to [noise]\nYou don't want to play and arrowhead and you don't want

chaos that happened last night but while I was watching that fight\n... going to be good because Bob of course there's an expert on all things may all things you have the actually he actually uh participate in mixed martial arts as well let's bring him on right now my little buddy from what we've been doing radio together forever from the Bob Ross and Tom show and he is being Seattle's Bob still what's up Bob\nHow're you doing my friend that it's good to talk to you again it's been a while\nIt is it has been way too long I've been waiting for you to call the phone number ranks that's what I Do I'm a tease that's what happened [laughter]\nWell I don't and you're an expert on all things you have the enemy and you also participating in a may as well uh oh just ... your thoughts about the chaos that the first the fight itself and then the chaos afterwards\nWell the fight was it ... it went the way I thought it would in that you know I I thought could be would when I'm I said Connors best chance to win was to keep the fight on his feet\nA two to engage them in a striking battle because ... counters got impeccable timing he's got great aunt speed any punches very hard\nFor that weight he looked a little off last night he was a little short on his counterparts are they kept trying to lure could be man which he did he got him to engage in his fight\nIt he couldn't he couldn't connect with that part you usually just impeccable with his accuracy and the timing and he just looked a little off it kept coming up short on that big left hand and he got clipped with a huge right hand knocked him down\nA but he took it well got backup but but the other part of that analysis was\nIt could be takes them to the ground it's going to be a long night that's what could be does he takes guys on the ground and he doesn't let your backup he just grinds you out down there and\nConnor was gas by the fourth round could be looked a little gas himself but ah got 'em down to the ground again took his back into submitted them with him that crank it was it was not a remake of joke that not have the arm underneath the chin added across the chance so it was much more of a net crank\nAnd then uh so the fight competitive but I'd\nThat could be although it was closer than than that and then all hell broke loose\n[laughter] wow and and and to your point earlier and I I\nI was thinking the same thing that I was thinking the same thing last night you know Carter he never really caught him flush and I wanted to see what happens to me last night I wasn't sure about how great his chin was Conor never really caught them plus on the job that left in ... I was waiting for that to happen and it never did\nNo it didn't and he came close he'd graze them a couple of times he popped him with a couple of decent jobs but you know it it's that punch that he landed on Joe's they all do he's landed on on ... landed on chat Mendez he's landed on everybody he's fine\nAnd I think you saw the time out of the cage and this is not me making excuses for Conor I picked him to lose\nA but I think the time it was almost two years\nOut of the cage so I I think you saw that I think there was a little rough as far as timing an accuracy because that's what his games built on he's not a ... he's the does not have a strong ground game he's the guy that he can use really dynamic again good hands speed really good power at a hundred and fifty five pounds and his game is built on timing an accuracy\nAnd it just wasn't there last night it was it was a good effort I give them credit he took some shots he he was taken down multiple times to get back up but ultimately it could be able to impose his will on him\nIf he gets right back into the gym maybe has another fight in between and uh you know is more active because he hadn't bought me in the cage and about two years could Conor McGregor conceivably win the rematch\nI absolutely think he could I absolutely do because I think\nAgain I think that that amount of time out of the cage does something to timing not so much conditioning but just timing and I think you saw last night and I think he was really effective in getting could be to engage in his fight he he you got to a point in that fight or could be wanted to stand up and trade with a man had some success by the way\nAgain landed a really big right hand that puts counter down um but he got him to stand there and it's sort of abandoned the ground game for a while he wanted to you know just prove I can beat you at your game which is exactly what kind of wanted them to do\nHe just couldn't couldn't take advantage of it last night so I\nThink if he can ... you know up the activity in terms of number of fights you know not wait a year or two years before he gets in the cage again and engages in a in a rematch I think he's absolutely out of a stellar chance and he also has a very strong sense of what could be does well and what he doesn't do well he's got holes in his standup game there's no question about it\nHe doesn't move his head he keeps his head on the center line his chin is up in the air\nHe's there to be hit that that left hand was there to be landed he was just coming up short on it\nThat can be then climbs the kids afterwards Nick Picks a fight with somebody and cut his entourage was another ... ability to fight or from what I understand and then some of these people come into the ring and sucker punch card and so what are your thoughts on the chaos that happened after you know and I know data set all the right things about what a horrible night it is but\nI I'm sure there are already thinking we met and everybody's going to make a lot of money on this\nList and then you and you as a huge boxing analyst and an expert in fan you know exactly how this goes man at the time you're looking at it and I was saying this was embarrassing because it is\nThis is a sport and that made this trying to establish itself as a legitimate mainstream sport\nIs is is a legit sport no it's not just a bunch of meat heads with tattoos who pick bar fights you know they're trying to move away\nFrom from that image from from that you know stereotype and show you this is actually a sport that's conducted with some level of respect some level of integrity yes it is a violent sport but at the same time there's honor there's discipline and it and it's not a bar brawl so when you see that and this is arguably it may go down as the biggest pay per view in the history of the of\nThe the organization and we'll see what the numbers are\nYou've got a lot of casual fans watching that's why it's embarrassing because that is only going to just throw gas on the fire of those and say that and I'm a bar brawl or as a bunch of meat had this how do you defend it against what you saw because what you saw last night was a bar brawl a guy talking smack outside of the cages name's Dylan down as soon as the jujitsu coach of counter McGregor\nGot under the skin of of can be in Iraq I met off so he hopes the cage throws his mouth piece at 'em all hell breaks loose and then a couple of people that were in in ... into the cage\nAnd uh with with Connors back turned through shots at him which about is is about as cowardly as it gets you you want to take a shot at them help yourself but make sure he's facing you I mean that's that's just weak sauce right there so\nUh the the whole thing was shameful it was embarrassing is a is it going to change the sport is going to make it less popular no no not at all because\nAs I said you you've seen this before we watched it when it was Andrew ... Riddick Bowe we watched it when it was Mike Tyson in November Holyfield we've seen it over and over and over the black guy for the sport yeah not at not a shining moment not anything you want to prop up is\nHey here's our sport but ultimately is going to change a the viewership is going to change the pay per view buys movie for now at wall\nThe pillow suspect in the uh you know second half of that game against UCLA when lifts team and the team that it's got all kinds of infighting happening and all that kind of nonsense between the the the quarterbacks bad in the head coach and all of that and it got a little too close for comfort so I I think it's a team that is finding ways to win\nDespite the fact that they haven't completely found a rhythm consistent\nSo the way you think this is Pete Rose last year with the Seahawks bomb I Know you and I were down in LA covering USC during the glory years when he was the coach there but you think it's just last year ... and his aides in with the team struggling right now\nNo I don't because I I think they they sort of listen these aren't themself a lot of slack he's he's been able to achieve a lot with with some cast off here and there was some young guys inserting them in guys that weren't built for certain positions turn them into superstars whether we're talking about Richard Sherman or kj right people like that\nHe's done a lot with this franchise when you when a when you win a Super Bowl in this town day if we didn't have a tight a title of any kind since\nThe Seattle supersonic serve Nineteen Seventy nine\nThat goes along the way you win a Super Bowl you go back to the next year uh obviously you're losing a tremendously disappointing fashion but I think\nPete's got slack I think they understood coming into this year when you lose people like Sherman cam chancellor cliff April Michael Bennet Sheldon Richard said that's a lot that's a lot of a ... I think they didn't use the word rebuilding because I don't think the rebuilding but I think they understood All right this is going to be\nThere's going to be a tough sled ... the coming up this year where we're going to hope to be a double digit when team at nine and Seventeen perhaps but you know it's going to take\nA lot of precise play and it's going to take some health and they haven't had a ton of either up to this point\nThe NBA and returned to Seattle the other night Bob still than you were there on hand and Kevin Durant comes out and of course he played his rookie season when they were still the Seattle supersonic they went to Oklahoma City\nHe took off his warm up jacket and he had a son Kim Jersey on and the police went crazy and he made a nice speech there and it's just it's just a shame that Seattle does not have an NBA team I Know I think the new arenas being planned for hockey and basketball and the NBA says they don't have plans to expand at least not quite yet so how long do you think this is going to take\nYou know that's that's a great question everybody speculating and this was just a reminder of the appetite that's in the city you gotta lotta disgruntled fans you've got a lot of fans that say you know what the NBA did us wrong did me wrong as a fan I Will never support it I don't want another team I don't care if there's another team I think there's going to be a lot of those people\nThat if and when they actually get the team are going to be right there in line to get in the door that opening night because what you saw in that building was absolute\nFever pitch maniacs maniac baseball or basketball fan the it was off the hook it was so loud in that building and it was just a reminder of what used to be with the sonics when they rule the city the Seahawks did not the mariners did not Utah mid nineties Ninety four Ninety five Ninety six\nThe sonics own this town when they had Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton and that led shrimp and her see Hawkins and all these people are and it was just a reminder of what that was like the building was packed full of people in sonics gear\nSeattle's supersonic chance going on you had that let Trump their Gary Payton their Lenny Wilkins downtown Freddie brown I'm Kevin Durant couldn't have played it any better I mean he he's a door it out here because he was here for a year but more importantly because he's kind of kept the message going\nEven when he's been in Oklahoma City and when he's been a Golden State he he he'll where the gear he'll talk about it he'll talk about how ridiculous it is there is no basketball here so he's been a consistent supporter of basketball in Seattle since he's left\nAnd they love him like he's a relative out here it he couldn't have played it better and to hear the crowded that frenzied level\nGave me chills was emotional and I think the that's not lost on the MBA it's not lost on Adam Silver I think there will be a team here\nWhen that's a great question I don't think the relocating anybody for people hoping for a relocation I don't see that happening I think you're waiting for him to expand whether it's two years three years I mean they're Rena supposed to be done in two thousand twenty could be two thousand Twenty one so I think pretty pretty soon afterwards where you're going to see a team get back here\nYou know above its funny everybody I Know who's from Seattle I asked him about the villain up there in his ... minute you must hate him and you everybody from Seattle [laughter] no no we don't have them yeah yeah he lied and said he was thinking about keeping him here but we all knew you know he's the guy from Oklahoma City a lot of course he was going to move back to his home town\nThe villains our soul ceases to never sold it to a guy from Oklahoma City there's plenty of rich guys up here and what about the team\nHe seems to be the villain and not play a bit\nOh without question I mean ... Bennett has been it David Stern and they're all on the list don't don't kid yourself up there on the death chart they're just not number one yeah Howard Schultz is number one he's persona non grata\nA there's a lot about what he said and did at the time and his options that he didn't take and and and you know avenues he didn't take local government local government\nShould absolutely be on that list and people forget about Frank chop and people in local government out here who basically told the MBA\nYou know Kiss My behind we're not going to what you they they got very indignant got very very pious and this whole thing uh so there was a lot of blame you want to do the pie chart of blame everybody gets a slice but I Would think in the minds of most\nFans out here that Howard Schultz would get the biggest lies but I Would I Would put local government right there with them along with David Stern and then you could get into everything you know clay Bennett and everybody else that was involved\nDidn't really need government do do do that there's lots of billionaires up their Bill Gates and a lot of Microsoft people\nThemselves because they they they probably quota but they didn't step up and you ... and again you have local government saying hey you're not going to use taxpayer money to build a\nBuild a stadium out here and there again very indignant about it almost to the point of being rude or ... with David Stern I think he took that personally and was like okay this is how you want to plant let's see how you like this you know so I think I got into a\nYou know a little masculinity competition there between you know local see our government and David Stern and then you throw in Howard Schultz along with clay Bennett it was just a big pile of bad it was just nothing was done well nothing was done above board everybody was completely dishonest than the entire\nLead up to it yeah clay Bennett just tearing the team down it was it was not a good product before he took it out of here and that was the goal\nOr to to do you know get apathy to set in at some point so it was nothing about what happened was good or right\nWhat what is right and what is accurate as you had for decades of NBA basketball in the city a championship in Nineteen Seventy nine yeah the team go to the finals against Michael Jordan in the polls in Ninety six\nAnd his team on the town there's no need to prove whether MBA will or will not work this is not a new market this was not a dip your toe in the water will it work there are no you know the answer for decades of of resume for decades of evidence\nIt's it's a done deal in terms of whether it would be supported as much as there are people that are bitter and saying they would never support it again I saw that pack building for a for an exhibition game between the kings and the Golden State warriors the game was atrocious it's pre season basketball but people were absolutely out of their minds you couldn't find a ticket to get in that building\nSo you you need to look any further they've got a market that they know they want to tap into here it's starving for it and it'll get it at some point\nGreat above hanging in there was a second second with us\nYou've got ... products are there you go to a great bombs don't Seattle radio legend\nOf course so he and I worked together for years down here when he was living in Los Angeles\nSo that that is it's a shame\nThat Seattle doesn't have an NBA team they are passing a basketball fan and they deserve a basketball team yesterday in Seattle safer than it was important for seven years I\nMean that's\nBe able to use H R U were NBC Sports radio lifting now\nYou'll all around the NFL highlighted by grand pianos sixty three orders to beat the giants thirty three thirty one even house cause game winner helped to build up the titans Thirteen twelve grand Joseph with the game winner and overtime brands but the ravens twelve nine on Sunday Night Football at Jackson's with a walk off\nThe alone overtime Nineteen sixteen they beat the cowboys kicking the story in Detroit where the Packers based in Crosby missed for fuel goals and an extra\nPoint lines ... thirty one twenty three elsewhere the Bengals score to defensive touchdowns in the fourth quarter beat the dolphins twenty seven seven genes chiefs are five and they beat the jaguars thirty ...\nJet stopped the Broncos thirty for sixteen stores over the falcons forty one Seventy instructors top the raiders twenty six ten vitamins over the eagles twenty three Twenty one cardinals get their first when the nine or ... ... e gene\nRamps up the Seahawks thirty three thirty one and there'll be postseason brewers complete the sweeping the Rockies with a six nothing when in Colorado brave stave off limits and should we do Dodger six five I'm Scott ...

in segregated schools back in the day I read an article with the great sugar ray Robinson the greatest fighter of all time most certainly before he died\nHe actually said he said integration hurt the black community and the black people are better off when desegregation because\nThere were more black owned businesses back then more personal responsibility and he said he owns like a couple of blocks in New York and he said the integration actually hurt the cause and we had more black owned businesses back in the day do you think he has any merit to that\nWell I mean we we all are happy that law suits were uh were waged a\nBreeze and equal find being too segregated school system yes\nUh I think what he was that there was a lot of us that the the call or a school like east Hi Dave uh

Gurley\nAbout a minute and a half to go in the game\nRamps got a really bad spot to me it looked like a first down but it was ruled by so now it's pouring down in in says about half the football that's what the ramp leader for a first out\n\nAnd he calls his last time out because uh you know the clocks one\nSo that was something that has the decision to make\nAnd I think it's a no brainer there's there's absolutely no discussing there's only one decision to make Europe by two points there was a minute and a half left you want to give the ball back to Russell Wilson how many times as Russell Wilson may play this guy is a play maker this guy makes as many plays with his legs was any quarterback in the NFL and he's been caught so over the years\nSo you got to put him back maybe twenty hard line and you're going to give him a minute and a half our youth freaking kidding me there's no way not if I'm the coach and if that isn't enough\nIf you've got Sebastian Jana ... your kicker who has fifty seven field goals of over fifty yards in his career more than anybody in NFL history so all they have to do basically get past midfield and you're in trouble\nYou're going to give them the ball with a minute and a half left up to where if you will be two with Russell Wilson ... over there hell hell and hell no\nAnd so I'm a great God Bless him and I'm I was yelling at the TV set get golf isn't there he's six for two hundred twenty five pounds land them up under center quarterback sneak the quarterback sneak in that situation works about Ninety nine percent of the time\nAnd that's what's on McVeigh did that while the guys on the ... while the experts were telling him to punt and I know even even Murray stones group who had a really good NFL career he was yelling you have to point here you have to ... are you crazy are you saying up by two\nQuarterbacks need for them they took a couple of these and the game was over that's huge actions that have done

looking for him to I think it'd be to win because it it it certainly human nature corner made eighty million dollars for that fight against Floyd Mayweather the boxing that so when you had the guy a check rate a million dollars\nSometimes it's easy not to get up at five o'clock in the morning and go train sometimes it's easy maybe to take the easy way out a little bit\nYou're just not going to be hungry you're not going to have that same edge when he got a check for a million dollars he's made it he succeeded and you've seen the way he's ... over the last couple of years partying buying expensive cars he came out with his own line of whiskey he came out with his own clothing line\nHe's been doing everything except fighting in the cage the last two years so that's why I Love to be an turned out to be a pretty competitive fight not bad but could be one the first round I get can be the second round ten eight by two points because he he gave Carter a weapon when he got him on the ground I'd like McGregor one the third round I gave that wanted to him because\nWhy did some good shots and out boxed them corner one of the dead on the fourth he got submitted with the with the naked a folk or whatever you want to call\nFights over\nBut then the fun began after that now congratulations on that can be he bought a great but he's the undisputed champion now after he defeated the guy who previously had the ... who never lost it in the rain gutter\n\nBut the one thing I Would have liked to have seen though is you know ... what he's great he's very accurate with his punches and he's really good at setting up that ... that straight left hand reflects a lot of people out\nHere comes forward the opponent comes forward and tries to take him down he thinks he's going to come forward another step these steps back and he throws the left cross like you did to host they all do and there's lights out\nAnd that's certainly what I thought was going to happen\n\nHe never caught could be flooding over those four he hit him on the side of the head he got them with a good opposite once landed a lot of jobs hit him with some good shot some kicks but I wanted to see I don't know of a habibi has a good fit or not\nCaught or never caught him flush on the job which which I think he still could be alive dog in the rematch if they bite again you know now he's had a fight if he trains aren't maybe has another five states in the gym which the party and Costa pulling around you know the ... from what I understand he can always win and there's going to be a rematch we do that\n\nBut then the fun began after the fight into to beep climbs over the the octagon over the cage jumps into the crowd and starts beating up on one of Carter sparring partners the guy who's also a fellow mixed martial arts guy and while that's going on a couple of it'd be a quarter a guys\nTeam members they get into the octagon and they start putting on a corner and one of them cowardly punches him when he has his back turn sucker punched\nAnd he should be in jail right now but I don't quarter in his in his locker room afterwards said he didn't want to press charges I don't know how that makes any difference cease to be in jail anyway whether corn and wants to press charges or not\nAnd then up in the podium afterwards said well you know I'm I Apologize I shouldn't have done that but you know Carter had it coming you you can't make fun of somebody's religion you can't make fun of somebody's country you can't make fun of somebody's but well yes you can here in America you can uh Habib\nYes you can make fun of those things now is it right the cutter does that does it go over the line of course did ... did it deserve to get his house whip yes he did and Habib did a very very good job of making Connor paid dearly for those insults\nBut you know or maybe not where he's from but he he's a devout Muslim a beep and uh and and he lives in a ethnic part of Russia and that's just things like that are done over there it's a big cultural difference when you were insulting religion and families like that that he's not used to because he's not an American\nYou know but here I with your Jewish Catholic Muslim Hindu Christian whatever whatever it's it's pretty much spare game of free speech we ... we can question make fun of each other's religions each other's families each other's countries and you know we we we might sound like a jackass and like an idiot or like hideous but it's not illegal\nAnd that was one of the reasons he gave for the climbing over the cage and going after O'Connor McGregor people\nBut I Love the way he'll be handled himself you know in in the lead up in the press conferences he can kind of like Carter won his mouth and he said once we get the ring I'm going to beat you down for everything you've said that that's the way you should handle that go ahead and talk I'll be your down once were once we square up once we raise hands on the rank and just seeing the second round\nOf had melted and was punching the hell out of him and he was yelling you got to talk now you're still want to talk at as he was beating the euro what out of it\n\nAs the Houston Texans now are lining up for a game winning field goal in overtime\nThey're down there deepen cowboys territory there on the twenty yard line which would make this a thirty seven yard field goal swath of them on a minute and fifty five seconds left in overtime if the ball sales to the ... the cowboys go to two and three and Jason Garrett should be fired on the spot\nOnce again Jason Garrett punted on the Texans forty two yard line on air force and one of the good side of the field what a cowardly gutless move by the cowboys coach\nAnd remember I said you watch what happens

good and Phil researchers I start referring to myself this day of the prophet the golden rule is sports got a strong enough term because I'm always right now I say that you could have done is called the game or moved\nOn to something else entirely not wasting any more time with it because that's exactly what happened they just leave it at that you know what I make a prediction you might have that's a good point Phil Richard you know when I make or break some people to just turn off the television because you know it's going to come true just don't do something else\nThe game or whatever and this is like clockwork when a coach makes a gutless cowardly decision and chickens out and says up upon or when he said go for almost one hundred percent of the time the opponent marches down the field and kills look what happened today\nIf Garret had gone for it on fourth down there and converted they're on their on the Texas forty two now they're on the Texans mate let's say the forty\n...

All right let's get on the line right now and oh buddy of mine one of the great TV and movie writers of all time as well and also with baseball play by play a guy\nWas several teams good in the mariners and the rangers and I remember back when he was doing Dodger talking away when I worked with them and local radio it's a great can live on what's Afghan\nHow you doing to talk to use the maker unite [laughter]\nWell I'm very upset when coaches mismanaged the clock and mismanaged and find out you know Ken that's a passing the mind clock management and uh I should be hired by some NFL team to be in charge of nothing but managing the clock and telling the coaches when and when not to use their time outs\nThat would be great you know you you were to manage the house [laughter] and I only want a million dollars a year it's right good job good job as good work if you can get it huh [laughter] well I I mean\nCan you you've done so much until the ... with a TV writing and then also play by play for baseball over the years so uh oh let's talk about the Dodgers series right now I thought I'm going to get your feeling on this I thought it was a stroke a genius by Dave robbers to save Clayton curse opera game too because we all know how ... struggled in the postseason as erase two points higher\nThan the regular season he's got all kinds of problems\nI think given him an extra days rest and now were you pitch great and put to shut out\nNow there's not a lot of pressure on ... they've got a one game cushion and he came out in ... great I I think if you start in game one and he loses a you know the the rough could fall in again this year\nYeah that's true I mean look get rolling the dice in a way because if the Dodgers had lost the one now he's coming in with pretty much the whole season on his shoulders\nBut uh I I thought it was a good decision and the other thing it said ten eight member court shot has an opt out after the the yes\nAnd it's been a season where he's faced well at times\nBut he hasn't been in the current job of old and he's also had back problems and he's been on the disabled list and so the question is well to the Dodgers really care if he opt out where they prefer to use that money for manning Machado or somebody else\nAnd the fact that they made this decision which you'd figure ... show was not pleased with to me it's kind of sending a message\nOkay Ken my mind a famous television writer of course mass cheering sprays or The Simpsons wings everybody loves Raymond Becker Dharma and Greg I could go on and on general the rent you work you've done on television\nAnd then of course ... the Orioles the mariners the Padres doing play by play with the baseball I'm a Dodger talk of of course over the years as well so how about the other one them in absolutely Milwaukee is now in the national league championship series for the first time in a long time\nYeah Milwaukee seems unstoppable you know and so much depends on the hot team\nAnd they're certainly hot and everyone is talking certainly before this Dodger games which they lost but everyone was talking about okay well what about the matchup between Milwaukee and Los Angeles and everyone is saying well LA it'll lead to actually get home runs but you know it's never too in home runs\nIts Milwaukee and they they really improve themselves with a yellow ... and pain and there was an interesting quote from credit counseling manager he was saying at the\nAt the all star break that this was a playoff case that he had what he thought was a playoff team now he says their World Series tape\nYou know now he feels this is a team that could get into the world series and they have the momentum going a plus I tell you you know when things are breaking your way you look at that game today they had runners that second and third\nAnd scored one run on a block and the next crying on the wild pitch\nCan live on break it way can bind to inundate Smith NBC's worth waiting to be seen forth whether you dot com um when I was a big win for the Yankees yesterday uh going down to zip to the red Sox existing but the best record in baseball not advisable but now they got the next two at home with that power house lined up so you think Boston may be feeling the pinch a little bit here\nOh I Do indeed you know everyone is saying that well\nThe red Sox have the advantage in the starting rotation and the Yankees have the advantage of the open with David Price that that doesn't seem to be much of an advantage for Boston uh and so I think it's going to be very tough plus you're playing in Yankee Stadium\nA but you know it's a war between those two tapes you know and there's a reason why they're always on national television because those games are just\nBattle royal house you know it's like nobody wins twelve to not being those games are always back and forth back and forth and you know I look for that to be the case and the next couple of days\nYou know Ken ... Fox wishes the Yankees and the red Sox for the American league championship and not a not not in the semi finals but are we sleeping on the Astros your other up to zip now on the Indians are the defending world champions all day the best team in the American way\nI actually think they are I actually think that they can beat either the\nRed Sox or the Yankees\nNow I've been wrong on things before by the way but before you go to Vegas and put your money down but yeah there are a\nMy pleasure well Ken we're agreeing to much we agree on real lining the divisions we agree on a ... or maybe said in the ... how about this one I'm like why\nDon't we disagree I'm not that great a writer okay\nOr we could not agree with that yeah much better than you are yes of course Oh yes I'm ... how about I Would like\nTo see us say versus the world and the all star game of foreign players against the American players instead of you know American National League you know within a league play now it's not best special anymore but I I think if you get the foreign players against the American players we see guys playing hard and we see guys who really want to win with national pride is at stake\nWe okay now I disagree with you um 'cause to me the thought of the all star game is seeing\nAll of the great players that you know and for our guys to be facing players who we never heard of from all these different countries um I I don't think it would be all that interesting so no I I disagree with\nYou there how about a I think you don't know what they're talking about I I I'm I'm a moron you know me I'm a moron you know from years ago when you're doing on the air ... I've\nBeen I've been pulling everybody for Twenty years now I'm a Mike crowd I I\nThink he's got to get out he's got to leave the angels and go to maybe the Yankees or the ... maybe the red Sox and go to a power to him because he's the best player in baseball and he has been the last few years as great as the years though can\nAffect the old saying if a tree falls in the forest is anybody here he's never won a playoff game is one of the play offs what's the angels are relevant they lose their he's wasting his career playing for the\nYou know I Am I okay I'm gonna have to agree with you hear a in a way you're right because if this guy was playing in New York\nYes oh our bombs it'll be just a a a superstar but uh you know and and it goes to show as opposed to the NBA where if you\nOne what brought you have one great layer it can elevate the entire team yeah arguably the best player in baseball and the age of ... are going nuts\nSo yeah I I kinda feel bad and look it's their claws Los Angeles angels\nBut uh people around the world don't be fooled no one in LA other than Orange County really give a rat's ass about the angels in fact there on a a radio station that you can't even here\nIn downtown Los Angeles there are a lot of the eight year olds are pretty much an afterthought this is a Dodger town if he was playing for the Dodgers it would be a completely different story of course he would be in play off games too well they're like well you just sort of playing in Seattle yeah Mike Trout is playing in obscurity\n[noise] they're like UCLA football and USC basketball and the clippers but that's that's what they can do by doing that you had to NBC Sports we don't have the sportswriter dot com when you look at all these great shows you by the way are you still doing TV writing now Ken is there anything we should know about\nYou know what the minute no I'm I'm I'm casting I have a podcast called Hollywood antelope line that's available I replied\nCaster found and uh

that show for ... years we wrote forty episodes of cheers and I never got tired of writing that show you don't have any money right cheers again today yeah ... characters\nMe too I Love that speaking of tears in speaking to tap dance and I had no idea he was doing another series called Becker I'd never heard of it I never saw it on the network and then\nI I started watching the reruns after it went into syndication sort of my favorite shows ever that show was great so that was funny I never knew it was until I started watching them syndication\n[laughter] I Know it was a show on CBS we lead over a hundred apple yes\nAll of a Becker a ... and it did well in the ratings where ever they put it they never really believed in the show so they kept moving the time slot hoping to kill it and wherever they moved it got an audience\nSo like I said we made over a hundred episodes and a lot of people like you I discovered it when it went into syndication a and I you know it's a show I'm I'm

mccarthy five eight three zero eight six forty five eighty three zero eight six or eight\nYears this shall we want to hear from you\n\nMay find three zero eight six story um students\nAre bringing my ah my Clements Sirius Radio chat with him about what we saw yesterday might be showing up close and personal just a an ugly performance I guess that might be the best way to put it on the Green Bay Packers right\nWho are these people you're calling a Green Bay Packers and what have you done with number twelve exactly and who's this guy is Halloween already here again what's going on there's clearly isn't that the players are used to that that really amazing crowd knew that he'd been kidnapped what's going on down there\n... it's a ... was it good to see the very least\nOkay so here's the first thing ten years ago when you went in to Detroit and it was there when they can it's been that way for forty years a recession and two thousand eight wasn't helping any uh as well but you know they could they back Thirteen Years ago or so\nAnd then they started or we're building in downtown Detroit fan I'm every time you come back down this fight in the building to building a skyscraper that's going to be\nI don't know a hundred stories the several guy was telling me about it where it's going to be an art place and they didn't have a theater here and they're going to have a I think it slides out and it's amazing and so you know what that means\nPeople are coming back down to Detroit and they're spending money and then you get into hoard field there's this giant mural\nThat Stafford and his core guys and often I'm TJ Lang standing next to him in the lions are spending money then\nYou know and the production inside Ford Field is much better they've got that they hand out the science for third down in the crowd is four times larger than we used to come to a game at Ford Field right after they built it\nYou know a number on enough wind scientist show by the second quarter they leave by the end of the third quarter there's plenty of Packer fan\nIt's different now loud tough place to play in\nAnd people want to come to these games whether their team is up or down it not now they got their head coach and that Patricia and he got off to a rocky start no question even in the off season\nBut the things that I heard from Lynn Taylor and one other player last week of the Packers lock real massive about like Alliance Defense is doing and he said they were telling me oh man you know now is it a different scheme but there's different technique\nYou guys are there the the way they actually go after you in the hand to hand combat are different and mark but Mike mccarthy even told me he's got so high coming in Rogers ended up on his ... his office he did that to strip CONMEBOL here's Mike mccarthy after the game\nFor going into the game today you know that's certainly the thirteenth sexist or extended place or you know it's a philosopher there's a gym and they're going to remain Russians in search situations and they'll give up more in the play coverage and send a pleaded extended\nPlay and then she went to rely on us or wrestling discipline and so it's just really the challenge we we feel very good in that area and it plays a ... that's how they\nChoose to play it and so they're able to make she plays a factor in in a specific situation\nThe guy in ten points in a matter of fact you know Aaron Rodgers losing them ... ...\n... ... very rarely happens in the fact that he usually has better pocket kind of awareness than that it's we talked about that last week\nAnd it happens twice in the same game\nAnd you know and they quickly hanging on the football too long and I'll tell you the line they picked up the Sean Hannity six three three hundred pounds they got him out of Alabama and the draft he's are wealthy and they saw on a Robinson sick for even though the Alabama kid he's been a there are now ... years\nThe one where ... was laid rolled out who is white and he was he he was oblivious to the fact that he had pursuit behind them that's the one that I couldn't figure out why does this guy I think he's got so much time you back up the tape and look at it is 'cause I'm David back here in the last ... had this guy\nBut this kid kept on coming on the outside and and he crossed through the center the field and chase down\nAnd chased out Rogers all the way to the opposition in the field to nail him and then you see the technique that Matt ... got what these guys to go after football not the quarterback and create those strip Saxon recover the bulk of the other one came right up the middle I actually thought the protection but generally speaking was okay but these teams\nHave been attacking Cory ... and ... and ... Taylor and whoever's playing like ... this week and that's when it gets\nWhite up the metal and ... and said Roger is about this at where are you getting blitz that much today\nDropping a lot of guys and the government's interests for I don't know if they'd pressured one time to have to have to think about and there wasn't a wasn't much new modem forty a little bit um New York times but uh when most pressure many\nConcerns\n\nConcern is kind of a buzz words and it's going to make headlines for half agree with you know I'm going to say that I'm aware where\nAt and we have to play better myself included\nStar faster like we've done over the years maybe if we can you know when it's not as I can start faster and play a little better early on and give us a momentum momentum we've been down in some of these games and um you know you kind of get back into it and we had a chance you know we were down eleven had a chance to be sitting there and when you're in line to pull the score and\nThe reluctance of shrimp that went back but we have to make the plays um throughout the game not just in crunch time and I got to play better from the store and I expect to know and we got to give our defense\nYou know somewhere else to shore fields and special teams gas were not playing three and then any of the three phases for an entire game but hopefully\nYou don't figure that out at some point and and look forward to next Monday back on the right track\nI look I get to the fact that they've been able to move the ball quite a bit and it's not just in yesterday's game but it's in prior games might put I put it out there Eighteen trips in decided and opponents thirty five yard line they've come away with a total of five touchdowns\nNumerous field goals they turned it over and downs and now they've got three or four ms field goal is to go along with it it just\n... they're not putting the ball in the end zone in the office for whatever you know Aaron Rodgers is right they need to get off to a faster started cliche\nBut how do you do that I you know they they seemed like they don't really start to get it going until they started to play with a sense of urgency\nI'm

would you pay for school\nI had a money saved up from a working for the past year I don't think I think it will probably like call of mhm mhm oh you left me a year you know\nI think I keep working\nIt clearly last year if it costs you half a point on your grade point average um yeah I heard about it like cheap yeah yeah I graduated with a tuna and seven\n\nI missed it as a magnet by I miss my about three one hundreds of them still piss Thirty years later but [laughter]\nBut you know what I have never had a single caller asked my GPA before this my advice [laughter]\nAnd I actually I've never gone on a job interview where they asked my GPA in my entire life ever in if you're wanting to go to work for one of the top accounting firms in the entire world\nThey might ask your GPA and you might actually be in competition or GPA might actually matter on your very first job but after that it won't um and it it has a whole lot more to do with did you learn how to do accounting than what your GPA is and will you work hard while you're at work and that kind of stuff\nAnd so what are you doing for work right now\nUh I work at a bank mhm okay good\nOkay a poke around in the accounting field and see if you can get on with one of them making about the same kind of money one of them I'd actually you for your degree\nYeah that's what I was thinking too\nYeah wouldn't hurt anything to ask around and see if we can make a job James and make about the same money and get free tuition or something that'd be very cool\nOn top of it but I'm I'm\nYou know you're not working a hundred hours a week you were going thirty hours a week twenty hours a week you can do this\nIt's very doable uh most people work when they're in school it's not that unusual really\nBy the way when I when I Do an event or\nI was just in San Francisco this week and we're doing an event we sit right of course all going to ask the audience or three thousand people there how many have you work when you were in college I mean it's like Ninety percent of the audience raise their hand now maybe the people that didn't work when they're in college and listen to my show I don't know but\nIt appears that most people work when they're in college that's what it looks like and so um I I think if I'm you I'm going to continue that route good question thank you for joining us a ... is with us in Houston Hi Lucia how are you\n[noise] hey I'm doing well thank you for asking I'm Talking to you and my husband and I I mean babysat ... getting at it that we are and what you call they looked at me and him for a down payment on or how much the same ... that we're working right now at about ...\nPercent about them I cough frequent down um are how they come before\nI'm going to say about one twenty five I'm after about negative cycle it's about one thirty two so I'm trying to make sure that I like them about like how much how I found that we are understanding on the um\n[noise] I I I think you recommend and I forget their take home pay exactly okay perfect and so I wanted to make sure that like right now where I pray for the million markets calculator them right now we're kind of had a funny one from Jerry I'm I'm I'm a\nI'm like a reasonable comfortable on now and I think number he has to have a little\nYou know it was a big now that it's a lot better than you're paying now\nBut if that's what that's like a fourth of your take home pay or less and your debt free with your emergency fund and blows you have the math spread to prosper if you continue to budget and stay on track the but again that's not what you should do that's the most you should do\nSo you can do less if you want to 'em or you can put it on a shorter term if you want to\nAnd you know I'm all by less house at Twenty one hundred and paid off in ten years there's nothing wrong with ... five years I don't care I mean you can do a lot of stuff but the most I Would ever tell you to do and I I don't even do that 'cause I don't borrow money at all for anything ever\nIs a Fifteen year fixed rate\nWhere the payment is no more than a fourth of your take home pay Luke is whether it's in Dallas Hi Luke welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\n[laughter] Hi Dave area\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nSo um my wife and I have been listening to you for many years actually my dad got new actually when I was a young kid and um\nTake care bye And I had to get a loan and we are hearing taking a cash out refinance house to knock out the high interest\nYou know and then start paying the debt off on the house because it got much lower interest rate [noise] and how much do want to share my student loan to the house she read at forty eight thousand okay and what's your household income\nActually clean takeover forty to sixty so I own my own business so last year we did sixty five this year we're looking at probably doing I'm probably going to bring a culture of forty two\nOkay I I don't know what you've been listening to on the show but in a twenty six years I've never told someone to do a refinance\n... take care of to pay off their debt ever except to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure and you're facing neither ... and so on now I I've never told anybody to do that\nOkay and the reason is very simple you make enough money to pay this debt off in a couple of years [noise] um you gotta work like a maniac and you're gonna have to have no life but then you're going to be dead free except your house and then you can work on paying off your house I'm\nFrom there and of course start working on your retirement and the other baby steps that we won't be groups but you can't borrow your way out of debt\nAnd on and if you pay this off within two years the interest rate on this becomes ... medically irrelevant\nWe're going to go in and also fast it's like you're keeping in for Thirty years it's a two year thing and and really is not forty eight thousand for two years more like twenty thousand for two years because halfway through you're going to be halfway through\nAnd and so yeah you guys need to get on a budget really really tight budget very careful where Donald in\nCut your lifestyle to nothing do everything you can all your business to increase your income because you need to clean up a student loan debt I agree with you on that part but no I don't I don't tell people tomorrow to get out of debt you can't borrow your way out of bed and then work to get your way out of a whole\nDigging out of a whole is a an oxymoron statement that we all might wish I'm digging out of a whole you're not digging out of hope you dig out the bottom of a holy gets deeper\nShe can't dig out of all you have to fill in the hall I get I don't know how to climb out of a whole maybe but you don't dig out of a home\nUnless you dig into China and work so no you can't\nYou can't you can't borrow your way out of that\nAnd that's the same exact situation so you got to stop that you have to break that cycle\nLittle on the sand and say without borrowing money\nEver ever ever shows that I Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare\nI don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just getting rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit\nYou're timeshare safely legally in forever is with timeshare exit team they have offices all around the country where you can sit
