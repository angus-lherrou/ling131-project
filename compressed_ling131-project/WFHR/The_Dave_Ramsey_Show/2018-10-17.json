CBS News\nBut I have to pay for all my life that you ... it was around [noise]\nAnd um ... who's taking care of the parent now\nWhile I'm like okay I didn't know what role and they'll help them out and you know or I Will courses online at night Ken Lay lo\nO gradually over there and\nStuff like that mhm that that like I have all that kind of like what should\nI saw all the other student loan to own a home run out 'cause you're back in school\nAnd how much they're no longer the\n[noise] how old do cruel credit card as well\nAbout two hundred and fifty years ago the quick one what's decent money\nShe makes about one twenty and I make about eighty okay\nSo the question that are that are out of the day that we have is um her mother and father passed away last year and uh she was an inheritance inherit and she has a certain amount of distribution every year for tax purposes my idea for the inheritance money I'm is who\nWon mom's from pay off all of our debt and then ...\nBut that to an IRA or so that we don't have to worry about ... sleep paying the interest game if you will or a worry about it that she um she is going to be good for our retirement\nUm my record added issue here we are thirty eight we've got a good amount of time to be putting into our\nI'm hanging out so I guess my my question is should we go ahead and take the distribution help all of our debt that we're no longer paying the um you know the interest rate or should we hate it down and we are a ... and it will be there for you when you when you're well\nWe've been using for almost Thirty years a decision making paradigm a decision making structure that is based on the idea of what is the fastest way to wealth what is the shortest distance to wealth\nAnd I'm In the process what in other words what gives us the greatest returns and what give what gives us the least risk what what has a level of wisdom to it um and is not just one sided it's not all investing in mind that it's not all\nThat in mind that it's not anything it's just a process of financial planning process that process has now been proven obviously doing it for twenty five years in many many people become millionaires and multi millionaires gradually not get rich quick using that process\nUm then the question becomes do you guys were you agree to use that process\nAnd if you're is so that the way I Would answer the question obviously me being me is I'm going to tell you use that process and that won't answer your question what to do with the money\nBut um but you've got a first decide do you want to do that or not I mean that's that's that's the core disagreement here what the process is based on the process is called the baby steps and what it's based on is a couple of things number one you're most powerful wealth building tool is your income\nAnd freeing up your income and not having that not only lowers risk not only increases the peace and the quality the relationship in the household but it also increases mathematically\nFreeze up all of your income just to make money with instead of giving it to banks and on and the second part of the things are driving the process is is that personal finance is eighty percent behavior it's only twenty percent had knowledge the stuff we're talking about it's not really rocket science here\nThere's not a lot to the math it's it's about fourth or fifth grade math is really all it is\nSo having said that we say baby step one save a thousand dollars you guys are obviously done that\nToo is to be dead free everything but your house you not done that three is to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses I didn't hear that you've done that and then some words you don't have that for a start putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement so how much is your emergency fund\nCurrently we have about five or so in our\nServings come if the inheritance was not on the table or we would teach you to do is take that down to twenty four\nThrough the uh or take twenty four of the twenty five and throw it at the vet and then clean up this debt very very quickly it is absurd for you to have Seventy five dollars in debt with a two hundred thousand dollar household income it was just right up that don't have\nA a couple of months ago and went on a on a life in a nice way to earn an on air that we might go wherever that\nOkay it's absurd that you make two hundred thousand dollars a year and you know twenty five dollars and that ...\n... ... you know you gotta make enough money to have done this the right way you chose not to do it the right way so\nIt's up to you guys but if you're going to do what we teach you know you would use this and heritage immediately to become debt free so that you take all those payments that you don't have any more in your years though it was to build wealth with you have paid for home\nIs the correct we we heard it more than I\nCan write and how much is in the inheritance in cash\n[noise] I I'm not quite a hundred miles north of born seven\nHundred and twenty five thousand dollars correct okay and why she taking distribution system just taking it\nOn her financial planner told her that she had a week or two I'm I'm covered a covert each year and a quarter of a good way to quit among the out of town\nIt's a bunch of crap um the\nUh okay because anytime you start making decisions based on taxes instead of based on economics you make bad decisions so I don't know what this money's invested in but I Want to get control of this money and getting invest it\nShot what would I Do I catch the whole thing out pay some taxes and um you know different financial advisor and uh I Would pay off all of that\nI Would invest the rest of it or in something that I can see controlling what it is in good mutual funds or in some paid for real estate or something like that I honestly don't think that's what you all are going to do but that's what I Would do um because\nI think there's a lot of cooks in this kitchen\nThere's a lot of opinions flying around here and you guys have got to get inside this end to as a couple decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do is show them telling you what to do and it's a different different situation so I think she inherited the financial advisor to\nI don't think he picked him\nAnd um and that's really a bad medicine\nAs well Ninety percent of the time\nAre you guys need to pick 'em or you need to re pick him and hiring again and this time he works for you but I think he's still works for grandpa even grandpa was dead and that's the way this stuff works usually bad bad medicine Travis what I Would do is catch the whole thing out pay off all my debts and invest the money\nWas watch less that's what I Would do and I would take your wonderful two hundred thousand lower income and become multi millionaires with it and that's what we've shown people how to do for almost three decades now\nHold on I'll send you guys are a couple a copy of the book the total money make over there to walk you through not only what to do but why to

doing everything you're going to be watching it you\nGotta or my credit card um okay that I called the credit card company to actually\nMove to count to come out of my name that we just want to remove the temptation of using a few that are way or absolutely\nAbsolutely and to be close the account completely not just cut them up and that'll keep them from reporting activity on your credit report and

Iowa I was interested in opening a five twenty nine plan for my daughter she has autism so I may open an ... account instead would depending on the ... and\nMy biggest concern is that I don't know what happened to the money and five twenty nine plan if she doesn't go to college can you tell me what happens to money not used for education\nOr it will be if you don't transfer it to a sibling um it'll be heavily taxed and penalize it'll be taxed and heavily penalize\nSo um\nYou know the five twenty nine is not a good plan a for a child that you're not sure what's going to happen this

designed for you all kinds of stuff with that but it's a good plan but\nI probably would just keep it were and get my hands on it and I'm I'm not a big deal either way the the thing the reason we push it ... does two things are ... in a traditional such a situation\nIt teaches you to brainwash your kid to go to college which is not a bad thing at all and the other thing is it allows that money to grow tax free\nAnd so it's a ... that's a wonderful benefits but is that ... is that the only possible way you can care for your child no\nInterest in a more traditional situation it's the best way the most um you know the least taxes on the thing which is generally what we wanted to um so we're letting grow but in this situation I I'm not the tax benefit is not worth the\nPension you in the
