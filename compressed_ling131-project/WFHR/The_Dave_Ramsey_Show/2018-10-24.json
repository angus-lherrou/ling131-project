I don't want to sacrifice going out on it as a vice you sports I don't want to sacrifice my rent a couch I don't want to sacrifice my effort to fifty it's costing me seven hundred bucks a month\nOr I don't want to sacrifice that\nTo get out of debt through Dave Ramsey is baby steps and so ... what I Want to go to jail I'll go to jail\nBut for the okay or ... or a three point five million dollars have not heard of the baby sat there that nobody they just truly I've lost all hope that they will never ever ever ever done out of it\nYou just hit the point they've lost out so they think I'll go to jail and then when I get out of jail I don't have any doubt\nAbout that because they may I I Want to believe in my the glass half full cup if there is one and laugh at that full cup that's not right\nYou know when I have full I get asked Georgia go out and opinion what do you think about that in the lobby he's like this he literally put his hands up and looked at this guy I said\nI Want to believe in my optimistic view yes that three point five million Americans this is an optimistic but that they just don't know that they can sacrifice lifestyle you can make different choices you can live on a budget you can take out an extra job for a short period of time and pay off that data is\nBut the sad thing is that they I wrote that they've just lost hope they don't think you're they don't know exactly how I Hope that someone someone doesn't say I would rather\nNot I'd rather not give up cable and go to jail because in jail didn't have cable and you know\nI don't think so I mean I don't know I think is limited and it's like murder she wrote from Thirty years ago so here's the fourth day Ramsey has a plan so we're having fun with this crazy stuff but the reality is if you're joining the show today and you feel that loss of hope you feel that desperate\nThat your basic freedoms you give up your basic right now we've\nGot a plan it's called Dave baby steps total money make over walk you through it join the show the conversation on a daily basis take inspiration from the men and women that are showcased every day on the show do that every scream\nWell and on this show and and the right to crochet we always have a couple of come in and share their story and when I left in it and it's ... you're listening to what you\nIt's it's everyday average American is people don't make crazy income they don't have like a super being Cape like no these are everyday people but choosing something different restaurant and at that you have to choose something different for a different outcome and so that's that's the parrot but again anyone out there you can do\nAnd trying to do both AAA eight to five five to five is the phone number that is how it started to take the step today triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Eric who's on the line and Kansas City Eric how can we help\n[laughter] hey how's it going good how are you sir [noise]\nUm so I have two options I'm a registered nurse and I'm not going to grad school either nurse practitioner scores see aren't in school [laughter] we owe a hundred K. on our house we're free otherwise [noise] um we have a four month old I'm looking at having a second baby and then next year\nI'm In the school like a cash flow and work full time through school would be a little bit longer it's about a five year program and totality um which is prerequisites and and I could not work\nAnd the dead of that would be Ninety thousand dollars at the end of it and so I mean the payouts are different obviously in ... make a hundred K. give or take a journey make fifty one Seventy five\nWhich do you really want if all those money things weren't an issue and you had the responsibility of the wife and the children in the house and all that which one would you want if you could snap your fingers\n[noise] [laughter] it's hard for me to personally answer just because there was a vantage isn't disadvantages to [noise] um I don't think I Would take away the are in a more right okay but I mean I Would be happy as empty as well\nOkay so the question becomes a can you take that next step or what do you call it the ... tea is that right\nYeah nurse practitioner\nOkay ill okay in ... and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\nNot without going back to that tree or program enjoy fame prerequisite\nLight but my point is let's say you're in ... for five to seven years and you've got a no debt you may even pay your house off in that time and so you cash flow your way through that as you move up the ladder how old are you\nTwenty nine yeah I just wonder can you do it just logistically can you do if you go into the into the situation you're going to cash 'em all that so no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to cash for your way through that ultimate role\n\nReally know what are you making now [laughter] the okay so you'd have a forty grand bump basically a year with that and how much does that go out there and he said that you the cash flow\nOr that one would be forty K\nTotal in the other one is nine thousand\nYeah correct oh you could do it just started bumped the salary honestly\nAnd go and do that it's forty can invest that but you're gonna make forty came back in a year the Atkins right if you do that I Know for ... and then go back to ... you may not be able to do than the other school right now like you said 'cause you don't the cash for it they're not don't go into debt for that\nBut go ahead and go to school get an upgraded job upgrade early and you enjoy it then that's an increase in income at least and yeah and then move into the school and a few years and ... you know\nThat ... I just want you to have that idea in your head I think where you pause you're sitting there\nTrying to run the numbers and I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there's a ladder to that ultimate goal might it take you seven or eight years yes but guess what eight years from now you're thirty seven [noise]\nYou can cash flow your way so I think it's both saying that's what I say because both of them are what you want to do both of them or something that you're good at\nArt folks more of your calls about your life your career your money here on the Daily Show don't go anywhere [noise]\n\nAre you one of the millions of empty nesters would look around their house and just see unused space it might be time to downsize but when you raise a family and I have a lot of emotions tied to your home it can be tough to separate the facts from the feelings\nAnd that's where and experts advise comes in handy Anna in Portland, Oregon knew she needed a real estate agents help when she decided to sell I had lived in my own for twenty five years and it was overwhelming to think where to begin\nYour E. L. P. helped me determine everything that needed to be done animals patient and put things into perspective with is help we at twenty\nBeards in three days folks there is no simple formula for determining when to sell your house\nBut partnering with a pro you can trust to provide honest advice will help you do what's best for you and your budget our real estate EL peas are great agents who can guide you in the direction that is right for you\nWe go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that's that's our one of our local guys if I sit down with Jeff and I we want to know that he's got the heart of a teacher well that's ... well I Do think you got to do some specific research there Chris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me\nAnd and it twenty eight you have plenty of time to get there but in the meantime while you're pursuing a plan I Can't say this enough\nYou're not being dishonest you're not being a shy stir in the current job so let go of some of that guilt um and and I think you're going to be fine I Would just would not let that way on you\nTriple eight to five five two to five is the number Ken Coleman Rachel crew sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour let's go to Kimberly who's on the line and nodding home Pennsylvania Kimberley how can we help\nI can um I Am fifty five years old I had been teaching and public school and the health care for 'em Thirty years\nAnd I just found in the last few years that on\nTime coming on or something else like that that the last year really then I'm drawn to real estate I looked into it um yeah I can collect my retirement um retire with a little bit of a penalty on as opposed to going all thirty\nOn a challenge or block is convincing like hung a good idea funded the price of\nAbout twenty five thousand dollars in salary but I Know that I can make that um I I really get excited thank God and helping people find Hong Kong happily and found I find that really interesting okay what I I Love my teacher in time for it\nI got good news I got good news for you and your husband okay so for you to become a realtor a successful realtor it's going to take you a little bit of time\nAnd I think the fact that you just reveal to us and our audience that used to enjoy teaching there is no big hurry you're not calling in a completely burned out\nAnd so I Would not take the penalty either or how many more years just for fun real quick how many more years would you have to stay in the role of teacher before he retired without penalty for five years\nOkay I just want to throw scenario you want is over the next five years you build your real estate business showing home that night and on the weekends\nI think that's extremely doable anybody who's ever been successful in real real estate knows you're going to build a pipeline your husband's only real concern cells like to me Rachel is that he doesn't want you to lose that twenty five thousand dollar that's just that's a scary thing certainly your age\nWhat if you kept the teacher salary for maybe three years still take a little bit of Hillary but I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business\nOver five year period is going to be here before you know it you step into retirement full benefits\nAnd by that time you should have easily replaced if not maybe another extra you know twenty five thirty percent above and beyond what you make you I think you can just absolutely double your income while still being a teacher I think that's the thing that I'd want you to consider Rachel\nBob and they had that great situation to be an because real estate usually agent show how those when people aren't working so that means it is night than it is we get that thought what the busiest time and so\nTo say hey I'm going to commit for maybe when you and your husband and decide that a year two years three years old can even go to five years if you can\nWhatever it is that they were and commit the amount of time and if you start to see yourself like well I'm really good at it because you sound very enthusiastic about it you sound like a people person which means you're gonna be a great residents say they drink a lot of people do great when they have great people skills as it sounds like you can really so\nEven though you're enthusiastic you still may not be great at it you can kind of get them things on your belt while you're learning for again a year or two\nMaybe three years whatever you and your husband decide\nAh and then kind of step into it yeah I wouldn't go cold turkey by any means but I think that this could be excellent having a great wrote that agent here and that or anything about it and it still commission base that you get to decide what you make basically like how much you work how many have you sell super fun versus going from where we're at the salary of the teacher\nTo do something like that can be very incredible for you personally and you may find that you're really good at it and maybe in a year's time about us\nAnd I think once you show the hobby replaces the twenty five right I Want to give you one piece of advice do and followed by the fees just on the show he trained to hospital stays specials Ryan Buffy be offended by and I find that common personal friend for days I've been on this show\nHe's the
