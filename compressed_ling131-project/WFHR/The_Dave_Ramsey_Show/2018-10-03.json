Rodrigues CBS News\nA new survey asked an assortment of Americans to take a multiple choice US citizenship test in just a third of respondents managed to achieve a sixty percent passing grade\nThirty seven percent thought Benjamin Franklin invented the light bulb twelve percent thought Dwight Eisenhower led troops in the civil war two percent said the Cold War was caused by climate change and that's a CBS world news roundup for Wednesday October third twenty eight\nAnd ... that right now to Katie in America we have more jobs that are available than there are people who were unemployed it is a fantastic job market even first day at home moms meaning you want to stay home but work from home\nAnd so what you have to first do is get very very clear you're in that first age and that is the stage of discovery so you've really got to get clear on what you do best and if you're struggling with the confidence on that I Want you to sit down with two or three people in your life and the next two or three days I mean right away make this urging\nPeople who will tell you the truth\nAnd I want you to say to them what do I do best of all the things I Do well what do I do best and then the second question is\nWhat I Love to do you've seen me you've been around me I'm twenty six have been enough work history for you or even in high school and college the subjects\nTo you know God the financial cocaine and other things too for physical mental and emotional health\nI think they've got about selling my house buying and he'll play where\nI was up there and it will be the center like concern that that is that on well there'd be some kind of liability\nGo ahead\nAnd get a somewhere to go as they get hurt a lot I Know that could apply for the and go after that\nIf I were to go after the fitness but I live in the same building that there but I don't know I'm Wondering if that would be an issue well\nYou've got a couple of things going on here put chicken I Want to own a a spend a little bit on each of them first of all I'm probably gonna be state specific so you definitely need to look at the law than your state in any type of regulation\nI'm you're gonna have liabilities regardless whether it's a stand alone studio or it where you live so you're you're going to have liability if someone gets hurt and you need to know what those are and to protect yourself with insurance um professional insurance product based insurance if you had a product that type of things do you want to look into that\nBut I Do just want to challenge and one thing for ... I Love your idea I Love the idea of a wellness center I Love the idea that you're helping people but here that are traditionally encourage people to do\nBecause you don't currently have a yoga studio and you don't have the idea of validated\nI Want to challenge you to start a little bit smaller and a little sooner so give me an example where is there a wellness center community center yoga studio ... studio somewhere where you could start your business\nSublease third base in their off hours builds your brand builder demand you have no risk no overhead no upfront costs\nAnd you're able to validate your idea until the business justify you getting your own space be that a duplex that you live above or your own stand on space I'll give an example there are a lot of churches that will operate when they're getting started out of like elementary school the elementary school right next door household they don't have to go on Sundays so they rented out to a church that use it on Sunday\nAnd it's it's a great deal to win when it's additional revenue for the school the church has a place to go without having to afford a whole building seven days a week when they can't justify it\nAnd I've seen a lot of businesses do this so I don't think your ideas a bad idea I Would just talents you just start smaller and sooner on a lower risk level lower cost level and validate your idea and build those relationships build your brand in your demand\nGet that going and then when you're ready to have your own studio it's the next logical step it doesn't feel like a terrifyingly so you definitely look\nInto laws and regulations for liability but also when you think about your space before you make that big commitment [noise] Patricia are you a lot of phone are you working full time right now\nAnd that was quite a lot I work full time and I found with Iran and on I was planning and also going back to back this year and that way I'm making more money but it will help them find them like business as well\nYeah I Will agree so you can I just wanted to know that fact because this this that piece of information please beautiful into what you're saying\nShe's going to have to do this on the side anyway she's not in a position to open up anything I don't think you would go right on open it right um I I just want to see you maybe do a little bit of yoga for some people maybe two or three moms when I see if you can get a small group in rent pay you\nBecause it's everything you just said but it allows you to tiptoe into it or the nurse practitioner thing that's going to school to get that will make more money I Love that too could allow her to cash flow have more cash piled on when it's time to to operate so I mean you you nailed it there I I just think ... you know don't rush into\nThe well and the other thing I Want to call out for anyone listening right now that has a service based business or like a yoga studio\nYou have a tendency to think that the studio is the business it's not if you ... you can go anywhere you can go to people's houses you can go to the park outside their calming and paying for you so don't feel like you have to have a location\nBefore you can start your business because you are the business so you can start tomorrow Patrice ... out of your living room if you want to learn and down the street and by the way you should go ahead totally yeah don't wait for the studio at the studios not the business you are the business point people don't care I Know we don't do it I mean ... enjoy it they're coming for you they're not coming for the building\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight to five five two to five ... sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour taking your calls about your business your business idea or a career career change career question let's go to bill who's on the line and Detroit Michigan bill how can we help\nThem out or to get a few good things are going how can we do [noise] so I've\nOn the chief field for about four years and to the point there really hasn't been I haven't progressive far like clear as I originally hoped and wish they would\nA long story short is I'm back in January was that I went through a pie view and as we're about to a baby step from ... to right now\nGoing through some of our stuff together ... gone we came in to some old old movies have a fish from stuff that she'd go from ... bad um when he died um\nAll the things we found you know we had a lot of old age millimeters old VHS law stuff and it's like okay we have a lot of stuff [noise]\nUm I started converting it and I really found a passion for that that I have an ad in a few ... and I'm thinking okay this sounds like something I could turn that triggered business doing going forward\nA slick at this point they lead\nBill let me interrupt what is the bit to get right to what is the business with the military or what is the business\nI'm converting the format like later VHS wide films that could digital content and properly preserve them\nOkay and so what's your question for us then I'm not a question I have is just um how\nTo get started um I definitely want to get started and I just want to make sure I'm stepping throw it properly and [noise]\nUm more tell you what Bill question\nBill ... he's ready to go she can cause we only have a little bit of time here I Want to be able to get to your your solution\nWe want to make sure we might help yeah here's the thing about the great need that\nAh when you were entering a bank where there's already people doing what you want to do it mean the idea's prevent so you're not doing something that's never been done before there are actually businesses that have similar type services what you didn't know is yet you're solving a problem and if you're selling a problem it's a viable business idea\nYou just have to find the people that have that problem that had the eight millimeters they want to preserve them\nAnd you're going to learn how who that person is you're going to go after them and build a business for them so you're going to price for them you're going to create marketing language\nThat speaks to them right where they are the best part about this bill it you know the idea is valid because it's been done before what you're going to do is you're going to build your business and you're gonna do it better and you're going to serve your customers and they're gonna want to come to you because you make a unique based for yourself\nIn that market a bell I Know my book is for women but I'm going to send it to you men read it all the time to business principles are the same and it gives you plan to take that idea to market I Hope it helps more than that to you\nKnow tried to great plans to follow it and and here's this thing a ... a lot of bills out there he said something that's interesting he finds these little things and you realize way oh hey don't have a happy about this\nAnd and you are giving him the steps the book is going to walk into it but I Want to just add when they try it just tested almost all of that last caller here's why some passion should be ...\nIt changes things when you turn it into a business\nThat you made a great point other people are doing this he just got to find people that are willing to pay him to do it and keep paying him into others have you need is done me tell you about bill he's going to start really small but start right away stop thinking about it stopped giving away I mean just you know water searches doing triple eight to five\nFive to do by coming up more of your questions about career starting a business [noise]\nDon't go anywhere\nYou heard me talk about id there for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare of the people go through when they become a victim\nOf the sixteen million victims of identity theft last year yes sixteen million twenty six percent of them have to borrow money from family or friends twenty two percent of them lost even more money by taking time off work and nine hundred thousand victims took out payday loans\nJust opposite freaking nightmare\nThat's why the only play on I have for my family and my entire team is through Zander insurance sander takes over all the work to solve these problems in more along with the system to reduce your risk and protect your money if your accounts get hacked\nThe reason I'm asking because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part\nTo validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can I run the whole thing without having a boss that kind of back me and you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited in Haiti because you're just going to do more of what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken said\nYou've got this light at the end of the tunnel when you're going to start to increase your family household income in other ways to your husband\nBut in the meantime if you want to spend the next two to three months building up the demand the client the relationship even just taking people to coffee starting to gather interest of other independent projects you could run on your own that could run through just new architecture firm that you're going to run as an independent person\nYou're building it up and of course it will be crazy for a season because you're getting more and more demand but then when you decide to leave your full time job it's the next logical step where the business can support you the income is they are of course that's only going to help and your husband had income so you're all ready I Would say twenty to thirty percent\nThem doing that you're not starting from scratch or not like I have full time job and I want to do this totally different thing how do I started out\nYou're already doing it you already have clients are working with I just want you to do more of that and then the next few months as you build that up that will start to ramp up as her husband's income comes in and it looks like first dear you probably should be able to comfortably leisure leader named them\nYeah and it comes down to a form of the you gotta work days baby steps days babies to fund the dream so when you put enough money aside plus the side business is there and then that's how you get to that number where you can step aside into Christie's point does not have to be a ... jump right in that should be a nice move and it just takes a little bit of time and patience lays on her way\nThe light at the end of the tunnels an important point can cause so many people still like how can I have to stay in this well you're not until January when you'd that light the talent you know the first season ended up in the head down for a season them and had the rewards it's worth it I think it's All right\nAll right let's go to ray real quick in Orlando, Florida re how can we help\n[noise] hey how you doing guys I'm OK though I've been in the field for the past Eighteen years and I love the
