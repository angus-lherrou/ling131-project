October temp twenty Eighteen ... CBS News\nThe Chris Hogan and the team just did for the everyday millionaire project you know we interviewed ten thousand millionaires among the things we found there and one of the things we found in this study before that that I read years ago was people who have wealth and keep wealth and build well\nHave a long term planning window\nWhen they're making a decision about an action a purchase something they're going to do they think to themselves house is going to affect me five or ten or Fifteen Years from now\nAnd they make decisions based on that they buy a car based on that rather than based on okay people who are baroque live who\nThank God it's friday oh God it's Monday they have a short planning window\n[noise] but my question is I've been looking into refinancing in my house because I have an F. A. K. and so I have\nMy and I when I Do the math like the six thousand dollars and closing costs versus a hundred and eighty seven\nMonth ended up being the three\nStraight it's going to go up so I'm not sure if that's the smart thing to do mhm\nOkay we'll stay in the home longer than three years is the only way you're gonna end up getting gravy on that biscuit right\nYeah for sure so um that's how you analyze it um that's that's kinda borderline that's the tipping point is much longer than three years I probably on your break even analysis I probably would not\nBut if you're you know Ninety percent sure you're going to be there longer than three years you're going to pass the break even point start making money even at a higher interest rate is what you're telling me right\nI'm In a well I'll get out of having to pay the hundred and eighty seven\nYou know but where your interest rates go up and offset that\nHe well he acts\nThree point seven five now and everything I'm getting a quote is about like for you know so you're not going to make any money [laughter] so is it better than I have an asylum\nAnd you're gonna be a flash you're probably gonna be four seven five on a Fifteen year right now uh today and so that's like a one percent spread 'em and so what is your a loan them out\n[noise] this one is a hundred and sixty six thousand\nOkay and so one interesting there at three years they've already paid off ten thousand him about\nOne percent on a hundred and sixty six thousand increase is sixteen hundred dollars a year\nOkay and you're only saving Eighteen hundred or a hundred and eighty dollars a month which is about two thousand dollars a year so no I wouldn't do this if that's the only if that's the numbers yeah I'm a bicycle breaking even to refinance and I wouldn't do that I pay the loan off\n[noise] and then add one other question I guess joined ... and in my area everybody's already in session but some of them have only done one class\nJumping I still don't even go in yeah jumping you'll be okay All right yeah the first classes on savings and you're already head of the game on that you're you didn't miss anything and you can go back and watch it on with your own line because you've got a one year membership and you can watch and listen to everything on line for a year\nSo yeah you go and watch the blessing one and then when you go in in Iraq whatsoever zone listen to your right in sync okay yeah no troubles are at all you're doing great way to go dawn you killed a ghetto Christine is with us in Boise idaho I Christina how're you\nDoing well thank you Dave I'm we haven't had a great situation for our family but I'm not quite sure how to cook the food we I'm told her home in California and walked away with a lot of equity um and had spent with the how much but we\nUm okay what is that how much equity about two hundred and forty thousand boom boom love it\nYeah I'm Still we're here it gets renting while we kind of figure out you know if we want to build their by [laughter] um but I'm not quite sure because we already have our our savings we have our retirement we have all that\nOut of debt that we get go yeah we don't have any debt good um but do we just go and maybe take cash for a house yeah what we want or at home we\nWe wanted we want where we you know we want something that's gonna cost us more than what we have a dog I Will put a small mortgage on it and pay it off real fast\nOkay you don't want to I don't think I met while I mean what's your household income or about a hundred and fifty\nOkay and what what would you be talking about building or buying what price range\nOh price range between four and six\nOkay and you have to forty in the bank okay so if we should for forty as an example Utah over two hundred thousand dollar mortgage right\nAll right how about your company that all five years really babbling yeah yeah I mean just knock it out how old are you guys I'm I'm forty five and my husband's fifty\nYou have any money in savings or investments to this not in a retirement account\nNo this is all kinds of it [laughter]\nAll right well my rule of thumb is never take out a mortgage that is on more than a Fifteen year mortgage and the payments more than a fourth of your take home pay you're not even going to approach that right right and then you'll be close to that and so if you take out a two hundred\nTwo hundred fifty thousand or more you're going to really fine house in Boise idaho for half a million dollars that's a lot of house that's wonderful property and about what\nWe're hoping more property than the big house you\nIt's a whole different world though obviously from where you came from rights\nAnd so um I mean you're bang for buck is huge in Boise compared to\nYou know big City California so um yeah you you're going to make a huge progress here and you know you just about whatever if you take a small mortgage or out in a small relative to your situation in other words I'm not going to yell at you know I don't borrow money so ... we'd be buying a two hundred fifty thousand dollar house and then we'd be soon\nMove up later and that's how we would do it 'cause I mean we don't borrow money for any reason ever but if it's only thing I don't yell at you for borrowing on on this show man in your case though just how the different mindset that the mortgage is just more like a car loan\nAnd we're just going to knock it out real fast and like other people's ... to Carla like five years or something you know let's just put on there and\nHow fast can we knock this thing in the head and let us get after it and that's how I Want to think about it it's a really good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Sarah is in California Hi Sarah welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDave how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nAnd I was wondering if I should tell my car worried about eight to ... ... pay off my about four thousand dollar a day and start my emergency fund like card paid off\n... what is your household income\nAbout thirty thousand a year\nYou should not have an Eighteen thousand dollar car ... you have too much ... going down in value when you're out on your car or things with motors your wheels of any kind of added up equals more than half your annual income how did you end up with an Eighteen dollar paid for car making thirty grand\nI'm married and we refinanced our house and included the car in the mortgage\nAnd then he got and and then we\nGot a divorce and we sold the house and the ... paid off\nGot it okay and I got a car and so what is your um what is your income prospects meaning you're thirty now where will you be in a year where were you being three years\nRight around thirty thirty tail so you don't see looking at ... you'll see there's doubling then no okay why\nI haven't got to school yet okay and I'm a single mother and fiber and yeah you you need the money more than you need that car don't you yeah\nI in the cars going down their value quick so yes Charlotte pay off your dad put your emergency phone in place you can get you an inexpensive car that you pay cash for probably in the five thousand dollar range\nOkay maybe seven or something like that there's something reliable and you can get lots of car for five to seven thousand dollars right now\nThan your debt free and you got a good emergency fund and then put you in a much better position but as a rule of thumb cars are the largest thing that we all by the goes down in value anything on wheels or motors for that matter if it's got wheeler motor\nIt's gone down about you and when you have all of that stuff I had it together you don't want too much of your life financially too much of the math on the wrong way\nAnd you get when you have more than half your in your own income tied up and things going down in value then that makes it real tough to prosper in your case you're going to change your income by going to school and things don't change later\nBut for right now I'm with you with shell that cost [noise] this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nIt's\nTime to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend a quick Churchill checkup then

before and those things are really hard to put on paper so what I have figured out is I'm going to live a hundred percent that free\nAnd I'm going to invest like crazy the rest of the money they're not having cash that comes in\nAnd I ended up with a ton of money doing that because I don't have any risk and I'm just investing real money not borrowed money so all of that to say if I woke up in your shoes I pay off your mortgage today\nAnd if you ... if this discussion bit sour on you and you think they ran she's crazy a year from now just get you another mortgage\nNo I I I completely agree I mean I for one thing that they just give it a lot of money I Do you know I just do that day and get paid off but my mind sort of back and forth\nPoint out is is that your the your gut is not intellectually wrong your mind is your minds using an incomplete primitive formula [noise]\nGot it that's what I'm pointing out that makes sense completely yeah paid off that you got this thanks for

... you just can't think that way and you have a different way of looking at things show um\nBut then you can really do a very sophisticated mathematical application of this it would just take a lot of time too much time really on the radio to walk through the whole thing\nBut what happens is is think about this how many of you if you had zero that and you looked over in your four one K. and

thing you've always wanted to do why are you waiting\nYou know here's the weird thing is that saying you've always wanted to do is probably where you make the most money you've ever made in your life
