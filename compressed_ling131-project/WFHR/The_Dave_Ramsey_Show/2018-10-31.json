I made a mistake that the early ... thirty three ... and get the Kelley Blue book is thirty two oh great\nOkay so you can only lose a thousand dollars by selling their car you'd only write a check for a thousand dollars it'd be sold it for thirty two but you had to give the least couldn't be thirty three to get the title you're a thousand and the whole right right right now your lease payment is how much\nMy [laughter] at least eight minutes five hundred and forty two dollars a month\nAnd then how many how many payments the remaining but we have about Eighteen came in okay\nI'm just putting that in here that's nine thousand five hundred and Seventy six dollars mhm mhm so if you sell it today you lose a thousand if you keep it you lose ten thousand\nYeah no brainer salad okay okay you see how the analysis now let's look at the second one then right what's the value of the second one\nSo the value of the second vehicle and twenty five\nOkay in the early buyout on it\nThat early buyout on it I'm ... apologies the early ... twenty five okay I haven't done the Kelley Blue book 'em out but I'm sure it ... I think actually in my head but I live in town then for that one where really in the hall\nAnd okay and what is the lease payment on it\nThe lease payment is two hundred and thirty dollars\nRight and how many of those are remaining fourteen why payment to show that um let's see here to thirty or forty and is\nThirty two hundred dollars if you keep the car till the end of the leash and hand them the case right yet as to thirty times fourteenth okay and that one is somewhere around fourteen thousand and the whole today okay so you get to drive this car for free\nUntil the end of this lace on that one you keep it 'cause I'd rather lose thirty two hundred and fourteen thousand and I drive the car\nOkay you see what I'm doing yes comparing a\nTotal of your payments against the amount you're in the whole\nShow that one that one I Would probably keep it for your husband's numbers are correct on their value I suspect there\nI suspect you're going to keep it anyway because I don't think he's going to be that far off I mean we got a fourteen thousand dollar deficit right now if he if he's eleven value is right but even if he's half wrong it's still a seven thousand dollar deficit versus three thousand to keep it\nShowed that one we keep\nOkay and you pay it out now is it overall miles\nThat one way I'm drawing mile\nOkay and the the wear and tear you're going to keep it up so you're not going to have to write a check when you turn it in fourteen months from now\nNow they're both in that ball that one thing great condition\nOkay good good yeah that one or you see how did that analysis\nYes yeah that really clear that Amtrak when they were really struggling with what you\nProbably are not really being that one and you know what I Would do is move on past\nA baby step to once you've gotten rid of the the big car the more expensive one and once you've gotten rid of all your other debts except this but if you still have this one with the two thirty payments were just written a car all the way through the end here and you might as well keep the car you get no advantage to turning it in our early\nRight right you're going to like the three thousand\nTwo hundred and twenty dollars worth of two hundred and thirty dollar payments no matter what you do so you might as well drive the dad gummed car you know and um if you want to put thirty two hundred dollars aside extra in your emergency fund just to make sure you got that plus your emergency uncovered the call yourself in baby steps two and three then that's fine\nBut that's how you do the analysis on whether to keep a leash or not and um\nMost of the time unless you're close unless you're close to the end of the lease you're going to be selling the car and that's what happened with the more expensive one there it's killing you\nKnow that one was a beast bite ya\nSo good question thank you for joining us ... ... if you've never heard the saying it's kind of a country saying you're getting ... east\nWhich means it it's it's like a a a sheep getting its for removed that's where it comes from your getting ripped off as a fleece means that's why I call them car fleet says because if we take the value of the original\nMarket value of that car that thirty three thousand dollar car on the expensive one there for those folks and I put that five forty two into a calculator and then I put the end of value into a financial calculator with residual value at the end in other words the residual values what you can buy the car for at the end of the lease\nYour your games up number at the end of the leash you put those numbers on the calculator you come back out what the effect of interest rate is\nIn motion of the time it's around fourteen percent\nThey call it cost to Capitol\nAnd they don't have to disclose the interest rate the AP are to you you know if you get a car loan you get this there's truth in lending sheet the Federal Trade commission make she makes them show you a PR the annual percentage wretched you're being charged but when you're leasing it's technically not that\nUnder the law [noise] and so you 'cause you're renting a car\nAnd so they are not required federally to disclose the cost of capital or the interest rate but you can figure it out with a calculator it'll make you view [noise]\nI mean it's ridiculous that's why we call it's leasing is the most expensive way to operate park the car lease is a disaster\nDisaster as a financial issue [noise]\nYou could just do the math you can understand what I'm saying\nThis is the rams are\n\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nTo be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and eating to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dot

had\nSome resistance definitely you know it's um all all the stuff you talk about why why would you if you can get zero percent interest why would you not do it it's free money when yeah no I don't get it\nAs a differential what is the key to getting out of that you've done at your coaches your blood classes you've done everything\nI think the key is vision I think you have to see where you're going I think uh if I have any criticism of myself as I said I'm probably too long term oriented and I think that has been I Believe your strengths actually argue weaknesses run for so long term sometimes I forget the little short term\nYeah he's very very determined and on I was the one that like that first started on the journey and I was so excited about that look like I get to read it and
