Tom Brady this patriots seems seems to have found is October rhythm now thirty eight point the last two games for Kansas City they've never not had a rhythm this year with Patrick ... multiple record breaking start\nYou know I've always said if you're going to get New England you get them early and and I played for coke spell check and just over a lot for the is starting in training camp or they get a little bit better every single day and what happens\nThey're taught to be once you get the December January and really the consistency offered by their quarterback is the key to the whole thing Tom Brady over the years has been phenomenal he's got almost three hundred starts as an NFL quarterback you can't present him with a look at the house in the you look at Patrick my home and start number seven\nAnd Kevin I I I think the two young quarterback most excited about the NFL right now our courts and went in Philadelphia and talk to my home ballot jak will present him with a variety of law and I can be the biggest challenge of his career with two of these but which of these defenses Mike\nIs going to be able to make the stop because that has been a problem at times for both defensive teams certainly for Kansas City for most of the different challenges for both teams Kansas City has given up more yard than any team in the NFL\nAnd it gets exaggerated because they lose their pass Roger tonight jumps in Houston top or the these are out of the game which tells me they're probably going to have to play warzone to protect their bases but you can't just ends on all night again Tom Brady they've got a huge out\nThe flip side the New England is how the heck the top three of the most phenomenal player makers environment about so something wrong with three months they didn't last year then you've got this\nKilled special teams terms than he might be the fastest\nI've ever seen in bad and then finally Kelsey guy\nHe's probably the most gifted receiving titan and

Sunday Night Football but I think Kansas City chiefs and the New England patriots\nInterestingly Kansas City has one\nOf the regular season last two times at these teams that played in in each of those seasons patriots would go on to the super bowl winning one and dropping last year a Super Bowl but you don't think you know about this is this is probably as Mike my points out going to be a bit of attract me to high scoring game and Tom Brady realizes that they're going to have to get out quickly on his team\nI think they were pretty good advantage in the first quarter of the games are gay and they had all these teams end up playing from it and that's where we want to play but it's tough to do so going against a team of five and I was really no margin of error and I'm ... great jobs in

there's no doubt about the fact that Patrick homes has been ... this year during fourteen touchdown passes three of them do is three time pro bowl tied in Travis Kelsey this week I asked Travis about how this kid looks out there right now\nI mean he's always had the tools physically to be able to come in to start right of ways I think he uh he learned how Alex drove the ship last year and I'm at the very creative guy\nSo ... is understanding of the game is a little bit different than everyone else is so he sees things kind of develop a little bit different and right now everything is showing through everything that he's a he's creating back there is a founding of course\nYou guys went in there last year you played them you beat them and you know nobody's ever going to talk about being overconfident play in the New England patriots but when you start looking at what you did last year does that help in terms of the overall confidence of this team walking into the situation again\nYeah I Would say our confidence just with the group that we had this year I mean we're not really look at it last year rather than a maybe a couple of this ... that we are going to try to stop everything about this year we got new guys in the building we have a new a new mindset\nAnd I mean we have one of the best coaches and the league that we think is going to put us in a great position every single week so it's really just based on the confidence that we've built to paint this year and not really looking at ... years\nOr they didn't years past was they ran out to a great record last
