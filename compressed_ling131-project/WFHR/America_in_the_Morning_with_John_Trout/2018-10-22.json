our privacy which a lot of people are aware of but that invasion of privacy the information they collect on us allows them to manipulate us in steer us\nIn ways that we don't even know and that has implications not only for a American society bought for how we choose our leaders and the politics of the country it's it's central I think to where we're going over the next ten to Twenty years\nI have crossed the line in terms of the anti trust laws\nI think they clearly have they engage in anti competitive behavior up because of the way that the Internet is regulated or or divided up between the\nSo called neutral platforms and media companies they've gotten a free pass in terms of regulation because they insist that they are neutral platforms and therefore they have no legal liability they have no regulatory controls whatsoever\nBut the fact of the matter is they are not neutral platforms they do it meant that they exert editorial control or that they do I'm a ... certain stories and push other stories so I think this calls for a fresh look at how we deal with Google and I think\nPart of that fresh law has to be looking at antitrust action they dominate roughly Ninety percent of global search in the United states it's eighty five Ninety percent\nAnd that to me as a dominant position that's anti competition [noise]\nThe people at Google mistaken actually maintain the pretense of they don't play favorites uh with uh uh various postings and I gather that the that is simply not borne out by an awful lot of examples to the contrary [noise]\nWell that's right I mean just take a local search or commercials search about ten years ago companies like Yelp and trip advisor accused them of cooking the books and search in favor of competitors to those companies that happened to be owned by Google Google said no we don't do that these are search results organic\nThere's simply reflective of the best results that that all our algorithm provides\nBut the problem for Google is that the Federal Trade commission and the Obama administration the European Union academics at Harvard all looked at this and said you're lying\nYou are cooking the books there's additional research that's been done by Dr Robert ... of Harvard PHD former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine ah he's done peer reviewed studies on what's called search engine manipulation of fact and he demonstrates a power that Google has\n... results even in the political realm so as far as I'm concerned that debate is over the question becomes how we deal with this power that Google has ... in

the Gobi Desert for pizza and give the shows I mean I I don't I'm Wondering if geographically there are problems in considering a Google as under the quote jurisdiction of the United states\nAnd I think that's a great point I mean Google would say that there are a global company they have a presence or around the world um and it's very possible that if the regulatory a foot was dropped on them that they would say we're moving to Singapore and we are now a company based in Singapore and therefore\nThe regulatory or anti trust actions I was a federal government don't apply to us you also have
