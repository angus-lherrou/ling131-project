fraud so who better to talk with Jordan Goodman America's money answers man online at money answers dot com or first of all it's been a bumpy ride of the late on Wall street why\nWell the stock market went down very sharply because interest rates are rising there's concern that earnings may start going down and the future that they've been pretty strong right now that they would go down the future um and the more about with China and certainly can concerning people as well that that's going to slow the economy when these tariffs hit on both sides\nI Want to talk a little bit about the interest rates historically correct me if I'm wrong interest rates are still very low even with the the recent fat increases in interest we've gone from almost nonexistent they addressed up to historically very low interest so\nWhat's got Wall Street so hot and bothered I mean it's not like we're talking about a a fourteen and Fifteen Percent interest like forty years ago\nWe got spoiled Jim basically because interest rates the vendors are kept them pretty much at zero\nFrom the end of the financial crisis in two thousand eight after two thousand Fifteen they've gone up seven times down from zero now to two and a quarter meaning the crime rate is five and a quarter but you're a historically things are still relatively low rates particularly with the economy during this this well\nUh but we like zero I guess they complain when it goes up\nI guess well some of us like zero I mean and I understand that I'm On the side that that that does I I'm more of a bar where but if I Lived off of interest income which more than a few people do types have been tough of late yeah\nYou haven't been able to live off of interest in the last few years because you've been getting pretty much nothing\nAnd that's the irony of the situation the fed has been raising rates and the banks immediately pass that on in the form of higher interest on credit cards in student loans and car loans and so on but they have not been passing it on in the form of higher deposit rates and paying the fathers and you've got to do something different\nIf you're just going to sit there and the hope that the

reasons either delinquent or in the fall\nAnd it's a huge burden thirty nine thousand is the average amount that people are graduating with something they can do is they still have a high rate they could refinance it\nTo a lower rate typically two to three percent a place called credible can do that so a website for that would be credible dot com slash money as they know it's to me that way you get two hundred bucks off your first payment\nBecause otherwise this is just crushing people Thirty years of paying on student loan debts and in many many cases in a major they're not even involved that are not not working I'm an ...\nThat's the part I don't understand here to take on the amount of debt that some people have six figures of dead is not hard to do for a college education not to do
