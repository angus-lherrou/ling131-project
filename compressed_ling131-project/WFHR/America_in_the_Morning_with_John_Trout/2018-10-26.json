certainly been an unusual presidency and no one knows that better than the man who has covered for presidency for three different news organization CBS News chief White House correspondent major Garrett\nWho was taking time to write Mr Trump's wild ride published by all points books subtitled the thrills ... an occasional blackouts have an extraordinary presidency you lead off here with a prologue that is that a very revealing it as you you know or perhaps it was a it should have been more revealing\nThat it actually was do you say it's titled or what I should have learned and this was the first thing that Donald Trump ever said to major\nMajor fantastic I Want to do with President Obama two weeks ago he was not thrilled I'm sure I'll be more thrilled unquote what was it that you should have learned briefly\nThat there's so much that comes with Donald Trump that's right out in front and he doesn't hide things that he doesn't speak\nIn a kind of a double talk or synthetic language that a lot of experience and capable politicians use most things about Donald Trump are very visible and in that prologue I take myself to task for not understanding what I could have learned\nAnd just looking at the words and the sentence you just read I won't give it away because it's an entertaining prologue but I Do take myself to task for not saying hey maybe there's something right here in front of me and if I just spent some time to look and listen and learn\nHow to get ahead of the game it took me many many months of being around Donald Trump to figure out what I look back in retrospect might have been more obvious to me and it's been a little bit more time\nAnd another point of the book was Trump's wild ride you note a thank you rally he held in Wisconsin just outside of Milwaukee after he had won the election\nAnd uh you note that Paul Ryan was there the house be grid not appeared once with Donald Trump during the campaign that is to say the twenty ...

temperatures for more than six hours and Ryan says in that crowd of seven thousand I recognize maybe ten people I've been doing a Republican events practically all my life I didn't know any of them before not Republicans were Trump voters\nAre at the time I said the Republican Party was undergoing a hostile takeover I guess in a in a way it was\nIt was and it sort of depends on your definition of hostility a as Trump likes to say the rallies are full of spirit and energy and the great fire that he loves and the Trump supporters have this kind of almost ... billion call and response with Trump whether it's the wall or in a much\nMore aggressive sense lock her up really talking about Hillary Clinton but they have this sort of play act relationship is that all hostile\nWell Trump doesn't things so Trump supporters do lots of Republicans look askance at and say we're direction is this all leading us well it led Donald Trump to be the forty fifth or as the United states and those Trump supporters to identify with the Republican Party at least branded as they see Trump branding it as their new political home the duration of all that\nI don't know I Do not have a unified theory ... about where all this is going\nI Do just try to describe what I've seen what's happened so far and what it might mean\nIt's interesting you note that an awful lot of people who were fed up with the conservative politicians who talked conservative but didn't always vote conservative really led to a great extent to the Trump phenomenon and yet that inconsistency which is quite understandable that it did cause consternation among Republican ranks\nUh Donald Trump has shown a great diverse agility of a a convictions over the years and that doesn't seem to bother his supporters as much\nDoesn't bother us support or is he is probably the least of angelic all a Republican who has been in politics for the last twenty or Thirty years to have as for support among evangelical Christians and ... Republicans and conservatives I also point out in the book and one of the most disciplined and focus components of the Trump Administration\nThe federal bench starting with the Supreme Court but
