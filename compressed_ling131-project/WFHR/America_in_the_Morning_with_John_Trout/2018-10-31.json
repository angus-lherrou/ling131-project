days\nFor Thirty years ago this really was unheard of the all the uh the southern portion of the Bible belt\nOr like our land or Six Flags over Texas that nowadays you can find some of the best Halloween uh uh I I guess the facts and\nAnd different uh different events that places like universal studios knots berry farm in California Kenny ... and ... west ... um I guess the Halloween weekend

Carolina\nAnd a and one is ... how the streams so there's a lot of it it becomes very big business and people just love going to these events\nSo I I guess age appropriate message is important for many of these things right I mean you you can't a scare the daylights out of the some kid who's five years old\nThrough and the great part about the news and parse whether it's summertime wintertime or even Christmas Time is that there's something for everyone at the parks you got the the really crazy rides for the kids you've got the smaller ride\nFor the uh you know for the toddlers you've got fantastic shows where everyone really has to audition in order to actually be picked a food or you know the different types of food and plus for the older people they they ... scooter is now a because

really\nAnd two hundred and fifty million chance of being involved in a faith Halladay add an amusement park an added that Ninety five percent of those instances we'll be right or ... not the actual the amusement park but something that the writer did a that was not something that they needed to do or what told not to do during the ride\nFor the rides based on all aspects of pop culture like video games or or movies like like say Ghostbusters are there other rides based around these things you will\nFind a ride based on most of the marvel and DC Comics of course Batman you'll find several of those all around you've also got a\nAll the rides but Spider Man for example or you've got to Iraq and roller coaster which is a geared towards the Aerosmith uh people of Arab Smith a it's a very big way to draw people in is to make it after a movie or a comic or something that uh that people can actually\nUh you know in get involved in and most importantly while you're waiting to go to these
