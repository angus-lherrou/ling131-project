Mukherjee were pretty good as freshmen in the old a two thousand two season ... used to ask you Ryan Wagner Adam rock would in the twenties for gene campaign started out as freshmen you don't often see three freshman\nPlaying together but when you have nine freshmen in five freshman forward just going to happen you know you're going to run into that little wheel and spin it and see what comes out so uh you know but the thing that's nice about that line is they just complement each other so well I'm you know and and after that first game of the year\nI think I said the ... that's a line that we keep together for four years\nAnd just to don't don't bother breaking that up just because of that and how they play and how how they read off each other and a kind of like I said that the the opening face off they just set the tone I mean that you're never going to question their work there's going to be mistakes made when you're never going to question their work yeah Roman a shot\nHis first goal is a battery had two points tonight ... field had an assist denied as well a dominant Marsha I'm was plus one a couple of penalties ie just throws his body around funding models hit the post yeah he wrong one strong health opposed to Shaun ... back to back to old and I see you've got five goals already this season mark and\nLast year he had fixed as a freshman I Know the coaching staff and many others including himself thought he could\nProduce a little bit more now we're seeing an army yeah I think he was probably disappointed and I'm self last year and a you know the the fun thing to watch with him right now he's playing the game the right way and he's getting rewarded for it so\nAre you going to continue to do in that I think his confidence going to grow a you you're going to see his game go to another level and a ... like we said they were or stress in playing that game the right way and then staying on top of the park but\nThe way that he is playing in the way he's talking to communicate and was made to read and all those guys very well he's sticking his nose in where he can and\nI just wanted to watch them yeah special teams were good tonight weren't there they were you know what their outstanding I thought it again or if the guy's shared the pocket and uh\nYou know again it goes back to the self was part of the game I think that's where it started on the power play\nOf the guys didn't care who's going to score the goal or they're just going to work work as a group of five and find a way to get it done and\nOn the flip side or the ... killed in a nice job minister Daniel he he played outstanding\nUm but the guy getting a penalty I think the bench ... was the guy said it best what has\nBeen all day let's do the job for the guy who got the call and let's go up there and do the job and and find a way to get it done and they kept the shift short a so we can pressure as much as we could\nUh and they did a nice job my excited for next weekend

through an NBC Sports we let me see sports radio dot com eight five five three two three four NBC the phone number let's get out to the guest hotline right now the NBA's back opening week opening weekend into lots of interesting storylines already and who better than the online editor of ... dot com and uh he's either at Hooters\nWhile who's or watching his ... in Fresno state bulldogs right now to Darryl how was that barrel\nGo does go seven baby a dog's a wedding guest Nevada oh I said earlier I had it wrong it was New Mexico they're made in our\n... thirty eight to seven no friends yeah but you're taught me a little while ago that there are playing the battered and what's the matter with\nYou yeah yeah I I I was I was drunk\n[laughter] well I Am now so or even on the airwaves here and NBC Sports radio um\nLet me ask you a question about the Lakers here I I I agree with Charles Barkley Daryl I I think Lorenzo boss will be starting I think that the jaws hearts will be starting I think it's a surround the wrong with the kids because a lot of these veterans they started to one year contracts aren't going to be on the team next year when they go into free agency again next summer\nI think it just dumps the development of the young guys when they're not starting\nScrew the development LeBron James can't play with young kids you know that they always ask for veterans wants to Mike Miller and James Joe's in July Ron Howard and and the Smith playing that he's an old man he needs the old days we knew we never\nPlayed with young guys and I'm not saying this is going to be a perfect fit 'cause the way it's going to work out but the mere fact that he's starting alongside Ron Ron do in the movie is called well pope and a veil muggy lets me you know what we talked about all summer long\nHe wants to play with a veterans and sure enough even though he's veterans along with Michael Beasley the three that they brought our costs less than a million dollars nobody wanted them ... these are the guys that he's going to depend on\nBut none of those guys are going to be on the team next year debate side of the one year deal or they could cut them loose and to get into the free agency the summer\nAnd that is why I predict that they would have within thirty five now everybody is coming along the thinking there say I have this\nGuy started this guy played and this guy came or what is not going to happen with this guy was hurt and he's gonna be hurt they always get hurt\nYou know it's these things are other things that happened and I don't think I made it on the Lakers they're going to have a great future they're going to be the warriors of twenty twenties decade they're going to win championships it's a great roster it's a great future is just going to be a a ... a year of adjustment this year and that's what they're going through right now\nLet me ask you a question here they were the worst three points shooting team in the league last year they were awful against the Portland TrailBlazers again the other night to where the kids to me\nThe ... the rookie ... why did he play at all he's their best shooter\nDave Smith when you're relying on a second round rookie to save the day you know you're in trouble already on a date on game to come on now come\nOn I mean they were all claim of course they were over six feet at one point not why not bring him in for a few minutes\nBecause they have horrible shooters have eventually you're right they're gonna have to rely on him but he's going to have other witnesses in his game they aren't going to be there this team is just going to ... has a lot of old\nAnd I don't think deep down I don't think the Lakers really mind they know what's your next year is going to be there to make the major splash next year ago at a major star next to her lungs a ball and Brandon Ingram will be twenty two years old you're closer to their\nYou know becoming good players instead of good prospects\nNext year they're going to be a fifty when franchise in the future is all theirs but this year is just not a physicist on a a good roster there's a lot of holes no big men those shooters no chemistry and these guys have them play together it's one of the five Louis teams and chemistry of guys who haven't been around all this whole people's assembled in the last two years\nBrennan Ingram is the only liquor who's been there for entering its third season\nBut right Darryl how're ... with the what embassies more weight on NBC Sports radio dot com bust well you'll get not fully yourself you know that not returning my phone call last week what's the matter with you\nWell I I I'm I've been thinking all kinds of heat every Laker fan of hockey an idiot [laughter] the last three actually been calling me any for five years they welcome to my world is\nPredicted that they were going to not make the playoffs five years ago when they get when they had Kobe after they got rid of Dwight Howard and they were about you know ever since then I said we're not play off the no one ever said walk though they're all you were right congratulations and this is just another year of that I hate to be full of myself [laughter] it's pretty obvious I say I think\nThis team households as it's nothing astounding to say they don't have three point shooters they don't have centers there's nobody on the roster who plays regularly a thousand minutes it's you know it's it's just the team with a lot of glitches in ... I think everybody is now seen after a week\nAnd hopefully they get it together because I Love these players they have a great future is just the president is going to be a struggle\nI said earlier on the show tonight I think the most impressive team I've seen so far the New Orleans pelicans with a hundred and thirty one points on the road with the wind over the Houston Rockets and then a hundred and forty nine against the king's last night and I think that three guards said\nThat ... going with this is very very smart spreading them out doing with regards and you know a de being a D and uh\nBut look at marriage with thirty and then thirty six his first two games and Julius Randall permit this off the bat I really liked this team\nIt's a good team they they've been together for so long\nThey've grown together they are right now where the Lakers will be a year or two now I mean they taking their lumps they've had their playoff disappointments last year where they were the number three feet and got swept and they had all summer to stew on it and the management brought back almost twelve Thirteen players on the squad pretty much brought back everybody\nI might might be fourteen right even exactly sure\nAnd I keeping his team of chemistry together year after year after year\nIt just makes them stronger and better and they got such bright bright future you know at one point they didn't have the bench and three point shooters and that was one of the criticisms of them and now\nI Do think though that the raptors made to upgrade what they had ... presidents and replacing a replacing Dwayne Casey with Nick Nurse number to collide Leonard's a better player than the Marta rose\nI agree that ... people are forgetting about him in the equation he's one of the top ten centers and basketball and nobody even knows how to pronounce his name is now with San Antonio spurs so they are the top ten ... a top five shooting guard and I think they came out pretty even on the ... as close as you can be expected\nNow you throw in you know instead of coaching no Nick Nurse she could be a very fine coach\nBut you have to start over chemistry starts all over again the only longtime raptors on that team or Kyle Lowry and you're on this phone stillness all these guys are new to get her playing under a new system it takes time and you just don't pick up and win fifty five games like you're just a year before you have to start over\nA whole new system and that takes time it's kind of what the Lakers are going through right now with all these newcomers\nLearning a whole new system whenever\nA new team has to come in and learn things and they go up against the Portland TrailBlazers who complained together forever a Miami Heat are Golden State warriors why that's been playing together forever those teams are at a mismatch\nThe rate Darryl how're the online editor for ... days but they wouldn't be the worst winter and NBC Sports radio dot com or you look at the timber wolves or a Jimmy Butler thirty three points I'd only twelve sought attempts the other night a magnificent performance seven ...\nHe's booed last silly mother timber wolves fan says the game starts but by the time the game ended they were chanting MVP with with the ... and you looked last year I think they were thirty three and Eighteen when they're played last year they would have been number number three seats so uh I\nThink the abs is correct in\nThis fighting scratching and clawing to try to make this work and keep them on the team and not deal I'm away\nYeah I think I think I think we've all discovered that crazy butler is the best Jimmy above her [laughter] and he goes crazy yes in practice crazy in the interviews everybody loves them I don't care if you're from Los Angeles New Yorker Minnesota itself I think the world is falling in love with crazy butler I think crazy but at least falling in love with himself\nAnd he's taking his game to a first female NBA level the way he's playing so Karlan\nMe towns and Andrew we're gonna have to fall in line because he's turning out to be a good leader when he looked like a dysfunctional member of this group so we'll see how long that last but crazy butler as wiling people right now and I'm a big fan and I think a lot of other people or\nYou know the very fact that Minnesota was Kenny MVP MBP after ... him in the beginning of the game tells you how hearts are changing\nWell he made an excellent point when he went crazy and practice the other day when he was cursing the general manager and the coach and his teammates and and kicking the starting teams with his with his third team scribes out there and then he said afterwards he said the best player on the team no that would be called up and down so I'm not the most talented player out there that would be Andrew Wiggins but\nI play harder than anybody and he was insinuating those two guys from soft and I think he's correct as good as they are and I love ... and I love towns but they are soft and I think they need a parasite Fifteen shoes right Nick ... Easter and to be kicked hard and I and I think Jimmy Butler was correct in his assessment there\nRight right and I think with typical rewarding Wiggins and towns with the money\nYou know it it kind of soften those guys that you weren't seeing that type of thing and Butler's the only one that can hold the fire to the fighting and even though Jimmy Buffett wants to get his money too and he's not going to be happening until he gets it\nUntil he gets his Mac contract but if he gets these guys inspired to play any of the rest of the teams already bought in ... and everybody else they love crazy but if they want this to happen if the two the two high paid stars can buy in and we start seeing the results on the floor\nHe will get his Mac contract and they will go on otherwise if they have to train them it's a team that I don't know if they can make the playoffs without 'em\nThere who's the worst team in the NBA is it the Atlanta Hawks so you know as much as much as we love Vince quarter at forty one years old and he's starting for you you don't have a very good\nThe kings are God awful so who's the worst team in the NBA\nThe worst team is the first came to pull the plug their six teams out there that will end up taking at some point the Sacramento Kings the Phoenix Suns the Atlanta Hawks in New York Knicks went nuts and someone I'm forgetting those six teams are going to\nThey're going to end up taking it on purpose which everyone pull the plug first will be the one that finishes with a worst record 'cause I think all six or on the same bottom tear\nBut it's really tough to separate who exactly is the worst it will be the team that doesn't want to win and let's see if the next ... coal\nIf they don't bring stuff for seniors back when he was ready to play and that's a theme that could have the worst seat the Sacramento Kings to be the team and as you point out the Atlanta Hawks but they don't play Jeremy Lin and there are other veterans you know they're trying to lose so we'll we'll see who calls the plug first\nGot to be traded do you think that's a a a fair thing or it's going to say if I don't get anywhere near equal value you can leave us a brazen at the end of the year\nYeah I don't think he's going to train them I mean I think the students will see it addresses in February and you know unless something happens in the next few weeks where he makes himself intolerable and has to be treated\nI don't I think this this story runs along so February at that point bill judge whether they can re signed him or not and at that point they might have to train them and take whatever they can get rather than get nothing in the end but right now I think they want to write this wave and see how it goes because there's a chance he could get towns that we can still buy in\nThe kind of a blessing in disguise Tibet trade with the he didn't go through because the Josh Richardson's really good player and he's had a couple of good games and and the Miami was also going to throw in a number one pick add another player or you think maybe it it's better to keep a Richardson and the number one pick then make the butler trade\nWill now you're asking me but my GM hat on if you're telling me that I'm the Minnesota temples and I get Josh Richardson\nThem out of bio that's enough for me those two guys are studs especially bad out of ... he's going to be a phenomenal center I mean ... when she can charge centers Ben Wallace type who when defensive player of the year and Josh Richardson's are not as good as Jimmy Butler it's a wing
