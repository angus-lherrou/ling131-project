we wherever\nYou went through the Bush leaves was\nIt is the voice leagues is NBC Sports radio where there's NBC Sports radio dot com it is the NBC Sports\nRadio mobile apps\nBush go back at it with you and other Sunday Morning\nOut east it's still Saturday Night live out here on the left coasters we're working our way towards week\nFive of the national football league in what a great was always my favorite month because\nUh the September warm weather is gone for a lot of places in the country all you gotta do is watch these baseball games watch the college football games the sweater or sometimes heavy coats are already out there is certainly a nap and its shell and the air hopefully we have a long long winter\nAnd store of a ticket from a guy who lives out in Southern California where the weather's always warm it's why I had to move a hundred miles away up on the top of the mountain so what's called\nAs I look outside of the nice bombing Chris forty five degrees no other place I'd rather be eight five five three two three four and we see\nIs the number to chime in but it's always cold it's nippy this time of year for baseball which means the run production is down the pitching is on full display and that's what I like to see I've always been a guy who's a band about pitching first\nDefense version I'm partially\nHave a couple of sons who went on a played college baseball they were both pitchers which was nice for me is want to start or the other was a closer so\nI could show up on every fifth day last won't start and I would only show up in the yard when they had a lead towards the end of the game to catch the ninth inning and that's why I like post season because we don't need those five starter so sports in those guys that\nJust tend to kind of market up why we're waiting for the number one guy to come around\nThen there's the Houston Astros was really the biggest question is\nWho is going to be one egg behind Justin rarely under the light Garrett coal Guerra Cole was the number two in the rotation throughout the course of the year I guess that's just the way it fell right\nDallas cycle ah he's still pretty good land smugglers he's got that junk that he throws their active at great pitcher and I mean junk and believe me the best a sense you can\nAnd then there's Charlie more new if any team in major league baseball would take a guy with as many wins and it's good of busy RAs Charlie ... had an ... number five guy how can you not like the Houston Astros well you got to like the red Sox the red Sox won five more games right\nNot until Saturday where the Yankees put it on a pretty good and we do the Yankees had the bats and John Carlos Stanton\nOr the bats with the of course there and judge a back to back home runs for judge now the ninth inning and then the first city between game on the endgame to really just picking up where we left off and how about the Gary Sanchez to Sanchez\nThe guy who's been much maligned this year by Yankee fans and rightfully so uh didn't really play the Yankee way if you hear all the fans have gotten on 'em and they don't put up with that stuff I mean the the Yankees fan base has a no nonsense\nFan base not running out ground balls how dare you try to play catch your for the Bronx bombers independence drives and all the history that has gone before you\nBut yeah what does he do he breaks it open with a moon shot I'm almost five hundred feet three rounding or as the Yankees beat the red Sox and Yankees out hits the red Sox in both game warden game too and they have a split to show for it as David Price continues his struggles\nAgainst the New York Yankees and look there is sometimes people say well this guy has your number of this team has your number I mean price I was looking at the numbers you're thirty eight innings pitched against the Yankees just given up fourteen of home runs\nAnd that was just after the judge home run that's why I stopped counting right there\nI'd watch some of the other games that were going on as well to to be prepared for the show I got one eye on the the college football game literally in front of me listening to a hockey game I'm watching baseball on on on TV buddies got an eye bad one\nScroll through the scores to but it all comes raining down and how great of a month is October you have not only major league baseball\nWinding its way down as we are just a couple of weeks away from finding out who the world's shampoo will be good we have a rematch of last year's World Series quite possibly asked rows of look great\nThen you have the Dodgers who have even run allowed to run in the postseason Atlanta and seen that a couple of years ahead of schedule certainly the lesser of the opponents with Colorado or Atlanta but\nHey the Dodgers play who the Dodgers playing Atlanta still won the ... east this year and the brewers are playing some great baseball's well we're getting that little bit later on in the program but when the Yankees and the red Sox you get that split and now you head back to\nNew York where the Yankees have taken away home field advantage Yankees can win games free game for that'll be it would be an early exit for the best team in baseball Chris Sale was what we thought he would be a game on David Price\nIf you look at numbers and if you look at history is what we thought he would be in game two to one of the reasons why are you may like the Dodgers is yours because Clinton Kurdish are for the longest time has had a reputation of being a guy who jokes and can't get it done in the postseason\nNow granted remember what I just told you about the Braves not necessarily mean world leaders the young team in about three years from now see how much better the Braves are\nBut the way curve shop is one of his best performance as I've seen in ages that he had in game number two for the Dodgers and that has them sitting pretty going to Atlanta or for game three on Sunday\nBut Garrett calls your number two for Houston oh obviously the nice thing is now who do you play with ... more callers Charlie Morton any one of\nThose guys any one of the long bullpen guys can come in and spell you just to be able to get you to revert or sooner who remember when he came over mid year\nAstros players didn't even know if they wanted because he was coming off a suspension for domestic violence say so we're going to let this guy talk we're going to let him\nHave his say have is peace and where it is and talking to my connections in Houston that he's been very good with the team he's answered questions he's been nothing but a great teeming\nSince he's been there now they're giving them the opportunity yes the leash maybe a little bit longer because his talents backs that up and that's just the way it is it's not just that way in sports\nSo if you hear that story you're like well he's only you know getting a this preferential treatment because of who he is with

us from the shoulder and it doesn't look like he's got loose yet but it's still productive and they could still function with them on a kid you know eighty percent is better than anything that they have but that's no disrespect to Kobe electrical real\nYou know a hundred and Twenty one passes thrown by luck between Sunday and Thursday they played Seventy minutes on Sunday and then write the short week and last Thursday Night Football is here to stay but but you have to feel as as somebody from a patriots perspective looking at this\n... you got a little lucky there that you're facing a team that was kind of beat down and beaten up and had all that extra working on Sunday makes it a lot easier to put the put on the gas and beat a team like the cult under those circumstances\nIt does you know like you said you know the colds played five quarters on Sunday yeah you're on the road or at home against Miami that game was over they halfway through the third quarter so you're sort of coast mode and take the fourth quarter off and then you you have to\nPlane travel Nazi Slater set of two glass the colds you know how much they enjoy you know planes Thursday night games that I was a bang up team but they fought hard uh but it's yeah it's good to be three in too concerned now this year started it's great that battle back\nAnd now you've got the chief coming up in nine days the extra time to get ready for we were talking about this earlier with with Patrick homes and everything he does any of the three step by step drop find the guy open fires a laser and you know forty yard gain\nAnd it gets flushed down in the pocket on another play runs around make things happen we hear all the time about bill ballot checks approach to take away with the other team does bad\nI don't know where you take away from the cheese what do you do to slow down the chiefs off that\nI I think you gotta you gotta perfect you're not perfect you really got a polish regret so defense um try and get them to come up here and trade so goals for touchdowns hail you they're going to get their yards there's no doubt about it was called bunch games gets the chiefs whether you're or\nDoubted arrowhead they they they stress the perimeter of your events these calls are great game um it's just at the end of the half and then to games\nSometimes the clock gets away from an Eddie ... coach team and\nWe say that a bunch of times um I don't know I don't know ... you know I watch a lot this year I you know it just looks like a shortstop out there playing quarterback gets athletic he can make all the throws a cup run\n'em it just doesn't seem like the games too big Sur and I think you know going back to the last year that was a benefit to sit and watch Al Smith throwing that offsets understand what they wanted to do with that off that's\nWe see all these young quarterbacks right and and I don't know why it changed to the point where it's no longer a fifty percent bus trade the quarterbacks coming in their highly drafted they're making an impact\nAnd and I don't know whether it's coaches embracing what these guys did in college and incorporating that into the office of attack but either way we see more and more of the great young quarterback\nAnd you're a Tom Brady look he wants to do is forty five we know that that the status but\nBoy at some point it's gotta be tempting for the patriots to flip the page over to somebody to get one of the great young guys could you imagine having Patrick ... could you imagine having banker may feel how tempted to the patriots going to be each and every year going forward to go get one of the guys now that we see that more and more of them are turning out like a great\nDeal I thought yeah we we talked about so my radio show or two years ago we thought there is going to be young quarterback problem and asleep after breeze after Rogers after Brady office burger river's really don't have it and I know people like they'll they met ride of that Stafford I think they're just stack guys just don't know how much they when\nI'm Out here we go I mean we've got two young guys on our division ill which are shelling and of course and Donald a Baker made so now he runs around caught at the guy Jimmy there but\nYou can't keep to franchise quarterbacks we know that it's sad without him a San Francisco look see them play for a year\nBut uh I think these guys come to the microphone at fifty fifty times are gay and young quarterbacks soda or college which has them reading from a concept than route standpoint to be ready to the next level\n[laughter] they're they're thrown at fifty times game in college they're doing the seven on seven camps everywhere they're throwing their throwing they're throwing their throwing and finally\nIt it's all working you know there were those years where the NFL coach who complain all they run and they call a job that is we're not going to do that I think now they're saying let's do what these guys can do let's do what they're good at it they grow into the game and I just think the temptation is going to get greater and greater each and every year\nBecause what Tom wants to do is only half of the equation the other half of the equation is how long the patriots want him to be the guy and I think to the extent that the crafts\nHad been the impediments and moving on if there's any truth to that and who knows at this point\nBut at some point you got you got you got to rip the band aid off at some point you got to say we're missing out on an opportunity for our own homes owned banker Mayfield any of these guys flood the NFL is going to be a point where you're going to be the last one did not have one\nDay out I mean hey you know we say we look at history books we talk about Politics Daily on into the fuse that's a long time ago right especially cause sometimes time passing by [laughter] you know he doesn't last forever so uh I don't know we enjoy it for what we have up here it's a depressive five hundred touchdowns yesterday we\nWill never see a guy like this year but I I'm anxious to see it evolved and eventually will be post spell check post Brady but uh I don't know Mike without Africa hope you saw me on your show that'd be nice\nAre you are or even though the patriots won't be relevant then so we want to talk to you are you are you [laughter] are you feeling about the team big picture now that you know out of that whole born into at three into arrows seemed to be pointing up is this a team that still has all of its goals within its reach\nOh yeah yeah I mean ... feet wide open I think it's a dream team race potentially\nBut um you know usually around ten ... ten to Fifteen Bill Bill really understands the league and all that says he's gonna be able to skiing events better do get better just two weeks alone [noise] um and if they just keep their helpless ... element I\nWhy I'm trying to cover James White coming out of the fact that he looks as good as he's ever look that's it's hard to say\nThe way out on the clock so they keep their health will be fine\nHow about ...
