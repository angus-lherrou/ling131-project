Hawaii special hello to them lotta Dodger fans out there I Know and uh they have to be sick to their stomach with what they saw\nMe in this game and I mean how about these games back to back just a the I mean do you not feel like you've aged five years in just watching these two games Dodger fans had a historic gain that they will never forget the Eighteen ending a fair where you literally play do games for seven\nHours and twenty minutes literally on the clock and the on the scoreboard two games and the Dodgers wind up coming away with the when they were back in the series and things look great for them up through six innings till the seventh inning can lead Jansen who gave up a bomb which had tied the game\nThey did on friday does it again on Saturday and by chance and doing so the red Sox got new life they were able to go ahead and then I then he was kicked the door down\nAnd they go on to win by a nine six tally take up three games to one lead into Sunday or they can wrap it up in Los Angeles\nOr or the Dodgers with the ... against the wall and not only have to win this game at home the final Dodger on game of the season\nBut then you have to go back to Fenway were all it's done is gone about five degrees colder than it was last week as well try and win it on either Tuesday or even if you can force the game seven when did on Halloween Night but you still need free to be able to win the Dodgers have proven that they're a talented enough team\nTo be able to hang with the red Sox in certain aspects\nAnd uh I don't think this all goes on day Roberts ears the way I look at a K Robert Robert didn't give up the home run ...\n... and gave it up All right well but jeeze you answer wouldn't have pets the Roberts didn't put them in there's no saying that\nThe pitching beforehand would have given them the pitching hits all all the time it happens you can just blame it with him all you want you can blame with other people not being able to to get the chance if you like you know the red Sox top\nFor hitters any order were over forty one over forty one in the last two games at Dodger Stadium counting the Eighteen any game and then all the way through the sixth inning\nBefore that was able to be changed\n... coming up with an ice double Rockville Denver's\nEndeavors that that guy is the man that guy right there he's he's got to have one of the biggest

over I had to sit there and we have an hour to do it at him up because of the game was still going I thoroughly enjoyed what we saw there tonight but this this kind of gives you a glimpse\nOf an idea of just how good this Red Sox team can be I mean who who let the match\nAnd we'll let the fire underneath the maybe they Robert said it intensely I don't remember he played for the red Sox at a really big stolen base back in the day he knows them using their history right he wasn't he actually got a standing ovation from a lot of people there are ... park when the series started as well but\nThe ... for them to pick themselves up off the deck and get nine or runs in the last\nThree innings I mean no body at all saw that coming and this is really going to be a true test them grits for the Dodgers tomorrow able to bounce back and ... how do you have such a short memory and the fact\nThat the red Sox after that painful last last night were able to have such a short memory I mean you have to do it's either sink or swim\n[noise] yeah I think the tactic at this point is you have to go in thinking we don't have to win three in a row we just have to win today that's only have to do is when the day to day and then and then Tuesday [laughter] you don't learn to live on a Wednesday right and I got ya ... sale in ... on Sunday so yeah we're back to a game want to\nBack to the game on yeah

spent\nEnron or Rodriguez now is spent maybe a poor settled David Price they kept tinkering with getting him up even in the ninth inning or to be able to come in because of the karate kid Craig immoral or gave up a a bomb or two he get Hernandez to make the game even a little bit closer and they were just shy of getting the tying run aboard\nA ... already went yard but\nAgain with twists and turns I mean you can enjoy friday all you want because what it what brought you some of the best baseball that we've seen in the postseason and sell extra innings then that seems just kicked it around like you were playing the YMCA league a for a few innings and scoring on throwing chairs and it was just ugly and then it goes back\nTo a month the winning it and walk off fashion as well so an

three two three four and be see\nI Would like it or baseball did have a salary cap just because I like the front office to earn it maneuver you're not trying to figure out ways to get around things although a lot of times they differ salaries and give it to you and signing bonus now I Would like a true salary cap just to be able to\nKeep things consistent everywhere I Would anyway personally then again I've also said I'd like to have a double header in the world series I really would let's see how good your pitching really is let's see an end point out those weaknesses bring 'em right to the surface of your managerial staff\nHow would that hold up Alex Cora day Roberts in fact those two gentlemen were asked a question at the end of the game that really had nothing to do with much of the game itself\nExcept the kind of did their decisions\nNow we know we have an outspoken president and whether you like him or you don't whether you're Republican whether you're a Democrat\nI like the fact that this guy is paying attention All right just like President Obama did when he paid attention to the basketball and he picked who was going to go to the final four courses brother in law was ... at Oregon State at the time so he followed it we know that Trump loves Tom Brady\nFollows football I think he follows baseball even a little bit more though the man he was on points listen to a reporter\nQuestion David Roberts and relaying message from President Trump and then you're going to hear Robert's reaction and then we'll have that same question posed to Red Sox skipper Alex scorer first there's the Roberts Dodgers manager getting an earful about what they think from Washington DC of all places\nPresident Trump tweeted about you are moved and I I don't know if you've heard about that but um he was critical said uh watching the final innings is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who was loose and dominating through almost seven innings rich hill and brings in nervous relievers who get she'll act for around ... gone managers do it all the time big mistake\nMatthews tuning in watching the game I don't know how many Dodger games he's watched I don't think he was privy to the conversation ... one man's opinion\nAnd the oldest sons get the facts\nYou were a little kid and you thought about what you want it to be teaching them to topple through things changed as you got older teaching didn't seem like the best option and you'll be something else what would your twelve year old does\nNow you want to be a doctor you don't think teachers\nActress playing a different role every time the bell rings come out of scientists\nOf physics chemistry who do you think teachers\nTeachers today are breaking down opposite finding innovative ways to instill old left [noise] taking learning\nOr beyond the four walls of the class\nTime to recognize the great things are happening in teaching\nDon't try to convince or otherwise\nTroops can [noise]\n[noise]\n\nTo what the what we [noise]\nWe had\n\n\nIndeed that's the joke is strictly on Red Sox radio W E I with the call was for nothing had that juncture enter Ryan ... who's been around a long time a good picture certainly er into his a spot where it may fall in the bullpen\nBut taken rich hill outs\nThe second guessing is going to start and it's going to continue for a long long time\nAnd it may cost day Roberts his job at a time when we tell the Dodgers shortstop out we do know that just ask the brewers\nAnd uh the Dodgers still have to lose one more time will it be Sunday in LA will it be Tuesday or Wednesday a stop to beat the red Sox three times in a row and it just doesn't happen very often it's why they want a hundred and eight games eight five five three two three four NBC\nIs the number to chime in here to the Bush leaves or on Twitter at NBC Sports radio so the questions are going to come raining and so a little bit of the post game press conference for Dave Robert's on the decision to put in rhyme absent\nThey made a bad pitch and uh fortunately a myth shouldn't really gets going on and so in that spot right they're considering we have left in the pan you have to make a decision and and I felt that Ryan still had a very good chance to to get them out\nOf course you're going to use not going to say oh I I was kind of caution myself I should have not put them in I mean no manager is going to say that they're always going to let you know the eagle getting away and he had a very good she had just as good a chance as anybody else I guess to get them out\nOr you could look at it that way so let's let's mix it up a little bit more and bringing Kenny Vance and who wasn't not day job who the chance and give up a home run on friday night I'm Still a little bit hazy because of the damn thing was Eighteen innings seven hours and twenty minutes of my life that I invested in that game like you all did\nHe gave up a home run and looking at here\nOkay that tied the game up gave it up the Jackie Brown the junior he deposited halfway up the right field seats\nSo Jansen comes in again gives up a home run\nTo Steve Pearce of all people a guy who's got a couple of years left a in his career I'm you're talking to a guy in his\nMid thirties so he's been around well he's been around a while I mean I remember God I call the college World Series again we're Justin Turner played against Steve Pearce parents went to South Carolina\nPlayed with the capture you may remember name land and Powell was really good never really made it that is full potential to power but Steve Pearce certainly did is that a great career what teams like the pirates and and the blue jays will finally getting shot and Boston and this may be the year\nThat he indeed gets a ring eight five five three two three four NBC so after we're off Ryan Manson it's on Tuesday Robert why the hell did you bring in ... chance of what's going on with this guy these days you just not the same guy was in years past\nComing into last night shift five days off and he was a freshman or any of our relievers mental there aren't too many more mentally tough and generally you look at a three innings he's he's thrown he's made a lot of quality pitchers in the two mistakes that he didn't make the cutters didn't cut\nAnd um they gave them to Homer so um I don't think it's a mental or physical thing\nOkay so that's a mental physical he doesn't think it's either so what is it then I mean I'm Still waiting for robbers and say look Boston's a good team\nWe can expect this but uh back to back nights\nI'm Sorry I don't believe for a second that that is not a chance and said you got to have a short memory when you were closer I get a but this is the world series right this is the red Sox and you gave up at ... home run all about I don't know twenty minutes ago it seems like when the game ended yesterday versus what we saw on Saturday or back out there and you do it again\nAnd we've seen this happen plenty of times earlier in the season ran into some issues in Colorado or with the altitude and that's one of the heart problems I think we came\nThe fight as well as the Dodgers fall by nine six tally when they led the game of for nothing and it all came ... down and the and the last few friends but we'll see what kind of gumption that the Dodgers have and that you don't want to\nHave it come back to your place and they have the Dodgers have to win both because they are a team capable of both but the odds certainly against I mean let's face it LA is using and taken advantage of the warm weather\nAnd it certainly does help the red Sox are used to playing in the cold weather what you get now in Boston\nIn late October is the same thing that you get in April it's in the forties it doesn't warm up until Memorial Day in Boston have you ever seen were bosses that in a map which is you get it out take a look at it okay and it's a it's north go north final remain is and then go down to about a half an inch Boston way up there\nGetting go down about six inches and all the way over to the left that's where Los Angeles is it sunny it's warm it's why there's so many people here all the time they want to enjoy the warm weather and the fact that you could be in the beach and and the mountains and and do all of that at a at a moment's notice eight five five three two three four and VCR\nAt a moment's notice you could be at a football game and a hockey game\nAnd a basketball game and anti baseball game that's right\nIt's the sports equinox we always hear of the journal equinox it as something to do with you know the longest day of the year when it comes to daylight and all that kind of good stuff [noise]\nYour day gets started if you're a sports fan out in Los Angeles the one

appreciation that when he goes out on the field it's shark is the legacy of all the Packers lumbar twelve sixty five Lombardi avenue with street address to the stadium\nUm it's following him that legacy of great quarterbacks and great players and played for the people at a unique situation without a Super Bowl trophy I think it might have checked it more I think he understands it and when he signed his contract that's kind of you know what you're going to be a Packer for lifers for ever\nAs long as they played football in Green Bay people are going to go to that stadium where number twelve\nI pick them to make it to the super bowl this year now they've they've had a rough time in part because Rogers had that knee injury back in week one they got their work cut out for them this weekend do they face the ran in a way to fill us ...\nHe was with the Broncos then twenty Fifteen of of the Sunday night game\nThey held Aaron Rodgers the Seventy seven passing yards I don't think I Would take the under on Seventy seven for Sunday is just show you when you when you combine the rams off fence with one way to Philips has done against the Mike mccarthy ... in the past but this is going to be a real challenge and if they win this game it's going to be Aaron Rodgers with another virtuoso performance\nIt would it would have to be you know and this rams team has a little bit of doubts for them to so maybe just as important as bad as what they can do to my cat in the recording this year after all those years dumped capers or the parents\nCan those guys take another not to step up in what I think he's become a very fascinating division B and C north but\nFor instance look they look like a ... or get the Breeders' Cup next week I might they look about white there has to to the front of the lake and a half in front of everybody else\nUh with the saints right on their heels a next in the race but I Love watching the rams are what they do and how they're doing it and the defense which was supposed to be great remember had those cornerback injuries going into the Thursday night or Minnesota as they get better back there uh I think they're going to continue to get better so\nThat for some reason my or not\nHaving as you know how long can the rams go undefeated conversation\nThat I Know they got the Kansas City in Mexico city coming up there and do a month but maybe it's time to start thinking about how how deep can the rams take this after several of those start because I mean most folks they'd be able to be a good favorite to win again this week you get halfway through the schedule that loss\nAnd you mentioned the saints they'll get a chance to\nMove to six and one on Sunday night against the Vikings and then it's saints rams next week and all the NFC West to get together and I think that like I said I can still end up the number one seed because only I can beat the rams\nI I but I I agree with you the rams have quietly gotten to seven to know and we're not having a conversation about sixteen oh because it does feel premature but\nThe way the rams have played if they can keep their core players healthy they could they could do well beyond ten into\nAnd maybe make it you know one of those things where hey we've got everything locked up do we do the bill polling and pull out all of our starters and and give up a game in a week sixteen or Seventeen or do we go for it they they may be in that dilemma when the end of the season rolls around\nWhy go we're a long way with me about it I don't think Trump McVeigh and that group would do that uh I I did watch a little bit of them on the end they'll game pass it just really is as you know when those four o'clock games get played weren't scramble mode we're uh getting ready for the show and you kind of watching the league games with one eye and then turning away and they're coming back\nA dollar in to play and Donald obviously for sex last week those guys are playing on that side
