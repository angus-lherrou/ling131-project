you a whole lot of stats if I Do ever give us that it's because I Believe it's an important stat\nThat you need to know but we're talking about the stuff that you're talking about around the water cooler as you're driving down the road with your friends or the ranch\nThat you have a you know pumping your chest with how well your team player burying your head in the sand with the how disappointed you are with your team and you're really contemplating whether a you watch 'em any more you certainly aren't going to go out to the games and spend your hard earned dollars or maybe just maybe\nYou're thinking about taking all your your swag you haven't lighten it on fire and the barbecue now that it's too cold actually use it outside been there done that eight five five three two three\nFour NBC is\nThe number got to congratulate the Dodgers as painful as that is a they showed me something and Milwaukee\nBook there were seven pictures used and Friday nights when for the brewers and why does this seem to me those same seven pitchers were basically used except for Josh ... if you haven't seen is the best picture that they have\nAnd he's the one who made the Dodgers look foolish with four punch outs\nIn game ... number one and yet they're going to save him for Monday I guess you have to get home field advantage back because all you have to do is win a game on the road and then it's yours they often say and sports a series doesn't start until you lose a game at home I guess what the series started now\nAnd it's in full swing for the Milwaukee Brewers but they damn near lost it on friday night and they they were traveling or nothing came out of nowhere and drop six on LA\nOnly to have gone backwards for runs and it came down to the final batter\nAnd Justin Turner who couldn't get a dawn on friday\nThat's the great thing about baseball is you have to have a short memory because you're playing twenty four hours later\nI remember there was a a very a famous college baseball coach when I worked at Cal State Fullerton ironically was just in Turner's coach and I called their games those names George short and he's now up at a college and I'm not going to name because I Can't stand the university okay but Georgia's a great guy\nAnd he had said that when he was coming up through the coaching ranks she had like a Fifteen to fourteen game on a friday\nTold his wife got I'll never go through another one of those again the next day was like sixteen to Fifteen you know and after that he just kind of surrender to the baseball guy\nHappens I mean you can lose Eighteen to nothing and you can win one to nothing\nAnd all you've done this or in yourself a series split now what I Do know is this is going to be a hell of a series of should probably most likely will go seven ball games have been decided by the narrowest margin celebrity chime in his eight five five three two three four and a B C\nCan also at the company line on Twitter

Cincinnati's or the really good this year do we still not trust a touchdown ginger because ... to me has to approve a little more give us a little more give us something something and against the Steelers team that we still I think are resting on their laurels a little bit kind of like\nThe patriots until you really knock them off at the end of the season when it matters when it counts most then you know we're still going to keep having this narrative and it's out there Steelers bangles another big game so we're going to talk about that with Matt ...\nDavid ... the time for the Cleveland

do okay and Justin Vernon land or I mean this guy really in the post season\nThe only picture currently still throwing that's proven to be better than Vern lander in the postseason would be Madison Bumgarner that's it and very landers been better than mad bum has during the course of the year\nAnd Berlin has been money came over to the Astros\nLast year and help lead them to a World Series title about the only hiccup\nThat ever lander had came against Madison Bumgarner and his giants back in two thousand fourteen when he got rocked at AT and T. and Pablo Sandoval I Believe took them deep a couple of times at one later on in that game but here's been able to get a couple of runs across early in the second inning against sale and\nSell it I don't think they pulled him to save him and and you know for a couple of games down the road and he's still through eighty six pitchers eighty six pitchers made it four innings\nBecause when it comes to reliable product in technical

do I get the feeling that despite Cincinnati being appointed have favorite Cincinnati really needs to win this game to prove that\nYou know the little brother can finally hang with big brother\nI don't question because I just wanted to stay on their own and as you mentioned bell storm out there the reports are he'll be back after by week which is from Pittsburgh after his game\nThe dealers

to class and leave or really in a little bit whoever wins his games in my opinion is a clear favorite color division and the crew the bangles so much psychological stuff that goes along with this cancer it's an enormous cocker\n... dot com or weekly contributors with us on NBC Sports radio uh I don't like the chargers even though there are three into San Diego at Cleveland near picked him to where the browns are actually\nA point favorite you know what that sounds about right to me I like Cleveland in Cleveland could have a couple more jobs and they do\nTo Cleveland as well I just never know what I'm getting with car [laughter]\nIt's hard to say things where they play like a super ... after the charges also things that you wonder how in God's green earth are now calling for an area where the carnival over and they ... the me dumb decisions on the sidelines like I don't believe in the browns because I don't believe in taxes\nBut I Believe that the browns are a lot better I Believe that they can make those who really apply and this week and I think they're desensitized to it\nOr if the game was in Los Angeles I Would take LA but it's not it's in Cleveland that matter ... bill mostly across the country they play in an earlier when the game I Do believe in that kind of stuff I can just throw seems off or or\nI wouldn't be shot it starts with on the owners office atmosphere of the few snow around\nBut I don't cross the chargers in these types of games during the games over the course ... career\nThey find some asinine way to lose and then everybody says wrong lucky and everybody rights at all when in reality or if it's if it happens all the time so I'm lucky it's just not that good and the chargers walk off talented and not always been consistent\n... dot coms with us on NBC Sports radio right let's venture across the pond where it should be raining which I like it could favor my Seahawks taking on the raiders I mean two teams that aren't combined three and seven\nAre right now and I said as the arts are honestly right where I thought they'd be OK the raiders are certainly a disappointing and let's say you about this one\nI think the Seahawks win this game and they're going to win by a couple of scores I I was very impressed by Seattle that surround it off at the end of the day as a citizen or she got away the map but they\nThey played very well in that game and I suspect Seattle I like cows approach you get there early getting acclimated meanwhile the raiders or basic flying and they play the game I think that really benefits the Seahawks\nI think they know what you're doing group has shown no go there you know he's going to hear and ultimately\nISIS held better like Wal Mart or or carts point you know the the ... sea hawk defense is ... an hour or an aircraft my God it is better or the greater the field I think Seattle is going to win the raiders paid a hundred million dollars\nFor a guy that they don't turn the franchise round and pay it thoroughly\nOr even see but early returns have been very very on the\nOther games that I'm\nKinda torn either way to go on I mean you want to believe in the bears at three in one I don't know what I Want to think that Miami's a little bit better uh I'm going to go the dolphins at home\nOn this one I don't know man you I'm just thinking because the bears want to get out of that cold weather we ran the probably down in South beach right now doing stuff that they shouldn't be doing that they hold doesn't get put out there in the winter I mean that's the only reason I'm going to go with my logic you like it\nIt's there for my mind for a night game if I was a betting man I Would say because I think the better I've been dissolved into for gold\nBut I also think everybody's going crazy over there it had a ... to play the bucks a couple of weeks back and everybody remembers ... six bucks to have a thousand impressive game\nIs an awful for the\nVast majority of their career and before that I can never be able to see just can't throw a ball the ethical pay is one good game on that land and we freaked me out to all things that rate quarterback and they're going to winter games\nI I just this is the co last game was like ten of thirty three\nAnd the bears were ten nine and people are All right back and it prevents me so I stay away from I pick the bears neutered defense is so good they might win the game as a child\nBut I I Would have thought that I I I think a lot of different directions\nHey you're Kansas City chiefs so we have the tweets are coming in it looks like Karen has tweeted and ... says she's picking the patriots to meet the chief says Kansas City has\nTo show me something I mean look come on and this could be like the opening game last you remember when you cheat supposed to be down on and mom sold on the chiefs I think the cheese are better than the rams are we loved Iran's to take a look at who the rams a beat I mean my God my Seahawks almost beat him and that's that's flat out embarrassed the man I like the chiefs to witness came despite the fact they're getting three and a half\nI Do too and to be honest normally when it comes to Kansas City I'm pessimistic because I was Thirty years nothing but pain that that franchise filed in New England for something on there and I really I mean I\nI've been doing was going to score thirty five points throughout all move saw I I think Kansas City is a nightmare for like a New England defense is the slowest thing NFL they can't move\nIf I Want they want to play the game and the phone booth in Kansas City or one thing about their their fat everywhere and read is going to stretch them out horizontally construct mouth vertically he's going to make the call the field\nAnd the whole says the devastating one guy who got no and in this game I don't care how knowing them place I don't go to the point man on not doesn't matter what I Do see through them ... I think you're going to have a huge game and chronic health because of the game\n... think it's going to matter because I I really think this is the kind of game where Kansas City my role forty five ... five hundred yards I I don't think ... any ability stock or as a writer and she won the game a day or in a dominant position on the\n... sided dot com has been our guest many we appreciate you for

ranked ... lions now follow one into in the big tendency Boston Michigan State and Ohio State and both of those games\nThey would've should've could've won is Penn State led at halftime against Michigan State only to a get out scores fourteen to three in that second half and that's\nNot really custom like of of what we see from uh a coach James Franklin team but we had that you had some troubles in the top ten altogether and she had number two in Georgia just get humbled\nBy Thirteen try and tell us you know as you I was thinking about putting some money on this game but I was like

thirty in the afternoon though I just don't know\nAbout Georgia is going to show me something more that's why it's so hard to make a living it is right and then bet on football the time and it really makes you I think a stand in awe and amazement of what we see out of the boys in Vegas I'm\nNot good eight five five three two three four NBC it's not just a Georgia lost his game last by three touchdowns I didn't score and the first half yeah\nJake from barely cracked two hundred yards which let's face it for college football two hundred yards is nothing\nGay and and really it was I'm Justin Jefferson was a huge game receiving why Israel issue great game or out of the backfield as well as we're looking to pick up where Leonard for net left off I mean my God a hundred and forty five yards are on the ground\nCarriers for al issue so you know they took it to the right to Georgia and LSU tough loss that they're coming off a prior to that doesn't look now they of wins with Auburn under their belt Miami under the vote and Georgia under their belt\nSo there are certainly team's gonna move up into the top ten because number to Georgia losers are you also have lost his with number

to seven and all on the season and five at all\nAt home and and if you ask yourself or are they really on top ten\nTeam I mean the record shows are undefeated who they beat and they got Michigan in week one way Michigan is playing right now we'll get to them a little bit I don't know I Would I Would bet Michigan regardless of where this game is over and over to him I just been more impressed\nWith them and they play in the Big Ten weekend and week out they also took it to Stanford though\nAnd beat them handily beat on my Twenty one point so it was like wow okay that's impressive

tonight thus far and it's okay to front that's not an issue but I think the way you can front that is important but if you do confront don't be don't\nShow that the big thing is to lift people up you know the political other people but\nYeah make other people better that is a ... tip it old tabs coach of the Minnesota timber wolves former coach of bubbles\nWho has found themselves in just an absolute mess I mean oh my God is there a bunch of drama going on right now and Minnesota of all places and there's more talk going on with the timber wolves who haven't even be gone the season\nThen there is the Vikings who were predicted by many to go back to the super bowl I mean it's crazy this stems from Jimmy Butler who played under teams in Chicago brought him over to Minnesota\nApparently doesn't play well with others\nK at first it was allegedly then apparently it's been confirmed and true if you're not hurt or have you been living under the NBA rock that's OK will shed some light on a four year best way to say is Jimmy Butler wasn't the best of teammates because he was okay it up with Carl Anthony towns girl\nNo you don't say look he's a ball or he's the guy who's a pig\nLots of women in this world here in the NBA player I can pretty much you have your pick of the litter do realize there is one NBA player for every million people in the United states\nThat is our rare it is

hope not at all but lots of sound coming out of cables camp look\nTowns one he's the guy who got the two hundred million dollar contract extension to stick around I mean short and sweet can you be happy playing with Jimmy Butler or not we we as\nHappy to play basketball with anybody looked at stake in the high road for Carl anthon towns but this is what's tough look it's going to have an effect in spillover onto the court itself per se and probably going to affect some records here and there so I get\nThat part of it [noise] it's just tough when we talk about stuff that is not related to it you know the extra types of\nStories out there you know the funniest people do that always try to say well it's going to affect how they play on the court is the first thing they always go to a lot of other times I think we're trying to create a a headline up this was not the first time that I Do it hooked up with a team mates girlfriend or vice versa we've heard the wife stories right\nSo and so's wise slept with his wife oh whatever it may be\nWe've heard about it and yet\nNow for some reason we make more and more of a big deal out of this whole thing a Anthony towns though says that I got to be focused on basketball in the matter hand and that's what's important here again telling us what we want to hear\nThat there's nothing else the frozen we have a big cities in front of us live
