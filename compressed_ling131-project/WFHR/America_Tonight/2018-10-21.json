P. threes and get off we manage this isn't the Olympic Games anymore not friends you know we're not buddies anymore\nAnd that game is going to be interesting as it's going to come down to the wire but they've been going on about ten minutes or so now that this thing has been stopped while they try to sort out who's going to get ejected or how it's going to be where it's going to go it looks like there are now just\nSorting things out with the free throws here as the rockets do lead that game but we're talking of course a major league baseball is ending not too long ago\nGame seven in Milwaukee and congrats to the Dodgers I I think the Dodgers have the better roster overall top to bottom or they should I mean the highest payroll or in baseball with with what they have what they throw out there all the time comparable to and even more so than the Yankees despite all the hiring is\nThat the Yankees have I mean this has been brewing for quite some time\nFor the Dodgers a Dodgers are an underdog in this World Series is the Vegas odds makers just put it out to the red Sox are a plus one thirty five\nI'm to the Dodgers a Dodgers are plus one Fifteen actually the red Sox from minus one and thirty five cars or baseball you've had straight on the money like baseball's baseball's nearly impossible to bad if you ever tried at well how many runs that they're going to win by the spread is always to\nSay you can't go on and it's got to be too so in order for you to cover its really one and a half you have to go out and win by two runs which I mean look at some of these postseason games a lot of times they are one run games I Will say this though not very compelling again sixteen games\nThe as after the Dodgers circa three to lead back to the great state of Wisconsin you were thinking we were going to change blows one runway and hear another one run when they're like we saw in the beginning of the series it was anything ...\nAnything but as Milwaukee a vote race the Dodgers on Friday nights or to put some fans on edge in la la land only to have the Dodgers are I mean with an impressive when\nOn Saturday nor the waiting sum it up they fell behind early in this game and in Ballenger teed off after a one nothing deficit to make it to to one and then walk or bealer settled down and and quite honestly pitch better than anything we've seen adequate and her show in the post season\nAnd you couple that with the ... we're going yard as the Dodgers just have so many big bats\nIn the lineup that is until a they face a Red Sox team that is equally as stout and stacked whether it's ... whether it is a standard bowl guards and we haven't even gotten to the JD Martinez so\nI mean the one hell of a series you're looking at starting pitching uh you would favor the red Sox bullpen\nA I don't know I mean you you'd like to maybe say the Dodgers I still don't know if we trust Kenny Vance and he's at the ... better than a bowl season uh than what we saw in the regular season but as far as the ball bends I don't know\nIf that's a coin toss as far as the actual benches concern on the Boston as a deeper bench a line up one through nine I think Boston has better top heavy players but I think that uh the Dodgers are more balanced one through nine you have to worry about any way you look at it should be a great series\nWe'll see if it goes seven games have been the fact that we start the series a little bit later we're not even starting a series until October twenty third can you imagine if this thing go seven\nThis thing goes seven we're going to end its in November I'd like to welcome him now the executive producer of the Bush leagues and of course that would be a good friend Jim and Dr ... second cousins you Richard right this and I always say looks just like I'm so first of all congratulations on your daughters I have to get it out\nThank you for saying that I Know that was difficult\nFor you well it was and I would really be in a in a

that Wynwood a game seven be if we got that far if the red Sox we'll let it get that far as I got to tell you man I was impressed with what they did against Houston\nHouston was just an absolute buzz saw with the best starting pitching staff and there was no doubt about that I'm just looking at the statistics and what they did and\nThe red Sox I Want to say made it look easy but after a game on

the nine eleven attacks they delayed the season or buy a week and by postponing it it pushed\nThe end of that World Series into\nA September then another one of the game was played on Halloween\nAnd by being postponed because of Mother Nature that had to be resumed and picked up in November So their word non scheduled to be finished in November and what we could have can you imagine if the red Sox and Dodgers goes seven games\nIt will end on Halloween nights as a they're going to start on the twenty third they would have to total off days so you can have a lot of baseball back to back to back to back days eight five five\nThree two three four NBC you know which I've always been a fan of that to a I think you need to tax you're pitching make the managers worked for it and and get after a little bit I mean who wants to go with just two or three guys in a series like that if it were up to me I Would make them play double header ... I'd\nLike to see yeah I'd like to see a double header\nAnd a matinee and you follow it up with an eye capital twin bill would that'd be fun\nTo be able to do that and let's see really just you know how good your pitching staff is and how these young guys can manage it everyday Robert's not necessarily a young guy per se but he hasn't really been around managing baseball too long came right into

jumping the debate New England a three point favorite\nI think it's a really good game for the bears is you're meant to not off the Miami has got to leave this hour to their mouth I Would expect that you have to come up owing very hard very well my my question is Chicago off in the they're scoring ... points for twenty teens\nAgain is all the way it's set up you're going to score teams are going to ... to have a Tom Brady Drew Brees ... they're going to a point and so New England probably going to score twenty four twenty seven in this game scholars because quite well\nConfirm this score more than that against the dollar check the pets not only the path of the person all the time for a week they beat the trees to hit forty point doing it uh\nI think New England finds a way I just don't trust Trybulski that being said it's a it's a game where the parents can forced to turn over maybe get a nice return they could certainly when I mean the talent there I just don't know ... up to the pac\nMan Vert ramps on than sounded like Tom's with us and NBC Sports radio do games that I really like jump off the page me in the second half of the day saints it the ratings change or a better team saints undefeated on the road though I mean going to take on the ravens Baltimore is yet to favorites\nAre in this contest so simply because it's in Baltimore I mean two and a half points it's gotta be because of that\nYes no question I Love the sanctions game or I get it would fall more really good you can\nBut I I just talked about this this is Tony Eighteen NFL I'm taking the offices all day off I don't care I respect for more I think Baltimore the playoff team from Baltimore struggle score and everybody's very high on Baltimore 'cause it just I was Twenty one to nothing and I get that with the titans aren't any good\nNo they're not lead who who quarterback sometimes somebody who shouldn't be at this point I was a yeah Marcus Mario play college right I played at the University of Oregon\nThat's why they're trying to you feel\nAbout that yeah I'm ... ... you know what I don't I look at the raven I don't trust them all kinds of ways I noticed that there are good but again I think they're going to for the ... to ... and the things are coming off a buyer week matter even to this day and everybody\nBaltimore wax and she was a couple of weeks ago last twelve nine Cleveland yeah so\nThis seems to me are the better team I don't care that they're on the road there's gold differently than they were years ago and it was super dome or posture that franchise I think they find a way to went on the ...\nYeah I Do I agree as well too and I met this one your Sunday night match up um you got the ball ginger and Andy Dalton going against the cheese looking to rebound playing there an airhead which I think of something they can do but ah there's bangles team even if the bangles losing over the foreign three they seem a lot better than that\nThe Bengals have played well I've been impressed by him they come to this day in little banged up they're missing their top corner an art there was some other pieces including a vibrant art center go a crisis or the question I have in this game is can handle on Marvin lowest and Andy Dalton be hand them advantage to read at all\nAnd I don't think it can not miss thought this was in Cincinnati it would be more of a coin cook for me ... coming off the top off I go home and she's going to give a starting point 'cause that's what she's due to the final score thirty points\nI think sometimes in the game I think it's a compelling game I think it's exciting\nBut I think ultimately Cincinnati might kill we'll hear a narrative she probably won't and conquer them own read combination with all of the scope of players around those guys\nAre I I just don't trust the bangles in fact the quick nugget Lewis took over this even two thousand three they fully Seventeen prime time road game there one in ... and they'll\nGo

both teams are under achieving and not talk to a soccer fan and they said the one thing that looking forward to this game is finally they needed the chick fillet because it's normally closed on Sundays here in Atlanta so you know the chick lays open inside the stadium in that's that that's about all you can say for this man the giants and he's been a train wreck for a while\nThe joys of terrible and you know we talk Thursday night the card or basically quit midway through game and then her wall last Thursday night we saw the giants just flat out putting on the off\nThe giants were

store and online at NBC Sports radio\nDot com oh we finally have our World Series it's a really what I think a lot of baseball fans across the country wanted to very popular teams as when I think major league baseball and there's thirty teams what I Do is\nThink of and I would imagine properly merchandise sells tickets and interest in history of the French are you worried altogether and I would simply say that there's a about six teams that stand above\nThe rest of the teams in terms of popularity All right in terms of overall interests are some others that are close\nBut I'd like to say that the ... and red socks of course are two of them All right Doug we knew that the cubs in all invite the cardinals to be a part of that top six and then out west you have the Dodgers and all of bite the giants I probably arrange a St Louis in\nUh San Francisco either fifth or sixth there are number one still being the Yankees number two I Would say the red Sox nearly probably ahead of the cubs\nAnd then the Dodgers are after that and so anyway you rank those six unequivocal believe those are the six most popular franchise is when it comes to selling advertising tickets merchandise you David so major league baseball is looking at jobs at what they have here with the brewers\nTaking on or not the brewers rivers lose the Dodgers taking on the Boston Red Sox it'll start Tuesday\nAt Fenway Park\nUh it'll be Clinton courage shock going opposite of Chris sell you're going to see JD Martinez says you're going to see I see oh boy you're gonna see Justin Turner you're going to see ... bats and\nReally look that's what it's all about and the best of the best of the cream rising to the top or this window for the Dodgers is actually stayed open for a pretty good amount of time that means six consecutive years making the postseason or back to back\nYears making the world series and when all the way the game seven last\nYear will it go seven this year and if it does it will end on Halloween Night of all nights number to chime in if you'd like is eight five five three two three four NBC and I were on Boston would love to hear from those rights\nLike your chances are as a talking to a gym never texting him during the game\nOn my good friend and mentor for many years ago and voice of the Boston Red Sox and and I asked to me who he wants to face maybe hey we want we want the the better team we fills the Dodgers you know you want to go out and and win that game and and head out and soak up a little bit of that LA Sunshine and take those crossed across a you know across the ocean or trips\nOr that they have their a cross country uh trips I should say five five three two three four NBC is\nThe number of Christian theology although he did Homer in game seven still overall disappointing series that we have Justin Turner although he did Homer in game two still a disappointing\nSeries overall Clinton curve shop pitch dwelling one game not so well in another Walker ... same thing to be said for him\nBut boy this young man ever a rise to the occasion in game seven I mean this is a guy who's pitched in the FCC nothing like what are you seeing here buddy went through a great program at Vanderbilt the same one that put out David Price\nOr Tyler Beatty a picture of the giants Pedro Alvarez\nUm you know the list goes on and on her belly dance wants that if I'm not mistaken from there as well too so this is really a program\nThat is not new to a cultivating and sending these young men off into the minor league baseball worlds and eventually working themselves up to the big league level and Walker bill came out and eat pets like enemy pits like a boss from day one\nThey only through Seventy three pets are so that was a bit interesting as he came in and started went for two thirds innings gave up six hits but here's the thing a lot of those came with two outs and nobody on\nAnd if you do that you're able to keep the brewers off balance a little bit I Know Dodger fan so it was around some of them added he's sweating a little bit in the first inning oh God here we go\nCan't can't handle the press or he gave up around already but then really a nice job to be able to rebound back in ... balance or help them with a a two run blast\nIn the second inning so the Dodgers\nAnd the red Sox are when you look at those national fan bases with what they have when you look at the advertising dollars everything out there at stake east coast west coast are called Chris whether\nOld bent out of shape you know a Boston type of people per se and I love it back there

Mac\nAnd yet there was any through for three hundred Navy Yard you had the two interceptions but he also had three touchdowns and the dolphins racked up\nOne yards which was not just the most this year but it's the fifth most in team in history and the other four\nWere done under Dan Marino so it's Dan Marino Dan Marino Dan Marino Dan Marino oh yeah and ... and ... so\nThat was very surprising going forward and he's going to start again this week probably next Thursday against the Houston Texans\nWhat I Would say to you that we're going to see now is at some point there's gonna be a regression demean meaning you're gonna get\nNot Ninety five quarterback rating broadcasts Wyler not three touchdowns broadcast Wyler not necessarily a five hundred and forty one yards of often ... but you're going to get something much less which will get us to where\nHe's the guy that he's always been\nBut let's say he can keep this going I Can't help but wonder Armando whether or not\nAdam gaze will continue to ride with broad costs water until Ryan tannahill is quote unquote one hundred percent and we've seen that from time to time\nTen it won't be a hundred percent until broadcasts while there does indeed regress to demean and then hey ten given us a better chance to win an Oscar Wilde but I feel like gay I think the smart players continue to play offs water as long as he's playing well and\nIf tannahill healthy well he's not really healthy 'cause he's not a hundred percent he's only Ninety eight percent\nPure banking on us while are playing well longer than it takes for tannahill to get healthy\nNo no I'm not saying that's going to happen but in the unlikely event that it would do you think gay students ethos while they're out there until the moment where he realizes it's time to flip back to tend to help\nMe yeah I I obviously if ... plays like he did last Sunday and he does that stack games after game after game doing that they're not going back to Ryan tannahill right away is going to be right and you're not a hundred percent yet\nYeah uh no not yet not yet not yet\nBut my thoughts and I don't have a crystal ball I don't know what's gonna happen\nMy thought is that period of time where broadcasts Wyler plays like last Sunday is not going to be very long and so call me a skeptic\n'em by definition that's what that is skepticism but I just don't think he can maintain that a\nCause and consistent quarterback play\nIs a lot harder to attain than stellar quarterback play you can be seller for one day and that's amazing but consistent over multiple games over a season very few people do that\nIs it there's something to be said though for the fact that ... had his career bottom out the failed season with the Houston Texans then he'll get a shot at them next Thursday night which adds a little spice to a game that otherwise may not have all that much faster but both teams can be over five hundred going into that game\nAnd you look at what happened last year he was on the browns roster that ultimately would would do when less than he wasn't deemed to be good enough to even make it onto a roster that wasn't able to win a single game\nMe for him any chance he plays now you just go out and let it rent because it's all it's all free money at this point it's all found donuts form at this point\nBecause he thought it was over in the rest of us thought it was over\nTo own a yum [laughter] yeah um it was\nLook this is a great story for broadcasts why are there is no doubt about it is an improbable thing that he is doing it it feels good kind of situation um you know the guy cast aside by multiple bad teens\nSuddenly get this chance and while he's a star is amazing that God that\nBut again [laughter] I don't want to rain on his parade but I just have to tell you brought Tobar fast\nThat ends in a couple of weeks he's gonna be over for a oh this is going to be something that uh we're going to see four five six seven\nEight nine more games is just not what he has been in his career and I think if you ask even the Miami Dolphins in there if if you put truth serum into the entire organization if you send them don't at least with truth serum\n[laughter] I think they would say hey you know what we're very happy\nAbout last Sunday but we don't know that this couldn't continue until January\nLast thirty seconds\nForeign to are they a viable playoff contender\nAbsolutely there is the season and the day they're not in the playoffs but you know what they've got to winnable games coming up on Sunday at home against Detroit and then a Thursday night at Houston\nIf they win those two games are going to be six in to Florida teams that started the first half of the the the two typically get into the playoffs\nAll right well hey Armando appreciate some of your time uh enjoy any donuts that may be left save some for us the next time and we'll talk to you soon\nBut is breakfast time so I think I'll
