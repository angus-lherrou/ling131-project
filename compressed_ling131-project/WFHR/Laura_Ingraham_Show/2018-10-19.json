night so Boston's in the world series\nCan beat him I said no\n[laughter] do they care for their donor World Series I'm looking forward to that Boston is just an amazing team or just an amazing team uh I don't think anybody's going to be Boston New series the feeling that they put together has been nothing short a fantastic so I I don't think anybody's going to be ...\nI can hope but if I had to put my money on it not maybe not but\nI think the brewers are headed to the world series when we talk on Monday we'll be talking about or where they're going to be trips to Boston airfare driving back and forth the home of Sam adams\nBeing town conjuring up images of the past all that kind of stuff we talking about that I'm I'm feeling good about this\nWhy but I Am feeling good about eight five five eight three zero eight six for age if you want to chime in if you're feeling good like I Am today dammit what your chest\n[laughter] I Love Kevin Hart references how ... how would you change the brewers lined up heading into the night's game if at all what are you doing to guarantee a when\nA I got a buddy of mine who uh and I I hate to admit it but he has a cubs fan who is ruining like crazy for the brewers so not all cubs fans or jags but he's reading like crazy for the brewers he has a Steve Bartman\n... of some type but he bought years ago it was almost like a voodoo doll at one point but he's he's he's got that out because that was in his pocket when due to quote break occurs when the cubs won the world series against\nThe Indians so he is now keeping that in his pocket through the entire run of the house yes and he didn't have it with him at work the other day\nAnd he said that's the reason the brewers last of the Dodgers so he's keeping it in his pocket tonight and tomorrow and the ... going to win so I said I didn't even do it I'm sure it's appreciate it as a cubs fan so he uh even though even if you\nA bright smart educated cubs fans are rooting for the Milwaukee Brewers I think there's a lot of people running for the ... when the series\nMichael's right here on central Wisconsin's home for the Wisconsin Badgers Marquette basketball and the NFL AM Thirteen twenty W F a jar\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nDon't want to\nGo ... we're on we're so glad you're on board\n[noise]\nYou're having a fantastic day getting ready for game six [noise]\nBreweries should I take it on the LA Dodgers and I believe they're going to get away\nI Believe they're going to get away and I believe they're going to the world series I think it's going to be awesome come Monday\nAnd maybe it's more more head air more heart than head but I just think they're going to get it done I just do a by five eight three zero eight six forty eight by eight three zero eight six for a\nJob and give us a shower I Want to hear from you what line of changes if any would you make right now\nWhat line of changes if any would you make right now you go Braun Cain yell at ... ... or see a scope ... Shaw and the anger over at first base paying your craft behind the plate\nWhat line of changes would you make you any eight five five eight three zero eight six for a brand and listening to us in Marshall Brain and how you doing it I mean I was going on\nA bill how we look in the day\nHow we look overlook and great what's up\nSo a change that would make I keep hearing that one I think this last game uh he really showed that um he's he's coming back route I don't think we have to worry about what I'm moving to thicken tick and yell at you and I are both out of the out of their spots there at two and four so I go Cain won\nRC uh to keep growing up three a number four I'd put shah and then you start to your your guys that are struggling a little bit more yell which you are and most and then whatever\nCatcher the pitcher feels more comfortable with I think where that guy that's awash as far as the brewers go I don't think I'm feeling quite as ... but I'm the may seem a little traumatic as far as the lineup changes go but it's just by Moneyball counseled on your long\nAll right no I charge to argue with that first year eight by five eight three zero eight six forty five five eight three zero eight six for eight\nYears this show gives you don't\nWant to hear from it how confident are you right now and his group what is your level of confidence going into this one eight five five eight three zero\nEight six for eight and a in addition to that ambition that a got a couple of people that are emailing me here as well but in addition to that you're gonna make any lineup changes what would they be what would they be I don't want as much as I Want to think about say Aguilar\nAnd the way he has not hit\nHim as a in the series now I'm kind of a believer that you know the back of your baseball card is is what it is that you're coming back home you just need something to kind of unplug it and things will start to flow\nBomb or something like that in the first inning or whatever I just get a feeling that they're they're ready to explode now I could be completely wrong but I just get the feeling that they're ready to explode do you as well paid five five eight three zero eight six way I I just I I Believe they are\nI Know some people think I'm Crazy but\nI I really believe they are really believe they're ready to go there seems ready to fly\nHang in there hanging there I think they're going to get it done I'm excited about it clearly excited about\nThere was a ... out this was from Mark Mark says I don't think they're going to get it done unfortunately you did I think they're on their way out but it's been a hell of a ride so far this season this was something that was unexpected I think this team has got a great building block for next year look for us to be back but I think on Monday we're going to talk about what went wrong in the postseason\nAh this one is from uh from Gregory\nGregory says let me start out by saying I hate to many Machado\nAnd here's why I think he's a good player who's on the verge of being gray but his own ego will never allow him to be that because he ... he draws too much attention and his own bravado will sink him\nThe brewers must go after him and his game because this is going to be their last opportunity to this postseason while I Want to believe my brewers are going to win I think this was a terrific here and they will have better luck next year when they pick up a couple of players and the off season to make a couple of more deals I Can't imagine David Stern\nStanding pat but not major changes need to be made\nThere you go from Gregory Gregory you may [noise] um\nThis one ah what else we have here oh this is just simply for more who says uh go ... go they're going to end up in the world series mark my words David says I'm In Vegas listening to your to you on the radio dot com at but I just put a hundred dollars down on the brewers to go to the world series now\nDavid that's what I'm Talking about it's not money that's going to break yet it's not bad in your house but you're putting enough data to make a significant impact in your faith now he's got like a preacher\n[laughter] [noise]\nI'll tell you the brewers fan um [noise] yeah well there you go if you win drinks are on you I guess the best way to put what are the odds right now what are the odds for the ... to go to the world series I don't even know that\nSort of how much of a gambler I Am I don't know what the odds are\nJob we don't really we don't do the bats over here every now and then we do the gambling on on Thursday for the NFL with the your point spreads but we don't really Joe you ... do you do sports book himself when you go to Vegas you're just more of a Texas hold 'em or something\nKind of guy like I like playing poker and after winning money and roulette I might try my hand and relate again Ron\n... is a interesting art\nOr ... it's I I got a friend of mine\nThat uh [noise] I usually just kind of do what he did when we would take cruises together and he was always the guy that I just follow in I'd walk away four or five hundred bucks and I always feel good and I quit he would keep going all night he'd wait till he was three four or five grand up didn't always work out that way but you know\n[noise] ah what is going to happen by the way the ... uh the Dodgers opened up tonight's game as a minus one twenty favorites so few wage or a hundred and twenty bucks you're going to get a hundred back if they win\nA latest odds that I have our\nFifth tea and now this was a week ago okay everybody Jimmy ... the odds but this one's from last week but from last week on October tenth and the brewers that Fifteen for two in the world series the ... tend to three and a Red Sox for a living uh five in the Astros were Twenty one to ten\n[noise] okay um\nThe money line as one Fifteen when when one of five\nOr for tonight's game\nI'm sixty two percent are saying that they believe the brewers are going to win\n\nA the over under its hit seven and a half when it comes to runs\n\nWell that's a that's that's interesting I Would almost but the uh the over tonight total of eight runs or more\nWeight mainly on the hill five and two the two twenty seven year a review on the hill tonight eight and three to Twenty one year All right\n[noise] uh\nThe consensus is the Dodgers are going to uh go over the money line\n\nOr so we'll see what happens interesting I'm not a big better so for those of you that do this for a living or do this all the time kudos to you 'cause I I'm just it it doesn't get to be my thing I Do some football but that's about all I Do I'm not into that and that's from one of the odd sharks\nUm [noise] a betting line\nFive eight three zero eight six for a Tim Allen hosted baseball post game show is going to be joining us coming up here shortly so hang in there for that and we'll see of teams go to the same optimism and enthusiasm that I Do also a little bit later on out of a Calvin from brewers dot com is going to join us we would be remiss if we did not talk a little Packers football as though they are in the by week\nPaul image are ready to go to animals is going to be here for a branch of the Green Bay press Gazette and Packers news dot com plus we'll see how he's doing because he was pretty miserable last Monday Night\nHe was a he was he's a little ill\nOr he was spewing as we say so uh we'll see how Eric's doing how he's feeling after whatever battle it is that he had his Porsche program brought you are good frigid bud lite Bud Light the official response with Michael sports talk network had a fantastic time last night uh Joe mama's I\nBe roasted chicken that I brought home last night was out standing may have it every Thursday night tonight obviously the fish fry out there with your mom as we had a great time thanks to the staff of management out there for having us and thanks to Bud Light for sending us out there\nOne of the women in front of me turn around and said wouldn't it be freaky if everybody went silent he wouldn't know what to think of what was going on is if somebody\nWas either going to jump on a field and grabbing it she said it would be Erie\nAnd I thought to myself for a minute I thought now you could never get everybody to do that because you're gonna have drunks wanting to do the hell out of him but think of that for a moment the euphoria of complete silence\nOr this or that would be cool we print out man you're going to the play you're thinking okay with it I'm looking for like one of those laser red dots on my head or something like the whole place is when silent because somebody pull something out you know\nKnowing that duty he'd laugh he just said that in the lab he probably raises arms up and say Bryant\nYeah well anyway that's okay I Am tonight to meet him score early get the crowd really really into it a and I'm looking for yell at you and I'm looking for a large specifically those two guys have to break out tonight for this seemed to be successful\n[noise] they do but also you have to you have to consider this I looked at some of the bats that Curtis Granderson have\nLimited as they are [noise] I I find it strange that he's ... they're not finding a way to get him\nA at bat or two more and and I probably would look for that in this game once if they can if they can get get spun around to the right hand or a Granderson is probably going to play a key role and and possibly have a huge at bat and us game tonight\nWhat do you think of my least starting and how short of a leash is my only have\nGet out\nAnd then then it is determined by the by the office and and if he can get the ... and get through\nTo be anywhere between this this\nMagical Seventeen out mark a but I Would put the window at the all Thirteen the Seventeen fourteen to Seventeen if they have a lead all hands on deck it's it's gonna be it's going to be a chess match or the highest level between Robertson council and and we're going to be saying\nThis this game without extra innings maybe a five hour game or if it's tight and its claws one Ron game as mildly\nYou know like I said gets gets his Fifteen outs um you're going to see that going back and forth Italy match up after match up after matchup everyone is going to empty empty their ... a little bit however\nYou know once you do get delayed if and when you get that lead you at a a little bit of this have to look at it as a two games kind of sat again\nOf course it's elimination so it's that's that's first and foremost but if you get a lead you might see you might just see a little greeting us and and I have a pitcher to held back for tomorrow\n[noise] um when when we talk about all hands on deck first of all I completely agree with you but you know\nYou can't get the game seven without winning game six right and is much is is I Want to look towards tomorrow and I do I mean unless they just get up and you know they get up you know five or six runs in its its you know\nJust your best strategy out their coastal best you can and get yourself to when I Move on to uh to the next day\nBut this is one of those extra inning ball games I don't care what I got to do I don't care if I'm pitch ending\nYou know starters I don't care if I'm pitching starters I don't care Craig council has thrown a Jersey himself and go out and play I everybody's everybody's plane that I have you got to figure something out and the biggest thing can I tell them as if this has to manufacture run and we again see them go with the opposite ends of\nSuper metrics rather than just actually going back to old school baseball I Will pull my hair out and find a giant place to jump off of a bridge I this team just when you're not hitting you have to do something don't you\nAbsolutely and that's again where we'll we'll look back on this on on a number of things and\nI won't say there's a laundry list of of growing pains that that a young manager has but I I agree with you a whole heartedly that the window is shutting and and the eagles game here\nA year and a half to ... ... you're going to have to go for it the only because\nYou're often says it's been a little a wall here a buck and a half for for a yellow and under a hundred for moose and and these sorts of things and you get a double from when you get a double in a tie ball game and the and I'll see us from your seven hitter and that was many ...\nAs good as the series is their land or sea uh as having you still have to go down right get back to basics and say what more do I want out of seven eight and a pinch hitter I Want to lead off double against them over and I got a man\nThat is really interesting to look at in tonight's game if he will do that a bill I I'm not sure my guess is he'll lean toward it [laughter]\nHopefully like you said the off chance than we've been waiting for this and I would think you would think the officer just blow up and put us out on the spot on the war it's just not happening and as the innings move on as the game gets deeper you will have to think more in terms of getting on getting over and getting in\nWhat do you think of line of changes in the sense of setting a you'll are what do you think of putting Braun at first and moving guys around Domingo Santana whose been hitting the ball coming off the bench playing right field which goes back to ... or back to the left you got Canaan center uh putting Travis showing the land up tonight going with your best to offensive line\nI think you you you stay the course in that regard I don't think wholesale changes or or even you know ... is is the way to go here they these boys gotcha here so you give them an opportunity here and\nI Do believe and agree with ... so that they are in a position of strength here heading into this game there at home\nThe best team or at home fifty one and thirty a crowd going crazy let these guys at least afford them the opportunity to bust out and and if not then you start making those changes and and those changes are going to they could come fast and\nOnce you once you get you know three four innings into this game\nTime with Tim Allen who's the baseball post game show and on this no Tim I'm going to end the conversation because I really believe they're going to get a win I Believe they're moving on to a World Series and I believe you're going to be ecstatic running up and down Wisconsin Avenue come\nCome Saturday Night I Do want to ask you though I don't know if you read Tom ... piece on major league baseball on on the Machado situation\nWhen he talked about which auto and then he gets into the post season and how it's been played in the fact that basically super metrics and launch an eagles have been thrown out the window you're back to pictures just throwing big sweeping breaking balls off speech stuff\nNobody's challenging hitters nobody's really throwing those pinpoint accuracy basketball's like we've seen in the past you get some closures that come in for an inning and blow you away but for the most part this has been throw the metrics out the window but then again fundamentals are gone you don't have sacrificed bunch you don't have sacrificed while you don't have any behind a runner you don't have hit and runs\nNone of that they're just relying on hopefully we can connect gripping ripping call it a day meanwhile you have just like the other day and the brewers game thirty to strike out some Fifteen heads I mean and strike outs are no longer a big deal\nSo in a five hour game and Thirteen innings\nIn a let's say in June\nHow big of a turn off his ... for the average baseball fan of this is the direction baseball is going because the post season's been exciting but to do this every day in the regular season this could do this can be a detriment to baseball baseball sincerely worried about it\nYeah I don't I don't think you can throughout the duration of a season and and cry council had had alluded to that I mean we can't do this all year long\nThere's two things says is just ... it really comes down to two things at least from the brewers standpoint when you when you go to this or you know short start and then go to your pan and and all the bowl panning one is\nIs it because of personnel is it because of the pictures that you have is that why you're taking this tack to you know bullpen more often than not or whether it's in the regular season policies and whatever it is it that\nOr is it that you as a small market you're never really going to get the Clayton ... adjusted for ladders that are going to take it you know you expect is six and two thirds are seven and a third out of these guys every time out\nAnd then I'll I'll add in a a stipend to that that would be you know ...\n... if you're looking for overland or how do you get him home grown if you don't give them an opportunity to go get that thing down if you're if you're yanking 'em in a two to one ball game after four and a third how does he get the ah the reps to go ahead and do that it's\nI don't know if it's a small market thing per se I don't know if it's a baseball thing I don't know if it's a personnel things so there's there's three factors there\nThe strike outs of the one thing that jumps out at me to answer your question yeah that's the one thing that just jumps off that she guys come on man you don't tell me that you're going to justify striking out as being part of the game not buying it\nI'm Tim always a pleasure in or out of time but man I Can't wait for tonight I Can't wait for tomorrow and I can't wait for Monday to come in here and talk about the ... World Series\nYeah pinch yourself brewers fan is still in this thing and it and it so you're you're one of three teams left on the map here it's really cool\nStuff to move on to talk to you later okay you got to bail you out there you go to Alan hosted baseball post game show joining us for a couple of minutes on the Schneider only challenge that are highly drivers right now you work hard they treat you fair eighty plus years they've been getting into and called him a hundred and forty four chronicle Schneider\nCalm stay tuned coming up after the job of the are out of ... dot com and it will be a job he is going to be here we'll talk some more about game six of this and I'll see as a Miller Park coming up this evening also coming up next our the Dodgers cheating mortal why go show next\nSitting Michael's sports go toward [noise]\n[noise] being posted Wisconsin badger hockey right here on your twenty four hour information station am Thirteen twenty WFAN jar Wisconsin Rapids\n\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by their works relief\nPam culture after a brief pause that migrate caravan is on the move again it broke through gate to the Guatemalan border crossing and it's heading toward a bridge to Mexico in Phoenix CBS chip Reid says President Trump is making it a caravan of big campaign issue the\nPresident continues his western campaign swing today they'll hold a rally in nearby Mesa, Arizona tonight and with the election day just two and a half weeks away he's turning his focus to immigration justice he did in the presidential campaign\nWhen the caravan reporter Louisa Reynolds talks about why many want to get to the U.S when\nEven eat that she left her children behind in gear as I was also leading poverty unemployment and run with the levels of violence in Honduras particularly in cities that to some little Sula\nTurkish authorities are questioning employees of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to see if they know anything about the disappearance of Washington Post columnist you'll ...

Shaw aircraft who's the guy\nOr another bomb from Orlando Garcia who's been hitting the ball pretty well this postseason eight five five eight three zero eight six point let's go down let's go out to LA David David is on the line David a gang Kayla my David David how're you doing\nGood thing we're kind of hanging out with a look at you got about an hour and a half okay and and and I think I think your concern\nOr are the same as ours about how your team is being over managed by chemical well ... okay I think he's the third was a line up too much\nUm I think we figured out you're hurting already and we kind of been doing it both ways with with the long ball and just doing the believe all just doing what we need to do to get it done mhm and I think the parents are really happened in the first game will be came back from being down five nothing to almost\nWin the game right sort of monetary and the experiment hurt him out\nSo I Would agree and I said at the time the one thing about the Dodgers is that the that I learned in that game as they're not going away you're not going to just put them away to find nothing now they did shut them out to uh to victory in in was a game three uh which was rather impressive 'cause I thought for sure they'd come storming back but since then\nThey've ah they've been able to kind of figure things out in the latter portion eating a majority that runs in the series have been scored in any six seven eight nine not necessarily in one through five\nRight and I think also a car experience you have a lot of players that were there last year I Am a chart thrown a lot of\nExcitement good or bad but we didn't get it is going to come right thing and uh I think to my but the the long ago that do it in especially in your ballpark more or less the hitters ballpark for\nIt is still on the other hand the brewers have been very successful in home they're very successful when they score first they're very successful and they ... play clean baseball uh the numbers are astounding as a matter of fact and they they do well at home so they know the ballpark as bad as well as anybody but you're right it's hitters part however it's usually hitters park\nJune through the end of August into September now you've got colder weather it's colder inside that ballpark the ball is going to fly exactly the same but it is more silver hitters ballpark than it is going to the cavernous area that is LA\nRight out and I think it's all hands on that night I think I think the Congress how to win it than I I don't want to go to a game of and and and and and worry about\nThat that was going to be my wife she goes to a game seven who do you favor\nYou know or if I'm going to be a homerun take the dog or than I think her child will be available to pitch an ending or two and and you know we have bumped up there with our pitching and you know and you know um\nWe've been using our country a lot and it's been managed right and I think well well it's good to be a hard game in them but I'm I'm hoping that doesn't go that far\nAnd we're going to be heading down the first base line cousins in my right pocket I have done this now for the last three games at home the brewers are winning I Can't feel any better about this and then what I Do right now\nOr whatever when the last three games at home they they lost the last game there at Miller Park\nAnd what's the last three games at home that you went to I mean that's what you mean I can understand that\nGuy writes an email inbox is going to beat a mango Santana he's ... he's been hitting how the hell out of the ball coming off the bench\nI Believe he's going to be the X factor in tonight's game Eric says that I think the X factor is going to be more land or see a tremendous defense he's going to come up big in a big moment he's been hitting the ball extremely well ever since September got here he is your end of the season MVP\nA then we've gone from Alexis who says can your MVP also be an unsung hero because he's not hit the ball real well in the postseason I think yeah which is going to turn it around tonight come on yelling\nMr lumpy rights and the way these email inbox feeling good about tonight's game not so about game seven I think the British backs are against the wall and this team is going to end up a lead and this team is going to end up being a little bit tied the Dodgers have been there done that\n[noise] um I I don't necessarily agree with you Mr lumping put it this way if you're the Dodgers you really really really want to close it out tonight\nYou desperately want to close it out tonight because you do not\nYou do not want to have to go back and uh and try to face this team with the home crowd on Saturday Night I don't think you want to do that at all so I I'm\nI'm thinking tonight's that night that they are going to stick everything they can possibly stick into tonight's game to win this thing to end it and and get back to LA or get on to Boston with because Boston is going to be hosting [noise] um no I\nI I think tonight's tonight or that you're going to see how they just go all in\n\nA five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six foray\nGive us a shout what are you thinking what do you think it\nWhen it comes to this Milwaukee Brewers team tonight you've also got some bucks basketball by the way the books are opening up the brand new Pfizer forum the big burrito downtown\nThe big brown burrito should've been sponsored by ... have been fantastic budget tonight they're opening up that new arena downtown officially as the first regular season game gets underway so you're going to have say what does that whole Joe like Seventeen thousand for basketball or something like that you're going to have close to forty tonight\nIn Miller Park maybe a little bit more than that and then you're gonna have another Seventeen at the bucks game tonight sold out\nSome people may have crossover tickets but I'm sure they're either giving them away or selling them off but tonight you're going to have sixty thousand fans damn near crowded into Venus that doesn't even include the sports bars and other places downtown that are going to be happen because of it you were going to have any crazy night\nIn downtown Milwaukee is going to be electric and it's going to be fantastic and I cannot wait\nA while speaking of that this one is from James James writes I Can't wait for tonight's game when he hunker down right in front of my big screen TV Tonight unit\nAh hopefully many people are doing the same the ratings should be a huge here in Milwaukee Brewers fans are the best fans in baseball we all know that they have put two and a half million plus through the gates ten times in the last eleven years and this is a baseball town\nLet's be honest about it is a baseball town here it is a football state period\nBut is it baseball town there is a this is as high as I remember maybe I mean I'm a prisoner of the moment\nBecause we'd probably see the same thing in two thousand in the lab and then when they finally broke through and got to five hundred people really static and then when he finally got to the postseason I went to Philadelphia people were ecstatic so I remember two thousand eleven like yesterday and people were ecstatic so\nUm yeah I think uh probably since eighty to this is you know one of the biggest game since eighty two let's be honest so tonight is going to be off the hook\nOff the hook I for one I'm gonna be doing the same thing I Am not going to be hunker down an easy chair though by the way speaking of that if you live in say Brookfield or saw six or walk or jog around the della field area uh I eat a pumpkin for\nI Need a good place to go get them because we have not carved pumpkins yet the whole thing with the moving to new house and everything there are some things that fall by the wayside\nAnd I have not done the pumpkin thing yet\nSo if you live in that area are you know some place in that area and I guess there are store bought pumpkins I understand that\nBut we're looking for either fresh cut right off the farm type of pumpkin back a big farm or something you go to and kind of you know walk up and down and do this or thing or you go out and cut it off yourself\nBut I'm looking for a big pumpkin ...\nSo if you know of one walk is job Brookfield ah della field or caught 'em a walk Sussex uh even up at Colgate where we were last night in those areas\nI Need to know a good pumpkin far or good place to get\nSo please give me a shouting five five eight three zero eight six for it I'm looking for that tonight 'cause me and the kids are going to turn on the game I'm going to kick back where they probably either a Bud Light or aside or tonight or sometime maybe it's still a site or a little bit of dinner and car pumpkins that's what's going on in the dock denied while I've got the brewers

Schneider orange hotline by doing that I mean what's happening [noise]\nHey bill how're you doing very well I'm doing well so the ah [noise] well we know that the the Packers are off you're on the by week's show at this point in time we're seeing this you can actually turn things around and figure things out women a week's time um we started talking about this the other day but\nI guess realistically ... first and foremost if you're going to try to fix some big if you're looking for one thing that's going to make a difference what would it be\n[laughter] well there's certainly a few options are for me it would be the production from the edge rush hours from the outside linebacker group I just don't know\nIt you know even if the Packers had the best secondary in the league which they don't it's a very improving group I think they're headed at a very good direction as a secondary\nBut I don't care if it's the best I could during the week I just don't know if you get if you're not getting a pass rush from the outside linebackers\nWhat you can really expect from a secondary because you're putting them in a really tough spot if you didn't ask them to cover for that long you're asked for a lot of trouble I think the only encouraging part of that as an offshoot to that answer\nOr is that my pet that that a good job or you know getting his quarters especially in situations where there was able to get after the quarterback or you do get good production up front from guys like headache Larkin like Daniel so there's other there's other reasons why the Packers are still getting a decent pass Russia I just\nI don't know if you don't get it from the outside linebackers eventually if you can be a top\nTwelve type the fence and I I just don't know bill short of\nYou know playing off trade over the weekend if you're Brian good against uh I I don't know short of doing that why you would expect to kind of wake up and we ate\nAnd think that your group is suddenly going to be\n\nMichael's right here on central Wisconsin is home for the Wisconsin Badgers market basket ball in the NFL AM Thirteen twenty W F a jar\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] hopefully\nYou're having an awesome awesome day we certainly appreciate your hanging out with his paid five five eight three zero eight six for eight five five eight three zero age six four right if you want to give us a shell please feel free to do show [noise]\n\nGive us a call ... we'll get back out of here momentarily the sports in the program brought Jabbar brands that quick trip don't forget shop in reducing tailgating\nThey have everything for utilities supply stakes broadside dodge bonds comments you name it plus no fee ATMs if you need a little cash for the ballpark you didn't tell getting outside favorite beverages adult beverages the lowest legal pure beer prices are on the twenty four thirty bucks keep that in mind\nAs a quick trip in tobacco at pleasant back all the polls groceries all you gotta do is stop in check it out for yourself you're going to be doing some tailgating a silver tore we get back to the phone calls for everybody that's been on hold for a while my it gives you a new Berlin Mike how you doing today man what's going on\nAt the heart today doing what's up\nThat point you also like most of your listeners everybody's watching these guys pretty much the whole season and for me I've noticed a lot in the second half of the season they really patient at the plate taking their are\nGetting their base heads I don't see that there's no walk I mean I don't even know how many they've had the series but it's probably been less than five\nI'm more of that that ah that the point\nThere were point I'll I Will check a walks in just the league championship series oh you've got four out of ... Santana would drift came K Braun Aguilar has one yell at us for ... in crafts all have one\nWorld where they towards the end of the season like um you know the last two series they were walking constantly mhm no yup and get most guys on base and really putting pressure on the pitching staff\nAnd early on this series they weren't taking walks and they were working even Clinton ... they they work those guys pretty good and games one and two and then what ... did was come back and start bussing them in with a fastball out over and then when he started doing was going to the curb or got ahead an account and then all of a sudden they're going fishing ...\nDo it right early on when the ... and then what happened was as LA maybe your judgment and now it's an aggressive mission to topple line up at ... at the top of the gal\nRight so now it's time for us to make that adjustment yeah no I I Would agree I ever on their pitching staff no\nI completely agree I appreciate the phone call which is one of the reasons why when you look at the statistics\nAnd you say OK yeah Christian yellow cheesy struggling okay as far as the overall Elsie yes he said he won fifty buddies got four based on balls he's got a two Ninety two on base percentage you still see the higher obviously but\nHe's got ... five strike Allen's always runners in scoring position by the way three hits only scored one run in twenty at bat Miller rental Cain\nHas got the average of two fifty now\nBut he's sitting there were seven strike albums I'm the only one walk to show for it he's got one are behind the day and three double so he's gotten on the set the table but they just haven't been able to bring 'em in\nNot consistently anyway five five eighty three zero eight six way 'cause he's only ... only has one run scored\nLet's go to Shawn listening to us in Racine Sean how you doing today man was going on\n... um I think are the has to be key in this series I wouldn't have too much except for\nA shot second base than I\nI Would switch of all I Know I think James van pushing too hard which with his strike out but you just said\nIt's causing yellowish to push too hard on top of obviously and being the MVP of the season and then when he was in LA it's got all his family there that I heard yesterday they all switch for rooting for the Dodgers written for him mhm and the ... so if you were to put our lead off at all they had this here or in the season\nBonnet who will be ... three she has a couple of guys in front of him then I'd put shot for an hour after him and instead of that in the picture night I came there so he can get hit hit it right like starting to essentially after we'd all guys in a row\nBecause they really are he is and the only one that's been consistent which is crazy this akin to during the way it was in the middle of the season and the series\n[noise] um I I like it I liked the fact that you appreciate the phone call like the fact that it's defensively salad and you're still thinking about putting guys who who can play small ball at least get on in in those positions I like it I Can't argue with it I like I still think they're going to win I just do\nMark yes marches how can you say that when they have looked terrible in the last two games and looked terrible they lost an extra inning game to the window to their sales came back and listen twenty four hours and had kind of an ugly game the only game in which was an ugly game otherwise this teams played toe to toe good baseball with the LA Dodgers\nToe to toe with one game\nBut he just didn't look good they looked like they just were out of gas a little bit and they still tried to come back in their ballgame um look they're coming home I'm feeling good about you but I've I've got mold you're going to go tomorrow listening to us in Steven's point mark how're you doing man\n[laughter] I like the motel first year that I I'm good um yeah the X factor and I I have a couple actually sure um I mean can crank council play small ball if he has to be there at the big one\nUm the other is will he change up his head thing at the end where Jeremy Jeffrey isn't\nThe closer and either hater or um can able are\nAnd what they're made Jeffries are we going to the tonight I think those are good questions\nThat that's an interesting question because ... is is not if you could talk about an X factor there as a matter of fact\nYeah absolutely I mean he ended up coming in and just pitching wiped out even in a couple of even a couple of\nInnings and gives them the opportunity to win the game and that that could be one of the biggest performances most far by a guy who has struggled to this one I mean you put it this way you can yell at shooting a bomb and giving a contribution and then all of a sudden you've got a Jeffers coming in and getting a close are you talking about a ball or confidence going in the game so\nYeah my other question for you is is after the brewers do finish that in and out in the world series who is your MVP for the ... theory\n[noise] ooh\nThat's a great question right question [laughter] yeah I'll I'll let you ponder it for a while I appreciate it and we'll pay you if I had to go with an MVP right now [noise]\n[noise]\nWow\nYou could say Orlando Garcia you could say or land or sea uh um\nUh you know the other guy that you really do think I was branded Woodrow seven in the third inning so far five it's only three runs\nAll earned twelve strike outs one walk he's wanted one\nBut he's been fantastic or shut seen he's he's been dynamite teaser body one fifty eight against them whether we're both a point nine for an e array of zero\nMan\nThat's a great question that's a great question\nI I I Would either have to go just seen our CEO or wonder if you you even go hater I guess to a certain extent he's real foreign foreign two thirds in three games\nHasn't given up a run\nYou could even go in and Josh have these kind of whip of point eight six so far this postseason\nYou could do that\nPaid five five eight three zero eight six forty five five eighty three zero eight six for a good question too damned listening to assume an awkward Dan how you doing it I mean it was going on\nA bill I doing math do what's up\nHey it so I got through things are you sure I'll start with the on one side of the federal at first okay uh my fiance thought it'd be a good idea to do a pumpkin carving contest in my house but I very game six okay for having a bunch of friends over that's gotta be out at the ... thing you know\nIt'll be a little distracted when it's always fun if you especially to involve pumpkins and beer for\nSure there'll be plenty of that maybe Republicans here now you go um [laughter] so I'm thinking so I'd be like a scary thing for my mom can or should I Do like a happy face I'm a superstitious guy what do you think's going to be the the secret to a victory that I\nUm I mean you go you can go back years and we've had conversations on your program in the past about you know some of the failed jabs or outright jazz coming from the quarterback towards the coach the coaches professional never never kind of gets into that kind of stuff but I think there's there's a good bit of a of animosity\nCan you overcome it sure they don't wink wink solves everything when you're when the ball games nobody cares a but I you know you look at the comments made on a Monday Night were you know the the quarterback says you've got to find ways to get the ball out of his hands on you know it was kind of a hey this is some blame on you and some on me too so [noise]\nI think that the relationship could be effective but you know primarily if they're not winning ball games and that relationship could get a viral\n[noise] ah that's what it was going to say how how broken do you think this is I see I I Can't believe that Aaron Rodgers will see anything that has been so behind closed doors or I Know there's a level of frustration out of a competitor at the end of the ball games especially if things aren't going right so you can make certain comments that can be [noise]\nPortion or people that are looking for drama you can find them to be dramatic I don't know what I I hate I hate to I Try to get the benefit of the doubt Aaron Rodgers and Mike mccarthy to say that this is a workable relationship and they were fined behind closed doors and they kind of lab with the media for making such a big deal about it\nUh but when you know one comment one thing but when you hear numerous things you start to scratch your head don't you\nTell us to look at it and if you sit back and really reflects going on for a long time\n\nI Would look at a Aaron Rodgers and say to him 'cause Erin clearly is calling the plays into it off and\nSo I Would have daring to say okay is this because nobody's ever asking the question hey\nWe might gives you the play aren't you the guy that had run pass options Leonard scrimmage is every play called them in particular manner or can you only base it upon what Mike sending in as far as personnel groupings already have you're having trouble with those guys yesterday I read the article from pro football talk\nThey said the the Packers are the worst team in the national football league it clock management isn't that then falling upon so the quarterback more so than it is the head coach\nSolomon is is how fast the calls are coming in from the sidelines you know that's that's part of it um you know our worst I guess that's a pro football focused says and that must be there is but I'm\nA I'm not so sure it is all on the quarterback on church all the coast but certainly a combination of two of both of those guys\nThen when you are talking about this team and the ability or as for a special teams go ah at what is your level of confidence they've got this thing worked out\nOh I think it's fine I think you know you're gonna have ups and downs throughout the course of the season I really liked the auditor for a young guy that guy is only going to get better um protests the cameras going to the end of November December how he can hit that that that ball when it's frozen 'em\nAnd and the kicker you know I don't have any issues there I think the coverage is good and return team hasn't been too bad um you know I I think the special teams are okay that that to me is the least there's a concern of the biggest concern for me or this\nAnd making sure that that offers can score points I'm In the defense can just get that one stuff that they need in the game\n[noise] how often do you think this team has the capability to continue to fall behind and continue to come from the well uh I because I don't know how much\nMore they've got left in them to do so because you're going to eliminate the run game you're going to eliminate a Aaron Jones you're going to eliminate a lot of things I understand about coming back and having the best quarterback in football but how many times can you continue to go to this well and walk away going yeah this is the Superbowl caliber team\n[noise]\nUh [noise] that is a really good question and I don't know the answer to that at all Trump um but I think it you know when you have a young quarterback\nI think that you know coming back when you don't have to come back it's easier because you might be able to get that stuff that gets that your office another chance at the end of the general um I I Would say they're looking at what they got coming out I think they can come from behind too many more times still be a playoff team\nRight now see that's what I keep thinking is that we're we're we're caught up into what's going on and we we we love it the fact that they can come from behind Aaron Rodgers the best quarterback and football and all the praise and accolades but\nHow many times can you stop breathing you know what I mean before he finally just died and and that's kinda where I'm at it it's it's exciting to watch but this is not a championship team if you're going to continue to say the super bowl or bust for this team you know what I mean\nMhm totally I totally understand which in yeah I I yeah boy you're right I don't think that they can they can keep\nDoing it because they're facing some quarterbacks there just aren't going to let it happen not only that but you're going to be ... to ... and ... and there's two minutes left in the game can put it in his hands and I stand you know and no debt clock away so\nSo you know they they have to start playing with a lead because that's your defenses okay\nUm you know if they've got to keep playing catch up with the taxi basking guys to to to make a stop rate the game with males to threaten to err on the clock that you're asking an awful lot if one mistake quicker bunch it with a ... is playing out on the trans\nOr into St Peter I'm playing real well right now that you're actually that's a that's a tough question to ask and I think they uh they really got to start getting all this project playing with the league um so that they could be that position turns out that clock away at the end so that they don't have to rely on the defense that make that stop\nA couple of things before I let you go first and foremost a we talked about the run game what do you do with Williams in Montgomery how do you work them and do you just make them down guys because that's parenting situations or do you use them because I'm a ... the whole thing of using one back per series drive me crazy\nYou know I Do too and I think a lot of people feel the same way\nI Know we talk to the first time last week in the play with nowhere or what would it have to back to the vacuum at the time you know eighty eight Williams or excuse me a job in the back of your time to play with that reversed kind of thing that went nowhere um\nThere's some tiny messed up there but but you saw that for the first time I think you can do some of that stuff especially when you know right now you know you got to tell you that that are playing\nSuper great you get two hundred receivers might be you know I think you might start seeing some all that um but I you know I I think for a second down you're you're you're probably got to kind of give it to thirty three and you know and I think thirty is pretty good out of the backyard and of course gave the eight or so you know those guys make really good they're down back\n[noise] good stuff very glad you're feeling better well John again next week okay\nAll right you're
