Arizona you should be able to get by them at home anyway get this guy help ease on my fantasy bench needed the scoring points over there was no selfish I Am a if the chargers at\nCleveland you know what happened to the chargers the last time they went to Cleveland is what happens law [laughter] so uh the the point spread is only one point and the chargers should be much the barrier deemed the Cleveland Browns duty ally\nI it's tough to go against the chargers this one I just think the browns are not going to be what they were well a couple of weeks ago the taken up [laughter] I'm doing it I'm taking them\nAround [noise] are they going to surprise people all season long I think was wins and losses and you know what the charges of definitely got the back of their head\nEither this is a I think this is a lock Chicago Miami who live in Miami not bleeding good football and and it's a a Chicago has been playing blistering beef bans a what do you think happens\nIs I think Miami as another Jekyll and Hyde gene but I'm picking them at home here in Miami I Am too yeah mine's cargo I may\nGo against you and everyone I Know we're both together I Minnesota He also Chicago over Miami or next to Carolina at\nWashington Cam Newton company coming up by tanned rested and ready right a big on Washington team's gonna banged up I guess Chris Thompson is not going to play a and Adrian Peterson is

[noise] I Know that your team to win the game I you know what I think the Bengals will not be\nThe bangles goes to his always play well in Cincinnati so I'm picking the students they need this more than that I\nKnow I have a guy that I have a problem here have a problem because\nI Want to pick Cincinnati to win the game at home but they don't want to put the whammy of my fantasy team because I got guys on that Pittsburgh team I Need to point to go Pittsburgh I go to Pittsburgh with you because I got I got to have those points they better do that that's a hell of a way to pick a football games but\nUh Tampa Bay at Atlanta this is a division rivalry game and again you look at the total and winning over fifty fifty seven fifty seven is the total over ... ... you know and the fantasy of gurus if you will hold ... ...\nUm all love gene is Winston to just air it out this week against the Matt Ryan who is been airing it out all season long who do you like\n... last week the cover of the

Wilson not a very good football team yeah we like I like the raiders really upset and somebody has to do\nWhile I don't know if I can go with something as to give that\nMuch or I'm going to go with Russell Wilson to somehow figure out a way not to lose that game\nOr against the raiders at ... stadium wonder what the weather is we should call over there to see what the weather's like or for the game [noise] long distance [noise]\nUh yeah we'll put it on I'll splurge I'll put it on my card uh let's see how 'bout buffalo boy Buffalo's the doorman team this year one of them are and they're

indoor game it's not like you're going to be slowed by snow actually you know it all he ran right in this stuff has explode or what do you like Texans\nYeah I'm going to take effect it looks like we're not going to be off on every single one of Iran's I heard Bush could say that he's taking Denver over the rams because he hates the ramp [laughter] that's the same logic guy you here just a minute ago I had to see the way to pick wins a\nRams at Denver I mean they are the Broncos the team to knock off the juggernaut Mm\nThe grudgingly he did go with the Broncos but I'm going to stick with the rams on this one I got to take the rams too because a ... is a great play color returns to the ... over to somebody else to wait ... even think about and\nI'm a you know I Love what what they're doing there I Know that there are a little bit of short handed a injury wise but everybody is\nA I Need a lot of points out it's an ...

weapons have unit that could sometimes like jaguars\nThe jags excuse me at Dallas I don't even have a cop out here so sorry for\nMe I Can't even take care of that myself a Dallas yeah I'm going to go with the Jacksonville as well on on just defense and the cowboys not looking very good and and then doing that whole emperor's new clothes things you know the Jerry Jones does they're not around around\nA Baltimore at Tennessee excuse my a condition here ah for not giving you a better a description your vote are you like\nGoing to get I I pick of the ravens but I'm picking them anyway after the Baltimore because Tennessee it's just kind of a dysfunctional football team too because of injury and and whatever else I don't know that that's just a an audit together football team and even though they're at home I'm going to have to take Baltimore Kansas City New England when everybody's looking for we talk about that total\nFifty nine yeah is the total poverty Kansas City New England

sludge an extreme temperatures you know it also protects our troops what each purchase of metal bowl sympathetic breaching the portion goes to be interrupted fallen heroes\nUm if you're looking for a quarterback or you'll get your hands on him or the patriots running backs Sony Michel I he is absolutely take it on the rules the official patriots running back you know because the the other back as white\nUh but I mean he's a solid start and what should be a shootout against achieves defense is the third most scrimmage yards a hundred and eighty eight per game and the second most touchdowns seven\nAnd the second most points per game listen to running back ah listen this guy's a solid starts he gets the Rockies got to get the goal line duty\nUm he's been solid so far if you waited for a couple of weeks on this guy or you you took a flyer you drafted knowing he was going to be deemed it wasn't probably going to start in the first week or two is going to pay real dividends now you're already has and he's going to probably\nUh put up again in his said chief's game which are all big for his shoes I mean a fantasy football\nWe're open for every game to be a shootout right except for those games it's for the games where you're just like I've got Sony Michel on one team and then I play against him and another for like every time he scores that sounds like\nHey I'm a tighter Lockett a went off or Ninety eight yards the touchdown against the rams last Sunday he gets a really nice match up this week against the raiders I Know it's in England but other readers were just lit up for three hundred and thirty nine yards and a couple of ... by the chargers a ... a looking like he's almost looking\nHe's almost solid enough to make it at the top ten a receiver this week I Would go ahead and start that guy against the raiders who were just a mess what does it grew instead hold on I've got it for John group that yeah ah\nWe have quote a ways to go before turning the corner that's the latest crude and quote we have a quote a ways to go yeah you do have a ways to go before you're turning the corner with bad team specially\nAside the it's not dwell on my pillow Mac thing about guys that were not high on today\nKenny Stills who started the season on fire first game was gigantic number but he has two games that leads Fifteen PBR point and three games with seven points are less\nNow when he doesn't scored a touchdown you know what this means touchdown to Ben and I mean he doesn't help your fantasy team at all and he has yet to catch more than four passes in any game this year along with not having more than six targets in every six targets\nA you've got to get more than ... going to make things really tough\nOn the Miami past game too spicy tannahill or having a very little time to look down field for still he's going to have to get the ball out faster and still says the guy that likes to get down feel that lessens his chances Kenny still not a guy that I Want to start today he's on the list\nAlex Collins or you know the ravens coach John Harbaugh it says that he's going to continue to limit Collins workload but hope to keep him quote airports fresh one scene in France that's why he's limiting it touches the if you got college I remember him and he's got a team last year and thinking wow this guy saw what I have to remember him for next\nThe whole committee with him in ... or maybe even a third um\nAnd now he's your coach talking about we're going to limit his workload here want to keep them fresh means you don't have the confidence to given well look if the guy gets done you're going to given the rock\nThat might be a good thing for Baltimore not a good thing for you call is played just twenty seven of eighty seven to Baltimore snaps against Cleveland last week\nWhat that is not keeping somebody fresh that's keeping somebody off the field twenty seven of eighty seven cents I don't know if that's about putting the ball a ground or what but he can can use to lose the goal line chances to buck gallons look to various Allen has been somebody that's been stealing those the goal line things for at least a couple of years there in Baltimore\nAnd colleges now combined for Fifteen PBR points in the past two games against the theaters and browse\nSo I mean this is not a guy that you can rent that confidence now here's a guy that is on my list and this will be for Chris Thompson a was ruled out their thinkers Thompson not going to be able to rush the ball for the Redskins today Peterson was expected them\nA is expected to play through the shoulder injury that he got a last week a New Orleans but then it's it's just hard to trust the guy that's less than a hundred percent that's over thirty three years old or I mean running backs over thirty this guy's thirty three he's also got to play in a short week 'cause the saints game was on Monday Night and the road\nAnd facing Panthers defense that is the uh you know going to be pretty pretty doubt I mean I it's hard for me\nTo run him out there and put it on the list when I think when I think ... times it was going to be in the backfield now that he's not it's going to depend on my shoulder and how much that the shoulders bothering him still Adrian Peterson not a hundred percent short weak or they you know they're going to be getting onto a specially of Thompson is out of the game I don't think he's a good start\nA today for your for your fantasy club\nUm other guys that are worth thinking about because you have to have some by week villains you guys are sitting up from the Detroit squad that puts a bunch of wide receivers that quarterback or a out New Orleans the same thing\nOr not to mention a running back so running backs a village Lindsey versus the rams you know the rams weakness in the dynamic in Sioux even said this earlier in the week they were talking about this bronco rushing attack he says yeah you know what we need to clean things up in the running game\nUh [laughter] yeah you could say that they are allowing five yards a carry that sports worst in the NFL and we're just barely able to hold off the Seahawks thirty three to thirty one and that was because the ... were running a ball like crazy on Chris cars and Mike Davis rent for a hundred and eighty four yards last week\nAgainst the rams in Seattle\nAgain that's in Seattle it's home but still a the Denver running game filled Lindsay is a guy that has to come out of the gate strong I mean the only bad game he's had his where he got a little carried away and punch somebody\nIn a pile and got tossed out of the game other than that he's been a pretty solid place so if you're looking for a look at that's not a guy just lying around the waiver why that you're going to pick up but if you got him you want to start him against the ramp defenses uh I guess what I Want to say about the same thing Chris cars and Mike Davis\nI could have some pretty good games this week there could have both have a good game this week\nUh because they're playing that raiders team I mean it's probably\nIt's Chris Carson out of the gate first but might Davis I mean here's a guy that got fifty one carries these last two games he also got the bulk of the sea hawks rushing load on Sunday was Nineteen carries a you know so I mean this is the guy that you can trust to give the ball to Chris Carson and might Davis is a pretty solid back up to\nA these guys both of them especially if you're tied to buy weak man I Would run Mike Davis out there if I needed a running back to somebody that uh that I put in there so uh that's some a system stardom stuff for your fantasy football team coming up next a little bit more on the Jimmy butler saw got yeah can you believe what a story this as [laughter]\nAs long as on the NBA version a ball or is I think right it's coming your way next NBC Sports radio and NBC Sports radio as mobile app\n[noise]

day and mark\nI Can't wait for tonight the Sunday night show down on NBC from Fox robot coming up here nine early games highlighted once again by the Steelers who are at Cincinnati and mark we talk about the Steelers last week they responded at home by dropping forty one of the falcons what did they show you in that game and what about the Bengals off to a four one start\nWell let's take Pittsburgh first Jeff I I thought that they had a little bit more balance in their office James Caan her I thought had his best game of the season and uh what's been bent a big band has never shied away from throwing the football but I I don't know that you can win consistently the way that team is built by throwing the ball fifty times are games so I like the balancing that off and that has to continue\nOr against Cincinnati today ah you know from a defensive perspective they made a few changes defensively a both and personnel and the way they've got about calling the defense tried to simplify a little bit more\nA vet has eliminated some of the big place and when you have AJ green on the field for instance in Cincinnati that's that's going to be job one I liked the Cincinnati team off to a foreign once starred\nUh but it's been my experience every time that you like them and you jump on that bandwagon that's when they tend to lay an egg a Pittsburgh is who's had a lot of success in Cincinnati it's division game or my guess is that uh it's it's gonna be a barn burner of again\nIf I had to pick I'd probably take Pittsburgh in a very close game and a clearly a given a very you know the slow start their off two of these division games now become extremely important for Pittsburgh so I Would imagine there'll be ready to play in this one\nNo doubt and march staying in the AFC North I didn't see the ravens are being held to just three field goals in Cleveland hey but you know what prompted the browns they finally got a big kick of their own to win that game in overtime and they have another big home game today a matchup and the dog pound with the chargers\nYeah this chargers team nobody's talked about this chargers team which is interesting I mean Philip Rivers is pointed a very high level you've got Melvin Gordon out of the backfield you've got a Keenan Allen who's one of the better pass catchers or in the league in and they've done all this without Joey ... comes back I think it'll make that defense even better\nA and speaking of effects is a listen back that Cleveland Browns defense has played at an elite level so far this year a great Williams has done a terrific job over there that they've got to um they've they've got to find a way to get a little better in the kicking game clearly because that is is haunted them I mean you could argue\nWithout you know stretching it too far this Cleveland team could actually be five and a bigger may feel has to continue I think too uh too you know play at a at a good level where he doesn't turn the football ovaries extremely accurate\nOr sometimes a little too bold with a football but I like this football team I think the rosters got much better than it was a year ago a I think they'll have their hands full with with San Diego who from time to time doesn't play particularly well on the road so this one is in ... want to be a must watch games for me this weekend\nMarked alone is with us here on NBC Sports where they were getting ready all ready for weeks six Sunday in the NFL Mark I'm also curious to see what kind of game we get today and metlife with Sam Donald and the jets after you know the blow up whenever the Broncos hosting Andrew Luck and the Colts\nYeah I don't know how to figure this game out because the ... this this jets team is a bit of an enigma to me I get it you're gonna have up and downs with with a rookie quarterback\nLike Sam Donald but I thought he played well last week they've got to continue to run the ball and try to insulate him as much as they possibly can uh I I've been a bit surprised with the up and down play the defensive side of the football Tom Bowles a defensive specialist\nAnd uh I I've I I Would like to see them play they much higher level which would give a Donald you know some some breathing room so to speak so\nUm I Will see where this goes I again I think the jets are making moves in the right direction I think the rosters getting better and despite you know the record itself I think Sam Donald has shown to be a guy that is most likely going to be their franchise quarterback for the next ten or twelve years but\nUm I've again are they going to be a\nAre they going to be you know one of those teams at the figures in the AMCs probably not but I ... I think they can probably win seven games this year without any problem\nAnd we have kind of a contender or pretend to match up in Miami you've got the dolphins who now last tutor all after that three no start taking on the bears who are coming out there by week after that tremendous performance by Mitchell forbid ski who through six touchdowns against the bucks yeah it's\nFunny because I you know I I obviously I Lived in Chicago and and worked there for several years and I've got a lot of friends back there and everybody's talking about ... the performance he hadn't six touchdown and I'm like hey wait a second\nYou don't eat Michel ... to throw six touchdown passes for you to one football teams ... is\nA transform that defense he's a I think the best player maker on the defensive side of the football or through the first certainly five weeks in the NFL\nAnd I'm sure he'll continue to be a a force to be reckoned with you've got a lot of an offensive weapons uh on the Chicago side of the football so you need Michel ... to manage the game or he can't turn the football over or if he can be you know even average on third down to keep that often it's on the field I think this is the football team that\n'cause they don't sustain any major injuries going down the road given the way the NFC North has played over the first five weeks of the season is a football team that I think could be in the conversation or come the end of the year when we're talking about division championships\nUnder center during the week on with us right now I'm working with this on NBC Sports radio alright last couple of before I let you go we've got a three late games in the afternoon and any kind of a another put up or shut up game in Dallas she's got the cowboys hosting the jags big game for both that big game for both of\nUs in Jacksonville I you know despite given up thirty points I mean ... turning over five times against Kansas City that can't happen in my guess is Doug brown will do everything his power to minimize the throws the ... as I looked on the film that game last week and I was just it was it was\nIt was embarrassing to watch the mechanics and the Fort Worth of one plate for those who I thought had kind of cleaned a lot of that stuff up he has not play but that didn't play particularly well last week that defense is still really good\nAnd facing a football team that is in Dallas uh built around the yo Eliot or you know if you're gonna win a football game he's got to touch the ball thirty times I thought last week\nOf Houston Texans did a really nice job of of kind of minimizing his effect on the football game and putting the game back in the hands of Prescott who\nI think it's a nice quarterback but if if you're going to ask him to throw the ball thirty five or forty times the game to win without receiving grew a it's not it's just not going to work so I like Jacksonville and this one and I wouldn't surprise me if they win by ten or more points\nAlright and Leslie mark tonight Sunday Night Football on NBC the marquee matchup the patriots hosting the undefeated chiefs is you get telling you this is going to be a shootout or can we see a little defense well I don't mean\nNeither of these defenses are great I mean look you look at what ... been nothing short of spectacular\nHe did not throwing touchdown last week and through a couple of interceptions so apparently he is human ah beyond that uh you have to ask yourself the question Jeff is this guy rookie or not I know it's a second year but it's there's a ... year as a starter and if you just go back and look at rookie quarterback for instance\nI think Bill Belichick it's twenty five and against facing working quarterbacks in his career in New England so he's got to wait to prepare for Patrick my homes or do you stifle and completely probably not but who's going to make more big place in this football game or or fewer mistakes Tom Brady or Patrick more homes\nTo stop

on NBC's sports radio watching Baker Mayfield going deep with a bomb in the end zone that was just a little bit overthrown\nA the browser trailing the chargers shoveling a nothing in the first quarter we mentioned Melvin Gordon with another touchdown eight forty yard touchdown run meanwhile we\nCapital Panthers Redskins and the Redskins get on the board first Alex Smith a twenty two yard TD pass to Vernon Davis and the Redskins are up seven to nothing that's in the first quarter so a good start to after a that a bad performance Monday Night\nIn the superdome against the saints also going on in London the raiders hosting the Seahawks Seattle making their first ever trip to London and uh so far so good Seahawks raiders Russell Wilson a good start for the sea hawks passing a remember last week they\nThey ran and ran and ran against the rams and just couldn't make enough big throws when they needed to they're trying to\nKind of mix it up a little bit and Russell Wilson was able to connect on a five yard touchdown pass to draw on brown the former cardinal and the sea hawks are on top of the raiders seven another we mentioned you've got Martian Lynch\nBasing his former team the sea hawks but also don't forget Sebastian Jana Kowalski belong time writer arguably you know aside from George blender\nThe greatest kicker and in the history\nOf going up against his former team because uh Sebastian Jenna ... is now with the Seahawks a an update from Atlanta we told you the bucks I got on the board first with a James Winston to camera in great touchdown pass but the falcons have combat\nCan buccaneers falcons as Matt Ryan eight thirty five yard touchdown strike to Mohammed ... new\nAnd remember the bucks or miss the extra points for the falcons take the lead Seventy six over Tampa Bay midway through the first quarter I think without a doubt early on here\nSurprise the absolute surprise of the day those bars in Miami bears dolphins\nKnow Ryan tannahill a late scratch inactive today with a shoulder injury\nAnd it has brought us while are getting distorted quarterback today ... ... a five yard touchdown pass to Nick O'Leary for that ... against that vaunted bears defense [laughter]\nAnd ah the dolphins have the early seven nothing lead over the bears with a seven minutes left to go so now we get our first look at a Michel ...\nThey had that huge when before there by week against the bucks and you know you you talked about\nWhen you get a buy one is it a good time to get a bye And not to get a bye should it be later should it be early but certainly when you have that kind of performance when you have your quarterback through six touchdown passes you probably don't want to get a week off at that point I wanted to stay odd but uh that's the way the schedule once the bears coming off of there by week\nThere on the road today in Miami or the colds and the jets are still tied seven seven years or the cardinals with an early field goal\nThey lead a the Vikings three to nothing but that just changed because with TB as Murray as just rent in from Twenty one yards outlet TV is Marie a Twenty one year a touchdown run delving cook\nOut today with a hamstring issue so ... and get him to start and the TV is Maria getting into the end zone to put the Vikings on top six to three with a point out to dry coming up on the shuttle Watson and the Texans are home today for the bills they're coming off the big win\nA Sunday night against the cowboys and Sean Watson I mean he really took a beating last week against that Dallas defense\nAnd so far today um he's been sacked a couple of times and moments ago if I'm not mistaken want to double check I thought I saw out of the courtroom by either that or the Texans found the end zone\nAnd yes they did bills Texans\nAre the Andre Hopkins a third team yard touchdown catch on to throw from Sean Watson so good start for that Texans passing game they read a lot of questionable place just did not look\nA crust or what they they were doing offensively even though they still got the one of the cowboys\nAre questionable one calls for the shuttle Washington that game against the cowboys\nAre just when they needed big pass plays they struggled but a good start today the Texans are the shuttle Watson to de Andre Hopkins seven to nothing the Texans over the bills with four forty three left to go in the first quarter in Houston so\nThose are the other nine early games that are going on right now of course we've got the three late games coming up this afternoon the cowboys back home after that loss in Houston they are going to take on the jags you know where's this Jacksonville team out\nA report that you know ... well the ... ... says another bad game will Tom Coughlin pulled the trigger

goodbye lower aggravated his his knees you Nick Saban said he could have returned says it's no big deal\nBut I'm curious so Brian in your estimation is this bam a team their best in recent years or have they just not played anybody yet\nI I think it's a little combination of both I think the often definitely is maybe the the best that Nick Saban as ever had\nA you go back to all the weapons it's not just the fact that they have to uh\nOperating a at a Heisman Trophy caliber level you know it's the fact that they can bring in jail and hurts a at that number two guy a guy who's who's one thirty three games are seen thirty three wins a during his time with that at Alabama and now the wide receivers and he saw two to those guys are down miss some time\nOr in that game against Missouri and yet you know there is no other guys stepping up and and making big plays down the field\nThat they just kind of overwhelming you and and that's not even getting into the fact that they've got you know four or five running back so they can throw at you and and really wear you down with a very good officer life defensively I think that's still the question marks or you know especially\nA given that the thin out then that second areas but um this is a again a very well coached team we all know that we we all expect Alabama to come in with the level of dominance in and they're they're they're still young teen they're still growing although they really haven't been tested just yet\nI'm a I think going into the next couple of weeks that they're going to start to put things together and and really grow up as as football team and\nUm you know I it wouldn't surprise me if if they're the prohibited favorites and everybody's mind because look let's face it um they they've been playing that way and and it doesn't really matter who is kind of in front of a they're taking care of business and and that's the bottom line\nYou know they were really are and back to to uh Brian is he kind of the early leader right now in the Heisman race would you say\nHe absolutely and and I think you know it's funny because you you go back to the beginning of the season and and he was right there in in all the odds and all that and and be talk with and everybody was kind of kind of skeptical\nOr in terms of what are you going to do but uh I mean even on an off night uh I think on on Saturday\nHe was still able to throw her three touchdown throw for over two hundred yards um you know I mean the the stats are are ridiculous but he's a guy that that is making all the big time throws in and he's he's putting them all in the money or where it needs to be I think he's far and away\nThe guy right now that that is leading the Heisman Trophy race but um you know it's still a long season we you know I think ... it's been terrific as well he's going to have some big opportunities\nUm as as we get into October and November ... teams I think island Murray still not out of this race at all you know you had that last to Texas and and I think that the question mark is is beyond kind of those three quarterbacks\nKind of get back up into the conversation and ah you know I I don't know I think those three of really created some big separation and the seismic race\nWill so they're All right a brand new mentioned\nMichigan giving the win over Wisconsin or in the big tended some are calling the signature when for ... uh what do you think about that and is is this will bring steam clearly they're improving from what we saw on and that gave me his Notre Dame or are they legit could they be ... before it's all said and done\nI I I think they are legit and they are really ruin meant that open or I get it get snow today and they add some changes that to get back into that one in an insecure victory and\nUm I I think the growth appreciate Patterson is really the thing to keep an eye on with the Walgreens is is it as he continues to get better yet that big one a against Wisconsin adding that threat or out of the backfield ... as well as being able to go down the field\nI'm and develop that chemistry what those wide receivers that the big thing from Michigan it's all going to come down to the office we know how Don brown and that defense is going to be there they're going to be able to to to keep teams in in and suppress what what they do often weights it's all about scoring points project marvelous team and\nWhile I wouldn't say that that when it gets Wisconsin is necessarily a you know the thing to write home about it it's really a encouraging I think if you're a Wolverine sand going into the stretch where you got to play Michigan State\nWe all have heard about the record that the gym horrible as against pardon you got that game against Penn State or you know and the big house and another big one at a ... year I Know that that's\nThat's where Michigan is truly going to be measured in I think you know right now based on what we've seen\nUm you know that they're going to have a shot to win all three of those big games\nFried fish or college football talk with us here on NBC Sports radio\nProbably probably less ... before I let you go a movie one of the pack twelve out here in LA or Colorado has never beat us see I thought they were going to do it last night it didn't happen and you know very quietly despite what are some people may think of him ... helped me was put together a nice little home field advantage that the coliseum in\nI say that because the Notre Dame game this years here in LA and that that could be interesting long you know what can happen before then but\nUh I wouldn't just circle that as a gimme for Notre Dame at this point\nYeah absolutely and and I think you know you kind of saw you know the laws for your see an end in where they can have success so obviously having a true freshman quarterback you're going to be better at the end of the year then you are at the beginning and\nUh that's kind of been the ammo and they're under us see the last couple of years especially on the health and uh he has Nineteen and all at the coliseum and and I think that is a big time home field advantage just in terms of the way that they play there\nOr at home or some kind of having that uncertainty when they go on the road and um you know I'm Still a little concerned uh in terms of what they do run into football they still haven't made it imposes\nA truly established the run that they've done it at times but um you know eventually they they kind of just revert to Jaycee Daniels throwing it up to those really good wide receivers and\nAnd and they're finding success but I think as you get into the crunch time as you get into these big time tackle south battles including the one coming up next weekend at Utah you ought to be able to run the football and I think that's the one concern if you're a U.S ...\nBecause they haven't really been that interested in that area and including football games out as well you know the getting that forced order a team scores late you know you kind of start to think what what's going to happen now and\nUm you know this is still a young teen ... they're still growing and uh they've still got the most talented kid on the board in the pack twelve south and I wouldn't I Would imagine that uh they are going to make things interesting not just in that position but like you were saying for Notre Dame at the end of the year with possibly a trip to the college football playoff wine\nAnd then finally broke and I had this great idea but it it was ruined a I had this great idea that UCLA in Nebraska could meet in the windows bowl of the of the year but chip Kelly rooted for his room with the Bruins last night a gal\nThe eye and I think the one thing about I Know everybody was gone crazy about that though the one most for both teams but the one thing about you know both the courthouse crews and the Bruins is is they they were in football games and and I think UCLA in particular they were getting better each week he saw a ... you saw the flashes against Washington\nHad at the rose bowl last week that they put together for four quarters on the road a cattle that's an encouraging sign I think they've got a real chance against an Arizona peanut that's reeling\nAre coming up and yeah I think for the corners themselves you know they they've played well it it just has not\nClosed things out in in the fourth quarter and the second half of it and that's really been the story their season if they can start to change that around\nOr you know there'll be fine I think both the schools will be fine going forward but certainly the honeymoon period that both of these head coaches had are coming in after the splashy hires and all season that that's gone in in both places and I think ah for right now that they've got to kind of circle the wagons and really focus on improving week to week\nAnd and that the big thing going forward for for each program\nI Can't believe we already have seven weeks in the books for the college football season is great\nYeah I Know it's crazy it's crazy\nWell it's great to have you on brain is\nYou can say things up and we'll talk to again down the road okay\nAbsolutely anytime okay Brian Fisher college football talk with us here on NBC Sports radio is we get ready for\nThe big games coming up next Saturday in week

NFL will get your product today on all of the nine early games that are underway approaches half time but we\nAbsolutely have to talk some playoff baseball right now and that means we absolutely have to talk for a major league baseball instructor here at NBC Sports radio my man the ... the great just average kind enough to join us here on a game days got a lot of stuff going on but it'll to squeeze us some time in forests here today just how are you my friend\nAre happy to do with a man there was a couple of great games yesterday there were compelling that's the thing on either I took away and the you know all I'm asking for a collective series with all due for a don't bore me so uh the season the regular season bored me but hopefully the playoffs do not\nWell okay so let's let's just cut to the chase a it David Price\nTonight and gets beat heart gets hit hard and the red Sox lose ... there'll be a series\n[noise] I mean there can be um you know the fact matter is is that you know at the Houston would be going up to nothing you know Boston\nOr knows that ah Houston's been dominant at home it was clearly think the Astros are going to win the ashes insects if there's one in five I wouldn't be surprised\nUm I think the actors or a better team um you know it's funny a lot of people think a lot of this pin on price I you know I I don't think Gary colds a sure thing\nI mean he was great in the regular season and I thought he was a great acquisition\nBut the playoffs are different beliefs and ah you know I I think that\nFor those two teams with strong starting pitching there's an opportunity for\nA again of a better match up and I think that's the key so much has been made a price in the in the you know in the postseason\nAnd how he has failed and the only thing I can say is this there has to be a reason Alex ... going with him and there are other thing is he was great for a reason and how he can forget all of that in the postseason befuddles me\nYeah I was going to say I mean he's he's he's he's been around a long time art guy one of the artist\nPictures you'll ever know and I I mean it doesn't make any sense there's always a mitigating factor you know sometimes he hasn't been right physically or sometimes it's been a situation where\nYou know he got some bad luck and he fell behind early and there's a quick hook I mean there's there's all kinds of factors are but for for him he's a he's he's a great pitcher and why he's not a great picture of the post season is beyond me\nWell can't wait to see how that plays out tonight and really it's a big game for both teams like you said I mean obviously the red sauce they want to get the split to go on and one\nThing about Chris Sale he has not been right since he went on the disabled and that's evident so you know the fact of the matter is is that you know the red Sox started the series with a guy that they weren't a hundred percent sure of Alex Cora was doing it and what was he doing it to rally him was he doing it to uh give the guy confidence\nI mean these are all factors Korea's got to be second guessed for both of these positions even if they come out one one\n... well I mean do you see in the final say though you think\nThat the trick [laughter] that you have that that's that's totally the trick and uh you know that that's my that's nice correlation for the whole thing that\nYou know I I I had been concerned about Chris Sale and I understand the logic to go with them and I wouldn't have said to do differently all I can say is is this is the problem when you have major question marks going into the postseason\nAll right let's shift over to the national league and they're getting a day to day game three tomorrow night here in LA\nOr the brewers really really stepped it up cut the big winning game one and as you know the I mean the numbers are worth repeating Lebanon the last Thirteen game one winters have gone on to win the series of winning game one there is significance to it\nBut I Am curious as to whether the last game too and the fact that Justin Turner was able to get the big hit uh what what's what's your feeling is the series shifts ... way\nWell look I didn't think he was going to sweep I had the brewers insects you know that sounds like I still I'm Still pretty confident that the key for the Dodgers once they got to that brewer bullpen and more specifically Jeremy Jeffress um he has not been good\nUm and you know he was such a big part of their season but there's clearly something wrong with him um if you remember the game against the cubs to tie breaker game or he wasn't warming up in the ninth inning a and they let Josh hate or go to any things which you would think in a ... game you'd have a backup plan and\nWhy he was on the mound and they said it was an undisclosed reason you know that they're not being forthcoming about sportsmanship I uh I'm I'm not complaining about that but unless you know you really just don't know that that that's part of the challenge\nUm I just think this is going to be a long series I still think the brewers can win a but yeah the big win for the Dodgers\nYeah I'm curious to see how you know when the Dodgers get going as you know when when they're when they're right offensively they're hard to get out I mean they can really where a pitching staff out and I'm curious to see how that's going to play out\nBut the only answer to that though is Milwaukee so many different pictures out there yeah if they they've got to hit all of these guys and and that's the hard part and you know it's a double edged sword though because you say that if you bring in five pictures in a game\nOut one of them it's not going to be right and that was the case yesterday or they were winning that game they were winning that game three nothing so you know it's a situation where the brewer model is to get that short lead and be able to close the door and they weren't able to execute it in game two and a you just hope it doesn't come back to haunt them\nAll right well tomorrow game three you lease just seen he's he's a veteran he's been around a while ago and he's been their best pitcher\nAgainst Walker buell or who you are you making case has been the Dodgers best picture but as you pointed out here you know the the postseason\nAnd that that could go you know if if he gets hit hard at the brewers can jump on him and find a way to get this game three I think that would really put them in a good spot\nThat we'll see you know a good match ups and and you know that I like I said what I'm hoping for is a great postseason hoping for you know so far the division theories really didn't hold my attention that much with the sweeps and the one for game series that was it\nUm you know my my favorites are game five in game six is rose or my absolute favorite games uh usually they're the best games the most compelling games and why I never pick a series\nTo go seven games because that assumes that somebody that up three to doesn't ... doesn't close it out\nYou know what I'm saying so in order to get a game seven you have to have a game six games sixes are usually the better ones\nYeah great point I said before I let you go and then he also in your writing or anything that uh I didn't bring up or that you've noticed that stands out\n[noise] [laughter] well you know I I I just like that ah the games you know the ... the former matchups I don't like\nThat is so apparent\nThat Fox wants it to be Boston LA\n[laughter] you know I just think you know if you compare the other sports you know the MBA doesn't care what market there and as long as the stars are they're right and the super\n\nTheir music ... thank you welcome back to sports Sunday on NBC Sports radio I'm jumping jacks and got a couple of really big time catches going down in the NFL first uh in Cleveland the chargers Brown's\nPhilip Rivers through a bomb into the end zone for Tyrone Williams in triple coverage and in the midst of the coverage and hands it everybody going after the ball Tyrone Williams somehow found a way in the midst of\nBeing fought for for the ball he found a way to secure it\nAnd get the touchdown and so right now the chargers are on top of the browns fourteen to three and they're on the move again a end brands territory with one forty seven love to go in the first step meanwhile they're reviewing a potential Steelers touched down in Cincinnati and I'm waiting to find out\nWhat the caller is but\nYou'll see this one tonight ju ju Smith Schuster\nGoing to the corner of the end zone in the front being a spot with and covered by dark was during hard of the bangles and\nBen Roethlisberger threw it up and as it went up it appeared that ... was going to get the interception but literally well no it's a it's a well I was gonna say they they were down before the before the end zone but didn't already had it in his hands\nThen while they were rolling and in the midst of a somersault ju ju Smith Schuster got the ball away [laughter] and so they were saying by the time he got in a way he was in the end zone and\nIt was a touchdown so we're we're winning a actually what the recall the field that it's going to be shorted the goal and the question is are they going to give it to a Jew Jew Smith Schuster or are they going to say the ... and it was an interception so we're waiting for that to happen right now\nBut either way a a spectacular play and\nYou know for all the\nAll the criticism ... if you will that are receivers get at times for being divas you know I'll tell you what when they when they make you know a spectacular\nAcrobatic catch or find a way to do something like that where they're able to secure\nJust grab the ball out the way that they did just just spectacular uh the the the gifts and the talents in the abilities that these guys have so so with that said they ruled it was short of the goal line and it looks like\nYes James Carter as just ran into the end zone from one year old out his second touchdown run of the day so the Steelers are now on top of the Bengals Thirteen to seven with the point after try coming up uh we\nAlso have an update from Atlanta buccaneers found kitchens of the falcons jumped out to a Twenty one to six lead but Jean as Winston as just a connect with OJ Howard for ten yards out and that makes it a Twenty one to Thirteen\nSouth in league with twenty six seconds left to go so Tampa Bay try to get back in ... when a in Miami\nBears do visions of the big story the day of course rain tannahill not playing in this one with the shoulder injury so it has brought us while are getting the strength of the dolphins broadcast while they're with an early touchdown pass on the opening Dr ... a moments ago picked off\nJust a just in front of the goal line of dolphins round the move tried to add some more points before half time but a ruckus while he was picked off\nAnd uh the dolphins are going to try to hold on now to that seven nothing lead over the bears a rough first half of you\nMichel ... remember he had that six touchdown performance and then uh\nThe bears one on there by week and so coming out to buy on the road in Miami Mitchell risky today nine of fourteen for eighty nine yards housing throwing a pack he's been sacked or couple of times but I think everybody thought with white tannahill out\nOn the ... which is going to tee off on broadcast why alert and it would be an easy day for the bears often but certainly is not played out that way does for a we mentioned that a tyrant Williams at a spectacular catch with the chargers well the other Williams\nUh was was that was it Mike Williams who was a ... it might have been terrible Williams again chargers Brown's either way the chargers have just scored again just scored again and it was tired well Williams again his second touchdown catch the day as a the chargers and filled rivers are carving up\nGregg Williams and there's ... and and the charges are up right now Twenty one to three in Cleveland with fifty one seconds left to go\nA bigger Mayfield is looked okay they just they can't they can't score they haven't been able to score Baker Mayfield has looked good I mean he he just has a knack of\nGetting rid of the ball when he needs to uh alluding\nContact you know running away when he needs to moving when he needs to doesn't stand\nDoesn't take bets sacks doesn't stand in the pocket and he's always on the move and seems to know how to get rid of the football and find open guys I mean he's he's really quick and really energetic really looks good and you can tell he's going to be pretty good but\nAh they just have not been able to they've they've had some good players but they've been sputtering and the red zone in the meantime you know fill rivers and the chargers uh this is the second big play\nScored they've had Tyrone Williams is second to the game and clearly that's the game plan of the chargers they just want to strike quick\nAnd put all the pressure on Baker Mayfield and the browns all fenced in so far it's working out what about the game and metlife colds pretty good start to this one I mean they were going back and forth early\nAnd moments ago in the second quarter Sam Darnell the Seventy are touchdown pass to drill prior remember Trump prior he's with the jets now did nothing or when he was with the Redskins getting that big contract\nBut are starting to pick it up now Sam growing old uh Jason Myers also added a forty three yard field goal so the jets right now are on top of the colds twenty to Thirteen with forty two seconds left to go in the first half of that one\nMeanwhile in London it's been a just a rough day for the raiders there down fourteen to nothing\nAnd with the seconds left before have time to sea hawks are trying to either get one more touchdown or settle for a long field goal for former writer Sebastian ... but the the Seahawks Russell Wilson are on the move and\nMan I think you know a lot of people thought it was going to be ugly possibly for John rude and this year but I don't know if anybody thought it was going to be this bad I mean they just they just look terrible on both sides of the ball you know had some good moments early but weren't able to finish\nBut it just seems like it's you know starting with the trade of Quil Mac is falling apart in Oakland for the raiders of the fence no point to the board today\nAnd get Seattle and now the defense of struggling fourteen to nothing and wait and see if ah\nRussell Wilson is going to get one more shot here at the end zone before they let Sebastian Jetta ... try to kick it by coming up next we'll check in from Green Bay Packers and the forty niners

know just maybe took some of the ... way a little bit so like you said maybe this will be kind of the game they're trying to kind of get that back because those were really the ...\nYeah I mean it it certainly was an animal want to get the one against Minnesota was directly you know changed of victory into a tie because if that flag doesn't come out and the interception the Packers\nStand there late in the fourth quarter of the game doesn't go to overtime the Packers had when and and they're sitting at three into right now instead of two to one but that being said you know the Packers\nThey haven't gotten enough pressure from the outside linebacker is not just math to use but Nick Perry as well um you know ... those guys they they had a pretty decent game against buffalo getting after Josh Allen but other than that game the pressure from the edges has has a you know has\nReally suffered and they they need to get back on track in that regard and as we all know when you talk about turnovers like we were discussing before turnovers happened when you disrupt the quarterback when you when when you hit his arm when you can knock the ball out when you get them off schedule and maybe in a result in an era and throw that gets picked off so\nThe pressure is what can lead to the mistakes that give you the turn over some really get the defense honor roll and that's what the Packers are going to be looking to do Monday Night\nMight sponsored covers the Packers for Packers dot com kind enough to join us here on NBC Sports radio right so injuries and everything is you know like everything starts with Aaron Rodgers and of course she's dealing with that knee injury\nFilms like Mike I'm it sounds like they're they're managing it as best as they can write I mean it's you gotta play every week and uh yeah\nYeah they they've been they've been giving him you know the the\nTwo the two main practices during the week which are Wednesday and\nThursday although this week those for Thursday and friday because of the Monday Night game they pretty much been giving him off that first practice of the week and then trying to have him practice as much as possible on the second one which is the one where they are in full pads and it just to ah just to give that need enough time to recover but yet also\nGet Rogers enough of the reps in the game plan with the receivers who's going to be working with all that kind of stuff so they it's been a balancing act really since that week one knee injury against Chicago and Rogers to\nYou know seems to be getting better he seems to be practicing a little bit more each week but then by the same token last week against Detroit he you know how to scramble in the first quarter or he got he got a kind of grabbed by the shoulder pad and tackle tough awkwardly it didn't look good the way he went down any kind of acknowledge\nThat was a little bit of a a setback for the knees he\nDoesn't think he's going to have to go back to the\nBoat your knee brace that he was wearing earlier that he's got a little bit more of a streamlined one he's been wearing the last couple of games that he hopes field stick with that we don't help as mobility but that tackle it in the first quarter at Detroit\nYou know kind of a hope that some of the the progress in in his recovery so I Know he's looking to get through this game against the forty niners and get the buy weekend and hopefully be feeling a lot better for that\nStretch from wrote into are talking about\nMike do you think also um in his grade is Aaron is I mean do you think at some point though the the Packers they would like to take the club out of the bag of the running game I mean if they can find a way to really be able to go to that when they needed I mean they have been running backs I Know Aaron Jones the doesn't seem like Mike McCarthy is a big fan of his but [laughter]\nBut he's he's got talent and I'm just saying if they could find a way to kind of balance it out so\nYou know Aaron doesn't have to do everything every single play\nI mean they they they they definitely want to get to that point and that starts with that starts with getting off the better starts in football games here I mean at the bottom line is the Packers I played five games\nAnd three times in five games they've been down by three or more scores at half time they were down twenty enough into the bears and weak one they were down Eighteen\nPoints at halftime to Washington weeks three and they're down twenty four nothing in Detroit at half time last week it's hard to find balance on off then since really run the type often do you\nWant to run and take some of that pressure off Aaron Rodgers when you have to score quickly and you're playing from such huge deficits all the time so the Packers need to they they need to to stop this bugaboo of the bad starts they need\nThey need to get out of the gates quickly Rogers talked about it this week the office needs to\nYou if the Austin starts quickly get some points on the board that gives the defense confidence this whole team plays differently it's been like that throughout a Aaron Rodgers tenure really when when the Packers get on the board early and ah and their offices in control the game they like their chances and\nThey have to get back to that because then you can run the football you run the clock a little bit more mood the chains with them with running backs and and take some of the pressure off that defense as well\nWith a with you know potentially reducing the number of production staff to deal with\nAnd Mica really quickly sticking with the running back so I wanted to make a a give a quick mention uh our thoughts and prayers and condolences a former Packer rate jumped Taylor or died over the weekend and I was yeah a little before our time but he was I mean he was really you know a dominant running back during his time back in the ...\nYeah no no question about it I've I've talked to a I've talked to a number of those will Marty Packers over the years when when they come through Green Bay or we had\nYou know some different events going on and nothing but respect for the way Jim Taylor played the game I the the first thing anybody ever set about Taylor and the way he played football\nWas was that he was just ... and you know you look at a you look at some of the championship game that he played in the weather conditions how he ran the ball and uh uh you know nobody nobody wanted to tackle that guy and uh you know he was he was just one of the one of the fiercest competitors and uh and in that\nIn that mold was a perfect type of running back for a Vince Lombardi often so it's certainly a sad to hear about a about his passing over the weekend 'til definitely be missed\nAll right Mike I'm gonna wrap up with this on on a positive note you've got the brewers playing game three tomorrow night the Packers Monday Night football or how does that work [laughter]\nYeah that's that's that's that's a tricky one I think there'll be a I think\nThere'll be some fans in the end the stand that land or trying to uh keep an eye on the brewers on their smartphones\nAnd whatnot during the game I Know there'll be folks like me and the press box will be doing the same thing trying to trying to check the score and see how the ... are doing a you know first time the present then this far in in seven years ago the state of Wisconsin's pretty excited they love to see him get back to the world series which uh they were they were in the world series when I was in fifth\nGrade back in Nineteen eighty two so as they are as a lifelong Scott for night it's exciting to see them have this opportunity hopefully they can cash in\nReally good stuff will

J. the technical maestro it's warming up and go over that e because we pay the bill we pay I pay the harvest every week\nBecause Armand comes in um thank you to let us know about fantasy stats so if you have Melvin Gordon which I had wish I had but I had a lousy lost some lousy picks in my initial draft and then I had some terrible weeks where I've even play players were off\nBut anyway for one of my teams Melvin Gordon ten carry Seventy eight years in a couple of T. V. so that'll that you and nights I'll tell you what\nIf you are somebody I'm just going to go down a little tiny rabid trail here for a second if you were somebody who picked up ... Barclay one he's exciting to watch too is proving that Dave Gettleman knew what he was doing when he decided to go with the all star\nCrazy all pro running back and take one Barclay from Penn State as he watches his Penn State teammates struggle this time it gets Michigan State yesterday but take one Barkley is the answer I mean Thirteen carries a hundred and thirty are than a touchdown and it's terrible\nBeating by the Philadelphia Eagles but what he showed on the field was mind boggling he looked like a pit bull you know with the ball drops down and get smashing a couple of different directions and kept going had one rush for fifty yards it's just amazing so for fantasy players who have the Koran Barkley they were\nAnd of course all of New York happy about that but not happy about he lie manning but that story for later on during the show the NFC East today we're watching what's going on with the red skins\nAs they're having their way with the Panthers I've been watching most of this game and uh you know with a thirty two yard field goal so that helps the Panthers a fit but they're traveling the Redskins have had their number they put up fourteen\nPoints in the first quarter so right now Seventeen nine is is is with five minutes to go in the third quarter\nAnd once again Adrian Peterson\nComing off of where he just spent some do re me to a really reward the offensive line for what they're doing Adrian Peterson Peterson rather eleven carry sixty seven\nYards I bet that ah\nThe dominant or on Peterson legs flips over to at least a hundred pin while watching the game they are really moving the ball and all kinds of direction so for the Redskins if they can win this one they would pick up their third but still plenty of time left certainly for Cam Newton\nAnd the Panthers looked kind of ... around in a few different directions the Vikings have been humiliated that point the season\nAnd they should be really the fracking the cardinals really just tossing them around and they are twenty seven ten witnesses midway through the third quarter\nA Kirk Cousins finding gold finally twenty three thirty one two hundred twenty four yard and it touched down so that's working a little TV is Marie\nHundred and Seventy a hundred and seven years rather on the ground and a touchdown for him so the Vikings just making that extra point and throwing up as other points I mentioned is there a head\nOf the cardinals what's going on with the fish boy\nThere swimming in a different direction they're at home the bears on top of Miami\nTwenty one to ten they're midway through the third quarter Mitch Trybulski is starting to get that rhythm hundreds of yards passing a couple of CDs but also we had to move the chains vicarious forty two yards So Doug bears looking for their fourth when if they pull this off\nAnd they get on the plane leave in South Florida there'll be four and one\nAnd oh my goodness John group and we gave you Fort Knox we gave you everything that's what the Seahawks lunging are crushing\nThe raiders ... won the ...\nAnd this is worth less than six to go in the third quarter Russell Wilson a hundred and Seventy five yards passing and a couple of touchdowns spreading the ball around on the ground and in the air so it's about the sea hawks in this game and it's about\nThe raiders just not finding their footing what so ever close game fun to watch this one I've been watching is a bunch although Steelers put up a big zero in the first quarter\nThen put up fourteen points before they went and so the halfway point that game was tied at fourteen now with what lessons six to go in\nThe third quarter the Steelers on top of the bangles seven teams to four I'll tell you what I think it's someone I Wish I had on a fantasy team there is no a sign of levy on valley still hasn't report it to the Steelers we know the saga that's going on there but in his place James Carter\nHas been amazing Seventeen carries eighty four yards and two touchdowns where's that harp is if you have James Caan or your life because he's got new production\nAll season long and certainly the Steelers like this this is a tight game they could go in the opposite direction really there are two two and one what Steelers will be in the end of the bangles on the other hand\nPerfect to do at home they witness their five and one but like I said it's an interesting to watch James Caan or the twenty three year old and the production they're getting out of him and just his\nA second season because of the levee on bell situation he came in and started to get a lot of the production obviously and so you look at the the touchdowns that he's had over all\nAnd it's um it's fun to watch and he's ramble for a bunch of yards I mean the longest twenty nine yards he's he is really getting up there and I his average depending on the game of average in October Eighteen yards you know he's he's um\nIn the ... he's he's he's\nAnd leave the drama an actor's like brought to you by the dollar general literacy foundation and the outcomes\n\n[noise]\nWay be forced to come back we'll be much\n\n\nAll those strikes were first your first alert\nHeart [noise]\nOne million dollar home loans turn turn turn or [noise]\nRon Shock daughters take off on\nLike the Dodgers radio network for that oh I interrupted Dave Roberts manager of the Dodgers here's what he had to say about Justin Turner and that Jack\nIt up so [noise] um\n[noise] then it takes a special glee overnight let's hear website to show up in ... in a far more\nOr just new guys because those are hard to converse\n[laughter] yeah he's right about that because Turner was not happy with his dry spell is what they've Robert is referring to\nAnd in a really exciting close game ultimately now that the retired at one Dodgers when for three there are a couple of nugget from that I Love playoff baseball I mean this is the greatest time of year 'cause we're in the middle of what's the balding pro football wise and we're starting to see some teams that are\nShaken up going the wrong way and then some others that are soaring and of course in college football we had a big shakeup with Georgia losing to LSU and I think it gets even more intriguing when we talk about Notre Dame and who\nCould they be there for one of the semifinal match up because only four teams get to challenge let's face it\nFor the national crown and college football but if we look at the Dodgers and the brewers coming off of the one game when the brewers had the night before and her finally finding his way and chance than\nPicking up the um really an amazing ending where he did what he had to do to make it happen so meaning when you come out of the bullpen you got to be able to shut it down and there was a scary moment or two and it's been like that for the\nI think it's going to be like the throughout the match between them but uh in the postseason Turner is\nUnbelievable what a blogger got that wild red hair is like a mountain man he turns around ... it's almost like he's he's hitting a forehand like the way he comes through once he slammed the ball\nAnd it was staggering to watch this to run home are sitting there like on the edge of the couch\nAnd I'm watching this in the eighth inning and how just how heat stroke the ball he found that right in the town and he was able to nail it and made a huge difference he is a difference maker when it comes to the playoffs I mean this is the best of seven series you've got\nGame three on Monday Night at Dodger Stadium for the split help the Dodgers Corey Ballenger got\nOn a the board finally he had an RV I think all in the seven because he's been chased and a problem for sure ... really chasing all kinds of things in the dirt though the Dodgers chipped away at it and uh Turner\nLove that because he's had he's he was terrible and that first game he struck out four times in game one and he said after the game\nYou know how good he felt and Dave Roberts know that I mean look patient pays in baseball it pays in playoff baseball is especially because the entity is ratcheted up the\nLos Angeles scored eight runs against the Milwaukee bullpen all in the seventh inning or leaders to keep that stabbed in your mind to me that the nugget out of this and for Turner\nIt was his seventh career playoff Homer you remember he was the co MVP of the national league championship series last year and then boom gets into the world series so the Dodgers are making the\nPlayoffs start really count for them 'cause they know they want to get back to where they were and it's not going to be easy the brewers were the team we were watching all year long on this show so that was an exciting game and there was a few other little or takeaways I think from from that too that\nWe can talk about later in the show we'll do that 'cause I Want to make sure that we get back to the scoreboard but\nAnyway it was an excellent excellent game in the end and fun fun fun to watch the brewers squandered a few opportunities then you have the other game\nWhere it was the first one out of the shoot for the actors and the red Sox and the ... the red Sox and the answer is play a game to tonight imagine if you're in Boston 'cause you've got the patriots\nTasty and then you and the rabbit sports fans right through they like both and then you've got the red Sox across town and the Astros\nThe Astros just completely blue would open a gr EL slammed one for the ... mission point with a three run Homer he was struggling the Astros beat the red Sox seven too but it was late innings and that's what the Astros do so well Carlos Korea\nWould be the one who who ultimately had the winning run with the RBI single here's what he said about that\nThough it was was he used to their momentum overseas scare from scoring two runs a crusading so I was used for a million ... importantly gives me a lot of confidence with a suitcase\n[noise] yeah exactly 'cause that's what you have a bad back you have problems and then you're able to come back and that is the uh that's the difference maker there what happens tonight with David Price on the mound a lot of people in Boston trashing him they don't have faith in him taking the ball and leading Boston after this\nFirst law named Garrett coal who's been pitching well take the ball for the Houston Astros what happened\nFor the Astros with Justin Vernon lander is typical overland are six innings to hit six strike out\nAnd look really good gave up to run but looked pretty solid and what it may be a little floppy but in what he was pitching again he he's the king of superstition and he pulled it out for\nFor the Astros he did what he needed to do to get them to that bullpen absolutely and here's what virtually understand about opportunities\nOne thing that this team or the ashes are so good at is not I'm looking down on themselves that they didn't take take advantage of the

headlines heading into oh you're turning forty forty what forty one forty to forty three how long how long does this guy have I mean are you kidding me the one who doesn't want Tom Brady at you ask the giants on their team but\nHaving said that what have we seen from Brady this year\nHe's looked good not great um turn them all over more than it usually does rodeos six interceptions which now for him is generally a season now some of those of circumstantial last week you get two receivers in the hands on ... on on Rob Gronkowski to flex and it's an interception so some of that\nJust happens bad luck um but I think we're seeing the office of all that says weapons evolve\nYou know we see Julian Edelman come back last week that's has been key got just go to guy he loves having him on the field that open some things up throughout Gronkowski and then the ... story on the games and\nIt's involving you know the first week it was a couple of prose couple's third down a conversion than last week we see that you know forty yard past deep\nWhere he throw it up for grabs you throw it into double coverage and he trusted\nAnd went and got it was a touchdown ... five hundred Korea touchdown so even Brady said post in that shows how much I trust him well if that trust continues to grow now you're really diversifying this often with Edelman and Gordon editor Gronkowski James White now some of the other guys Chris Hogan can be just a complementary guy\nUm Sony Michel the young first round running back hasn't done a ton of the passing game but he's certainly capable he showed he could do that in college so I think\nI think there's often says evolving and I think you're going to see Brady hit his stride as these weapons hit their stride\nYeah I Love that you brought up job scored isn't it interesting all the problems they've had with drugs and it's a crazy if you look at his path and bill bell a check\nJust seems to pull the rights strings when they didn't they just got you know what next to re looking at boy it's amazing I think that the damage the patriots do when they pick up a player\nAnd then how successful they are with uh maybe for a year or two where other teams path on them and say oh no way and we've seen time and time again I can off the top of my head name five or six players it's just something about\nThe way he eyeballs them I think and I think that makes them just a brilliant coach what do you think\nYeah and there's no question that the environment here in Fox borough um allows him to do that and that's that's still bell check as\nPart of his greatness as a leader as a coach but I also think it's the environment of Tom Brady and these other leaders Devin accordion Matthew Slater there's a certain\nCulture in that locker room that I think allows bill to take a few chances with guys that you know maybe other coaches couldn't get away with and certainly has ranks allow him to do that you know he can take chances and if it goes poorly because Dr Gordon he loses the draft pick and they move on they find that the other way but the environment I think more often than not\nCreates that ability at least in the short term for it to work the leadership and the guys around him and and everything they put in place now it's still early on withdraw score you know he's had good stretches obviously in the NFL before can he stack them up can go two weeks\nBecomes for weeks foliage becomes eight weeks can you get to the point where you're now in January and everybody's saying wow I Can't believe they gave up only a fifth round pick your get Gordon and seven\nAnd look what he's done to that often look how he fits in with chronic Brady um but that's a process for him anybody dealing with addiction knows that you know just because you get it done for a week or a couple of weeks doesn't mean it's it's you know the long term is going to be success but certainly everybody in the locker rooms rooting for 'em you've heard nothing but good things\nFrom the players about what they've seen from him on and off the field\nAnd I think they're really excited to see where it goes and if you listen to Josh Gordon he's excited I think the way he phrased it he said there's nothing out there for him to do than take advantage of this opportunity and that's that's a good mentality for him to have\nYeah absolutely and we started saying is we're talking to a Eddie hard covers New England patriots were patriots weekly and patriots dot com check them out there and you can hit him up on Twitter ... jumbo heart a Andy did this story of the quarterback so\nIt you know who knows how long Brady has but when do you think that there's start they start to have serious discussions about looking for that younger quarterback because they had Jimmy ... below he goes to San Francisco sadly out that these nice all the injury but Wendy they start when do you do you think they started game planning for that or that's just not even discuss you\nKnow I think that's it's happening as we speak\nYou know whether the right guy becomes available like ... and the second round a few years ago\nBut that was the intention you know that was he was drafted with every intention that he was gonna start games with the patriots at some point and I don't just mean to fill in for brief suspension and Brady changed all that by beating father time and you know continuing to be great and winning MVPs at forty and\nSo that obviously changes the perspective but you still needs to be ready\nAnd you need to be ready with that next guy and it's not Danny at length in my opinion the late ... when I was a year ago I think you're going to see them look\nEarly and and if the guy is there a second round this year or even a late the first depending on how things play out there that extra draft picks there they always have the ability to move around has built generally collects that that ... um but the searches on you know it wouldn't stunned me if it's this year and if it's not this year that I certainly think it has to be next year because\nYou know Brady is going into the last year of his contract next year and I know everybody assumes\nOkay it's going to finish in New England if he plays to forty five it will be in New England but\nYou do have the uncertainty of that contract and\nYou know there's even been rumblings around here that you know grounds contract runs out at the end of next year maybe those job would want to go somewhere together if they're truly unhappy here as all the crazy story lines of the off season said but um to get back to your original question I think they are always looking for that next quarter back they were ... they are now\nYeah All right Andy heart great thanks for stopping by\nNo problem enjoy the

not who's not playing fantasy football [laughter]\nEveryone I was playing fantasy football either have\nMaybe even three four five I have a friend that has the eleventh team which is excessive but he's very good at it somehow I Do not know how because I Can't even keep track of all the action I certainly can keep track of what's happening\nOn the grid today and off of it as well it's interesting I got some great inside intel on a situation in New York\nI used to work at WFAN in New York City had a long conversation with an old player friend from the giants I'll talk about that\nComing up this hour plus we're certainly going to look at that Sunday night game who who am I ... for that patriots and the sheets pat my home\nIn a conversation will lead Steinberg his age and he told me really watching this guy you know watch him coming out of Texas what he's been able to do there and no kidding really watch this guy's fourteenth touchdowns on the season but we'll be young quarterback be schooled by the patriots rookie quarterback\nComing in to Fox borough have been over for twenty three oh for twenty three look for some of that zone deep and happened in there and it could be I don't think you could I think it is going to be a fabulous game but are we going to see a high scoring the their the wide guy's habit at\nFifty over a hundred fifty eight and a half\nNew England favored by three and a half points\nOf more than three points but uh [laughter] so what happens but I think we're trumps the Casey even though they're fine with it right now we're gonna be foreign the true after they\nThank you the fake bill bell a check [laughter] you know the damned a jargon\nY girlfriend measure them I Know for sure I washed\nPurchased screeners are you better take correct there I got to tell you what happened earlier today and some of these games were to jump around a little bit I'm going to give you more juice on Sunday night game or two it just boggles my mind to think of\nYou know my home's grew up in Texas a huge cowboys fan and he was six years old when Tom Brady won its first Super Bowl just put just put that in your mind for a second right\nAnd there's two ways to look at that too 'cause then you look at Tom Brady and house the nominal is the way he's played and how well he's played up to his age to ... ... and the buccaneers\nAnd what's interesting about this is for the falcons desperately need a when not that the buccaneers don't either but this is at home that gorgeous new stadium\nAnd the falcons blues so much of the first part of the second half hunting hunting hunting hunting there's like given the ball back to the buccaneers here try again let's see if you go or so the falcons duly though and it's a little less than two to go thirty one twenty nine and\nThe Steelers and the bangles they've been going back and forth the whole time or let's face it we've got like ten seconds on the clock Steelers leading the bangles twenty six Twenty one was impressive is James Caan or is there in place of love you know I'm Still he still hasn't said what's going on with the Steelers have them reported\nAnd in the meantime Connor is confident young showing what he can do on the ground Nineteen carries a hundred yards and a couple of touchdowns\nFor Conor wow\nSo the passing touched down boom hits the money it's droplets burger right down the middle to brown for thirty one yard touchdown that put up the the twenty six points\nAre now we'll see what happens with that extra kick but I think we can ice that game the chargers have held off the brown\nThe whole time it's been all about the chargers not about Baker may field and the hype and what's happening with Cleveland and at home people being excited to see new life into this team but a charger thirty eight fourteen or at the two minute warning of that game\nAnd then we've got other a couple of other games that are have gone final all dive into that in a second\nBut uh how about the jets stamped Arnold\nHe's no joke did did they waste to pick on him of course they didn't waste or pick and we didn't think that right but the rookie quarterback is really starting to feel comfortable coming to his own and he's put up some decent numbers big numbers\nForty two twenty seven feeding the colds are at the two minute warning so in New York well New Yorkers are really upset about Eli Manning and the giants if they are rooting for the giants the other side of that coin that life is jets fans couldn't be more thrilled with what's happening\nOr with their team and especially what's happening with Sam Darnell so you would think they'll wrap\nThis up but the Colts are charging\nThere is a a couple of final quickly Texans beat the bill the Sean wax and we found you a hundred and Seventy seven passing yards and it touched down\nBut see Andre Hopkins who really can make things work he came up with a touchdown five catches sixty three yards twenty Thirteen attacks since when that speak for them the Redskins big for them in a tight and the east or least\nAgain depending on how you look at uh twenty three seven scene that did go final over the Panthers in the books Adrian Peterson not quite a hundred yards I thought he hit that\nA body Ahmed or that's what I call it ... because all those miles it's amazing seventeenth carries Ninety seven yards per Peterson who couldn't be more thrilled to be playing for the Redskins three and two how bout it\nElsewhere this is how it unfolded the Vikings beat the cardinals twenty seven to seven teams sorry Josh Rosen unlike some of those other quarterbacks you did pass for two hundred and forty are costly interception but the Vikings desperately needed to win at home they got it with ... Murray\nYou're a fan of the fan we got our hearts sound effects or sound I shouldn't say sound effect because we have a harvest in the studio\nJust for you and when you hear the heart sound you know it's a fantasy stat a lot of people have marine [noise] twenty four carries a hundred and fifty five yard touchdown so brilliant a on his part continuing to motor and do you have to do the\nOther couple of games the chargers are not the churches the sea hawks and the raiders that's just final and in London it was a bloodbath\nFor the raiders once again the raiders or one in five to twenty seven three the victory for the Seahawks there now three and three we have other games getting ready to get started including Jacksonville and the cowboys ravens and the titans\nAnd another Fifteen minutes\nBut already under way a couple of minutes into this the rams and the Broncos are scoreless at this point the rams getting a big test I think because of the altitude et cetera in Denver and Denver's record doesn't really tell the story case ... comes saw\nBut uh the Broncos would love to get to five hundred it'd be three and three and the rams are they going to do it in the six and so\nReally killed me though so Jeff has won Barclay and the giants were crummy against the eagles except for Barkley who was the son and got Jeff [noise]\nThirty three point forty point that was crazy [noise]\nI'll take it I've I've been um two and three and our league I've been on the wrong and I have bred Abbott go off go nuts or gets to be with one of those kinds of games so I Know how it feels\nOkay all I care about\nBlow out of the week so I'm watching the scoreboard intently when I'm not on the air [noise] All right because I feel I got Seventeen points from Seattle defense everybody's performed better\nThan projected so I liked that part [laughter] that's fantasy that goes right I Know no fantasy here we've been trying to nail to score this is going to be a great game tonight what do you think happened\nPoint I Want to get a quick update from ... to do it this\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [laughter]\nNo great I Love it I Love it was fantastic thank you for that I Would expect ... patriots thirty four chiefs thirty one\nWould you like it to be close I Love it or do art for the patriots so that some of the defense may be worse than them in the end did they get a kick a kick is not just to kick in for for the win though I like it I liked that production thanks Geoff that you could [noise]\nOurs we go to a Josh Jake up and find out what do you think technical might throw\nWorld you know last time the Kansas City chiefs Tacoma and even when patriots Kansas they won and won pretty handily and I look at the steps right now and Casey is six the nonsense New England twenty first down defense Casey's thirty second which it seemed like last place pretty much [noise]\nBut I think that also in passing Casey has the advantage so I think it's gonna be\nKansas City [noise] thirty four thirty one twenty four\nThirty four twenty four All right uh so you like Kansas City [noise]\nWow All right so we're in the opposite side I'm the tie breaker here I\nLiked that analysis I I Would be wild is the case they do that and the people if you've ever been in Boston has been any time there oh it's brutal when the patriots blues and especially if the red Sox are losing to across town because they got the two for going on\nI'm going to say the patriots win this I think it's going to be close game\nHowever and I do believe it's going to be more of a high flying if they're kind of like Jeff said to an author Josh a lot of points on the board so I think the patriots win at thirty eight thirty for Brady is going to have the air in and out of bed or something is going to have to be happening there too and that in the home\n[laughter] [laughter] are we going back to the uh just on the football folks [laughter]\nYeah on the football so I I think it's going to be close game though that you'll be the the wide guys have it at three and a half New England favored and fifty eight and a half\nPoints or whatever that's worth I think I've told this story before I Lived in Vegas I did that was my first syndicated show and\nI'll tell you what I learned a lot about how the lines or that and really some of brilliant people do this I mean guys with degrees from MIT like math nerds and they analyze everything forward and backwards which again means nothing\nYou know paralysis by announcing except for that if you look at the line's a lotta time they're right and I'm very curious about that over underline because that would mean we'd see a much more high scoring kind of game so that's it we'll see if any of us nail the score this time around you can play at home with your buddies [noise]\nYes [noise] really a lot of fun Sunday night football's a lot of fun [noise]\nNo question about that and\nYou know it's interesting as we look at Sunday Night Football we do do this thing where we look at both sides of\nThe ball and when I ... well I mean by that is you know we talked to somebody who was on the team for a living and their their day in and day out watching what's happening\nWith the team so you know the the what the what was happening at some of the practice is when they're open or at least what's being said as you get closer to to the game I covered a couple of teams is way so I Know what that's like you really are just immersed in it\nI was like that with the Dallas Cowboys even used to fly with them so far have grigorian joins us he's a columnist for\nA great paper the Kansas City star and we'll get his take on case the and pat ... coming into this and Andy Reid how he's feeling about the kind of play calling against a bell a check\nAny reduced to infuriate me with poor clock management in the later years when he coached the Philadelphia Eagles seems to be doing a better job with the Kansas City team\nThis year and even last year you could say did a lot better job in some of the plays that were called and I think a clock management although you could still question that\nIt's been different this year ... homes is just a whole different ballgame these are all final now the falcons beat the buccaneers thirty four to twenty nine Steelers wrapped up the bangles\nTwenty one chargers knocked off the ground thirty eight to fourteen Baker may field with a touchdown and two hundred and thirty eight you're passing but it was all about the chargers Melvin Gordon three touchdowns you want to talk about a fan of the player and just good player Eighteen carries a hundred and thirty two yards from Melvin Gordon and\nThe uh I told you about the Seahawks wrapping up the raiders are ready in London ... graders put just three points on the board\nAnd over time watching us right now with two fourteen on the clock in overtime is tied the bears and the dolphin at twenty eight\nSo a third and fourth that's what the bears have trying to convert at Miami's thirty five yard line how 'bout that\nViking wrapped up the cardinal\n... earlier we mentioned that before the Vikings pick up their third when jets just completely a thrashing the Colts were both to the game of forty two thirty four was the score at the end of the thing\nThe red skins come up with a win so now there are three and to just like the jets are three and two uh the Texans beat the bill and part of part of the reason for that was um Jonathan jokes of twenty eight yard interception return for a T. V.\nWith just a minute and change the law that was a huge huge play rams on top of the Broncos by a kick three dip they leave\nUnder six to go in the first quarter just kicked off Jacksonville and the cowboys also just kicked off the ravens and the ... and so when we\nCome back and we look ahead at Kansas City that side of the ball give you some more nugget about this Sunday night game also coming up an injury report and the jigsaw puzzle that is the top twenty five in college football later on in this hour oh it was an exciting day and major league baseball playoff\nHow about the Houston Astros rocking the red Sox in that first game and the Dodgers coming back\nPain pill any NBC Sports radio [noise]\n[noise] for a complete book if you were weather\nGreat information\nHampshire gave a

potentially to kick a game when bill goal tried twenty twenty with the dolphins the rams up three nothing in Denver\nThe early games are filed the Steelers want to come back in Cincinnati with a minute ... marched down the field and get into the end zone Antonio Brown to the Steelers beat the Bengals again in Cincinnati twenty to Twenty one dog comes over the bucks the chargers blew out the

could be a preview of the play offs them and you know this there's all kinds of crazy stats around this but it's like over twenty three with rookie quarterback going into Fox borrow\nAgainst a ballot checking Brady so this is a tall task for\nMoms and obviously the Kansas City chiefs gonna have to get that protection 'cause he's the target not that he is in every single week you're probably seen some zone defense I don't know what do you what my homes and Casey if you were game planning this what do you think they really have to do to to win this\nWell I Do I Do think this is an interesting thing you're right the crux of it I mean a trick\n'em hasn't been that sharp glass to games you know he was a little confusing first at Denver he's doing\nI don't know if that was pretty good games right but you could\nA mortality and um for lack of better term and\nI'm In it and they always or twenty three points last week out because they got a defensive touchdowns so I'm ... and he threw the first two steps and so the thing that has stood out about him whether it's with success or or even in these moments of lapses is really one plate is not affect the next for him\nUm you don't feel like anything because the moments too big now this is I think by by you know\nA couple of different uh festivals or or tears whatever you want to call it this isn't a level above any other games um\nHe's played it I mean that Monday Night at Denver yeah that's a big deal and his first starts or a big deal and playing Pittsburgh the big deal but this is Sunday night against the patriots I mean\nBut you know a guy that he grew up in Monterey of of you know not playing against and directly but in Tom Brady\nI'm so this is sort of you know clearly the biggest test yet I think and he's twenty three years old and we all understand them to be um which are beyond as yours but what see what that looks like tonight I'm\nWon't last little thought of that first it's just that you know the chiefs\nChiefs fans are so excited about him is the feeling to\nA friend of mine uses the term that they finally got the magic unicorn that a lot of other franchises have had or some judges have happened they've never necessarily hat and Kansas City because um he's the first sort of homegrown guy like this even lend Austin\nWas five years in the NFL before he he was really a on into the chief systems ended up at the Dallas texas at the time so there's there's so many different aspects of this I said way more than you needed to and that one first\nAbsolutely and you know it it I think you don't like yeah yeah yeah I'm taking my head thing I Love and I love the magic unicorn having the magic unicorn and it's so funny I'm thinking of that I'm like oh I can like I'm running through a list of players in my head even like\nIt here that was Carson went for the Philadelphia Eagles under dog never won the super bowl nothing and he nodded them I think because he was the cause he had that fun factor that's what it seems like\nTo me with ... and it seems like he's really enjoying playing that sounds funny but I I think he kind of looks like he's shaking off the pressure am I right\nI think I think that is right and it's you know I I've heard different people describe it in different ways I saw I think in the NFL Network a description by Kurt Warner about looks like he's you know playing back yard football and yeah I'm a Patrick's not he's not just a minute guy but he's a he's a\nHe's gotta he's got a a roll with it the meaner um he's he's interesting to talk to a vote because he has a very distinct voice but also because he um he's very uh\nAnalytical and and even self deprecating tore a to some degree and they'll they'll tell you the truth now he's as somebody pointed out to me the other day he's a quarterbacks would have to tell you everything but he he's um you can learn a lot listening to him and how he sees things\nSo it it it it they they the guys around really like them and he's he uh he appreciates the guys around them too he's he's he's pretty careful with that but I think it's also very natural that he doesn't just think it's all about him\nYeah and you know he always heading into this too it's about you look at it it's not all about him and his teammates who were the wounded teammates he's going to be there and just in Houston going to be there because he had a hand me problem and and also Eric Perry with dealing with some of the hill\nYeah we're ... the funny thing with Arab areas we've been getting the term from the chiefs in various forms a day to day for about forty three days or five days now and\nSo that kind of reminds me that all the\nUm you're not old enough for this but they all Saturday Night live routine about journal Cisco Franco still being to um they they kept updating that that uh he's he's not he's still not here um\nSo we yeah we will Eric Barry unless there's been some incredible subterfuge because he hasn't practice um and just in Houston I'm it looks like no way I don't know if they call them out but uh I I I I don't remember they officially called him out but I've been of the mind that he's not going to play\nAnd that that hurts them I mean those were\nBasically there to best defensive players they're very you know hasn't place in the opener here last year at New England and you know we've had the expectation that he would be back and he's still not back um\nYou know it it it there's different schools of thought on why that part of the feeling is you know you want to be here when the game's count mayor and the season and try to be cautious\nYeah boy had one last one ... do you think we're going to see a high scoring game or will we be surprised that it won't quite get up to that point\nKnow it's funny every time you see and you really think there's no way this has got to be I think this is a big over right like fifty nine as your personality and be crazy like half yeah um and and you kind of think

the season just one of the many stories on the day another rookie quarterback\nStoring are hoping to store anyway great performance and the jets back him up all the way two hundred and eighty are passing it did talking interception couple a touchdown though and\nHe looked pretty decent so that's the that's the key right just Jedi Eddie as much as you can for the jets although the Colts made it interesting that's for sure\nBut uh in New York just as at least one team that they are cheering for you know when you look at where a New York falls in the AFC ease especially with\nMiami on top New England behind them and then a New York at five hundred but at least there in the thick of it Sam Darnell feels like this office is really coming together right them\nIt's all come to\nYou know just

you know a similar Kate in control of different places and all that just continuing to grow as an often um husband really special I'm so far you know as we continue on through the weeds\nThanks for the jets radio network for that by the way as we kick things off here on our NFL coverage big week six and a big Sunday night game the patriots hosting ... Holmes the young the quarterback and the Kansas City chiefs he's been\nIncredible we looked at the Seattle Seahawks a lot of people felt like they were toast and had no way of clawing back into the play off the panic was studying in\nCertainly on the west coast but across the pond in London and against the raiders was much different story check out the fourth quarter to put an exclamation point on it Russell Wilson\n\n[noise] sweetness so it is about the the hawks crushing thanks to the operator network for that the raiders twenty seven\nTwo or three Russell Wilson two hundred and twenty two yards passing and three T. v.'s\nAnd like I said for the the hawk they're not out of it uh this was a this was a good game for them because they destroy the raiders\nAnd ah they know that they can still make a run anyway let's put it that way signs are pointing in a much different direction just like the jets they get to five hundred three and three after the game the raiders think to one and a five wow and five rows\nWere handled is dangerous so uh have their ago\nLived up in danger up did and uh he tore them apart there's no doubt about that rock ops while or on the other hand had to come in for Miami Ryan tannahill out so ... for three hundred and eighty yard than three T D's and it took over time and that was a good game where\nIt started to get to the I think good game in a sense because\nThe dolphins struck first in the ... the first quarter\nAnd then nobody would score and so it was all about the defense and the misused by both offices and then the third quarter the bears put up on the one point wow but ... and then they put up and others that but it wasn't enough and it went to overtime and the dolphins when this one thirty one to twenty eight so that takes\nHe'll over and the dolphins move to four and two there were certainly other highlights\nAnd low light from the earlier games we have a whole hour will jam on all of that for you to let you hear some more sound awful if you hear some sounds of the upcoming major league baseball playoff games as the red Sox are in the whole Houston feeding them last night they have another game tonight game too and that American League championship series\nAnd the national league championship series they're split with the Dodgers coming back for one run lead much like the night before friday to kick things off\nOr they were in the whole losing that first one to the Milwaukee Brewers so we'll we'll go into that as well and what both of those theories looks like the look like rather because now we're up to seven games remember when you get into the championship series and it's pretty interesting\nWell the Dodgers have bats I mean that's been the biggest criticism of ... when they needed the bats they did not have the bass even with ... lost or they were down five to nothing if they came back didn't quite make it the way they could have but still compared to earlier in the season when\nThey didn't take advantage of those situations they didn't come back from or seemed to make the effort they were trying to but they the bats just weren't there at least this time they were they're coming up just a tad shores\nBut still like Saudi Yemen the less\nYet Justin Turner who it was cold heading into this\nThe the night before he had four strike at the worst ever in his career and then he felt that the run jak and it was just amazing to see that the red headed wonder does not disappointed to see just kind of let that trail off and was a big reason for that when obviously for\nThe Dodgers against the brewers that was an exciting game and the series has been very exciting so far\nFor the Dodgers are hungry for it because they really lost in seven games the world series last year so they are eager I think they want it most more than anybody else I think because of that because of that just all the seventh game last they're just more hungry than everybody else is my opinion\nYeah there is something about hunger and I said that with the cowboys the cowboys on top of Jacksonville twelve minutes till they hit the halfway point and there are so hungry in fact at Prescott is sick a people dog and him so he had his first rushing touched down of the\nUh season and this game is going to be a long game for Dallas I think maybe Jacksonville because to me there are so furious over losing that overtime game to Houston that it's added that extra something special for them to try and witness to come up\nAnd especially in the end of the east where they can be three and three after you see the red skins winning and then after on on Thursday night the uh the Philadelphia Eagles beat the New York giants and that changes the picture and the NFC eastern they know it and they know they had that opportunity when they could have won that game\nAgainst the Houston Texans and they weren't able to do it\nTake ducks credits ... critics [laughter] that you've critics exactly where they're going to work in it but I Would absolutely\nAnd then he was he was able to set up before he was pushed to the sideline and checked out there but it was all about the sea hawk than nothing to do with the raiders or the raiders or anything they tried I mean look car\nStruggles he struggles the authentic blind struggled there was just nothing happening for the team and everything was happening for the the hawks after the game Derek card talked about the loss of the the hawk\nOr a good job I'm obviously there were a good plan for somebody to really gets me a little bit and um you know once they have to lead obviously the differences we've talked a hundred times you know boy my kind of depressed I get really soft and they will not let you throw the ball down the field\nThere you go they won't let you throw down the field he's right about that he never got any good groups on that in fact I Love how he described how they just completely got annihilated\nOr human rights you know I think are factored the it makes it hard um but again you know you know me too um I Will never measure ... as we know we we are are are too strict and that we have to own a lot and we will but uh [noise]\nYou know ... are part of the game I think everybody's hurt you know I may not feel somehow some way around this time of your show up ... up in\nA row which is if we can getting hurt besides car his favorite white out one of them anyway uh uh I'm Ari Cooper with a concussion left the game in the second quarter in fact you really only played a minute or two into the into the second quarter\nSo he he's there was a struggle there obviously he took a wild hit\nFrom the the hawk safety Bradley make make gold and the that was that though he was out of that game of Oakland now host with a coat on\nOctober twenty eighth wonder if people are going to I was gonna say paper bags will they bring up the paper bags the boom bags for how long we've all over the course of the way their play that much\nIt's easy for them to be the punching bag and beat up on the raiders but hey listen when you've got\nFirst of all their car ... a couple of years ago were talking about him like he was going to just run away and get the super bowl and a host of lumbar the trophy and he was playing since ... than injury then coming back now with John ... and ... going to have to get some giddy up and that team and at least try to figure out a way to be respectable\nYou know here's the one thing they didn't get a donut on the board I mean I guess if that's your takeaway they head injuries he's right everybody deals with injuries\nBut um it was not a good showing for them it was not\nPretty at all let's talk about and that will be quickly and then we're going to jump to a couple of other things that will tell you the Dallas put some more points on the board seven teams if they lead Jacksonville who says seven minutes away and some change before they hit the halfway point of that game tonight we have the loan game\nIn the American league championship series which features of course Houston and Boston after last night's show lacking the actress came to play this summer on you have\nA Mr price up on the mound for the the Red Sox and boy there's a lot of people complaining about that and then you look at\nGarrett Cole who is a wouldn't nine with a six something ER I intend to host the ever did or prices rather\nA price is so when nine with a six\nPoint over three ER I going to get that in there and ten post season starts which is why the people in Boston are exploding on the talk radio shows\nAnd um opinion pieces et cetera\nAbout the um about starting him about putting him in there Garret coal on the other hand it's a much different story when it comes to him and the Astros a start taking a one game edge with the seven to win from last night in to this one\nCoal hasn't lost in nine start so this is a tale of two different kinds of of pitchers uh since\nI Want to say the second week in August and he beat the Indians in game two of the American league division theory than it was a good outing seven innings just three hits and one\nRun so and Houston comes off of early under winning last night where he put away the game on\nYou know where he he put the game away and out of out of touch\nThey couldn't get much on him just a couple of them and and then there are bats came to talk and that's why seven too so this is you're not going to be an easy walk in the park for team that just crushed it during the regular season one of the\nPlayers being talked about his MVPs ... bad but in the postseason he's for for twenty so that's a problem in ... struggling to for twenty five why watch him play a lot I covered him with the with the rangers too\nAnd then on the other side of things you look at Alex pregnant he's fascinating to watch his defense at third and also um that he broke open in that game then the first game and the American league champion ship series so\nI don't know my money is on this is going to be tougher price if I'm price for I Want to win this thing like nobody's business of course he wants to win and he's competitive but because of all the conversation and then you look at Alex Cora\nThe manager of the red Sox dumped ejected whatever from game one because he was arguing a strike three call\nAnd uh and and there were some conversation about that afterwards but that doesn't matter that was game they're already lost boom so it's done it in the rearview mirror is about this game not about a yesterday's game I'd be very worried about George Springer who would I pitch around\nI Would be worried about George Springer he's had a two run single in the first spinning and he tied to Berkman club record with ten\nUh ten postseason attempt postseason hit streak\nHe's been on the show a couple of times he's a he's a fanatic four games when he's not on the field and and he's tough when you get into postseason anyway I think it should be a good game it's a seven o nine first pitch\nI'm curious about price the lefty and what he's going to bring because he is getting beat up all over the place and the decision of core to play him to start him rather\nAt in the second game and then coming off the law while wow wow the Dodgers a different story Monday they pick it up at home great when for them this has been a a good series between these two clubs\nWhere you've got one raw separating them so they lose on friday and then they come back and they win the next day and this could go the distance the brewers than the Dodgers\nWe'll we'll see on a Monday Night now that they are back on the west coast and their fans will be incredibly active I think for Dodger fans\nGet back to the world series\nIn the meantime I think that in the NFL we got three games that are still pumping and go and the cowboys really want to make a statement after that last so far they are six minutes ago Seventeen the edge for them ravens also blanketed tightened fourteen nothing five minutes until they're at the halfway point\nLess than a minute to go rams on top of the Broncos 'til they get to the halfway point of that game

night on NBC\nSports radio weird allusion ... such a take you through the night the whole weekend in sports we have the first word on everything that happened this weekend a baseball the college football which was wild\nThe game's going on right now the earlier games Pearl off but let's go right now an update everybody where we are ramps Thirteen Broncos three no big surprise there started the third quarter case keen I'm not doing much for Denver and he got ... the first happened it was getting tested percussion well\nHe got it went into protocols they brought in check Kelly show right to take me to taking me right I mean case schemes fifty for twenty four hundred eighty four yards no touchdowns but yeah he had a touchdown\nThat is very controversial call a basically mayor Sanders caught it slid in the end zone celebrated a as if you were a touchdown\nLike and because they said he was down at the one very very controversial called probably the wrong call but they didn't want her or is it so they he celebrated his he thought he scored a touchdown they called a tone and food are they pulling back the sixteen you never see that so that's the only reason case you've already be having an electric day if they took that away\nSo if it was a touchdown he would not have been flagged for said celebration no possible way I think that you let the player habit because they're believe it or not I wouldn't use the intent word there was no intent to celebrate outside\nYeah ... well he might have to sort of said something in the corner back it was a tone whoa but that would be hard but if yeah I Know oh that sounds like\nThe Broncos Broncos Twitter is saying that there's no way they could consider him down like that so it might have been a mistake it for ... it's a tough call you never see any way a ... unstoppable\n... Gurley has eleven carries Ninety seven yards\nAnd others to couple of catches a one of their star wide receivers ... Cooper cup popped he did you see came back yes he came back to come back he went off on a car I thought his like year was over it looks like one of those look like Phil Eliot in a semi pro that the phone now north Dallas forty getting carried off the field of running back and\nYeah so he's back in the game before that's great because this is ... and that's just a fun team all the way around\nHere that I'm going to go a couple of more ravens fourteen tightened zero I think a lot of people saw this coming titans had not done that much even though there were three into they've scored ... points in the first half Joe Flaco who's you know actually every one of his better years wise sneaky\n... having a great year you know they it so I think last week they were the they're the best team in the red zone by law which rotates fifteenth trade touchdowns or somebody in the red zone and now a Flaco I think do you think all of our Jackson got Flaco um that stretch that we make up as the media\nI see that's a good topic whether I Believe yes I I Do I think there was real extra motivation they always say like well he's not trying harder no but when you're in fear for your job I think you attack your job differently than when you're comfortable with your job I think it's fair to say about anybody in any realm of life like if you're a salesman\nAnd all of a sudden they say ah you know the this new guy is going to take a job unless you you may do more than you normally do\nIt's absolutely abs also his knee is healthy to which he's been banged up so I mean just like who's going to do when you're a Super Bowl and we'll see how the ratings\nI think it was interim at the Baltimore Ravens is Flaco is a very well known player but not an exciting player you to really tune in for and the rest of their team our guys you don't know Alex Collins at running back\nDivorce Allen running back my down yeah yeah a Michael Crabtree he's been around the league not real famous John Brown played for the cardinals not real famous even his name [noise] they've got a bunch of guys on often\nThat you don't know yeah I mean they they don't have a famous defense either they they did a nice job of adding Crabtree and brown brown is is the best boy the threat they've ... I ...\nI think they are talented players but I don't have named players they all have the ... like ... seems like he's forty but he's only got you know one of the defense\nAnd ... by the way is somehow he's unstoppable ... thirty five or you're right it's not but you know it's Baltimore like their defense it doesn't matter I call them the there's a a liquid Terminator of as healthy that can really do matter they will that they can break apart that core a hundred times they're always going to be ten and six and threatened to win the super\nBowl I thought the game that's going on right now that if you haven't heard the score yet you're going to be pretty surprised Dallas Cowboys twenty four Jacksonville Jaguars nothing\nIt's early in the third quarter deck Prescott as having his best game in the air probably the best game and two years at ... ... right at halftime he's fourteen for Twenty one sixty two touchdowns no picks he's been perfect ... el it hasn't done a lot about fifty yards at halftime deck Prescott lead them in rushing you talked about a guy who may have thought of thought to himself hey\nThis is a man there is a couple more games I Know they can't really bench deck Prescott 'cause they don't really have anything going there other than him\nBut but I think you may see the future and say hey I've got to prove myself to get that big contract someday\nAbsolutely so he's running you know where was that all year that's amazing ah this is probably be a very unlikely Sunday and even more unlikely Saturday to me is the biggest surprise at the mall\nAnd this is an interesting one to the I think we could talk more about later at the jaguars have none points against the I think the Dallas Cowboys even actually pretty good I think either take out the pretty good yeah I don't I don't think the defensive backs are great but they're linebackers I think are great and their pass Russia's really good\nSo they you know Sean I ... at least not playing the easy way higher than we thought they actually have a okay this this kid of ... the quarterback who actually gets a lot of tensions I throw it um a lot is pretty good players at every level this which isn't it funny that they tripped into a defense\nYeah because well they took Jay Lynn Smith out of Notre Dame ... so he dropped in the draft and they basically your blood diamond him put him on the shelf or yeah and a half and now they've perfectly healthy he looks like a statue out there and I mean physically jak oh he said leave the ideal football player he he writes we have a young Brian or locker way could run everywhere\nI liked that um he's in inside linebacker which isn't usually a glory position anymore but he sort of makes it like he's humble leaves all over the place and um\nLayton Vander ... linebacker that took that I thought they struck a wide receiver he's going to be probably not offensive rookie year but he's gonna be up there\nYeah you get gets big tackle numbers you weren't wrong by saying they should take out a strategy game yeah you're going to be cowed really I think really got picked up today I he's been very effective I don't know it's kind of really the number one though says it's hard to tell in Atlanta two guys are Julio so you never know how to play out\nWe're going to go through all the one o'clock games a little bit but baseball a lot of\nI watched a lot of baseball this weekend I was up in Vermont and my uh my Vermont buddies love their baseball they love the red Sox they were grinding they that game felt like it lasted a hundred years for Red Sox fans [laughter] they they I'm telling you a baseball is one of the tougher games to watch because when you're not winning it's just an absolute\nGut punch yes every moment of the game 'cause it's like a clock is counting down\nIt's slow and gradual and you have limited amount of opportunities that seventh eighth and ninth anywhere tougher Boston as you know\nThe other day brewer six Dodgers five that was on friday night and then last night and you had a couple of games going on yesterday actually who is going on a computer there ah yeah\nThe Dodgers a beat the brewers really Justin turned her home run that was a big play for the Dodgers still looked like they were about to lose control of the series to the very outer boroughs yeah the\nBrewers are really hot coming

really matter what was oh as Josh I'm injured or was he pulled Josh how is the injured he was following through any I think he had his hand\nAh and Josh how it was also incredibly ineffective the bills off into the mess ... they can get to the hike without a priest that probably it's a miracle show\nAnd they were winning that game they were they were yeah lead they yeah they were Thirteen ten when I tune in and it seemed like every time the ... for the um for the Texans would get something and it would give something back yeah it just it is all going wrong for the Texans and then they peering gave up a pick six\nAnd ... are you know there are section and then another another one across the body which was just seal the deal\nYou know to discern Watson didn't look great and there was not a special game for the Texans now that I wasn't there not a great team I was just for the pre game shows that were like well let's Saxons as a sure thing one of the day and this one guy goes well the ... the the Vikings they have the send them everyone has a denim from\nOne day yeah I mean Josh Allen can't get to a hundred yards at a game it's unbelievable day or the worst they're they're the worst off it's a long time not the quarterback certainly everything about\nThe ... a lot of times we discuss what game we discuss on friday and Saturday what's the NFL games you're going to watch because it's gonna be interesting and what's the one that looks like a total dog\nThe dog that weekend was probably bears at dolphins ... the dolphins the bears aren't exciting they got a pretty good defense that ends up going thirty one twenty in overtime one of the games that I was really looking forward to watching and I watched quite a bit of it was chargers at browns\nThe bra the brands no showed I mean they weren't horrendous but the you know they just couldn't stop the chargers\nEverybody in the national media was talking about how the browns\nWere good defense over to show up at home or by the way uh\nYeah it just it didn't happen or their defense was terrible they the chargers are very good team target running team yeah a male and Gordon came in a season looking fresh and he continued\nThat so many guys to throw to to I don't know who the it's Williams Williams fair to Williams as of this and they're both like strong and tall I really like Mike Williams a ... for the touchdown today so\nThat would just point but I got to tell you though you yes we knew the dolphins bears is going to be either ... or ... which was Baltimore, Tennessee is if you don't type of non washable those are the two most I watch\nHim so that was kind of like grandfathered in\nLike you know that I mean maybe the cardinals are harder to watch by the way you know they pay David Johnson a ton of money this off oh sure the cardinals who lost twenty seven Seventeen and Minnesota day that there is just flat out slow I don't know what happened to him since his injury like he's not good and they paid them a lot of money\nI'm telling ya I'm I'm even though say Kwan Barclays awesome\nI'm going to stick to my you can't take a running back high thing and I may go to the grave with it because say Kwan Barkley is is fantastic he's going to come rushing you can have a total two thousand yards combined the season wow and and he is working out for the giants but that doesn't mean it was right drastic still\nNo I Know and he he really is she's like Barry Sanders bigger and stronger or maybe water being I I Love it by a man to keep going\nI what I Want to go with I must start with Steelers at Bengals Blake comeback by the Steelers they score late ah Antonio Ron touchdown for Ben Roethlisberger this really could have gone either way the Bengals played fine ... always that's classic
