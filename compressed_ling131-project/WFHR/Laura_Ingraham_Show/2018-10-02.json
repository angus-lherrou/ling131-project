thousand and Eighteen National League central champions they have the best record\nIn the entire National League as far as we know they're going to continue to winning they're going to have home field advantage throughout to cross your fingers it all works out that way\nAnd uh when it comes to when it comes to this team in the way they did it who knew that their land or sea or whatever career day yesterday we\nKnew what in the hell were they doing pitching to yell at you with a man on third\nEye as much as I Want to say look the brewers won that thing Joe man you got to be stupid you got to be

coming up your shortly fast who is on the brewers roster but\nNevertheless\nYou start to look at this thing and think who who will who will not be making this roster eight five five eight three zero eight six where you want to get all this on Twitter go ahead and do show Advil underscore Michael's Advil underscore Michael's also you can you can track is down over on Facebook\nDraw the line

listening to us in Burlington Chet how you doing today man what's up\nYou know so far what's on your mind\nTo it on our on our part\nIn the playoffs are on I thought you're going to be left out of that party man raptor\nBoy that's a great question um because when you start to look at this roster in the way it shaped right now um they've got a lot I mean obviously they've got a lotta options but a ... like let's take a look at some of the guys you may think would probably make it but may not I mean right now\nThere is I mean obviously you're going to take your ... throw the outfielders in in ... and you and your hitters in but you you want to make sure that your bullpen is supplies and you've got one of the ... and all of baseball [noise]\nUm we appreciate the phone call chat let's take a look at this I mean some of the guys obviously um the younger guys call ups you know those guys are not going to be on your roster scene and got we're not going round worried about that\nBut in the grand scheme of things would man\nWho would you who would you leave off of this thing ...\nWould that be one of the name the the main names state the main names that would not make this thing I mean he is really struggled as of late offensively speaking\nCould you leave them off of it um you're keeping her non ... is ... and the guy that would be on the outside looking in you brought in Curtis Granderson is Domingo Santana go back down does he get left off of this roster\nShot scene Davies Mali's a Anderson ... you know you're all going to be all gonna keep Jeffress hater can able um Corbin burns I don't know if you can you trust in Jennings\n... man I mean Jennings you would keep maybe just because he's a lefty ... there's no way I could bring met Albert up and keep him here\n[noise] um [noise] you'd like to keep pretty Peralta if you can but I don't know if they're going to be able to just because of the the situation will use although he would be a great long reliever um boy that's a great question\nYou're keeping Cain you're keeping you know what you're keeping Braun you're keeping Shaw Aguilar stock is many pain you\nForesee a scope can you keep the scope I Would assume you can you would keeps go\nBy aircraft she has not going to keep Nottingham\nHer non press has been your guy so you're going to ...\nTyler salad you know I don't think so you're ... deaths outs out in the outfield most likely you're gonna keep Curtis Granderson as a lefty not keen on Braxton and probably not Domingo Santana\nThen it comes down to who you're gonna keeping the Penn who would be the odd man out Joe who you think anybody in particular eight five five eight three zero\nSix or eight still has a loaded question man I Know there's first of all this bullpen is just tremendous\nUm so many guys have contributed throughout the course of the season is going to be very interesting to see how many guys credit counselor decides to go with in that bullpen\nAnd whether or not he will roll with for starting pitchers or a few things maybe he can get away with three and try to do a bullpen by committee game depending on how serious girls it's very loaded question I I have no idea that she was only a guy who have if\nYou have a game what you're going to use ... committee you would probably go a little deeper into pin\n\n... who would you ride man out of the routine rotation beef you're going to go with the Forman rotation which is most likely shot scenes been great wave Miley has been stable\nChasing I've even been more than ... you know I Would agree with that chase Anderson has been good last year but good portions of this year but not his real well down the stretch but have you augment outlook\nMan it it comes down to this is my only shot seeing ... right those are ... there's no debate there but then exact babies are shaped Anderson and again that comes down to ... counsel as to whether or not he wants to roller three starters\nA or he wants to go to for because then the debate begins as to whether or not you went back Davies or you want to understand chase Anderson right now to me cannot be trusted\nRight that's what I'm saying I mean he ... he says ups and downs and last year he pushed really really well but this year right now he's just not throwing the ball real well\n\nPaid five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six forty let's go to a ... he's got some roster thought Steve how're you doing today man what's up\nAnd go do a show on uh one thing that would that would wonder about is that I'll count the like the stack up right end it better or left handed hitters depending on the pitcher I Wonder if they're going to have Eric theme\nI don't know if I can work things out there right now seems not hitting the ball very well\nSame way I feel the same way that\nFight for three strikes out waiting to happen so and it saying well he's twelve or Thirteen\nYou know that's that's a big question though who they're going to keep her position players right at one one extra pitcher or one extra player will make a big difference and they I think the latest serious you know where there's a few games that day off and so on\nI think they could get by with twelve relievers or with a lot of pictures like yeah\nI'll hang up now with your thought\nNo I appreciate thanks so much he drops off you get on board eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight by by a three zero eight six for eight right now Eric things in the last\nTwo months not just in the last month of September but from August first through yesterday is hitting one thirty three he said he one thirty three he is eight for sixty\nEight for sixty\nEight for sixty with um good God a pre sixty with thirty four strike outs striking out better than one every two at bats\nYou ... you can't put them on the roster you can't put them on the postseason roster\nHe would not be a guy that I Would be choosing paid five five eight three zero eight six for the ... year it's a great question of how many people you're going to how many pictures you're going to go with like I said okay look at it this way a shot scene Miley uh in ... there\nGoes your starters\nThen you've got to Jeffries hater coordinated will Corbin burns\nYou would go most likely with another left the Indian Jennings I Know people don't want to hear that you probably would\nI'm\nJacob Barnes ... Peralta\nWhen you go with ... ... is head up and down man I don't know if I'd trust story\nYou traded for 'em you brought him in for this particular for this particular run but Syria has not been good as of late although maybe he matches up a little bit better against some of these teams and I'd have to look at like deeper numbers but sitting there right now for what he's done as of late or any way you go from a\nSaid at six thirty five ER a coming\nA month of September he's thrown eleven and a third innings giving up eleven hits eight runs only one long ball eleven strike out three walks\n\nHe's got Thirteen games that he's appeared in\nBoth eleven hits in those Thirteen games as he already coming out of August was much better as a matter of fact um he had been\nOkay until he got the September first he got the September first in that game against Washington where he went two thirds of an ending giving up a couple of hits in foreign runs couldn't get anybody hardly anybody out at one strike out but to walks along the way as well and just that was an ugly outing\nAnd since then he's not been able to really right the ship you gave up a couple of runs in Sanford again San Francisco and other run against San Francisco another run against Pittsburgh he's been scoreless since then\nThursday night and I cannot wait but I'll tell you this get there early\nGet there early get yourself some of that popcorn and these are\nGet yourself there early get a couple of cocktails going and you're going to have a fantastic time going to be a lot of fun that's coming up but ah but the atmosphere at at Wrigley Field yesterday I give me the first hand account if you were down there let us know how it was let us know how you were received letters you know\nKind of the the the the brewers pandemonium that was going on because I'll tell you what they were certainly showing it showing it on M. T. V. and ESPN\nThey were showing a lot up close and personal uh brewer's fans were down there were signs let's go to Barbara in St Francis Barbara how you doing today what's going on\n[noise] [noise] [noise] um I like getting a little credit to guys who were out here and\nThere were there and vote terrific\nThey had been um put it in ... she had the phone call Barbara and thanks and I'm Glad you're ecstatic 'cause this is a fun time of year they have been a both of those guys have been part of the family I guess the best way to put even the one thing that was really cool that they had mentioned I don't know if it was in one of the speeches\nThat we kind of like we're able to hear or if it was one of the mansions after the game part Winkler from our flagship station was down there inside that club house together and like I said you're gonna hear some of that coming up later on\nBut I remember as I'm driving and I'm listening to this to the post game show and I can hear this they were talking about the family and they talked about everybody from the videographer\nThe guy to cut up the video they were talking about the strength of conditioning guys the guys that were on the DL that are still the family\nThey don't forget about 'em you know they talked about ownership they talked about the general manager talked about the manager and the coaches and stuff but they went through and very specifically started pulling out guys' names Tony ... who has been the clubhouse manager for so so long obviously the broadcasters and euchre and such\nThey get a lot of credit for that as well but\nIn the grand scheme of things they were top to bottom family oriented that this is one for all for one type of organization it was really cool it was it reminded me and I hate to use the cubs analogy here but back when the cubs were going to the world series\nWhen Theo Epstein headset okay this is beginning to combination here and this is all under one roof\nBasically meaning our mission statement is all for one okay it's all under one roof there is no deviation whether it's in the Dominican whether it's out in the Arizona fall league ... doesn't matter we're all under one philosophy and he brought in every scout in every scouts family from around the world\nTo partake in and be a part of what was about to take place I as far as the world series goes\nIt reminded me of that as I'm listening to guys talk\nYesterday about the videographer isn't about the scouts in about guys down in in in Arizona at the beginning of the season when they were coming in and the construction guys\nThat were coming in through the clubhouse and they were talking about where they're gonna knock things down and start to rebuild right after a camp broken the team headed north to start the baseball season I mean they were talking about everybody so when you talk about some of the guys that have been on the deal that have been supporters\nThey were mentioning the guys who were part of the family so I I agree it's it's you know granted winning breeds\nHappiness and joy and success breeds this this level of of camaraderie you know it's it's when the chips are down is when you find out who your friends are they've always said that\nBut this has certainly been eye opening there hasn't been a whole lot of me me me back and not that there was but back when\nYou had prince and you had Korean you had Ryan who had Jay Jay you had you had all these guys\nAnd then you had cc that got here and then a couple of years later you get back and it was about ... not talking and it was about guys that were you know the shirts and talked and yeah they were kind of there we are family group it was more about the guys was more about the ... this is about the organization this is about mark out that I was you know David Stern and even Doug Melvin to a certain extent\nComing before the microphones and going gang meaning you're the fans were rebuilding\nMore transparent you can see right in our window this is what's going on be patient and then the first question when you expect to rebuild to be complete we're not going to answer that it will happen when it happens you will know okay ah what are you gonna do it for the rebuilt we don't know we are ...\nTalent under one roof through our scouting department through trades through free agency whatever we can do are going to put as much talent under one roof as we possibly can get next question what do you do about pitching\nWe're going to figure out a plan you know because pitching some of the pitching throughout major league baseball as high dollar or being the market that we are we don't want to save money is an object but we we can't go crazy\nSo we're going to do everything we possibly can't bus the bullpen and bullpen by committee and and getting games done by committee go back to the beginning of the season when David Stern was on this program four thousand three hundred and Seventy four out that's what we need to get\nBad so we need to get okay took a few more algae obviously would that's we need to get doesn't matter how you get there as long as you get there and he was right\nBecause this was this was the philosophy this is the way we're going to do it where we don't have ... okay we don't have very lander we don't have those big arms they are going to cost us two hundred and fifty million dollars over the next ten years or eight years or five years or whatever those crazy money's being thrown around out there right now we don't have that\nSo we got to get it done by committee we're going to find great guys to be placed in great roles to be then great pictures and that's what they did\nJeremy Jeffries comes back gets a new life Josh hater lights out Cory can able doesn't look good get sent down comes back lights out\nYou know you pick up an armed here or there along the way that maybe you can catch them lightning in a bottle you catch a couple of guys like us just seen like a weight Miley who who just want to kind of rebuild themselves reinvent themselves get themselves on the right side of maybe what the next contract would be they did\nThey did it and here we are today\nSo now there's more work to do don't get me wrong\nBut it it's it's been a a really cool process to watch this thing play out and you know what they did it without being perfect\nBecause what we felt was once they picked up a once they picked up Christian yellow gentlemen's okay huge acquisitions once they pick them up we should okay the next move is obviously go out and get starting pitching your next move is to get that big starting pitcher get in the ... scenario jump into that fray and they did a little bit\nAnd they didn't get you to our average and people were just devastated like ... I\nDon't have any pitching well there's graft out hit him\nWell you didn't realize what the plan was we said the same thing but I said I said at the time the blessing in disguise is sometimes the deal is never made thank God they didn't get you ... you know what I mean\nSometimes the best deals are the ones that never get married\nAnd you look back and you say there but for the grace of God right now the cubs are sitting on a on a big stock pile of cash and a guy that can't throw baseball they've had some problems down there because of that not that they can't afford to go out and get more players but you know what I mean in in Milwaukee they can't afford to do that if you're gonna spend the money that's fine money's no object but you gotta hit\nHad the brewers spent that money\nGoing into next season might look a little bit different now and this coming off season you still have a little bit of money to play with and you probably get yourself a couple of guys can fortified the rotation and and now the ... winter you're considered to be maybe a team to go to your you're no longer up and coming you've arrived and you've arrived a lot of young talent that looks as if it's going to sustain\nFor at least a short period of time let me say this though real quick there is one thing one thing that I'm I'm telling you do not allow history to repeat itself okay\nAnd the cubs they've done this\nAnd I'm going to tell you what it is when we come back to more than Michael shear next\nPoint why bill Michael sports talk network [noise]\nWith the regular season winding down the Lincoln high school raiders will travel to Steven's point on friday to take on this patch Panthers will just be victorious and make it to it or oh if you can get out to see the game\nW.

F. HR\nIt's\nReally remarkable fashion and to think that there were five James back in the beginning of September and dialogue in that conversation about how ever wavered that we were going after the invention of you guys heard that all you hear that all [noise]\nAnd it was truly these guys never lost focus of the division for jobs that we thought we could we could make some hay during those days I mean I can go to a baseball game is played all you're really not\nLike I said the other night I I'm just trying to be proud\nTo be part of this organization thankful for the family for giving up a government sanity and uh I I\nReally believe that these guys are doing everything in their heritage of activists\nWords of David Stern is welcome back to Michael show continues I build Michael's across the way radio ... if you want to open up the phone lines and chime in their wide right now eight five\nEight three zero eight six or eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight to go ahead and take advantage of that you can also get a hold us on Twitter at bill underscore\nMichael's Advil underscore Michaels at radio Joe sports you can find a silver on the Facebook fan page as well so you chime in and they're always good to see Facebook being utilized you can chime in over there and drop us an email um\n[noise] this one from Dick who says maybe the a dumb idea bill but which you can encourage all the listeners to call the commissioner's office or in voice their displeasure for the three o'clock in the afternoons start time so people after they leave their job you should I call it in the person they're so they never thought about that when they do the schedules\nNo I mean they look at it regionally and they say okay uh you know because if you're just joining us in a and you're just wondering what exactly is that we're talking about the er\nThe game tonight between Colorado in Chicago is a seven eight seven or eight start time central time same thing with Oakland in New York one is on ESPN yeah that was on TBS okay\nThen Thursday if you're just tuning in it is the four o seven central time five o seven eastern for oh seven central time start time\nFor the winner of the Chicago Colorado again at Miller Park\nSo the ... of the first game on the docket part of the reason they do that is because the late game than\nThe late game is eight thirty seven ... there'll be network because it's out in LA which is five thirty seven start time there okay so they're giving a decent overlap between the two but that's part of it because you've got to a west coast games so the brewers they're not going to be on say seven o'clock at night\nYou know you're not going to start that came out on the west coast a safe for a good at two o'clock in the afternoon you're not going to do that you want at least middle day prime time type of thing so that's the reason they set it up that way uh and then on friday\nNotice the way they used to do it it's funny because people complain all the time that baseball runs way too late you can't see it it's not good it's not good for the kids to build your fan base or baseball bunch of bumps up suits are awesome start times uh show the game coming up on friday at Miller Park is a three Fifteen game\nFriday three Fifteen at Miller Park a game to LVN LDS game one of the ... I heard the AOL Diaz gets underway between Cleveland in Houston\nThat's a one oh five star time in Houston so Houston the Astros are getting a five game the brewers get a three Fifteen game and then they've got New York in Oakland the winter they're taking on Boston at six thirty\nIn the late game being the west coast game starting at nine thirty seven which people are going to complain about saying all my kids get you know people in Atlanta on the east coast are going to say my kids can stay up that late friday night I get it but still it's gonna be a late game after midnight before that game's done\nSo they're trying to make it to where every game's view of all and they're giving you some day games again\nAnd people are complaining about it you know specifically brewers fans Bruce fans want to see prime time that's where our team belongs we're going to have the MVP all that kind of stuff and I look I understand it but I I don't mind and I guarantee you one thing I guarantee you one thing we were parks going to be sold out\nMiller Park will be sold out so for all the people complaining about it hosted forty thousand people are gonna be complaining about it because they're going to be down there at the ballpark so I understand it might be a little bit tougher brewers are for brewers fans that are not going to the game but\nThat place is going to be sold out and everybody's going to be there it will be packed\n\nEight five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six for a\nAccording to ... times Milwaukee they're saying that all the LDS home games for the brewers are sold out there you go\nThere you go here's here's the good news if they do face the cubs you're not going to see a ton of cubs fans in there\nBecause the birds are fans of already bought up the tickets and ... they would assume yeah cubs fans don't know what their fate is going to be so do they really want to put money down on Miller Park and then if the cubs get eliminated ... what are they going to do it they're gonna eat that money are they going to have to try and sell their tickets\nSo you've got a people complaining about the start times look I I don't mind day postseason baseball I remember when they used to play a day game every now and then for the world series\nI don't mind de de baseball I I Know some people get upset about it maybe we don't have the traditional job to where people want to pay attention to it in their cubicles or watch it somewhere I understand that might be a bit of a hassle but\nYou know baseball's damned if they do and damned if they don't so you might as well just go ahead and do what's best for the game\nAnd and just let the chips fall where they may so he's got Colorado in Chicago coming up tonight Oakland in New York Coming up tomorrow and then you get it all under way with you know the U.S in the LDS are coming up on Thursday and friday\nAnd kind of go from there Saturday by the way is only American League baseball\nGame to Cleveland and Houston\nThat gets underway at four thirty seven cents or eastern time three thirty seven central time and then the late game will be on the east coast that the seven Fifteen start time at Boston depending on who the winner of the New York Yankees Oakland A's game is and then you get only nationally teams on Sunday\nDuring football day during on you and Phil\nSo that's kind of the first run leading through Sunday anyway\n... the nice thing is the brewers game on Sunday will not conflict with the Packers game because but not in the Packer game will be over with brewer baseball will be on TV\nYeah no I I completely get it and and statistically speaking we talked about a time and again when you break all the numbers down there are teams that are supposed winning teams that don't and that you Joe mentioned it a little while ago that the brewers inanimate carry some to who knew because the ... one of the hottest teams in baseball at the end sometimes you've got to a guy\nYeah hard and a lot of trouble at a bank triple crown\nYeah so I think yesterday was not supposed to be days Orlando Garcia shined as a matter of fact he was a guy that should have been shut down and he didn't he ended up contributing at the end scoring a couple of runs in the second one being the winning run so\nI I put a lot of a stock in statistics the numbers and I always come back to the guys on the field sometimes it's a play it's a balance it's something that happens out of the ordinary or just a big moment in time as a turning point of the game or the energy from the crowd and it's things that people that go with numbers and savory metrics and\nUnderstandings of physics and such hate because it's an intangible that you can't ... you can add it\nAs bad as the absolute truth and background of the equation\nSeven hundred and Ninety games right the two times by its got we got a window we love ya\nYeah ... you're a man he's fired up he has a right to be fired up it's going to land last week there was a mosquito land how you doing\nGuys I don't\nKnow what am I [laughter]\nI don't know of course I think that would change what do you\nI [noise] boy appreciate the phone call here's the thing with with nicknames\nTheir organic\nTheir organic it's it's it's a headline in the newspaper it's it's it's somebody with a T shirt that comes up with something kind of cool and it catches on 'em because he's this team really a team of bombers\nIn Christian churches can hit for power but he's not necessarily your typical bomber he's gotta hits all over the place\nYou know now if you had Eric things and you are an Braun all hitting home runs and Kaine at a prolific great well then yeah you're you're the crushers\nBut it's it's not that this is a team that can play you know yard ball or small ball you know yesterday they weren't bomb in and out of the park you know you get all doubled down the line moving runner over they ... they drop down bunch yesterday\nThey drop down bunch ... dollars dropped outta by successful sacrifice that's like Sina Loch Ness monster man is there an app it\nMoved runner over base it brings them in small ball so\nI don't know if I can labeled him anything it's kinda like when I remember when the Packers came up with the cold G. force remember that\nAnd they were trying to market the G Force and you know everybody knows it's cheese heads come on it just it just happened it was organic and then they came out with the the the song ... for some people looked at it like\nWhite it no\nYou know it just it's it's great for marketing if you want to sell something but sometimes it just needs to happen organically and if somebody has something that just happens and\nWe walk in one day and somebody gives us something and you go man that's kinda cool not to say your ideas not it's just I think sometimes it's organic when when you know things like that happened I mean it was somebody up a sign years and years and years ago\nI live in the black hole\nEveryone is with a black hole is it's it's the cheering section it's the fans section the crazy section out in the Alameda coliseum to because some guy to sign up and were everybody was wearing black is starting to coordinate together for the Oakland Raiders you know I mean\nSuddenly it was a black hole then you had a big fat guy in a in Cleveland had a big dog mask\nKept saying give me give his dog a bone they call it the dog down next thing you know bam sit on the capitalized on it but it already become organic at that point you know so I don't know I don't know if I Want to ... attempt to label anything until it just kind of flows\nAnd that makes sense eight five five eight three zero eight chicks for a while ago Michael show
