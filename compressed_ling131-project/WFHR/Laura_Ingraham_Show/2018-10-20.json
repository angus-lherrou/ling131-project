that score then defensively [noise] with with some energy and that that's what you want to see from the other side right so I'm Avi Smith I'm I'm really like and what I feel a great series of events right from that standpoint but\nI think the interception the one I gotta feeling when they look at it [noise] forty ... at least the first one was reading something different minerals wide receiver [noise] I don't know that for sure but I'm just ... it just looked like [noise]\nTwo out of a path right right what's your stand them ... and I don't take that away but I think he read something differently or within his receive or the other one is a he tried to get up and throw you still kinda knocked gathered himself yet that the wind and and get another pick [noise]\nUm [noise] what the penalty was huge threat to the five yards that's all it was what it was a huge thing 'cause you're sitting down ready to punch the thing in and be able to deal I'm In that first half [noise] and then you come out a little flat the country and we just started to second happened that's\nThose are the things that again when when you look at it as a coach or or as a player how do we get this team

of it if it was great we hit the ball and she out there on affair with a lab and I was a fight in the Gulf it on\nThe number ... to go over a hundred yards does that landmark means something is it a point of pride\nHarm you know when I didn't know I was in Ninety nine at first then you know\nThey were like hey you got to get her injury you got to get a hundred or so ago back down and you know it felt very you know to get a hundred you know many running back you know a hundred yard game as you know pretty good so\nAs as a team and I've asked all of your teammates and you've been around for a while how did you handle that moment from Michigan is not the same you want another one of the all you wanted it is a character test how to do you guys handle that test this\nI'm you know all the mentally you know uh we did in ... to you know um\nWe we took it on a chain you know Michigan play to a good game you know taking of no credit from them and I'm\nWe had to come back they leave bounce back to work hard and practice you know\nClean things up in the ... come out and play the game that we know how to play in the you know that at the end of the day where all the football players you

they're moments gonna come\nHere and I think some of those similar conversation but [noise] um [noise] maybe has he has with his teammates maybe has with his family for a uncertainly how some of the coaches and that at some point things come to an ad right now there's a number of high school players around the states\nStarted playoffs last night will happily team tossed right two hundred and some teams started last hour and a half of them are drawn to you think about that and and\nTheir their life lessons or different things and some of them are injuries\nFrom ... to learn the mentally how do

worked hard to be here to earn a scholarship to come play haven't had a chance to do what I wanted to do now I have the opportunity I'm healthy I'm going to take advantage of that and I think when you

respect you and are there to slap you on the back and sometimes to Yahoo but to make sure you're doing the things you need to do but but to me there to support you and I think that's the special bond that you have with players when you're one of them\nBut it's an opportunity now to say hey here's my chance I'm going to do all I can form and they're excited from Europe Ninety nine yards give back you know over a hundred [noise] All right I'll do this for you guys but there\nAre there are supporting them and rallying around them because they know how hard he worked to get worried that

the same type of hopes and dreams in Wisconsin due to who sees them began but the expectations are high\nAnd then kind of situation there it is here especially the ones who started the whole kind of been up and down they haven't found the ... yeah and the one thing for me when I when I watch westerns base for a job they have athletes out on the edges all over the place right that\nIf we can control the lot of scrimmage defensively [noise] we should be okay\nBut we need guys back that are healthy we need to go to work in his way back in and we need guys to respond to take another leap from Michigan to Illinois and then to northwestern\nWe need our office to control things so that that fast paced type of often can't where our guys down there again that's all playing together but you

I Believe the game has started already so I'd already kind of guts\nHappening in that game a week ago and it it's set the tone for me they went on to win that game uh and then you know lost the next one and then one the next two so\nPretty interesting series so far quite honestly I mean who doesn't love a game seven if you're a sports fan we all love game sevens really even if your team is not in it you can get involved in a game seven you can understand the excitement and the pressure et cetera et cetera so I started preparing myself for\nThe fact that I feel like the Dodgers are probably going to step in it not be able to execute and or\nLose this game brewers move on to the world series et cetera so started thinking about okay and you do get excited about the NBA season stuff for the hockey season or spend more time focusing on NFL et cetera because\nAh after they won games three and four in LA a size four and five I thought\nWow you know they got two chances to win one in Milwaukee and I know the brewers are good taking nothing away from what they're doing but the reason I was confident about the Dodgers opportunities and feel free to join the conversation here eight by by three two three four NBC\nI was feeling good for one main reason all the stuff that I was ranting and raving about\nWith regard to the Dodgers problems and issues and things that I think they are going about the wrong way\nThey changed in game five\nThey started playing small ball sits in a way she situational hitting stealing bases sacrificing shortening up the swing and poking the ball and the right field that kind of stopped for a right handed hitter going with it per se\nIf you're not a big baseball fan you don't exactly know what that means but\nA short swing versus the long swing is I'm trying to make contact versus I'm trying to hit a home run and it works\nIt works they were scoring runs in getting base heads and it was exciting it felt like this is the way baseball should be played especially in October\nSo I was like and you know guys like Austin Barnes who doesn't you know he's not a regular starter on this team during the regular season he gets up there clutch single max months the who is you know and unheard of guy I think everybody knows the story at this point\nBut he's the guy that thirty five months this year for the Dodgers so you have to expect on a team that likes to hit home runs specs to hit home runs they are going to put max months you know they don't mind well he had shorten up his swing tweet shortened up its wing knocking the ball up the middle kind of a thing in Coney\nBallenger stealing bases so ... sack bonds\nAnd villains or even the game before that game for\nHad the ability I Know he's got the ability I Know all of these guys have the ability it's not about ability it's about desire it's about once it's about what the coaches you know what the messages from the manager what they are instructed to do\nSo the philosophy but the Dodgers has been hit all Ron's we don't care if you strike out four times looking oh which is just my stomach turns just saying the words striking out looking I don't think there's anything more frustrating as a fan of a team when you're watching\nI don't even know if it's the score matters I guess when you're up it's a little bit easier to stomach but when you have a runner on base specially in story position and\nAt the plate watches strike three it makes me want to jump through the TV [laughter] I Can't tell you that is probably one of the more frustrating things in the world when it comes to being a sports fan for me\nThat right up there with you know stupid penalties in football like holding on a touchdown or a first down\nStriking out the bases loaded or striking out with runners on base looking to me is unacceptable and acceptable you cannot do it swing the freaking back\nSo I don't care if it's\nOutside and you're guessing that fall and they throw a curve ball swing the bat you have to you have to take the buyout offer shoulder what does not swinging the bats get you nothing nothing other than maybe I guess you could say well I was fooled ... is\nThe worst so that they weren't doing that they were swinging the bad they were showing it up they're pumping the balls are out there and taking care of business so I thought\nOkay let's see if they can do that again and of course I guess what\nI think the brewers might have taken a page out of their book\nDodgers got up to a good start yesterday game six lead off hitter freeze it's a home run I say I like this I liked the way this this\nThen we get to the bottom of the first Aguilar hopes going out to right field for a double\nSmall to call that a tennis Bali and it'll do they look like that it was a perfect description of what he what he did and we'll start just came up basically the same thing\nCain crafts on that curve ball that ... would not lay off poking at the right field\nLittle easy just make contact get it out there oh and kept going back to that curve ball which again\nThe reason and I I really appreciate\nThe broadcast the work that the the guy's been the truck at Fox are doing on this series because they're throwing out amazing stats right they're kind of giving you the opportunity to make your own judgment on whether or not\nThe statistical information should be supported it or not\nSo they they they they ... and it's one of these things where you would think I Believe with Google you can find anything there are times when I'm like\nI heard a step that I really liked and I wanted to go support it read more about it learn it ride a gal make sure I had it right kind of a thing research that's that and I put it in I Can't find it anywhere I'm like how the heck are these guys find is that\nAh you know baseball reference there was a great job with that kinda stuff but sometimes it's really difficult to find these random stacks especially in baseball so I appreciate that they're throwing them out there but the throughout the Staten and I'm going to get them to paraphrase I don't remember exactly but basically during the regular season Dodger starter hunch in review\nIn Wisconsin a fighting chance Scott Walker also at tough decisions to make is part of new jobs\nBefore he was governor Wisconsin had a huge deficit unemployment hit nine point three percent\nTaxes went through the rough Scott Walker's reforms turned our state around\nPeople at work on this year than ever before\nThe deficit is gone\nTaxes are lower than what Scott was elected and he made his Oregon but once in schools can help bring good paying manufacturing jobs\nWe cannot afford to go backwards by raising income property tax\nAnd keep Wisconsin working with Governor Scott Walker\nVeterans Scott Walker [noise]\nSleep everything you need for these ...\nWith a real big myself\nWhat you need for these are the best ... next to\nNew to paint camping\nWe use in one last camping trip\nFarmers for him ...\n[noise]\nSaid which network\nListening to Wisconsin badger football all season long right here on W. F. HR am Thirteen twenty brought you in part by ag country farm credit services a member owned financial cooperative serving rural and agriculture customers for over one hundred years\n[noise]\nCoverage like NBC Sports [noise]\n\nCan be the fourth radio the NBC Sports radio out but of course NBC Sports radio dot com Pete box with you till nine eastern on sweater or Red Sox fan [noise]\nWe got through a whole conversation about baseball primarily the Dodgers and then they bring up many Machado at all\nSo we're talking about that a little bit later because there's a lot there as well he's one of the uh [noise]\nMost hated players in baseball right now unless you're a Dodger fan public enemy number one [laughter] everyone's got an opinion on manning Machado\nBut I wanted to talk about this Michigan Michigan State game rivalries as I've mentioned in the past attracted me either I game sevens I'm interested I'm a little bit of a bull Greenspan my mom's from the Michigan area so she's been a Wolverine span since I was a kid\nUh so I visited there a couple of times have some friends that live um on the western side of Michigan and they're actually spartan fans but I had a very close buddy who lived in the area I Lived in Ann Arbor as a matter of fact so uh you know they were there five six years so that kind of became Michigan band anyway\nUh that's my history with these two teams you know not a huge fan I don't really care either way I kind of a bandwagon fan I guess you would say from Michigan have a hat you know I was there visiting and that's one of the things I buy when I'm visiting somewhere find that the\n... for the local team so I I didn't really have\nA big rooting interest I did think that Michigan State was going to be in this game a little bit more than they were\nAnd therefore they were getting seven so I made a very very small wager on Michigan State to cover I thought it would be closer because they have been very very close ah over the last few years in Michigan State you know pulled off a mob set\nA couple maybe it was for two three years ago the a famous bumble or I guess that would be infamous stumble by the Michigan kicker that a spotty turned into a touchdown\nSo that was out there and of course the other big stat coming into this game was I'm John Harbaugh\nJohn Jim Jim Harbaugh is one in five against\nOhio State and Michigan State so\nYou know that's just not what you're looking for as the Michigan head coach so this was a big game for ... and the ... their number six now\nTheir defense is unbelievable but of course the story went off the rails before the game started with Michigan State doing some march across the field where they come out onto the field before the game from sideline to sideline the entire team linked arm in arm\nSo they kind of like I don't know sweep the field or something it's a ritual I don't know what it means but they do it every home game I guess\nSo surprise surprise Michigan is absolutely aware of this and they have their their guys out on the field\nSpecifically Devon Bush was one of their big time line backers and you know they're linked arm in arm from sideline to sideline so there's anybody else failed to get in the way they're going to get raped up Devin Bush of course they don't like that\nWords were exchanged push against shutting Michigan State kept walking basically and Devin Bush was doing that hold me back saying I don't think he was actually going to\nLead fifth fly if you will but he was pretending like it you know I'm I'm a Jew or you're a you know that whole deal they held him back and then he went to\nThe fifty yard line and desecrated their logo no we didn't take a whiz or anything but pretty close pretty close\nHe started with his cleats gouge eating out a big chunks of grass on spotty helmets drawing lines and just you know ripping up the grass\nAnd then I guess they stopped him or he came to his sense is a little bit and then they had to send out the grounds crew to paint over that the chunks out of the grass but look the bottom line is that just completely juvenile uncalled for behavior\nIsn't there reminds me of geo when he's with the niners then he went to the\nThe helmet on fifty yard line and put the ball down or whatever he did those kinds of things just why put a target on your back that way I don't get it\nMichigan of course wins the game Twenty one to seven because their defense was oh doubt so tough to move the ball on Brian Little work eat\nThe spartan quarterback has that line that I don't think I've ever seen before\nYou know you hear about\nIn complete passes in a streak five or six seems like a lot right he was up to ten eleven incomplete passes in a row we finished the day doing five twenty five you only completed five\nFor sixty six yards [noise]\nAnd the Wolverine defense definitely did their job he would have thought that it would have fired up Michigan State a little bit more than it did and they play the defense but in the end they couldn't couldn't hold off the Wolverine Sony One to seven [noise] not quite as exciting as I Would hope but I guess all that the federal budget make it a little bit more interesting the Fox NBC Sports radio [noise]\nOr can we look at news\nAm thirty twenty\nJar [noise] your NBC Sports radio updates\nOn her one Alabama ruling against Tennessee Alabama

have to think of you know the lack of ties to an advantage to his advantage is quickness manages to to sneak around and be a\nYou know a loose pox jumped on those talks quicker than other players and and and that's really how he scored both his goals that he was around the net he was able to beat defenders to them that\nHe made a great little say go for school to get to go out of the neck to score the second one ages readers guide to the net and Palestine or ... are still so he's got a lot of confidence so last year he started to come on CSI or want to and he didn't produce as much as maybe we thought he would just first year but but a new way he's going now I think uh\nKnow he's going to have to be a big contributor for us to believe he's not gotten a ton of power play rep for us so he'll probably a little bit more power play time for us as your moves on an old fleet and keep score like\nWith the power plays doing here and told me the more you know it needs work I had to\nCut that out and then the\nPractices and then the first team the exhibition game um\nI thought we had a lot of conference going in the sea did a good job killing against us we it till we moved to talk really well we didn't create as much as I thought we would and then last night and we just never really gotten think as a group\nAnd so it has the personality we have the the guys that can can be a successful ... but the need rhythm they need the scan it through in a season so I'm not giving up on them um but I think that learning from\nWork teams are having that against us and how they kill and being a boy
