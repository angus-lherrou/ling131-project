writes the winnings email inbox they're going to be lucky to get to wins I think they're going to\nBeat Miami and most likely the Vikings but did they lose to the rams they lose to always got to lose the rams and lose the LA unless he means any New England\nTom Brady will eat them up and just Seattle is a hard place to play which I you know I I don't have an argument for\nBecause you're right LA is a ballet there are there are undefeated team they're they're moving along really well Tom Brady is Tom Brady and do belly checking company and it's not easy to go into Fox Pearl and get a when they own that place\nAnd uh then Miami is a beautiful team after starting off three you know they've had some hard times as of late and you've got a familiar phoned the Minnesota Vikings who\nYou pretty much should have had at that level field you can go on to go toe to toe with them and because of your off and see what you believed to be good team speed once you get into the turf and us banks stadium take the crowd out of it you should be able to get a when they're\nSo no I I Can't argue with that\nI have five five eight three zero eight six for it gives you ... what do you think that record the Green Bay Packers is going to be over the next stretch a five games what does it have to be for them to remain kind of in the hunt\nAnd in addition to that uh I well you know this one says a brisk says when they go on and for I Will be tending bar and the gun club come on by and show me your ID so\nBrisk you're not real optimistic last ten games jet says the Packers go eight and to the goal Evan foreign one window division get the number two seed in the NFC beat the chiefs in the super bowl and make more pop McCarthy still gets let go\nGo pack up that's from jet if they win a Super Bowl and they beat the chiefs why in the world are you letting your head coach go\nYou know what I mean that that doesn't make sense\nJed I liked the way you think that there's a flaw in your methodology is you get to the very end\nI'm\nKurt says I think Aaron Rodgers is going to throw his name into the MVPs trying to play without the Braves which means he's feeling better and he'll be more mobile the wide receivers as we have discovered our top notch\nGood against has done a terrific job in putting weapons around Aaron Rodgers he just has to take a little more time to fortify the defense it wasn't all going to be pro bowlers overnight Packer fans need to understand that\nThere's teams had it in the right direction you just have to give it one more year and be patient I Kurt\nI was I was kind of with your until we give it one more year and the problem is I I understand it theoretically it it works but\nThat would be one of those arguments of yet another year of wasting a hall of fame quarterback\nPeople will say why did you waste that year why did you go ... why didn't you bring in other players to fortify and good kids can say I did I got Jimmy grant you know he had the ... we know that but he's going to come back and be just fine he's going to be feeling good after this I went out and got my Wilkerson nobody knew he was going to break a leg\nYou know he went out and got drawn Williams who has been\nTo the young talent and finally you have all the young talent together he brought to enjoy your Alexander and the draft who looks as if he's going to be a hell of a slight covered guy they could probably use one more guy but if you got him John Jackson Kevin came looks to be the real deal\nIf you can keep them on a damn field at the same time you might really have something back there\nWhich you don't have is a consistent parents rush you don't have the beast and that's why your biggest misstep to this point could be could end up being polio Mac\nAnd not bringing him in although ... right now with the high ankle spraying which is pretty much a six week injury he looks human he doesn't look superhuman anymore\nI don't know if you haven't seen last week he he you know against New England he's just a guy right now he doesn't have the same leverage the St push the same quick missing footwork none of that and they're not saying what it is but the only gets you can surmise was bad it is a ...\nAnd that all of a sudden they find the truth or a thousand last weekend that serve established the game's going to touch that\nBrings more balanced are there are guys with Clinton stores and as he could say just to get healthy\nAnd then their defense against the rent has been very ... the last three years I was led by Patti fishes so sports car that I think Alex heartbroken gonna have to play better I mean you go back to that game against Michigan I'm sure he'd love to get if he had that kind of performance that\nIt could be a costly last year was caused and he's going to rise to the rise to the gays or confidence uh I'm In north western ... very good\nLooking at the you mentioned Alex ... broken I've said it and I hate to make that comparison as ... people that are making a joke but he's a guy that's got a ton of talent he's shown an amazing amount of ability at times but it's almost like Jay Cutler he'll always give you a couple just bad decisions in\nIt jumped to the opponent to to to capitalize on it if they do it makes it extremely difficult in Wisconsin the if they don't\nThen Wisconsin remains in the driver's seat because he can make a lot of place\nYeah I think we'll learn that you can't be one dimensional right and every time\nA lesser nonetheless you're lucky you gotta have some valid and as you mentioned I just want a lot of games has been really good he was great I guess I was the second\nHalf but everything that said the court every uh every quarter back that space ... has looked pretty bad so far I think that's a blip on the radar I think he's poised to play well\nYou know they try to figure things out without court to see was a problem but I think now they're they're fighting played beggars Danny Davis gotta stepped up and plays well if he just made good decisions that got ballots run into football but you got to give up a Wisconsin a great opportunity to win the football game the\nOther area I'm concerned about outside ... is the past rushed they haven't been to the quarterback is all this and so if they can put some pressure on Clinton or make it uncomfortable in the ... step up and play a great game I fully expect Wisconsin away\nI'm looking at when you talk about two kinds of winning and being one dimensional Johnson Taylor seven games now with one hundred yards plus a at the beginning of the season he was one of those top two or three guys everybody's looking after the Heisman are they still looking for the Heisman\nProbably not and has nothing to do with his standing right at the top five of the things that are rushing the problem he has these quarterback that video game numbers I mean to enter the play the second half a replacement cuts that section Wayne Haskins got thirty five interception\nThe quarterback just playing at such a high level the numbers are just running away with it I made the whole thing is the youngest\nMayor but I'd be hard pressed to see anybody but a quarter back when the eyes of this year\nBy the way we're sitting here uh it's kinda chatting this morning we're Stanley Jackson bitten network analyst and looking at the Big Ten um who we keep waiting for a power to emerge whether it's Iowa whether to Nebraska I mean I think the Big Ten is better when you get in Nebraska back you know I Would full strength and really starting to make a national name for itself\nWhere are those programs I mean I Know I was more advances should he get Eighteenth and the country but we're is new brass can wear is Illinois you know get programs like that didn't really I think the Big Ten needs to bring the bottom up\nNebraska is a good hands it was a total ...\nThey're the most exciting one in six football team at a country they've got a young quarterback that is really good and he didn't want to know her thing Scott from us knows what he has to do to get that the on the right track and see what they've been able to do last few weeks of scoring points\nThey just got to get the black shirts back in ... so I think very good shape as as far as having finished a full year when I look at it and I think my expenses filing for about another very young team but they're more competitive this you know it's not good with they've got conference when\nI've really blew the west is you know the teams in the west they haven't been there the last few years are on track now and Purdue is the thing that you have to look out for it they had to keep Jeff ... about the disease and the job he's done is they've played makers got quarterback but playing well\nNot taking the because you see the west you know ... some of the cities that have been to a pretty good\nThe one team that I still think can really rising give or the Big Ten additional prominence not that they haven't already with Penn State sitting number Seventeen in the country they take on number Eighteen Iowa then number five Michigan then number twenty Wisconsin if they win those three games man Penn State will have survived\nA a tough row before they get Rutgers Maryland to call ... make it ended up winning as being an east before it's all said and done where\nThey could I mean they would need some help and they did get some property regard\nBut you know Mitch ... macabre risking your privacy we're Ohio State and I don't know how to figure out what

far\nIt is kicking off tonight no doubt and a lot of people talking about this weekend a specifically here because the Packers are on the road out in LA and we'll get to that coming up here in\nJust a little bit but a good DACA games coming up again this week some boys some\nSome surprises last week I mean we were looking at the Kansas City games on it that would be a great match between these two T I don't think anybody expected Cincinnati to win 'cause their record in primetime terrible but they got completely waxed and uh they they blew that spread all of a hell of parts give me a couple of blocks this week some things that you're thinking they're just going to pan out\n[noise] sure well I think there is to Cairo bears\nAgainst the New York yet I I don't think that game is going to be particularly close to Chicago had some\nSome top gained the weight but I think you know or at home against the get in that kind of you know myth and some of the ... now we've got ... on the injury report with the ankle so I think the uh the fare can handle it yet at seven and a half and I think the Indianapolis Colts\nAre there on the road you don't usually like taking a short road favorite but I actually think the French should be\nA a little larger for Indianapolis do I get Oprah and I think their morale is down an open ended the bottom line is open process very talented to begin with and now they have continued to lose talent um you know with a mark Hooper in addition to clear back\nIn and those guys and so I think Indianapolis we grew up playing the way it is really ... and modeling that given them a whole another element in the back you know it's going to be able to to have their way would open the fat\nIn other big game coming up Cleveland and Pittsburgh play do a tie when they were playing in Cleveland ah I think Pittsburgh's given seven seven and a half or something like that in this ball game but Cleveland looks will be a little bit different team now bigger maybe you don't\n[noise] yeah they they do like a different game Iraq they were just wasn't getting it done with all the way through any path to the outside and not really seeing anything over the middle but if you look at this game is there actually is that some sharp report on Pittsburgh the wide open at seven it's been set up to eight\nMichael's here yesterday scores tomorrow scheduled to today's opinion everyday hug Thirteen twenty W F a jar\n[noise] ...\nBetter yeah we're gonna have to play a lot better than we have to [noise]\nSo when those games this is a foreign stretching RC\nYou're not going to say it's going to define are seizing but it's definitely gonna check things out when we got on the other side as we get back home and a six week someone where we're at in the race and\nAnd the world where we were playing [noise] I Know\nHe says it won't to find their season [noise]\nUm I [noise]\nThe last day say winning in LA [noise]\nLosing New England [noise] went against Miami in Seattle lose against Minnesota [noise]\nYou know I [noise]\n'cause you don't know what to make of it are they a good team or the team that is right there with everybody else [noise]\nTry beating the teams they should be put struggled with the teams are considered some of the top top notch teams 'cause then okay you know a lot of teams do that [noise]\nBut this I Believe will be a defining stretch for the Green Bay Packers as they get ready to embark on a west coast trip but it it's not easy uh I Can't remember a time I I don't know the last time the Packers had to go west coast then to the east coast then home than back to the west coast on a Thursday\nAnd then run another gauntlet where they have to go to um a division rival on the road for five on the road and three out of those five or on the coasts so just a lot of frequent flyer miles for the Green Bay Packers\nUm ... there was a I don't know if it was the chargers\nThe chargers at one point\nOne year I thought the chargers had to go to Miami and play at home than go to New England play at home\nThan they were like on the road against the jets and then the giants and then back at home it's like they they were actually charting their frequent flyer miles because of all the miles a day traveled so I I think it was the chargers that had that schedule I I Can't I Can't remember a schedule that so back and forth like that probably since then I remember and twenty\nFifteen Percent of the year the Packers that back to back games in Oakland and then in ... Arizona that I remember yeah yeah\nI remember when they beat Arizona to get the postseason then had to go back to Arizona the next week 'cause I I stayed in Arizona I just stay behind I was living in Arizona for the week and covered the cardinals and [noise]\nAnd ah Kurt Warner and everybody that was a hell of a team to man and that was a lot of fun to cover they got a terrific practice facility but their practice facilities not even near University of Phoenix stadium it's complete it's down in Tempe it's down near ah\nArizona State university which you don't mind you don't mind walk around campus campus is a terrific place but that's the that's the place where I turned the corner and I thought it was a bar restaurant and walked into one adult store 'cause it's just a big giant building I thought it was a bar\nAnd you know the\nBar was behind the adult store because I just wanted to burgers burgers on sale sign right out front I Can't remember the name of the place was a long time I have\nA eight five five eight three ... three zero eight five three zero eight six where did you want to chime in feel free to do so Aaron Rodgers speaking to a meeting yesterday a wide uh you know he's been saying all along he wants to play without that knee brace against the rams\nWere will say I mean It's Tuesday the day which is already there three hours a day [noise] you know to practice and more of a grown\nMan he was asked will he be able to shed that knee brace if it's not this week at sometime soon\nI mean if I'm completely ill they'll need or wherever it a more comfortable without it obviously\nHaven't dealt with a knee injury for much of my football life\nAnd he's right remember he had torn ACL at one point never told anybody got fixed after a season going back to college I think there was when he was playing a calorie Butte you'd community college one of the two we play the entire season with a torn ACL\nUm he's had some injuries like that before um then the question obviously and how you can almost predict the answer by asking the question but did the by coming a good time for him to kind of rehab that neat\nYeah I mean it's it was great to buy came at a good time obviously a little different because we played Monday Night instead of\nRegular said Sunday noon game is a different type of schedule but um yeah I was a great week a lesser relaxing and uh [noise] you know everything that we're dealing with you know the the knee is an issue but we have other bumps and breathe that aren't on the injury of pork as they're not significant enough that it helps\nThe week on those things are\nAlso he's he was asked will he at least try to test former you know Packers cornerback Sam Shields and now with the rams\nI'm Sorry I don't know I Love love competing against Sam have for many years in practice or you know in pretty well you know that's pretty well also I mean he's a fantastic player I'm just came out that some during his time away after the injury in Jacksonville [noise]\nUh this is what he wanted you know he wanted to come back and ones that come back here [noise] but I'm I'm happy he's playing them happy families are eighty seven no issues with his head [noise]\nThat's the guy was a great teammate for US Senate have time for a number of years starting with his intersection and the NFC championship game and continuing on to the number of great places he made over the years it's been fun to be the maid and now to watch 'em back in the late\nWell here's the question now I mean that's just the watching him back in the league but are are you surprised that he is back in the week\nI'm not because I think he's a fantastic player I'm just like guys we've had over the years term on 'em and Charles and guys you got to learn under he's got a tremendous approach [noise] and um you kinda say then repeat that about different guys because it's not\nThe standard you know there's there's guys who have good approaches and then there's guys like\nTrials in Vermont and Sam were able to stick around for a long time because they understand really what it takes theoretically every week and the fans I kinda got these fantastic uh athlete\nI mean it's extremely well get their news that they think about their land and money that gave me play at home when he ran down now who they are Jones was one of the most athletic ways [noise] um you know other than that Collins is a fat guy on the field and I'd love to see those guys raised their prime but uh but I'm happy for Sam\nBeing out there and he's a town of ... surprised to find\nNow when you look at the off engineering Rogers coming back and getting healthy obviously that's that's that's huge news\nBut what we found while rental car was down ... down\nAnd even with Jimmy Graham not being a one hundred percent of the the ... the low the workload then started to shift to some of the younger guys equity new St brown mark was scaling so when you look at these guys I really feel good about the wide receiving corps moving forward I unless there's massive injuries cross your fingers knock on wood\nI really think this is a very high end quality wide receiving corps I just do they found a really good finding that couldn't emu St brown mark was Valdez gambling\nIs only going to get better and he's just good he's just a good way to the one thing I said at the beginning of the season before training camp even started when you've got a chance to meet these guys I said do you watch 'em because you'd gotten bigger\nAnd they are faster but you've gotten height you got matchups now\nAnd that's what the Packers wanted I think they're really good with the emergence of these these young wide receivers which is fantastic how good is it going to be though to add carbon Alison back to the\n... yeah be great I mean obviously he's around them all\nHad a great start the season rentals well in a nagging injuries that kept him out of thin tough on them but they've been great teammates them in the room when I was guys are you ready and I'm I'm really proud of a of a few in an empty ask her are stepping up and making some big time place you know that that's\nAll we need them to do and just step and like they did especially queuing it lasts a drive to the plate of food is really into\nA lot more manageable Phil do range was a fantastic catch I felt great about the ball in the field I watched it back I realize what a fantastic catch it was I mean it was a big time flavor guy hadn't got a target [noise]\nUh up until that point and the games to stay locked in like that to get a great really stop lying to make the play was a you know I wanted to play the game\nOr he also talks about the first game back in LA and the coliseum since he uh one one there when he was playing with cow really\nYeah I mean I played one time in college um we had\nYou know some success up until the last couple of drives um I remember the atmosphere being electric obviously we were at top ten team they were number one team in the country\nHas a fun day until the ending yeah I mean that's a great stadium you think about all the different things that have gone on there over the years from LA playing there\nFor a while and the Olympics and you know it's a great venue and it'll be fun to get back there\nNow you got to go back yeah it's fun to get back to what you got to go back and face Erin Donald and that is Russia the rams have mental man\nYou got to be aware of where is that um and he's one of the more dominant player has seen a number of years\nI'm an indicator of that with the future hall of famer right next to him um who can who can dominate the game as well and has since his first airplane [noise] so it's it's\nWell coached on both sides of ball players wave number of times it's fantastic oh too and I would see Sean has done a great job but they're all fence so we got to find a way to slow them down in front and and a complete pass on the outside on the wall and keep it away from the\nYou talk about different I mean that Rutgers stadium it's just sort of sleepy and I'm ... I I don't know it seems the plane\nDown to some competition this year in I guess they should be and then they've been playing you know they had a Seventy nothing lead on Michigan and you know we all saw Wisconsin played against Michigan that's a pretty impressive that northwestern had that lead and that was a home game it just\nThey play pretty well in that game they just couldn't really hang on so I I Would expect closer to that kind of game then went on whatever happened to get to get Akron they're gonna they're\nGonna rise up it's like this case but scheduled circled other schedule all year they\nIt it's no secret that the big than what kind of goes through Wisconsin you have to beat the badgers and I think that something to do with why they they really weren't all that up to play against Rutgers last week so it's gonna be a big one I I I feel pretty confident they're going to\nAnd it'll be it'll be a I I think an outstanding football game\nOr the badgers obviously want to come down and they want to control the clock control the line of scrimmage they want to run a lot with ... and Taylor tell me about the run stopping capability northwestern\nYeah pretty good overall um probably better than\nA even look at the numbers and honestly I don't have that in front of me right now where the exactly they rank but they can stop the run and I and I think the game plan\nFor beating Wisconsin is a pretty obvious at this point you stop there on first and you you try to make out already broadcast the beat you and I sometimes he does more times than not eat eat thousand so uh I I ate magic that will be what northwestern trying to do slow down John and Taylor\nOr you know forced out already broken it's tough third in lungs and if you can do that that's where you start to create some takeaways and ah you know northwestern is out of the type of team that huge on time of possession they they typically like the go quickly on all science but\nYeah this is one of those games where you you don't want to let Wisconsin grind out the clock the entire time because that's how they beat opponents and and uh that will certainly be what they're trying to do on Saturday\nLooking at this north western team um they have been in some close games where they will pull them out I mean has this galvanized ... sometimes when you playing these close games you figure out what you do when consistently even though you're behind and and do they always continuously pose a threat leading ball games because they just figured it out\nWell they've certainly played really tight games over the last few years and ... and a lot of times in college football what happens in previous years doesn't really matter because the team is different but in North western's case\nThey have a starting quarterback that started a forty five games in a row now in Clinton ... he's been around for a long time\nAnd and when your quarterback is the guy that's been and all these close games to me that matters that carries over from season to season this is a team that won three straight games in overtime last year at one point they had one overtime game against Nebraska a couple of weeks ago and I really felt like that experience helped them in that type of game now\nYou'd ever want to be downtown in the situation they were in late in the game kind of needed a miracle to beat a team that had won a game yet this year but they pulled it out there and so I Do think that they\nThey have the confidence that no matter who the opponent is if they're in a tight game they can pull it out but I think it's a great question bill and I think that if this is a close game\nUm you know north of Wisconsin you can't just feel like oh well all lined up and we have the bigger guys and it will pull out because north western has experienced the winning those types of game\nWell that was gonna be my question because right now you've got the ... with a bang up secondary sources and who's been through been there done that and really doesn't have a problem trying to win his way down the field especially leaving a ball game [noise]\nGotta be looking at this game is like you said Wisconsin usually wins in the trenches they usually beat you up up front with their secondary seems to be a little bit vulnerable right now right\n[laughter] yeah absolutely um and I ... it's been kind of interesting the last three weeks or so because North West or lost Jeremy lark and they're starting running back\nWho many thought was even more talented the justice Jackson who just left the program and that's saying that a lot because just Jackson or you know it is one of us running back is ever played at Northwestern but Jeremy Larkin was a really good player and he had to retire because of a a medical issue\nAnd they were scrambling to find any kind of running game and I'll tell you what\nThey basically abandoned it they said\nWell they don't have a running games but we have a\nSenior quarterback that's been around for a long time that a lot of NFL scouts are still interested in because he's six for it's got the NFL's side then he's got a big are let's see if this kid couldn't figure it out and carry the team and he had\nHe has quote this off and on his right arm and played very very well the last few weeks and that started at Michigan State a few weeks ago and they got that big win in East Lansing so um you know if we're looking at that match up\nHave to imagine that authentically northwestern is going to try to take advantage of those young guys in Wisconsin secondary because Clinton tourist and have the talent in the experience or to take advantage of that kind of match up\nLooking at this game moving forward or you know what the new northwestern can pull this off this then change some of the expectations of their season\nYeah and it's funny because this happened last year or two they ... they started slow in September and then they rattled off eight straight wins\nThey won ten game there was an outstanding seats that\nAre they also have a six game a road winning streak in the Big Ten which doesn't apply to this game but it's pretty impressive I mean how many times you go on the road six times in a row in the Big Ten and when so they're they're pretty good at and I I don't know why they have been struggling in September and the last few years\nBut I hate to just say oh game but losing the Akron does this matter it's certainly don't want to lose\nAt home but they actually came up with three defensive touchdowns enough the sort of a flu the second half\nI think this is a better football team that what we saw temper and so it would not shocked if they they beat Wisconsin Saturday and then all of a sudden\nYour whole season's kinda riding on a beat in Iowa and if you do that you're at the big tent championship game now you're you're getting out of yourself they're thinking about that but that's what these this team's goal is when the Big Ten west\nThen when the big tent that when your bowl game and all those goals and that's what path Fitzgerald has been emphasizing and his team even though they lost and soft games early they're still out there they could still accomplish all their goals the season and that's why they make this sort\nOf a dangerous situation for Wisconsin walk into an eleven AM games at rice field on Saturday\nDone without 'em whole WGN Radio in Chicago signed my reporter for the northwestern Wildcats a ... I'm a statistical kind of guy sometimes and other times I'm not because they like to go by gut feeling but I at Northwestern is one eleven or twelve Big Ten games for the second time ever\nAnd\nI I just I Can't help\nBut think you know some of these games that they lost the to do in Akron and stuff it's kind of like they were just kind of like yawning through it and said okay let's get ready for the Big Ten and then the gear for the Big Ten getting teams there in Evansville, Illinois seems to be where they love me just like little ... them into almost asleep especially my God if it's a cloudy day early in the morning everybody's yawning when it come out of the damn tunnel\nSo this is a new playing well against the Big Ten it's migrating and I blew in teams away but like you said Fitzgerald certainly leaves the goals out in front of 'em and finds a way to motivate his team to say the the Big Ten is what it's all about\nWhat led the type of team that doesn't have the talent\nTo get away with not having their a game if that\nMakes sense I mean are counted they have plenty of talent but they don't have the type of talent where unless you're played Rutgers like last week Rutgers might be the worst team in college football so\nIt you know kind of Fitzgerald actually called that their game last week and they still managed to win but I think that's sort of the exception last week they have to bring their a game and I and I think you're right in that\nThey sort of\nDidn't bring it early in the air against Duke and ... and uh even against the brass to some extent though like turn it out late\nShow but when the Michigan came to town and that place was sold out and it was a great atmosphere they played pretty well they just lost to a better team and you know Wisconsin probably feels like they're better teams\nAcross the roster they probably are how why what northwestern is good enough that if they bring their a game and they get up for this one and I know they will just because there's been so much emphasis on winning the Big Ten west first and foremost and they get Wisconsin and they're building this time uh I I think it's a tricky situation for the badgers\nGood stuff is great to talk to you Adam I certainly appreciate it should be a lot of fun to watch ... and enjoy the game okay are they they'll\nTell you to talk to you soon they go out I'm home he's WGN Radio in Chicago cyanide reporter for the northwestern Wildcats is ready to host the Wisconsin Badgers and\nI I ... that he be GB feeling about this game and the badgers and they need this one big time to get a window down their granted it should be considered somewhat of an inferior opponent but to win there a place that has been the bugaboo for this team would be big and they need a big time\nUh we are they going to take a quick break come back we'll talk some more football this time of the state of Wisconsin whitewater football head coach Kevin ... can be joining us coming up next

last year I mean that it's totally gone these players have\nA clear goal in mind they know exactly what is being asked to them and there is no hesitation and from player one through nine I mean it's incredible the night and day difference I think Jason Kidd black of\nEvolving to this modern MBA is what hurt him mhm wouldn't make any changes and then one more point I Believe it was last season you had Malcolm Brockton on it was either in the Malacca or Milwaukee basketball or right\nAnd he and he brought up how defense kind of lead them to better off in the state of the opposite I Want to see that like can you believe that when they got going off in their defense picked it up correct and I think he hit the nail on the head yeah you watch this game they'll they'll\nCome down the court a couple of wide open more bang bang or you know they got to be on top of the key on the other teams pressing it's it's incredible jump right\nIn the different than it's really exciting to watch\nIt has been a ton of fun to watch them\nUm to to watch the way they play and to watch confidence built I guess that might be the biggest to appreciate the phone call that might be the biggest aspect to all of this is the fact that they have this level of confidence right now and you could just see that exude it right now it just it\nYou every time they are the three you get a brook Lopez shooting at three John engineering it's really not your normal shooters draining a three to place goes nuts it just now granted they got to be able to do that on the road and manufacture that same level of energy but\nIt is a each to say the very least it's been extremely fun to watch no doubt about it or what to do this let's give it to a time for a buyer so [noise]\nIn the world of sports a lot of people say

a different level of different style of play to the table so [noise] uh I think we can all see we're enjoying what we're seeing I think we can all say that it's a good basketball team talent why are they Still Peace or two away for maybe being the championship contender we think they should be probably [noise]\nBut for the most part I mean I'm [noise] I'm excited about all of this I I feel really

had some fantastic game [noise]\nIt's hard for me to say no he hasn't played a great game yet but I think he's had some fantastic games\nI'm excited about what he's doing I look I I don't need him to play a great game in a sense of dropping forty or drop and fifty and [noise]\nAnd just smoke and the rest of the rest of the field what I Need out of him is kind of what he's given yet he's a leader he's determined he's feeling good about the situation [noise]\nHe said most of the most is if you have a lot of fun right now playing basketball so [noise]\nI'm [noise] I'm perfectly fine with what he has going on I I'm I'm I'm good with that [noise] so\n[noise] I [noise]\nAnd it's hard for me to say I need a great game out of your honest when everybody else is contributing when you need a great game ... is one your teams down nobody's hitting and suddenly he drops forty and gives you that triple double buddies that we've become accustomed to that when you're getting a great game out on a show going back to your question\n[noise] have we [noise]\nHad he not played a great game he is played great basketball he's mean compared to LeBron James so yes he's played great basketball 'cause he giving you that spectacular oh my God game yet no we haven't seen the honest evaporates and [noise]\nBy force sell\nMore three pointers and less defense will not hurt the NBA won't hurt a bit won't
