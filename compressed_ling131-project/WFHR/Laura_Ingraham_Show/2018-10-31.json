three remaining players three remaining contributing Packers on the roster right now from the two thousand Thirteen two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and Fifteen draft classes\nFor the Green Bay Packers and you talk about a draft and develop team where you bring in guys you hang on to him you retain those that are good\nIf that's the case three guys in three years have remained with the Green Bay Packers that is\nAlmost unforgivable let's get back to the phone calls talking to mark was he was in his corner mark how ya doing what's going on\nAppreciate your rundown Packers drafted I think about the team are playing the New England patriots who've had a great quarterback because they will have a number of veterans trade infringing on their roster this week\nIt went down all the failures with the draft we have one veteran that our former general manager to pass on this current roster through free trade that Lance Kendrick\nTerrible half of his tenure pre Super Bowl poster will ten almost like I don't know if it does seem like ten Schneider left or something else going on there and has covered up for them for years\nAnd I hope everyone is starting to find out\nAppreciate the phone call Ted uh in his last few years um yeah it just wasn't\nDidn't didn't didn't benefit the team too much I mean that's that's\nThat's what it is I mean they keep David back to you already from two thousand and Thirteen as I mentioned uh two thousand and fourteen or divine to Adams according to ... and nobody remaining on his team from two thousand and fifty\nTwo dollars and fifty you'd have Jake Ryan but we're talking about a contributing roster player at this point Jack Ryan is injured\nBut that's it and it's all his left and [laughter]\nLike I said when you're a draft undeveloped team and it just that's the bottom line you know that that's your that's your that's your blood\nA brand listening to a surgeon base it based on what you've seen how do you think John Jones will do the safety does he have those for the football as you could tackle or and do you think of your mind is a big enough to play safety or is that not an issue a traumatic played safety and patent system in Cleveland now doesn't make him big enough to play at a he's a smaller guy\nBut he's got the knowledge to do it okay uh as far as what I've seen other Josh Jones\nHe's played said he's got his nose in there and he's a hit or he's a he's a line of scrimmage guy it's when they put him in a secondary and ask him to start roaming or are you putting them in coverage on certain players in certain situations that he really struggled uh as far as the nose with a football the good tackle or good hitter yeah but he's he's\nThe question is not as physical ability the question has been as mental ability to be able to grasp it so\nIf that's the direction you're going to go you've got to feel pretty good that he's at least now grasp the system so we'll we'll see a it's also the timing of it when you're talking about the bill Bella jak are getting ready for a secondary of my pet and\nHe's probably gonna look at some old tape put your mind Williams playing safety from Cleveland he's probably going to look at some tape of Josh Jones from last year and when he can do\nAnd then as far as the rest goes you wait and see you know you don't know what they're gonna throw out there just yet to go to Steve listening to us at ... Shaw Steve how you doing today man what's going on\nI Will feel sometimes to like\nYou know I couldn't agree with you more on on a terrible track record of ah the Packers of lake and sometimes it's also the players that you pass up in the draft and you're picking somebody else I'll give you a microcosm of at two thousand six to draft second round\nThey traded down and get the spring I think they come down six seven flat they gave up even a couple of extra draft choices could do it I get that gift and who did they have\nNo they jumped up to get him they went up to get traded up all night at him\nBy down I met yeah you're right I meant going down a number of them and the draft you're right they they they have\nBecause he was the second round draft choice that year and jump right behind kinda Clark yeah\nAnd so they they gave up draft choices to do it and who did they skip over in that and then he couldn't hit the on Jones middle linebacker for three speed I Believe he was an all American he plays for Atlanta I think he's led Atlanta two years and tackle\n... and\nThe kind of element recording it was down there the fences is middle linebacker that can go from sideline to sideline and any hits within pat and there you go there yet classic example of who you had to get a\nWould not vigorously oppose that case a particular given my background but I Would give ... a slight not I put Lombardi too and I would put Paul Brown at three\nSo when you look at um Bill Bill a check and I obviously the package getting ready to take him on this weekend but when you look at Bill Belichick what makes him different from every other coach\nI think uh obviously when you start with Tom Brady arguably the greatest football player ever\nHe didn't get a little lucky with him picking them a hundred and Ninety ninth and ... and the two thousand trapped it's interesting that bart star was taken two hundred and his draft and he won five championships Tom Brady was taking a hundred and Ninety ninth and he won five\nI think you have to start there so uh but he didn't pick Brady and nobody else did you give them credit for that\nAnd I I Do think that ballot check out details out works everybody he practices situational football more than anybody and I interviewed more than three hundred and fifty people for this book\nAnd some ex players who had gone other programs and said what we did in practice in New England we don't do those things are we ... I didn't experience that with other coaches and other teams\nAnd entered practice session if you don't perfect it\nYou don't move on to that next apart a practice by the schedule and I talked to many parties is said and other organizations you did\nAnd so I think having the greatest quarterback ever and as the work ethic it's situational football the extreme\nSignificance he puts on special teams a lot of coaches talk about special teams being as important as often some defense bill actually means and lives it I think when you put all that together and the fact that he's a better motivator behind closed doors one on one in his office he's a lot more human than he comes across in his news conference I'm not\nGoing to say he's a lumbar T level motivator but he's\nProbably under rated in that regard when you put all that together I think that adds up to the five championships in the fifteenth division titles\nKind of senior writer for ESPN wrote the book villain shut the making of the greatest football coach of all time\nUm each interesting because when I mean it's just you know from our own experience or your Mike mccarthy talking about running a couple of times and then let's go in and study it\nAnd look at it on film and see what it is you're doing and what you're not doing them would go back out tomorrow and we're trying to do a better word is Bill Bill in the news very much on ... you're going to do what do you get it right and you're going to you're going to strive for perfection\nKnowing that excellence is merely achievable so in that realm\nYou guys said well they don't have fun ... it's it's it's like you know it's like a camp a bad camping show but guys go there because they know they're going to win is that the trade off so you're not going to have fun but you're going to win championships\nYeah I and I think that that's a good question it's very good question though I think\nThat uh for the most part you don't have a whole lot of fun there but winning is fun and and that's the fun and and they'll do on the other hand Gronkowski has been allowed to have his personality and to do things away from the facility whether it's WWE or or whatever he gets involved with and I don't think\nBill a really suffocate him he seems to be having an awful lot of fun\nAnd and I would say last year for the first time really Brady didn't have fun I think before last year where his relationship with ballots really unraveled at least temporarily\nAnd I think part of that was just the unrelenting style of coaching for Eighteen years just finally war him down among other things the ... situation also the bench Malcolm Butler really angered him and other patriots and the super bowl\nBut I think that that is the tradeoff that ballot check the one thing about him and I don't know if somebody was this way and practice chicken is not a screamer he's not a greater\nAnd when you watch and I I really appreciate that part of his coaching style but in a film room in a meeting room he will cut you and a half with sarcasm\nAnd pointing out mistakes on films not really with the volume but Jess with that dry wit and sarcasm and he ... he does it the Brady all the time in front of\nThe entire team and and the messages sent to people at the bottom of the roster if I'm going to hold maybe the greatest quarterback of all time to this level of accountability that I'm going to hold you to that same level and I do think that the reason why he has basically maintain the dynasty since two thousand one\nNow you're talking about a Tom Brady is Tom Brady greatest quarterback because Bill Bill jak or what have you been great in any system\nI think he was going to be great five championships great probably not with another coach I I I sort of believe that ballot chicken Brady\nAre worth one title apiece let's say Brady ended up with a a good coach but not a great coach I think he's going to find a way to win that good coach one or two titles\nAnd I feel ballot chicken if he had a a quarterback who's not Tom Brady that may be at the level of say a joke Flaco or Russell Wilson or Philip Rivers I think he's worth an extra ring to players like that if he had our Rogers and I wrote about this today for ESPN dot com that to me it's fascinating because\nRogers is probably the most talented\nPerson ever play that position what do you have only one rang with Bill dollar check in that system I don't think so I think he'd have more than I probably have three at this point\nBrady had three through his first ten seasons as a starter and I think that's where Rogers is in his career right now I I imagine he'd have two or three with ballot check so\nUh that's the fascinating thing too when you look at this matchup who do you think is really\nThe greatest quarterback and is it team accomplishment which you'd give certainly the not the Brady with the five rings or is it just physical ability I think the two most talented people ever to play quarterback or John Elway and Aaron Rodgers and and Rogers I'd probably give the edge too\nSo uh it would be fascinating to see Rogers in that system and went bell checked would do with them obviously we're never going to find out but ah I think he's done okay uh with the and and really a ... and the other thing is being in that iconic franchise I think that means a lot and and so Rogers has been pretty lucky himself\nKnew what do you let me ask you this because you have had a chance to see what is considered to be one of the ... time\nGive me your perspective on where Mike mccarthy is because as you say he's got one Super Bowl he's been the foreign and see championship games he was there one with red farm in ... and three others with Aaron Rodgers ... and the coaching room so to speak\nThat's a it's a good question because you look at his record and he's got to be what about fifty games over five hundred and he's won a Super Bowl and he's regularly in the playoffs he presided over Fifteen in one season and to me\nThat's the championship he let get away I was at that game when they lost to the giants at limbo the nine and seven giants the Packers were the better team at Fifteen and won that team should have won a second championship in a row and\nGet away they don't even want a playoff game so he's got a little bit of a mixed bag of a record but certainly he's in the top ten coaches in the NFL if not a little bit higher than that\nBut it'll be interesting to see if the Packers missed the playoffs this year what becomes of him I think if he is is fired somebody is going to hire him right away just based on his record\nAnd if you're going to get Vince Lombardi credit for what he did with bart star and I'm going to credit for what he did with Brett Farr I think you have to give\nMcCarthy some credit for the development of our Rogers and and Rogers is an extreme talent but he's coached them to a very good record a championship\nAnd then some missed opportunity so it is a bit of a mixed bag but I I Would say McCarthy is one of the better coaches in the NFL I don't know ultimately that's going to be good enough\nGrades stuff in the book is called the village check the making of the greatest football coach of all time one more thing real quick before I let you go when it comes to scheming and against an opponent now one thing to do things to perfection is another thing to be able to always create that wrinkle tell me about Bill Belichick mind in a minute or less\nHe's always bill looking to take away your best weapon and he's done that in Super Bowls he did it the first Super Bowl victory over the rams he told actually Chris Berman at a private meeting before that game Marshall Fox will not beat us in this game so\nI don't know what he's going to do with our Rogers on Sunday night it's certainly easier said than done but he does like to identify the thing you like to do that and I'm going to take that away from you and then if you beat me fine but you're not going to beat me with your strength\nAnd I think that is the essence of how bill approaches again\nGreat shop and I certainly appreciate your time and we'll talk suit okay thanks for the opportunity\nAbsolutely thanks so much there you go to Ian O'Connor a senior writer for ESPN dot com author of belly check the making of the greatest football coach of all time\nYou can find it pretty much anywhere at this point in time but it's a terrific insight into Bill Belichick and what it is that he does may be different than what uh will say other coaches do

what he had to say\nMorning thanks for coming I'm just a quick uh some thoughts on on\nBoth ... anti before we get going obviously those guys and buy a nice job or so in the past a contributing to our team um our locker room and also in the community so just kind of want to thank those guys for all their contributions and I'm I'm wish them well and their new their new spots [noise]\nWas it\n\nSo that you take everything into consideration when you make these kinds of decisions on the performance comes first that's always kind of the major factor in these decisions um but everything is taken into account and um but it's never usually just one thing\nAre you better\n\nI I think I'm really excited about our team I'm really looking forward to what's coming up I think we're home and it just the right time we got some challenges ahead of us but I'm I'm really excited about where this team said\nYou've got to be starting state [noise] start\nYeah obviously a very good player um but we have a lot of bodies that um I've been itching to get out there a lot of guys that are having their opportunities yet and um I think they're really excited and then and I as a modest you what they can do\n\nI don't necessarily think that there's a message that a sense of the locker room I think that um\nYou know I'm I think that's been the decisions that we make um probably isn't the best interest of our team's not only in the short term but in the long term as well um but I think our our locker room knows where we're headed in a you know I think like I said I think we're ... at the right time and I think there's a lot of positive things going forward\nThey handle all aspects of the publishing process for you printing ... publicity copyright an editing got eight hundred five zero one thirty

to the media and he's excited about his team [noise] belt where they're going the franchise the direction in which they're headed\n[noise]\nNow we'll see see what happens is yesterday deals roommate\n[noise] now find out [noise] what are they got\nThis team a as she said a humming along or is there a is there something else eight five five eight three zero eight six four eighty five five eight three zero eight six for eight if you want to chime in feel free to shall we would love to hear from you because the issues um\n[noise] this is um\nIt's kind of a turning point in this season we talked about this uh on Monday coming out of the game on Sunday that\nThere is a lot to this there's a lot of thought into well how do you take a do you take that laws as we just went toe to toe with the best team in the national football league type of laws and\nWe uh we ... pulled it off or do you take it as well we tried to beat the best evenly we can't do it uh we just touch a couple of players that have been a pretty pretty integral to our team and now we're kind of taking a step back and we're going to kind of reassess the situation just try to get\nThe season and then move on so we'll see uh give me your reaction eight five five eight three zero eight six forty five five eight three zero eight six Reuters portions of programming broad you buy friends had bought light fish will be responsible Michael sports talk now we're don't forget coming up this Thursday night ... pub and eat or you were going to be in West Alice going by and say Hi\nGoing to be hanging out there six to eight this Thursday night it's right across the street from the Wisconsin state fair park and it's all brought you buy a Bud Light the official beer sponsor\nMichael sports network floods rights and you have a mentioned this but to sit back and think how bad test rap or in two thousand Thirteen through two thousand Fifteen calling the ugly as being kind the rumors about his ability more true and why did Murphy stepping sooner I start to look at mark Murphy now and the competency and running this franchise um\n[noise] this one is from a mega brown who writes I'm concerned about the franchise I don't know of good against is the right guy for the job certainly add some pretty good draft choices this year cutting somebody mid season how good is that look if you are but now he says he's not into sending messages but clearly\nYou know otherwise you're trading guys were draft choices you're not getting better there in the right here in the right now\nThey're sending a message so you're basically saying look if you're going to talk about the franchise you're going to take things upon yourself a you're not going to be in the Green Bay Packer away\nThen we don't need you will do get a draft choice for you and we'll move on because they basically would have gotten about the same compensatory pick for Clinton decks just so you know a cause some people say well they could have got to hire drafted and it was going to be right around the fourth around\nIt was going to be right in there the um\nTo say that ah they wanted to time I got out of town and I think would be an understatement basically saying that they took a seventh or just anything you've got to give a couple of years down the road yeah that's why we just want him out that's what that came down to\nMe silver piece that we talked about the NFL dot com quoted not one or two or three accorded six ... six people between coaches and players\nAre about the state I'm I'm going to say mind maybe or at least the state of actions on the sideline in that ball game\nI'd like to say something in regards to the Mike Silver peace because I did see Mike Silver at the game on the field towards the end of the game or Peter King was hanging out as well so the way it worked a flows into novels in LA covering the game\n... this is like the weirdest thing ever because it was at the coliseum and it's older and stuff\nThey wouldn't let media people in the locker room\nSo what they did was they were bringing players out as they were exiting and they would you know pick certain players to come and talk with the media and then you talk with them in the tunnel essentially now I don't know if my silver had access inside the locker room I don't know if his was different but\nShe should have been out there with everyone else so there were only so many Packers that address the media is so I'd like to think that whoever we talk to Mike Silver also had the chance to talk to so I could read all through the list of players that address the media bill um\nBecause again we don't know who exactly talk to my silver what happened um\nBut I mean guys like divide the Adams talk Mason Crosby talked how Clinton decks talked you wonder Hochul\nIndex was the guy says something [noise] I don't know you know\nHad I don't know I was right there when I talked I did not see Mike Silver so maybe silver God how hot after he was done with us no idea no clue a Corey Lindley talked with the media a claim that these talk with the media model Williams\nA and he defended time a gum or a\nUm so so I don't know I don't know if my silver had some special access I mean I Know he works with the NFL so maybe he did but there were only so many guys that address the media after that game so I'd like to think\nMight have been one of those guys might have been one of those guys after they're done with us silver caught up with them and\nThey told them how they really felt about the situation\nYeah it's um we talked a little bit about it after the game especially when the peace started to come out that okay now now what now what do you do with guys speaking out like that so um it it it's just it's really interesting that guys took it upon themselves to look I\nYou know as as you know is it was stated even by the time a gum rate he understands you guys were pissed off\nI mean there there's there's nothing there there's there's nothing there that will be erroneous you know he knew the guys were were not happy with what had happened and he he just kept saying look I made a mistake and I don't\nKnow who is really pissed off after that game and I don't know if you guys were able to play this or not but Mike Daniels was just heat it after the game and he he\nMike Tyson and the fact that they can't find the right hand them on the road cynical knock 'em out Daniel's out of any of those guys after the game was really fired up now I'm not saying he's the one that was the anonymous player but he he was pissed\nMhm you know he didn't he didn't mince too many words put it that way\nI now I just I really watching that game yesterday\nThat defense that Packer defense kept the ramp scoreless for almost two full corners and you cut that off and you can only put up ten points when\nYou talk about unacceptable they had every chance to win that football game and they should have won that football game sure they look like they were the better team defense had ... that ... that was probably the best performance of the season if he asked me\nThat's the best performance was you know the defense in a long time [noise] man and they and they just didn't get it done unfortunately\nThey can't find a three zero eight six forty they'd probably buy a three zero eight six for a gives you shall we want to hear from you in a cage a west Alice what's going on man what's happening\nHey Bill thanks for taking my call bill I don't consider this a a retail I think it's more a\nA ... I think they're trying to get a real line that I found a real interesting uh that the level of accountability\nHas been heightened with a Brian ... because I'm not sure that a pet Thompson would've made these moves in the middle of the season ah you know and it's more of a dollar check in type move\nThere not been successful they can't do a Bill Belichick does because one they're probably taking over\nPretty crappy teams into there not be a dollar check he just has a way of doing it and he just does I mean I I\nI don't know if I could walk into a room and have a have a coach be that way and think anything more or less of them but Bill Belichick walks and you're like well that's Bill Belichick\nYou know what I mean I'm\nRobert tweets is Abdullah underscore Michael's you can do by the way uh you have to give it to GM don't or to just to meet the media after the trait that down to would not have done this they must feel that they can get along without high and eighty eight they definitely can get along without him a\nHim based on the usage that he's had his he's not time a government look then I'll go to two running backs they have to running back now that they have to deal with and you're right I mean one is your every day every down guy the next guy he's your he's your is your change up back\nYour mall Williams is your change up back that's what they're gonna run with\nThat's all they need\nYou just hope they both guys stay healthy but when it comes to um your safety position that's that's I like I said I mean they've got some some ability back they're drawing Williams he played the safety\nAnd my patent system in Cleveland for a little bit Josh Jackson can be converted safety from a from a corner that's more of a slide guy than he has to an outside guy a Josh Jones is still waiting in the wings he wants to play he's been outspoken about his usage and playing time he's about to get a whole big dose of it I think\nUm you still have raven green you still have your main why hasn't ahead and control Bryce\nNot saying that control price of the answer I'm just simply saying some of the body that you have back there but if you think about a secondary said trauma does go to said or say just Jones goes there and he's he excels way he hit a couple of years ago\nSay he goes there you've got your mind your ear and Kevin king would Josh Jackson as another slide guy would Josh Jones in either country will rise to remain Whitehead or whoever else they want to throw in there you've got a pretty good and athletic secondary now all of a sudden\nThey might concerned about uh not overly concerned to be honest not overly concerned you got a pretty good secondary still\nAnd again you're not going what no injuries that's what you're hoping for no injuries managed to get injuries boy than it then it\nUh then again then it can go south in a hurry ISIS from Kenny says they're speaking of comments I was wondering did you happen to see Mardi a Bennett's comments or a couple of days ago and how Green Bay is lucky to get anybody worth a damn as far as black athletes in Wisconsin because of the race to state including Green Bay I did Kenny and I know it was the topic of conversation\nBut take the source more jealousy Michael Bennet have been the Koreas for being wires and to twist things in their own way and to just be for lack of a better term character lists jackass is\nYou know I I don't care about what might tell us Bennett has\nTo say he's he's a loser he just is\nWatching the guy come into the system you really hoped but the fact that\nHe turned out to be what he was in in what everybody said he was he did the same thing in Chicago he did the same thing or early on in his career down in Dallas\nIt just he's he's he's a loser or tell us about it just is it Michael Bennet\nIs just as bad you go back to the videotape when he claimed he was profiled in Vegas and it could have been further from the truth you know so ... you know again videotape doesn't lie\nSo both of those guys are I I don't worry about either one of their comments\nAnd here's the thing if you dig and fight and get into an argument with them they're getting exactly what they want because then they can point the finger and say see soldiers up they hate me because I speak the truth they just they're idiots that's it [noise] um\nA five five eight three zero eight six for this one is from Alex and he writes ah do you really believes the Green Bay Packers are just retooling if you look at what's going on they jettison a lot of bad talent for some of the new talent you have to wait for all of that to start to come of age in the meantime you've got an aging quarterback who knows he's on the backside of his career\nAnd he probably wants to get out of Green Bay and do a better situation and do a better team he took the money and ran with it because he knows he's not going to get another ring as long as Mike mccarthy and bright good against is here we know the teams should be good in a couple of years but what about the hearing the now Packers fans are paying premium dollars\nFor the crap that they're putting on the field they can't win on the road they barely won at home they've got a quarterback who is ... ... they've got a quarterback who was acting option it towards his head coach at times\nAnd yet he wants to point the finger at other players to say don't do this but he does it all the time yes he has credibility yes he's a superstar\nBut he should lead by example I'm disenchanted with this franchise right now how many other fans do you think\nAre Alex uh you tell me I don't know I mean if you're out\nThere sitting in the bar stools are out there at your job today and I mean certainly there's people that are called this program that aren't thrilled with what's going on in Green Bay you think that maybe they've taken a step back or they're missing here\nI sometimes for the treaty grow you got to trim the bad branches and maybe that's what Brian good against is done trim the bad branches get rid of attitudes get everybody on the same page send a message and move forward as he put it he believes his team is now going to be coming along now we wait and see more yeah go ahead you\nWhile I was just going to say did you like the return that they got I mean a fourth round pick for high Clinton Dixon a seventh round or for time on camera for twenty twenty ... the fourth round there\nFor ... that was kind of expected that was kind of what you thought you'd get any way I guess a compensatory wise maybe up maybe down but you you kind of took a safety pick their ah for tie these wanted to get him out\nHe did they took a seventh rather what two years from now not next year within the Iranians want yeah yeah they basically said we'll take anything just give me a seventh round draft choice and let's get rid of this guy and and that's exactly what they did so uh I\nI it's more of the message are we just want to get you out of here I think more than anything that I think is is interesting um because they they they just wanted them gone\nThey just they just want him gone and and that's what they did and that's fine I mean if you wanted to go and that's fine if if if you feel that he was not conducive to your locker room then yeah you got to move on\nSo I Do I like what they got I Would have loved to see them get a starter\nBut they weren't going to for two guys that they just wanted to get rid of\nThey weren't going to a a five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five

season is a\nWell we knew the Boston Red Sox were good baseball team but we didn't know exactly how good and then obviously they go on and begin to run run the table and\nSure enough they knock off the LA Dodgers and a U.S they are now the world series champions of brewers getting back at it and hopefully making a run again next year they gotta they tell you what the brewers\nThey got a lot of good talent they got a lot of opportunity here are the window is pretty pretty pretty I don't want to say Brighton wide open because there's always a time limit but\nNevertheless there is still a good opportunity for the Milwaukee Brewers to make some may so let's talk more about it just shut down for the national baseball insider joining us on the nine or orange hotline Jeff how you doing buddy\nWhat's going on my friend however you Ben\nWell we're doing well wherever you know a few people kind of look in the news I guess might be the best way to build it as this team um didn't get to the ultimate goal but certainly played well enough and gave a lot of people a lot of optimism show a you know I mean there's going to be some changes are always in major league baseball and I don't know\nWhat I had an idea we should we should have played the first one we did in spring training\nWhich at first I Want to know the first segment you and I did okay\nWhen we talked about expectations and how all we were looking for was just progress and to say that at the end of the year the team was better than the team that started\nI Would say that kind of Fifteen [laughter] they accomplished their goal when you know you can say every year the goal is to win the world series yes all thirty teams say that every team in sports so that that's not that's not a that's a cliche\nThere was a realistic grow there there is new respect for David Stern that didn't exist in baseball and in the state of Wisconsin this year there is a new look there is a new reputation for Craig counsel\nWhereas he was one of the nondescript managers of this plethora of young managers that are coming in to the sport ... this has been well documented the brewers made a big time acquisition they made a big time free agent signing they spent money they have money to spend\nBecause they're not up against the luxury tax where you could say oh you want about the phraseology the word luxury tax really is a\nSalary cap no one's going over it any more so the fact of the matter is that I just think this franchise yes losing game seven stunk I get it I'm not saying I wanted the Dodgers by any dry the Dodgers have hung from their team\nBut the reality of it is is that there is a sense of pride for Milwaukee is one of the thriving baseball markets\nOut of thirty then it's actually actually thriving and many many of them are not\nShow is moving forward I mean first of all capping the seeds I mean the Boston Red Sox you know just off actually speaking that team just got done I don't know what else to say I mean that was a while there's one\nAh you know a Brody bandwagon and which is one of the weirdest situations in baseball for the bandwagon and the CIA agent who's now the general manager of the Mets\nMade a great point in saying that the trend in baseball now is paying guys for future performance not paying guys for past performance and it's a change in the philosophy so it's why Jake area and I didn't get sign until ten days before the season\nAnd if that is indeed the\nAnd this is how teams are going to be if I'm quitting Kurdish I stay with the Dodgers\nYou always going to say this clean courage than just remain\nI if I'm him you know if this was five years ago I think it's a guarantee he opt out even if he stays with the Dodgers I\nWould say he does like for example what ... did you see the bath you opted out but then resigned in like five minutes your\nEye that for Clinton Kurdish I Would have done but I think in the changing landscape it's a different world out there because now what you're doing if if the saber metric mentality is you sign for future performance not on past performance you're going to have another camp of big name guys that don't get side\nDo you think that we're looking at this off season again in talking about guys complaining that the salaries just aren't there and we're talking about you know the players association getting involved in all of this again\nWell ... this is what I can say about the theme of the world series 'cause you know I had the option to go to the Boston and I had a family commitment so I couldn't go and so I was I was texting a lot of media people you know what Scott about what the theme what's the what's the point you know could are still doing my commitments\nAnd I you know I just felt bad that I wasn't at these games\nAnd when the conversation was happening man for it was asking all kinds of reporters\nWhat do you knew about the attorneys that the union hired waning right you know like\n... what's what's the story with this new attorneys because don't forget Tony Clark is very different he's the head of the players association\nA he's very different than down here in the sense of number one he doesn't have a legal background so everything he has to to get across he has to do so through attorneys that he hires\nWhy during the year where they have that camp and all those an signed free agents do they hire a new crew of attorneys\nSure they're ... they're they're gearing up for a fight right\nAnd the thing that baseball see that the reason why I'm I'm typically are very union guy but the problem is and this is again this is part of the list of why I'm fearful that the sport is in a crisis is that I don't think the league is wrong\nWith the union fight is is they want guys to have you know ... defined roles and that starting pitchers get a certain salary and you're seeing a decline in those kinds of salaries JD Martinez chick area to like you saw\nThose kinds of deals and then there's the manager salaries that are getting decreased by night in jail article\nAnd if you notice we're not talking about any of that crap and we talk about about beyond field stuff this is off the field and behind the scenes and what I what I fear is that the unions going to ask baseball to go back in time and I think baseball's passed that\nIt's going to be an interesting combination several

to twenty eight second year player signs of the Packers practice squad and October night the originally signed by the bangles\nHasn't been directed free agent out of Texas a and M. I spend most of his rookie season on the Bengals practice squad was on injured reserved for the two thousand and Seventeen season and then we have to buy the bangles after a week two of the season

their name the bus reporter for the athletic he's coming up here in about a about seven minutes so hang in there for that it's going to Tony in Mount pleasant Tony how you doing that I Know what's going on\nShow defensively speak English team they push 'em it's not like you don't play so much of it but everything now is predicated upon that officers ...\n... it's a it's a really\nTough kind of thing to think about because if I Would call that same kind of idea and I'm like who knows where [noise] um\nI think he might do something at me because of you know there aren't the entirety\nOf his career back a ... people always him as an off at the LBJ and obviously you're seeing why ah but it deepens is water then great\nReally the entirety of his Atlanta Hawks tenure or the five years they were top five in the sense that this will be their top three\nIn the current events of the patients the as we said today though they are putting up a lot of point but who knows it's shocking to me that all they don't spend a lot of time on our fence and practices that need to go over and over again like they're drilling defense and they're trying to get as good as they had on the defensive and and that's where it's focused and I and I ...\nDue to a kind of what we think of power but events is really where he kind of hang does have\nThe uh the song maker keeping zone around and and not really kind of letting him go ... it did seem like maybe the beginning of the season they might maybe going a different direction because maker wasn't getting much playing time and he was kind of guy just kind of hanging out on the bench I Know it was certainly don't they're shooting threes I mean certainly become big believers in the sun maker experience\nI mean the tough part there is that you know we kind of heard from Bob that these are just\nSit at Don had a little bit of a little bit of an injury here and so you know he's just a healthy stride but you know if there's anyone else nothing down and down the range of going you know it was kind of hard to square up okay is it really the injury is rarely you're just not thinking bond is up and ready for that uh\nThat role and obviously he had a huge game on Monday and he played really well there and\nI'm curious to see kind of know what happens here because the ad and leave I'm Talking about before John Ensign shooting three now three now and uh for John Henson he is someone that\nCan find a way to affect shopped at the ...\nI was a guy that can be a little bit more of a room protector he doesn't have to be as far out as Don does when Don has been good sensory so when he's been switching and I'll probably end up a book really do and asking this year so it's really going to be on time to figure out how we can make an impact either off and that's in perfect as a\nKid that's been shooting the breeze pretty much since the time he got in the league and obviously Mike who knows is that in hanging in those days off the off I prefer that it's going to be about the defund birth I'll make it and whether or not he can make an impact on that\n[noise] what else do you see on this team right now they say no I don't want to say excite you but the fact that maybe the breath of fresh air has been has been lifted because we know we're ... holes were brought to the ... and I'm waiting for the first real controversial piece of not and not necessarily anything what's in the locker more I'm waiting for his\nWhen everybody should merge with you I mean obviously you're playing right now without a without Yon his and that's a little bit of a diversity but and and also you\nKnow when you hit a little bit of a losing streak I mean I Want to see how this team handles it the ban on the line of succession he only well what would you ever done in the past by the way but I Want to see what they do when they do have a little bit of a diversity\nYeah I mean I think that's going to be the big thing is that you look at that started lined up and up\nEvery player in the starting lineup except the honest is planning for a contract for next year you know you look at Chris metal and you look at Malcolm rock and are you looking at it but don't you look at broke up as all four of those guys are probably for contract for next year so if the team's winning and they're getting from shops and they're putting up the numbers\nObey wide that can work right everyone can be happy and can be excited by everything's going on but if all of a sudden you lose a couple of games and all of a sudden you're trying to figure out\nOkay how does this exactly work like what what are we doing now that we're losing\nI Need more shops or I Do that we can win games that I get more shops belt if there is controversy a kind of looming often the distance I think that this is that\nYou know when things started to go wrong does it become time for this is my shall I gotta get my money how is this going to work at we haven't seen that are far and I would say that if you worked at ... and I don't put the numbers I think everyone gets paid but at the same time they're things start to go south you lose a\nCouple of games well then you know maybe you don't trust the system so much so I Would agree with you but I I think that's when it's really become interests with escape\n[noise] what do you see with food and homes or that I'm ... and the way he instructs because what I said yesterday I said look\nYou can't throw everything out from Jason Kidd Jason Kidd wanted to play defense you want to play the fundamentals he wanted to instill that because that's when you play and everybody can't teach the way they played because of the guys great it's very hard to tease guys would be great however what I Want to see is or what I have seen the news I guess the\nAh the byproduct of Jason Kidd were guys do at times play defense they do play fundamental but now they're just being able to go out and have fun and play basketball not a good way to put it\nI I think that it is a good thing and then just the idea that everything that four or five that with Jason he just thinks the game at at such a high level obviously he's on the greatest foreign gods that ever played so he he just saw things in understood things\nAnd I think of a big portion of kind of what kind of lost in translation was that he just kind of assumed that guys would be able to pick those same things up that okay we wants to get in the middle of the floor and then you're eBay\nThese four read that this guy is doing that than you do this and if he's doing that and that guy that you're that they do that and it was just like Jason you you understand that\nYou know how to do that but a lot of players in sync the game at the same level as you and certainly I got like ... who is only done playing basketball really for about ten years at this point like hey that's just not going to come\nTo him and that that's just not gonna be something about airport though another guy that has really benefited from everything being simplified that I think a lot of the things that Jason\nAre really being out now is on the events that are going in there and trying to do everything that you and not\nTo really give that effort either I think all those things are kind of showing real but what like what does it down to simplify it all those things instead of making five review make one read\nAnd that you get to play any kind of an athlete I liked that it ends up being a lot of our because you don't have to overt think everything that you're doing that to me you\nKnow kind of the biggest difference between gays and an ad with Jason I mean that that's not a problem that all that uncommon are great players be seen plenty of great players struggled to be great coaches because you know it's difficult to explain something that second nature\nMhm real quick before I let you go and one more thing so without John as you feel that well maybe they don't travel maybe he does okay maybe comes back but with these gene pool strike how ... even without ...\nHow big is this match up with Boston Boston consider to be the ... the best in the east so and I know it's usually there are seven and now the only undefeated team I get all of that but how big is this game upcoming\nI mean I think any game where the top four teams in the east is big for the box because\nWhat we're going to talk about at the end of the year is high rate goes right do you think back last season and it was okay or the box on their team they got to do that is that if they win these games and they can move all the way up to the three the that they lose a man called out of the tribal we think through all these things it's going to be tied at the top that eastern conference\nAnd that can be huge and I mentioned this last year last week with the Sixers game that you know that could be the difference between three and for those two teams play each other three times that you're you're in the first one you only have to wait one of the next two against ... you have to tie breaker though I\nCouldn't move or breaking is ... is our you know making a better life people know this is big for at the other either when you're out of all up\nAll of them that or whether you play them in October or whether you play them in April ... it's not going to matter it's going to show the exact same way and the record book so you got to find a way to win the game though that at the end of the theater and you're not\nBlack belt high breakers in trying to figure out if you're going to get two rounds at all but if you're gonna get one round at all if you're going to play I don't get all the you gotta figure those things out\nThere are a great job or talk to you again down the road okay sounds yeah\nThere you go Eric ... joined us each week reporter for the athletic same time same place talking two bucks basketball box with a big when Martin I take it on the Boston Celtics and again like you said anytime you're taking on those ... consider to be the top four teams in east it's always a big game\nDoesn't matter what doesn't matter what it is you got going on you you got to be the top four teams are going to be considered one of the best right now the bugs are considered one of the best he joined us on not only childlike shuttering drivers
