you've got to get at least a six to seven mile an hour difference otherwise they're just teeing off and on you and that's what we've seen so he has to be Ninety six Ninety seven for him to be

Burlington Corey welcome to the program how you doing today man what's going on\nFor more than they are going to call off the show thank you um you know I'm nuts\nI I'm not going to say you guys are wrong about Jeffrey and I know you know if there was a point in the year where he had more inherited base runners than anybody in the league and was still a sub three race so I think I can do it\nAnd I think tells a realizes if Jeffries isn't doing what he what he's done all year that we had no chance anyway of who else are you going to put in that situation\nA beer I ever since ... let me go let me go to something here ever since they won that game in St Louis when he was then quote not available in Chicago for game one sixty three has not been the same\nI don't know what it is but there's there's something there he was suddenly not available we didn't know why ever since day one game something's gone on to where these changes ability\nThat they did a lot I've got my finger on but then he come and then the next game ever ever get ... get us out of trouble yeah\nSome game to game too yes\nOkay yeah I mean again I something's not right but who you know I think also realize as if he's going to be able to do it then we didn't have a chance anyways you know\nMy my biggest issue with Louis on game too it's not like you know they came out and hit our you know hit are starting pitcher and that are reliever came in and capital costs ball game they're eating bread and butter\nAnd you know they're doing it way the game and that just does not feel good and I I there's been a couple of situations in the areas or um like I don't know about this decision and a half the battle I felt like I have to trust our thought like I have to trust house oh look what he's done for us but\nI did not feel that way when my wife with them about your however then by the way with with the boys who\nAre the value added that life is you know but I mean other than that I just have I had a pinch myself and you know if I myself to shut up because with what he's done for us so if right duck\nKnow I I look I completely agree with you it\nAppreciate the phone call it a tough situation because he has been one of your main stays okay I I equate it this this this bullpen of ... in ... hater in in Jeffers\nToo when I was watching a nasty boys back in Nineteen Ninety and the reds were rolling through every body and then went wired wired ended up knocking off the uh Oakland A's the mighty Tony La Russa led Oakland A's to win a championship I that was the kind of bullpen this has been\nAnd it's hard to kind of dark away from that but when you know somebody is struggling\nThe best thing you can do as a manager as the head coaches to put them in a position to be successful\nAnd therefore when you start to garner success confidence ability everything begins to rise right now\nYou know is is is strong and the stern and as angry as Jeremy jeopardy looks on the mound with that demeanor and that presents you can tell\nWhen when he throws a pitch it it's just it's not there that flare falls you can tell it's not quite the same look the courage I had one ... one yard\nPlane going

important and we got to the way we're going to use our fishing is that we got to count on all these guys you know from age age I made a bad one bad pitch a today and it cost them anything it was still a very good at her\nYou know I think a lot of the other stuff he does it have made some really really good pitches I'm certainly\nLooking into one run games you know make mistakes that kinda hit her and urging\n\nThose are the words of Craig council will get back to the phone calls momentarily who is\nTrying to get back into the wind column get up to games to one coming up later on this evening out in LA joining us now in the shadow orange outline Tim Allen who's the baseball game show and so Jim you and I chatted this morning a little bit\nUh all the talk about Jeffrey soon about the use of weighed Miley and Josh Potter and the one thing that you and I both agreed on and I said I took away from the series is those hitters of LA are like\nEven if you read 'em up like a boxer and they're bleeding it doesn't matter they just keep coming at you and they figure you out this is not going to be easy\n[laughter] no it's not going to be here maybe in a weird where it comes back to help her words that that that's not going to be a cake walk when you get through the sixth seventh eighth and ninth ending a so they are there are deep\nReally potent off around and\nYou put a scare and all them and game on your GOP too I'm I'm probably about the Dodgers are off as it gives the brewers fulltime you're\nYou're scaring game on God's to them in Gainesville and maybe now with the break it's as fast or it could be viewed as they'd be a good reset for that call and say hey man these guys come on\nLet's make sure we get back to where we know are we were throughout the bulk of the season of some ... in a good way maybe it goes back ...\nWhat do you think right now this team and they move forward and they're looking for a spark I mean is is a Jeffress it has to go in and get a cleaning or is it haters got to be able to come back and give them a one two three I mean what kind of a spark are they looking for right now are we talking more often than anything\nYeah well ... and that that was the a narrative when you and I talk heading into the policies or was that the officer is going to have to do some happy left right and they're just gonna have to step up or parts of runs or and and they have for the most part are averaging\nAgain to games you're on a on our on our friends are game starts respectable at least six three but\nUm it's going to happen to be the often says that's going to have to be a bill\nOr first car out of that town\nThat first guy out of that um tonight or taken over for shots and we're going to have to do his job that is key now that's not per se that if he does come in and and give up or to run double or their shots or travel or read a page that they can't come back and then recover from that\nThat would certainly help this team at least from from the perspective that first guy and does his job\n[noise] what else are you looking for out of uh we'll see off into space often generally speaking 'cause right now it seems like some of your keys I mean you know you can yell at you had I'm not going to say quiet but\n... was spectacular down the stretch you get to the post season he's been a little more quiet they concentrated on him more than ... do they need to get him going do does he need that sparked a sea okay he's going to be that powerhouse again or you're just joining the bottom line is contributing as long as they're contributing doesn't matter what the topic will end up does\nYeah well no it's a good calling us at the bottom half as is trying to through and have some success but\nStill the same philosophy with with a wakeup call maybe the Dodgers did have a wakeup call in with the same from afar that as witnessing crushed and yell at Stewart temper and and they knew comment in\nFact do they pointed out that to maybe a lot of other teams seven and a lot of us fans at times of thought it was the lines are okay and\nYou know the top of the catalysts but as we saw in September I mean it was all of a Christian college there are\nSo maybe that was there a guy that they pointed out and said that that's the one way up to stop right there ... down and you'll be very careful with them play a game of your springs but certainly don't go to his strengths\nAnd then so maybe maybe the boats and those that are you know for the Dodgers hitters and and again our our back to even here and go\n[noise] what ah what do you think of the ... council managed minor league do you think they put them too soon\n[laughter] I Can't [noise]\nA a great a great guy one said that the recently that it it's almost the crime that question what ... what does the stretching out [laughter] and\nI still think though you've been with success that's the great thing about baseball that's great thing about what you do for a living at all what I Do for a living as a way as\nWe face baseball the movies the splits the numbers that they've got the situation ah many runs up down up why is that tied the pattern of Brits yesterday that's the great thing about all of this\nI Can't question what he did with Miley because that's been the recipe for success that third time so they must be overwhelming don't verse against a starter going third time through an order so that being said\nI I don't question that one\nThe one I Would pick up just a little bit is Jeremy Jeffress being put back GM after what we saw him do it in a seven to slip back in the in the AIDS then again you had yeah Taylor hitting a a you know a lot tougher off the tea now for about thirty five feet and and then the home run so\nBut it it didn't work in eighth grade in the seventh and ain't got they\nGot out of that ah got out of that sort of an portray a double play but Austin bombs come on man on a curve ball the Austin bonds with the faces here's a very long ball game and and I don't see us game bumper to\nYour film a curve ball right there I think ... ... out for a job offers that I Know would have challenged him right there it's off the bar that so that's the one that I Would question if any however bill I'm\nThat we've talked about it this morning but\nIf if the situation comes up I'm going right back to Jay Jay I think it's worth the risk I Do\n[noise] I uh I I the one thing I keep going back to is and again I didn't go to the game I said ah for the first time a long time on the couch and watch the news thing but John ... and a great point he said if you watch the discipline of what the LA Dodgers hitters who brought to the plate\nIt's almost ... times as if they know what the brewers are throwing because they know what's coming and what not to go fishing for because they've had unbelievable played discipline and specifically in game two\nAnd they've had good gamesmanship too and I I don't know if anyone else noticed that but they mess with Jay Jay\nAnd they were stepping out they were making him live in the mall and they were making him Griffin the pressure moments I didn't see that one can lead chance was on the hill I didn't see these guys stepping out less than ... chance of them that heartbeat bill it\nUm and I uh maybe that's the experience coming through my guess is it is I'm all about the gamesmanship pipe but I did notice that I Believe every hitter he faced stepped out onto her image out for us in there to\n[noise] what do you think the way David Roberts is handled things ... the strike zone who's been

brewers game for those that say you know it's not a big game for the Packers it is\nIt is a big game for the Packers there's a reason why you have to have to win tonight goal way during your by we get health shell scale and then come out\nSwinging you've got a really really tough schedule when you come back\nWhen you start out by going right away on the road to LA and then after that fact you've got to then go into New England I mean you have got to get when you you have got their start stacking success you have to win at home and then you have to steal some on the road\nAnd the Packers let's be honest between ... and the parents most if not look good\nShow they they have got to start stacking some success and if they don't then this season's going to fall apart quicker than you ever imagined and this is not a bad\nTeam I mean you look at the\nPaper and you think okay with what they have\nThis is not a bad team\nBut when you come back after that you've got LA at LA New England at New England a dolphins team that is not as good as their record indicated early on I think we're finding that out and okay at bat Seattle teams play Seattle in Seattle they're going to be kicked out for that game you know that\nThen you have to go on the road again to us banks dating you have for\nYour next five games after tonight on the road against pretty tough opponent before you come back home and get a little bit of a reprieve against Arizona and or an Arizona Cardinals are now Atlanta falcon team I Can't figure out\nI Can't figure out a Atlanta Arizona we know they're not a good football team but Atlanta I ... and then you go on the road or on the sixteenth of December to Chicago\nYou come back home you take on the jets at land ball and then you close out your season with Detroit you got a big stretch coming up and\nThis is going to determine whether or not that those five games for what you're on the road are going to determine whether or not you're staying at home in the postseason you're gonna eat came to the post season or you're a team that is absolutely positively for real but you have to get a win tonight\nYou have to\nEight five five eight three zero eight six forty five five eighty three zero eight six voice you know as far as playoffs go do or die no it's nowhere near as big as what's going on with the Milwaukee Brewers but as far as your season goes and you're getting to the postseason yeah it's a big game to it\nIt's a big game tonight some things I Want to see coming out of tonight's game a first and foremost I Want to see the often function I I Want to see them actually punch the ball to the end zone is far too many opportunities to Paul and by the wayside for this team when they get inside the opponents\nNot just the red zone but inside the opponents thirty then if they do not if they do not get it right and do not punch the ball and I think everybody's going to hold their breath when they seemed Crosby and if you go you take the field have they worked out the things that have been plugging them\nSo that's the other thing that I'm looking specifically for the students defensively speaking out is what it is we know what this team is but off eventually there is a lot riding on his shoulders and on the legs of Aaron Rodgers andme Asian Crosby and I want to see if his team can get it right when it comes to ... baseball\nI Want to see shot seen go five or six I Want to see this team at the top continue to stroke in the bottom line up continue to produce it seems to be that's where they draw drawing their energy from right now\nAnd if they keep a defensively clean their good baseball team they're they're very very tough to be very tough to be a five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight chime in\nChina and we love to hear from you the brewers on the road\nTaking on the Dodgers including the post season the brewers relievers by the way our sixteen in one with the two six ER a over the last thirty one games\nOpponents have bad it is just one Ninety seven against them in prior to watch the game to the you know so yes against the Dodgers on Saturday ah the bullpen had not been taken had not taken a defeat\nSince the first of September at Washington\nThink about it the brewers have\nGone twenty seven and eleven against the national league west opponents of season which includes foreign one during the postseason against Colorado in LA\n\nAnd by the way also Ryan Braun recorded his fourteenth career postseason RBI and Saturday against the Dodgers passing Cecil Cooper\nFor the franchise record asking me a little bit earlier about the brewers on the road versus at home\nOr on the road the brewers went forty five and thirty seven on the road going Fifteen eight in foreign series play their five forty nine road winning percentage ranked fourth\nIn the national league they're forty five a road wins mark the third most in franchise history and the team on its last six roads series and last five road games and that's what you're looking at right now this is a series okay you're not looking at four games what'd you looking as you're going into LA you want to win two or\nThree you want to win the series\nSeason high five game ruined winning streak from a April thirtieth through mail eleventh and then from the twenty third of September through the first of October a season I six game road we're losing streak\nFrom the eleventh of July through the fifteenth of July the team went forty in thirty it on the road last season

[noise]\n\nPretty good uh just several one comment sure or are they Germany Jeffers everyone is for getting really heavy lifting ... or yep and Saturday Night live or are\nA formal way the football in in numerous times in a long time I mean he's been\nHe's been so lights you out and so meant to leave there you just kind of wonder you know is just the injury just affecting them that much in so many different facets\nBut we're probably but I think the the other end is you've got a bunch of ... ... people on his sister we last week the idea that it's been in the system that's out on the field\nBut when I'm Talking guys ... ball was about to Adams\nAnd you've got a guy in a position who's supposed to recognize splits let's is there and he doesn't run a hot route how do you blame that on twelfth I I don't know so so some of that stuff was a lot of those that live there you know you've gotta you've got tired of that it's got a bunch of new young receive result of effect is going to be that way again so\nYou know some of that stuff is bigger than\nWho's got a bum wheel [noise]\nDo you think that there's other issues uh you know I Know you've talked about you know other issues other than the bum wheel but do you think there's anything else that goes below the surface\n[noise] are you talking\nCoats in the odd yeah pretty much\nI mean come on that's been years now they they seem to twelve or in Rogers likes to uh you know kind of pumps for shots under the ball a little bit you know but I\n[noise] I don't know I don't talk to those guys individual enough to have any idea what's really under what's really going on I think it's more of a a a a system thing right now they got to get the book was fixed up\nOr do you think with Aaron Jones way he's run the football I understand not trusting of totally when it comes to pass coverage somebody cares would you see him to getting tonight\nOh I don't think it's going to eat as much to show what we've seen for you know what maybe ... right around ten probably a maybe a little bit more you know it's over or under if you're a sky probably or her Fifteen um you know I I think you know obviously\nYou know we talked about last week there's more to it than just pain in the Boston got to be able to to a pickup blitz is recognized blitz is it not only that when your number's called there's help let's say you got to get to a spot on the field and um\n[noise] you know hopefully that's the case and they're able to feed him but I really think looking at their entire ... ... ... ... from that side of the ball you know I don't know why you don't try to get that guy\n... twenty times of game whether it be selling it to them out in the flat or hand in the ball off either or I think um he's shown some ability and I think you've got it right on the till till you can't do it any\nOne of the game where I think you should be able to get up and stay up and this is where you bring in Eric Jones in Jamal Williams you keep feeding those guys I don't understand and Eric maybe explain it to me than I Am worried that I'm stupid or the most I Can't fathom for the life of me why it's one series per back\nWhy can't you mix them up why can't airing Jones be your first and second guy in a gym always be your third down guy or why can't you say you know Aaron Jones on on the first down Jamal Williams in a second why can't you pound a football and different ... I don't understand the mentality of you have to keep one guy in consistently I don't get it\nBut I don't you uh I I wouldn't be I think they should all get to those guys on the field at the same time you know what you got to back to the actual warning that are both very very capable at certain things\nI mean I think that could be a that could be a weapon especially since they're they're receiving calls it was a little bit make up um yeah I think you want to give off answer coordinators are tissues and defensive coordinator something to look at some to prepare for ... take their time away from other stuff\nUm I I don't know that I I Can't answer that question 'cause it's it's beyond my pay grade and certainly beyond what I think uh they should do off\nAnd the only thing that that I can argue Mike McCurry and there's a lot of things people want to pick up Mike mccarthy for now for the most part he he has been a good success will head coach but\nI I don't get it because they had never\nEver had a good run game ever and yes you don't want to take the body around BP's hands I understand it but even using it as illegitimate complement to what he brings to the table you can't lose say well the way I've been doing it works because it has it you have a ... you had a crappy run game\nFor a long long time and just say that it's some way shape or form that this is the methodology you have to use to me I think his erroneous because you don't have the proof is not in the voting in something like this\nOr certain to make the argument there when cable is adequate um and I think in a lot of the only they\nApproach office a football is you know that they feel it's adequate what what they are at war my problem has always been is when they want to when they need to line up and get their fingers in the dirt and get a yard that's where the struggles\nUm you know some of it's on the offensive line some of it's they don't have that kind of you know pull back [noise] um so some of that is where it is but I I I think that\nCan they do it adequate who\nI think they care a I think they have the horse is whether or not they should stick to it is there's the question that I think that's the one that's got to the answer [noise]\nDefensively speaking where do you think these teams at\nThe middle of the of the team you know new according to a bunch of young guys running around them with actually you're gonna you're going to expect some issues and I\nThey had had some of these shows uh fortunately most of the issues have come from the veteran guy not the young guys\nYou're going to see gradual improvement I Believe through the season what these guys what you're seeing is is a ton of effort and you know football guy you know just accidentally I'm the one player that he made last weekend when he gave up that\nThat long past fell flat on its face got up and went and got back to the bait and tackle tend to me\nThat's a football player that's a that's that was the most impressive play he may even though he got burnt for fifty yards I don't care he had the heart he at the intestinal Flora to keep going to get up and get any more that that that's what that defense is lacking more or less jobs yet comes from the savings\nI'm real quick before I let you go and you're talking about the new system with my pet and do you like the way ...\nIt's it's he hasn't always worked but at least there are things that he's been capable of dialing up to where they have gotten a little bit more pressure on a quarter back\nSurgery much interest there's more to it you know you have to go back a year or two of\nThe other places where to say about the extent of double decker um\nYou know rarely did you see a shaky as primary ... double double gas shoots a yourself overloading one side of the scrimmage politically or the other end dropping essential I ever had the coverage that interested in Syracuse for guy\nUsually like Washington that type of football it's it's good fathers they struggled ... there's some of those things but if you look at just the skiing and just\nThe nuts and bolts still have it but it looks really good that short a couple of players don't question but\nThis is interesting and it certainly is if you watch if you have to show up while you're like a\nGood step is always a chat with you tonight then if you want to come by in July and we would love to have you again I Know about Gary is still on the men's or going to have that opens offering them by\nUh we'll see what happened at oh they'll send you some

stations as we're going to be\nTalking about the brewers in their post game will be talking about the Packers and their post game so much going on so much going on and don't forget prior to the game tonight going to be a lodge colder the logical of kick off tonight with Nick Collins is actually going to be logical or in leaps and bounds downstairs\nSo come on by and say Hi hey one or the other thing that I wanted to remind you about I mentioned it before we started talking to Eric is our good friends from van horn and the automotive group they've got a as the FDA locations in Plymouth Manitowoc consultant and\nThey've got a what's called the ... day test drive program and I did this\nAnd uh and and love it I ended up going to their own truck center in in Plymouth and I started looking at cars there was looking at chargers and Chrysler three hundreds and everything and I thought about that and then I went to the Jeep Grand Cherokee which I loved it I thought I've already got an SUV\nAnd I haven't had a pickup truck in a while and so that's the direction I ended up going and if you're not satisfied with the vehicle and the Ninety eight ... test drive\nYou can return it no additional commitment you can buy it if you decide to and you could say but the two grand as well I picked up the two thousand and Nineteen ram Fifteen hundred I've set up for a while it is a luxury
