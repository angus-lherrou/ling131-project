baseball bombing our would they've shot and from the Washington Post\nQuickly through the top twenty five college football scoreboard and then we'll think about how the college football playoff is starting to come together with the first official rankings\nTo be released two weeks from Tuesday Ohio State getting pushback from Minnesota golden go first had the early lead on the road throughout the majority of the first half but now three minutes into the third quarter\nThat the horseshoe urban Myers team undefeated number three in the nation leading to go first Seventeen fourteen\nAuburn

Vanderbilt with the surprising Twenty one Thirteen lead over Florida\nGators coming off the victory over at least you up to number fourteen of the nation but Florida's been unable to get out of the room where they've had a couple of trips inside\nThe van de five early in the game has settled for just one field goal although they hit a late field goal to cap the first half to make it a one possession game will keep you posted\nSo as we think about the balance of power across college football SEC having another banner year no surprise we know that they are the reigning heavyweight champs in college football and we know the passion\nAnd the intensity of the nation yes it's just different when you get to the Southeastern Conference\nBut it feels even more pro down this year because Alabama might be a team that fifty years from now let's see I Will be in my late nineties I don't think I'll be wheezing it to the microphone that but who knows it's good to have goals\nFifty years from now we can be talking about this year's edition of the time they're just that good because the defense has been as powerful as typical saved in the days when you watch the NFL tomorrow and they do to player introductions\nOn Sunday Night Football or they're just going through the line ups throughout the afternoon games\nHow many Alabama players are going to see on the fence a lot you can save and coaches them up more to the point recruits so well\nThat Alabama typically as a stepping stone all the way to the NFL the difference this year I was you know is what's going on and off it sure is a transformational quarterback and he has been brilliant they don't give you many stats but some were\nSo substantial they have to be articulated to Eighteen touchdowns no interceptions\nAnd he hasn't played in the fourth quarter yet the seats and now you could say perhaps that's an obstacle that this team has it been tested maybe they're going to blanket the tight game that sounds like

have a call\nThat is working and you might have\nA difference of opinion as to how the teams are selected but at least we have this play off because when I got into this business twenty eight years ago the whole point of college football as we went round and round and crowds of mystical champion and some years we add splits national champs between the a P and UPS and\nWasn't all defeated record more important than a one last team based on the strength of schedule on that we have this brackets but\nWe still can't have a level playing field because somehow Alabama can get away with playing the citadel of the week before Robert and I'm not saying that the tide should be punished I have eyes that work I'm squinting 'em to vindicate classes I've seen what Alabama has don't every week\nBut it just strikes me as an older joke\nThat it's still tolerable than Alabama is playing a team like citadel in November I realized everybody plays a cupcake but do it like the rest of college football get out of the way in September\nIt just makes no sense to me other than we are talking about Alabama we're focusing on the SEC they can do whatever they want to and this is certainly the year the feel good about that conference in addition to\nThe overwhelming abundance of talent making their way from college football NFL Sunday in addition to all the national championships one\nI'm going to return

strong I talk about ratings just to give you a general sense of public consumption of what we're talking about and the NFL is having a banner year after the down cycle last year although\nFor all the conversation about the anthem being the primary factor I think really what happened last year was a confluence of the big word Saturday of stars being injured Aaron Rodgers oatmeal Beck and junior and the rest secondly\nThe game's worth that entertaining and never lose side of the fact that while you and I\nLive each breed this stuff because we're hard core fans there is a huge portion of the public that's much more casual without they watch sports at the game's not good they're not sticking around unless there are degenerate gamblers all the games have been good this year the exception\nOn Thursday Night Football order beat down applied buddy eagle so I guess we can say they of solve their dilemma as early in the years\nJay a giant moving forward so they got to figure out the balance of how they split the ... between ... and small wood but Carson went look better\nEasing is way back to being close to a hundred percent coming back from the tornado CEO and remember for all the conversation about what was wrong with Philly heading into Thursday nights game I met live stadium eagles overall point differential was only\nMinus one meaning every game was tight and if you think about the team last year\nAfter Carson which went down this was not a historically great team right nobody thought that Nick Boles was going to be the architect of not only a upset in the super bowl but a dynasty and moving forward it was all about how good with Carson went look coming back\nThe good news from Philadelphia is that to me\nHe seemed to move better against the lousy giant defense out Sean Jeffrey becoming a bigger factor in that office now that he's fully healthy and more important to look out for your place in a garbage division I grew up a giant fan I'm\nAbout Thirty years removed from a giant fed them but\nI Know how ... it's supposed to be when the giants match up with the cowboys or the Redskins or the eagles and Mike to Rico and you've got to check out makes toward the new podcast partnering with last year and NBC Sports radio among his week one guess shelter for you to see her as well as Mike a part of the coverage of some of the football\nTomorrow in that a massive gay and going to do a huge number where in Kansas City budgets undefeated record on the line at New England\nWhen Mike was doing Monday Night football I remember this phrase because it was so precise he was talking about NFC East five seven years ago as the most competitive division in North American team sports and that's why I make is the best because he chooses his words with specificity oh I got that ... well\nIf you believe that at the time and that's pretty broad heading right North American team sports we're not talking W T a tennis what has happened to that division Washington's been stuck in the middle for a long time you see the report that Josh Norman would not take his headphones off\nAt halftime Monday Night in New Orleans so either Jay crude and took them off somebody got his attention and Norman bench to start the third quarter\nDallas has a variety of issues namely Jason Garrett is over matches the head coach no other owner unless he was the GM we keep Garrett on\nBut Jerry Jones has a strange degree of loyalty anyone so head coach he can manipulate jak Prescott has progressed\nPrimarily because the cowboy offensive line is not nearly as good as it used to be\nHis number one receiver ideas that Jason wit news mumbling his way through Monday Night football and the giants even with\n... Beckham junior and with sake one Barkley who's a star in the making was dynamic a Thursday night just can't move the football because he like manning has fallen apart so\nEven if you think Philadelphia has real issues to overcome namely the secondary has progressed who's going to touch them in that division I go nine and seven when the division was that you get the right to host a playoff game then we learn more about the reigning world champs in the tournament couple updates coaches will vote for\nFlorida just scored\nThe card said go for one they\nKicked the extra point currently Vanderbilt now Twenty one twenty five it's go third quarter\nAnd Tennessee\nHas come up with a defensive touchdown\nExtra points you to give them a twenty seven Seventeen lean on the road at Harvard much more on the way I'm Brian wherever this is NBC Sports radio [noise]\n[noise] that's coverage of\nJohn twenty four\nStation [noise]\nYour NBC Sports radio with being on\nThe twenty five would football school all these games in the third quarter number three Ohio State merely leading Minnesota tornado fourteen Vanderbilt has a Twenty one twenty lead over number four team Florida tendency just scored a defensive touchdown on the road it over Twenty one all birds of all ... to\nTwenty seven Seventeen coming up in less than ten minutes on NBC it's number five Notre Dame hosting the\nNBA the next wave Joe Camel Noah postseason baseball for eastern game to see us\nIn Milwaukee Brewers beat the Dodgers six five last night's weighed my only on the mound for the crew hunting real goes for LA and then it ate eastern it'll be game one of the ALCOA between the red Sox and the Astros Justin Vernon lander squaring off against Chris Sale on the mound at Fenway Park this is envy\n[noise]\nIf you suffer from E.

Shaw implodes again and that's a fair assessment because given his body track record the fact that they only lasted three innings translating to the shore to sort of his playoff career\nIs what people are talking about although if you paid attention ... Shaw Petrou very well\nOr we could go against Atlanta he was much better in the playoffs last year old though he was terrible in game five against the Astros and for whatever reason\nYou can say it's a strange new wants his postseason baseball you can say that he gets tight\nThat this year I think it's different his velocity down because he's damage goods but body of work he's been a fundamentally different picture in the playoffs then the regular season so maybe it's between the IRS although if you go back and look at Greg Maddox says numbers\nIn the hall of famer did not have nearly the same kind of dazzling stats when he got to a high leverage situation as people like to say now in the playoffs compared to the regular season but put it all together ... wasn't good he didn't get much help from his catcher\nDoes ... was a disaster but if you're a Clinton courage show\nAnd you see the Milwaukee is going to a relief pitcher in the third and brand new Woodruff tanker so suppose game he was aware of the bread that it has a home run you cannot let a relief pitcher hit a pinch hit home run\nJust can't happen here the best picture of your generation\nDo better so the series is not done\nAnd candidly Reeves bend the better pitcher for the Dodgers clearly and the second half of the year that's why he started getting more of the ds he'll get the ball coming up in the end of the U.S coming up that for eastern about an hour twenty minutes from now in Milwaukee but\nBrewers while it would not be sexy for baseball clearly you could figure out the match up to them they'll be in Fox is praying to the baseball gods for\nDodgers Red Sox now we're talking about a real rating\nNational followings big histories to roll out all the videos that close your eyes here comes Sandy Koufax and on the other side oh the ball gets through button or well Dodgers have some work to do and there'll be does not want Milwaukee to make this World Series but the brewers are fun story\nThey won twelve straight and to be straightforward with you I don't follow baseball as much as they used to in the regular season I talk about it selectively but I'm aware of what the brewers have been doing because that's another theme this year\nThe importance of starting pitching has been marginalized so you think about what the raised it this year a very nice story well they went with the opener\nGoing with a relief pitcher to start the game because they just did not have faith in the rotation thinking about how the brewers approach things they want to go to a relief pitcher\nThe fifth if they can follow their normal blueprint well ... was a bit spotty so quick I also went to his bullpen and the fourth inning and that's why ... was up there and the bottom the third is able to go deep\nSo you got that game coming up I think more to the point Red Sox Astros shouldn't be juicy tonight in primetime Boston just the juggernaut in the regular season Houston had a better record this year than last year\nAnd there are a better team I Know they dealt with injuries but just thinking about the personnel moves data player like Garrett goal or used to be an ace in Pittsburgh\nThe mix for later in the post season is\nA complete stood and Boston is still going to try it out David Price in game two five said David Price you think back to his latest meltdown against the Yankees and the D.

that never happens in the history of Nebraska football and trust me I started my career in Nebraska\nThose fans will be live at the courthouse for fans are already fit to be tied by what they've seen so far and we got players were transferring they're dropping like flies this would be a big win for Scott Frost who was a superstar at Nebraska if they can pick this up\nBut there still is some time on the clock\nHere the big one after having the college football selection committee way in Auburn checked in at Twenty one Tennessee is beating them\nThirty seven team now nine minutes to go in that game so what happened the running back\nFor the volunteers high Chandler is getting a little running room and moving the ball got a touchdown and has been able to move the change when they needed to move them and for the tigers did him with a couple of\nCostly interceptions turnovers are really in college football or in pro football so Jared did him who had a pretty decent line before that with some costly uh interceptions and that's made a big difference here and it's it's wild because if you look at Auburn and how they've\nPlayed and coming off of that when over Washington\nWhere straight across the board you look really good through for almost two hundred and Seventy five yard it was pretty much on the money I watched big chunks of of that\nAnd then you look at losses like to LSU which was a tight when they lose a buy a point but still in that game what the difference was interceptions a couple of interceptions\nFor that him and that one\nSo this is what we're seeing happen in this one too but still some time left although they'd have to really get a up if they're going to get back into the that would knock them I Would assume out of the top twenty five coming up later today there is some huge game but the huge 'cause I think the game of the day really\nIs Georgia and LSU that has all the makings of edge of your seat football and it's ...\nOn the tigers coach at OSHA Iran he knows what they're up against with Georgia and Kirby Smart and that defense here's what he had to say about it\nSort of British police are slow to go up to their level of search do first recorded but most of the room but we're pretty far to the doctor will burger personal personal cameras look up to your point man on the books are there for ...\nYou gotta love if somebody gave us all the actors and they can play anyone that wants to do that how they line up\nAnd Georgia's south of course they're tough that's why there too that's why they're six in oh LSU though could play spoiler\nBecause if you look at what at ... Iran has done with that team and this is the defending national runner up remember from last year if you looked at Alabama jailing hurts proof he's out see what comes in they win the title\nYou look at Georgia and how they're really trying to go for reputation\nReputation they want to be able to stay up there but L. S. you know\nThat there are even though it owes Ron\nGives him so much credit on that deep and he knows\nThis is going to be physical he knows he has physical players he knows his team is hungry and this will be a huge win on his resume and for the team and for where they would\nWhat would happen down the line next week they play Mississippi State Mississippi State really just jumped into the top twenty five they've had a couple of brutal losses and you know now you you look at\nWhere LSU isn't there poised to make a nice statement because there are still alive and the FCC and the west and potentially\nI say carefully potentially even in the college football playoff race they just can't afford to lose so this is the biggest competitor that Georgia's face right today\nAnd they know it and they know that ah at as Ron has some tricks up his up his sleeve but he does have that incredible\nDefense Georgia does have an incredible defense and they are so so deep and when you look at what LSU where they're hurting\nOffensive line so what kind of protection are we talking about uh for the tigers to try to make that\nMove to ... to me the ball further down the field because they're going to have to score against Georgia they can't turn over the ball they can't give them anything and they have to come away with point they have to get in the red than they have\nTo score and they just can't\nRely on rotating rotating rotating rotating over and over and over again but I think we're going to say are super close game it kicks at three thirty that means all be on the air when it first starts you can bet all the giving you all the skinny on that game and of course everything else in college football in between Notre Dame is another good one\nBecause they're taking on a pit and if you looked at it on the surface you know I wouldn't say it again I think the number one game hands down his his Georgia and Alice you\nI I I think that's it period but\nNotre Dame has been impressive to watch him book are you seeing what this guy's doing his lighten it up what a smart move by Brian Kelly were over that excitement now now it's about what are you going to do in some of these other games and this was kind of one of those other game's\nBiggest pick could rise to the occasion to make it a little bit tricky for them they don't want this game to be close and Notre Dame wants to go to seven to know because you talk about\nCollege of football playoff implications there in this you can not count them out of this one and the\nPanthers could be that team I mean look there's three three they're nowhere near as physical they're nowhere near as big as um a Notre Dame is and here it is to um\nGot the timer on there actually underway and a Pittsburgh on top of Notre Dame as I'm just just flipped the channel\nPittsburgh on top of Notre Dame ... nothing just as I was gonna say oh you can't afford any mistakes\nAnd unfortunately that's what happened in this first one out with a Notre Dame so the fighting Irish on N.

C. on to a lot of people will have their eyes on that again because of what can happen for Notre Dame so the opening dry for Pitt\nSeventeen played eighty eight yards and they ended up with a touchdown and Notre Dame defense couldn't do much to stop them it's early it was a nine yard touchdown run that put them on the board period and that's another day and that will\nLand that or just say\nLet's just hope Steve twenty thirty seven doesn't get his hands article time machine because he is going to come back here and not some sense to you this message brought you by the American Institute of certified public accountants and the capital\n[noise] hard to recruit actor former football player game show host problem\n[noise] I'm also affects rentals drama and all kinds of drama there's a good\nTrue\nLike season ending injury [noise] necessary kind of like an agent and all they were feeling drama drama around my time [noise] and then there's the drama and [noise]\nThe drama that comes with not having your course looks fine for you to do is you can click industry which is\nThe moment is not enough to remember river on the phone when the nine eleven\nAnd leave the drama an actor's brought you better do original literacy foundation and the outcome [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nYou can always judge about\n\n\nTwo minutes really left on the car if you want to be exact about one fifty nine Nebraska beating northwestern thirty one to twenty four so\nThey're trying to hang on but they got it first started down and that means they meaning uh northwestern does one pass just broken up so here we are\nFor a second and ten but boy they would really they being Nebraska would love to walk away with the wind 'cause if they don't owe and fixes mark they have never in their history\nHit so can you imagine how much pressure Scott process feeling he's already feeling the pressure no matter what and and there's still hurts recruiting\nThe horrible start that they've had but boy they just have a big donors up there are a bagel whichever you want to call it is not the way they want to go but as as you know in college football\nOr two minutes or even just under two minutes can seem like an eternity so we'll keep you up on that one there are a couple of games that are set to go final and some that that to have one that's getting closer there under the four minute mark\nAs well as fourteenth rank Florida trying to uh hold on a beat van de thirty for twenty seven the corn that one\nAnd Stacey\nWrapped up Oklahoma said oh what a difference a year makes thirty one to twelve it was all about what was happening on the ground for touchdowns rushing touched down for Alex Barnes a case state wildcat\nExtraordinarily moving machine at least anyway and the cowboys and actually all feed them on you that it's that line has been really really good came to leave me here on this Saturday always thrilled to do college football and we talk a lot about college football but I'm going to die in major league baseball too as well and then we've got\nSome of the odd that we're going to talk about at the bottom of the hour 'cause now is you know especially gambling and looking at what the odds makers do the white guys and how close they are just so much of what ends up happening in the game\nBy the way while I was John Ohio State wraps up Minnesota no contest there thirty fourteen you're not done by that but the lines are super good\nThree touchdowns four hundred and twelve passing\nYards you know what I'm Talking about he's up for the Heisman Dwayne Haskins but I think\nRight now anybody would be hard pressed to rip it out of the hands of\nTwo or because of what he's been able to do as a quarterback for Alabama his his that lines are off the chart\nThe Eighteen touchdowns and the fact that this is a different kind of often that we haven't seen that in a long time from Nick Saban 'cause usually there's more of a mixed there's more happening on the ground but this is a guy who can throw a bomb you can bet he'll be a high\nDraft pick in the N. F. L. I don't want to dive into a major league baseball for a few moments here it's it was interesting to watch the Dodgers that first Dodger game against the brewers you know\nAll season long\nAs a big baseball fan and watching what the brewers are doing I kept saying boy this brewer team it's like something we haven't seen their they're playing like kids I'm In little league there's playing lose playing really really really good and what happened I think in the um [noise]\nUh what happened in the in this game for the brewers that work was the fact that there were some high moments in low moments for Clinton ... Shaw and one of the low moment was the shock\nOf the home run from the reliever who just matched the ball I mean just done him with a home run we're normally you know\nBlow 'em off there but uh he had just the right swing the right timing and sure enough brand in what was the was a just a a hero\nSo left handed off of the left the pitcher in the playoffs I don't think though right so the Dodgers were sloppy defensively the Dodgers\nYou know beat them ... or the brewers beat them six five on friday night and the championship\nSeries which I think it can be really tough for the Dodgers a lot of people were just rubber stamping that I just I don't know why because maybe they hadn't seen a lot of the brewers but the brewers have that scrapping is about um they kind of remind me they remind me of the team\nIn St Louis that had freeze who was just the hero I'm against the Texas Rangers little in the nineties just the way they played the losing his of how they were playing\nThe Dodgers court three times in the eighth so they made it six four then they almost tied it in the ninth and Chris Taylor had an R B I triple\nAnd I'm now we got game to\nGame too at Miller Park it's Miller time for the brewers\nAre the the Dodgers tour through the brewers bullpen that was certainly their weakness coming into this man image shot at home or did he drove in three runs but the Dodgers have for errors for errors to past fall\nMeaty what do you do it to pass balls in the playoffs are you kidding me [laughter] so um this'll be I think a different kind of a game and Clinton commercial\nOut before he could get to a battery in the fourth inning and you know this has to take on Clinton Kirsch law it was the shortest postseason started his career and this\nIs what happens the errors affected the game\nSo we move on now\nTo this second game and we'll see what the\nWhat happens there and if the Dodgers to get things back on track\nAnd then of course the Astros and there are theories against Boston should be great\nThat later tonight at eight o'clock eastern first pitch\nStay with us we're diving into numbers neck [noise]\nPeople any NBC for radio [noise]\n[noise] the morning and I am\n\nVery drawn in BC sports radio with\nRats looking for that elusive when they're thirty one thirty one though right now with nine seconds left in the game that are we going to see an overtime game between between these two wives knew it wasn't going to be easy [noise]\nAll right let's dive into some other action Auburn twenty first ranked Auburn trying to fend\nOff Tennessee but they're not going to do it we've got less than a minute to go the volunteers feeding them the thirty seven seen the other stores to throw at you in clued [noise]\nNotre Dame in their quest to remain perfect not gonna be easy Notre Dame right now\nBeing beaten by Pittsburgh seven nothing and that's of eight minutes until they hit the halfway point of that game later tonight LSU in Georgia\nLeaders that the new age ...

I mean this is a fighting type a football team not lost on Hugh Jackson who we got to see throughout hard knocks on HBO\nOr I think they're really melding as a team and definitely if they were handing out awards like when you were kids you went to the sports banquet and you get most improve they'd be on the list for most in prove\nAlmost improved\nIt's I don't know that you know Cleveland losses on the roads because it says that at home the browns have definitely got got the Mayfield booze but is there too\nHype because they're too much pressure in that and you look at you know you look at the other side of this and you look at Melvin\n[noise] a touchdown and four straight games he's part of an impressive attack in Phillip Rivers has turned Thirteen touchdown passes only two interceptions that's part of the big difference here is getting a lot of protection from his office of wine he's only been sacked half a dozen times that's helped make a difference\nFor him and much more balanced attack offensively a to\nSo and and if he gets into any kind of a situation where they're airing it out who did that benefit\nI don't think it benefits the browns if you look at what rivers is doing right [noise]\nSo it has the makings though for one of the better games on the board I think Cleveland's only favored by one\nAnd there it is kind of fun to watch is it's it's it's fun to watch to see what's going to happen I mean they're they've become like oh let's see what the browns are doing now like I've had people that I'm friendly with who watch a little bit of football come see comes up they keep that's what they keep asking me hey what's going on his brown\n'cause they know who Baker may feel that they knew is number one of the draft they watch them in Oklahoma and they want to know how he's doing\nAnd some people watched HBO's hard knocks and they paid attention to what happened in hard hard knocks and they're following the saga of that how about the Dallas Cowboys coming off of that disappointing Sunday night loss in overtime to Houston\nNow they come now they turn around and they've got to play 'em they got to play Jacksonville the the cowboys at home\nNot favored in this\nPlay portals he is the mystery mystery meat I think compared to to dock Prescott but the Dallas Cowboys often has made some coaching once they've made some terrible decision a decisions rather including\nAgainst youth in fourth and what what do we do what are we going to do here we always go for it but we're not going to go for it now and then we're going to lose in overtime but that was the past\nFlake portal has thrown seven interceptions\nSeven right so if you look at that number they're pretty much and you look at ... and and other problems in the turnover department there near the bottom of the statistics in the NFL right there really are\nAnd then you look at the cowboys defense all the goal line stopped against Houston that's what was so sad and their last it was unbelievable how they stopped in Houston\nI watch for straight times in a row and so what are they going to do what what's the cowboys defense going to do\nTo Jacksonville\nIt's a big game for them the NFC East with\nThe eagles winning the other day against the giants who looked like the worst team period in the NFL he lie manning oh hang it up it was fun to watch you but go away from the game don't let these New Yorkers slaughter you with those ugly headlines and oh Dale ... junior\nBecause they're being more immature rich entitled player in the NFL who has crazy skills\nBut can't get his head together off the field with what every the camera just follows them around it's like they should have somebody that just has one of those um go go pros on and they just walk and they look at his every move\n'cause everybody wants to see what the next gestures going to be who is going to yell out what's going to happen it just seems like a broader lists giants team and it showed against the Philadelphia Eagles\nThe eagles were able to take advantage of that the mistakes by Eli Manning\nAnd yet you have say Kwan Barkley who was incredible fantasy was a\nMeeting my fantasy teams are getting just so rushed might actually two teams are okay and I focus more than my third one\nTwo weeks in a row I had players how do I have a player in a bike 'cause I don't get it in and time because I'm doing something else and I'm not paying attention to it and then um I've I've got an opponent this week who have Barkley who had the lights out came and got massive fantasy staff even though I had just Eliot the kicker for Philadelphia\nAnd Corey climate who did a nice job and puts importance on the board but certainly not enough against that crazy final it over by the way they're brats SCA\nNorthwestern prevails thirty four thirty one or they're going to be talking more about Nebraska so they do the unthinkable they slip to though and six never happened before in their history by the way Florida wrapped up van de thirty seven to twenty seven\nSo that's a nice pick up for them\nAnd ah as they try to get into a bigger ball game I'm certain of it and we're watching Notre Dame put a few points on the board any way before the half\nGot three minutes and changed before there in the locker room Pittsburgh on top seven three at this point still a lot\nBook had been so good he threw an interception in this one to ramble uh eight\nEight carry for twenty yards but Notre Dame ... stopped\nAt a couple of times nothing costs of they haven't been able to get anything really going off then simply that's part of the story is I'm watching this from my plush studios also underway Oregon and Washington the seventeenth rank duck\nAnd of course uh the huskies for\nWashington Three nothing they put up three points a field goal that was good at thirty eight yard or making a difference for them tons of time a handful of minutes into the Texas and Baylor all eyes on taxes\nThey jumped up to nine they were nine out of college football selection committee that I five in one so they're trying to become sixth and won against Baylor they just hit a field goal\nDick or the kicker and that's like saying now they're going to do bumper stickers with it a forty yard field goal three that again and that midway through the first in that game LSU in Georgia\nA few minutes into this game no score yet LSU has the ball were diving out them were diving back in and talking about uh some more NFL highlights in low light to look for this week and we'll catch up on the scores in college

Iran boy they've been ... the the LSU three did\nBeat in Georgia right now ... football ton of football left although the Andre with was trying to make them with move he did get them at least in that position three Carrie thirty seven yard\nFor the tigers and um the yards were big you are or Pittsburgh and Notre Dame\nMan I Can't remember when as many people were talking about Notre Dame certainly over the years there is the lure of that program there have been some great pro players that have come out of Notre Dame winning season but this year Brian Kelly when he made the switch\nFrom ... to a book from two in book what a difference that has made for the team although a costly interception Notre Dame behind\nPit seven six they are at the halfway point of the game and a Notre Dame coming out of this could be\nI mean could continue to sail I ... in that the perfect type of season that they're having and their\nHot coming into this just looking on the outside of a semi final game where they're ranked fits that can change though\nYou know this is where they're going to have to start coming out of the um locker room finding ways to shred that defense\nBut Pittsburgh defensive line has been soft they've had a couple of facts they've been all over book they've hurry them and that's been part of the the difference here they're trying to control this\nAnd they're having some success with that some success with it\nBut it feels like it's Notre Dame time doesn't it it really\nIt really does I mean it's been a a wild make over because of in book and there are some other reasons why I mean being undefeated like I said for this team the history new rock me must be cheering somewhere\nOn the other side of a on the other side of life is the second life pizza is it gives kids go says revived them it's crazy and especially you look at some of the when some of the bad beat them or that they've leveled at other teams people were talking about Virginia Tech\nLast week and how tough Virginia Tech was going to be a main handled Virginia Tech especially in the second half a\nStanford I thought Stanford could put a thorn in their side they easily took care of Stanford\nThe Irish did and you know they start off the right way because in the regular season when you got to match up against Michigan you got to take care of Michigan you could look at the ball game when they took them when they took on ball and said you gotta be kidding how do they get that close where they only\nThe them by just a tad over a touchdown that's crazy 'cause they're not an offensive juggernaut ball wasn't but again you have to look at who the quarterback was and the big move that was made and one book\nThat in their statement really really started\nTo happen now let's see what happens in this game coming out\nYou know for the second half let's look at a couple of the other games that are in progress and some of them that have wrapped up and I mentioned you know poor Nebraska Nebraska oh and six\nFor the first time in their history goes to overtime they they have the edge they're leading by more than a touchdown as they're like at the ten minute mark and then it starts to slip away\nSlip away slip through their fingers gets to overtime tied at thirty one north western prevail they beat him thirty four to thirty one that is a bad beat for Nebraska 'cause players you know blue chip players are leaving\nIf they're eligible and it's going to be tough on recruiting Scott Frost has to find a way to turn this team around and it really looked like they were at least going to pull off this first when and get that\nAnd feel good about that where there's not a lot to feel good about this season but they couldn't get it done so Nebraska at Northwestern not on the top twenty five foot definitely a team that's being talked about Nebraska anyway because of how\nBrutal how brutal that are playing all bird at home\nLosing to Tennessee you gotta be kidding me thirty twenty four was the score and this was tight all the way through although\nComing out of the halfway point when they actually had to leave by a couple of points Auburn let that slip away Tennessee finds a way to um\nTennessee finds a way to capitalize on some mistakes\nAnd puts fourteenth points up in the third quarter that was the difference and they're able to hang on ultimately and beat all Byrne that's a big macher because Auburn at home you don't see that much and now Auburn fall to four and four and they've got to um\nThey've got to be and they've got to be smart and from that because they're now in that position where they're gonna drop out of the top twenty five most likely that will happen to them with a college football selection committee\nDecides where it's going to fall in the top twenty five it's not going to fall in their favor Ohio State it's all coming up buckeyes for them because Minnesota the opponent Ohio State a perfect seven and those who were knocking off Minnesota\nThirty four team no contest Minnesota gold and go for could do nothing and the second half of the game and of course not because when you look at what\nOhio State field an urban Meyer you're expecting the buckeyes are going to be there and they needed a couple of you know a field goals and also another touchdown pass to really put a way to go first and it was one of those kind of games where they should have put them away and they they did\nBut um the the passing game\nShowed up that's what it was the path to a game showed up big time the defense did not show up\n\nYou just

attack them two oh five or perhaps you've downloaded the NBC Sports radio ads [noise] I'm going to give you an update on that I Am like the Kevin Bacon of the networks on like all the guys don't know it's because when I was just filling in years to go\nAnd still up to the yesterday I'm telling people about it and to download if somebody was actually\nIn line and I had it on and I had my had put in but I but I dropped my um I dropped my ear buds so you can hear it what's that you're listening to that doesn't sound like the ticket because I'm In the Dallas Fort Worth area no\nAnd I told him and he right in front of my face downloaded the app so now I think I'm up to about twenty eight hundred people\nThanks to the people who know me there six friends do and and so forth\nAnd the people that I've just told so I'm going to count myself as a Kevin Bacon like\nPerson for NBC Sports radio and spreading the word yes I Am the the buy in the\nNot the to say or what the word for that I Am the uh the profit the NBC profit taking this you'll love it and why because they're saying that I'm just said that the better word stage although said makes me sound like I'm like ancient but it but yet\nAnd I say the reason why is because if you're listening on the local radio station that's awesome and then you get out though you get out of the car you're tooling around your\nUm doing errands whatever and you don't lose you don't lose what's happening in the games or the updates or some incredible pithy comment or some incredible gift or whatever it might be\nHard enough of that so I said I lost my ear bud but I'm not a professional football player I'm not sitting there after getting schools in the first half where a team put up twenty six points against me and part of it was my fault so I'm not sitting in a professional football players shoes in a locker room at halftime\nAnd I got my a headset on [laughter]\nThis is what happened on Monday Night to things Jeff lam Washington with a ton of points\nAnd Drew Brees found everybody and their brother right\nSo Josh Norman decided\nThat when they went in to ah to the Walker\nAnd it was half he was going to put on his head up and he wasn't going to listen to Jake route and his coach who was given a big bad burning speech to rally the troops [laughter]\nHe didn't even hear he's like practically screaming supposedly and say hello hello earth earth to Josh norm in are you there I mean just brutal he got caught with his headphones on\nI mean when I think that's the big story it's a big story 'cause it's a phenomenon of what's happening of course younger culture younger guys all that I get it I fly a lot I see everybody with headphones on I got my own headphones on but I'm I'm taking them off in between and I'm Still pleasant with people and people aren't screaming to get my attention\nBut I'm also not a professional football player in this scenario so we get he was bench last week not because he was playing so lousy which he wasn't playing great but he got benched because he had the headphones on while the coaches were addressing the team groove and told him to take them off\nAnd guess what\nHe ended up having to take them off for him so that what happened supposedly that big story broke in the Washington Post can we put Norman and the blue box we got our big box handy or brewers are they there too\nReally [noise]\nGive me a break\nAnd started thinking about what was the norm in listening to that he\nCouldn't get enough of that he was so he wasn't paying attention was the uproar little wanes uproar was it a young blood five seconds the summer with the Drake I Love Drake in my feeling was it that was the um\nThe was it I don't know was it I Love it Kanye West and little pump was that what he was listening to all listening to and now some of those\nSongs that I throughout our what in my little magic music box I like to call if I'm if I have my iPhone on and I'm just doing the bug thing but I don't have those giant\nPhones on headphones on that some of what you would that's not what you would hear I even like are you on the ground day God is the woman I liked that song\nAnd I like and I of course imagined dragging natural that's a good one to anyway that's a little taste of what you would hear if you borrowed you know my ear buds or even my headphones that's what you would get how 'bout you fill up what do you what are you to hang around with\nWell recently is\nBetter [noise]\nNot bad is that I Want to get but I'm afraid I'll show my ignorance to classical music which I

watching pat ... for the first time he gets picked off twice last a week now though the real capstone up again patriot what did she have to do to beat the patriots and be competitive in a\nWhile I think what they have to do either they're going to be competitive in the game I think the the the question is\nIs can that defense stopped the patriots\nAnd I don't know if either team can stop the other\nAnd you know we saw the patriots\nYou know certainly come out of it somewhat you know in in the last game when you know they had Julian Edelman back they had George Josh Gordon on the field who just learning the off chance but just having him on the field kind of open things up\nFor the rest you know for for other you know for other play makers and then with Sony Michel now he's you know he's banged up about a little ... issue and so of course the patriots list everybody that's questionable so who knows you know what what the real status is but when you add it back like that along with those other those other place\nFences getting back to what it's capable of doing so I mean I Would be surprised we see this league this year for the or the over under Z are going crazy and you know we had a game last week this fifty eight I Believe this game is fifty nine the over under there's only been acts like\nEight or nine over under that have been sixty and the last Fifteen or sixteen years and so I'd be surprised if this game is both teams weren't in the thirties by the time it's all said and done a on Sunday night\nYeah when you look at um some of the more interesting stories across the NFL what really pique your interest in ... the than a week thick [noise]\nWell there's so many I think that that's certainly what the chiefs and Patrick Murray homes you know what he's been able to do a as you know in his second year really us for obviously his first year as a starter a buddy learn so much last year that that has been a real real intriguing story we've seen the other\nYoung quarterbacks come in and really really I ... I think one of the great stories we'll see how it all the valves is the browns and Baker Mayfield and\nHere they are five hundred after five games and they might have had one or two wins if they had a kicker in the first part\nOf the year and so that it was a team that won one game the last two seasons combine and they've got to go through these already so I think that's that's a really no matter what happens\nThe rest of the way for the browns the season they know they have their quarterback for the future which is ... for the president and the future which is something they haven't been able to say since they came back in little league almost Twenty years ago I mean heck did you realize he's the\nSince the browns came back you know after the original browns went to Baltimore\nHe is the thirtieth different starting quarterback\nThat they've had well unless there's an injury they're not going to have another one for a long long time and I think that's you know it's great it's great for him it's great for the browns great for the city that because they they obviously haven't had much to you know to cheer for you know tomorrow\nAt the at the browns game they're going to do something very unique I was looking at this earlier with a record when I talk about how bad it's been there they are going to be inducted into the ring of honor\nA number I don't know if you saw the story but there and dumping into the ring of not not ... and so the ring of honor and I don't have a number in front of me I think it's ten thousand three hundred and sixty three ... consecutive snaps\nThat left tackle Joe Thomas played for the browns and his eleven seasons until this year you know ended by injury last season so there and the thing that number into the ring of honor and Joe Thomas ... eleven seasons for the brown they were ten and six\nThe first year and then the rest of the way they one thirty eight games\nIn ten years huh how that's how bad it's been\nFor the brown so like I said I don't talk a lot about them but I think that's one of the great ... ... is one of the great stories of the season and the kind of the ... some of the criticism some of the head scratching that they got when they drafted Baker may feel but I'll say I'll just say this John ...\nWas the man behind the drafting of Baker Mayfield John Dorsey was the man behind the chiefs last year trading up to get Patrick my home [laughter] so I say that there shouldn't be too many people questioning what John Dorsey does when it comes to player personnel decisions\nYeah obviously he's made a couple of good ones and you're right it was ten thousand three hundred and sixty three that the number ... ... yeah that is pretty amazing hey one laugh when Jason Gary is he going to make it through the season is the head coach of the cowboys and if they don't win some I Would think he would get booted leave by the end of the year\nWell I I Would suspect he'll make it to the end of the season obviously you'd never know what Jerry Jones is going to do because he's you know he's ... [laughter]\nI I guess he's a kindred spirit of our president because they just can't help themselves from talking and saying crazy things and when he comes out this week Jerry Jones and says well one of our big problems is we don't have an elite number one receiver well\nWhose responsibility is to get that for the team\nIs Terry Jones he's the general manager and write all you can blame Jason Garrett all you want\nTo know what I'm saying anything about him two years ago when bad does Bryant and they had enough of a line that was healthy in together and of course they drafted to seek Eliot\nAnd that Prescott what's a rookie now this year the office of line isn't as good they don't have any good receivers or at least really really good receivers and everybody wants to blame it on the head coach of the quarterback of the office of coordinator its personnel\nIts personnel and that's Jerry Jones whose responsibility so it you can change the head coach\nBut if the other part of it doesn't change just not going to matter\nYeah absolutely Howard always fun to talk\nMuch for joining us national NFL writer editor broadcaster hall of fame voter I could go on and on a we appreciate your thanks [noise] always a pleasure to hear\nThat some good insight from Howard including what he said about you know the whole of the brown spring of honor rather and the fact that they're recognizing the snap the consecutive snap\nPlaying alongside of\nYou know sixteen pro Football Hall of fame selection than eight league championship very very unique and very very cool we're diving out them we're wrapping up this hour with a little baseball talk\nDodgers and the brewers going at it toppled the third what's going on there tonight the actors and the red Sox start their series Astros defending their world championship will they be like the two thousand\nYankees who won back to back ...

welcome and Jessi Hempel from the athletic dot com it's time here has brought you buy covers normally this is a segment forge up the trick is\nAre we wish him well he is recovering is working from home today they're probably listening to this so Jeff is dividing his loyalties right now between the brewers three nothing lead over the Dodgers\nAnd getting ready for badger football tonight\nAgainst Michigan will expect Jeff back in both with us\nNext week against Illinois Jesse let's talk about this being your first trip into the big house and I I think everybody wonders what this is going to be like when you walk in it's kind of like land ball field in that regard when you walk in here for the first time there's some history what's your experience because this is your first time it's exciting it's like oh it's a bucket list event so to be here\nNow they're just trickling into the stadium right now it's going to be packed with a hundred thousand plus an about an hour and a half but just driving into the stadium and seeing how many tailgate or is there were and how many spots there were just you know this is one of those places that you want to be there to the U.S\nFantastic environment and under the lights here tonight or be just after a seven thirty local time kick here in Ann Arbor obviously just after six thirty for our listening audience back in Wisconsin let's talk about the biggest challenge that\nFaces the badgers tonight is how their defense through attrition through injuries through a first half was mentioned first got Nelson how can they hold up\n[laughter] that's that's the biggest question today to me it obviously starts with a front seven and can they generate enough pressure to make life difficult for shape Patterson\nAnd help those guys on the back end out because we know as they allowed or milk is not going to play one of the starting defensive and\nThe team right now has five packs and that's among the lowest in the country and so they need to be able to figure out how to get some pressure up front or but on the back end is Ron Harold going to be able to play as these are Williams going to be able to play and and right now as they haven't really started warming up yet we don't quite know\nSo I mean the pressure then ends up being up pressure is maybe the wrong word but the onus is on Jim Leonard to find a way to scheme up some defensive stops because maybe from a personal standpoint not going to have all the bodies he wants to have available\nYeah that's right and and when we talk to Jim this week he mentioned that I said is there a certain point they never use use it as an excuse they never use injuries as an excuse 'cause you have to have eleven guys on the field but I said is there a certain point where the defensive coordinator you start to feel hamstrung about what you can do\nAnd he said he realizes that if he put together a game plan it can be the greatest game plan ever but if you guys don't go out and execute it it doesn't mean anything so he may have to tweak things for guys who are experiencing something that they haven't experienced before and obviously if anybody can do it you would think at the gym given his experience and really what he's been able to do with defensive coordinator here in a year and a half\nFull Crist's donors radio show earlier this week talked about team wins map brought it up [noise] um this is one of those were maybe a little bit more onerous ends up being on the fence to bail that defense out just a little bit maybe stay on the field longer it's easy to say going to be really hard to do against these Michigan defund I agree\nCompletely I think that is a reasonable thing to say coming into this game the often was hyped up so much and I was among those people writing about it because it's often be one of the three best we've ever seen from a statistical standpoint I still think they have an opportunity to get there you mentioned Jonathan Taylor's numbers\nHim being able to get five yards for yard five yards and continue to move the change is going to be a huge\n... being able to hit a big third down paths or a play action when the defense is creeping up it's going to be massive because Michigan's defend the typically speaking as the best in the country they have the number one past event the number six Russian defense so yes the the often can't keep the chains moving that's obviously going to help out the defense who's not going to be wearing out as\nEasily so the ... of anybody playing Wisconsin from their defense to the badgers ... is to crowd that box they've been doing it for a long time try to take away the run game and make Wisconsin beat him in the pro game if that's indeed what Michigan tries to do out of Wisconsin fare against it and you know [noise]\nI think Alex has shown a lot that season and I know he's taking some criticism over the years from ... fans for his turnover rate and certainly last season when he threw Fifteen interceptions that was far too many there are only four quarterbacks and the FBI the three more but through you know this stage of the season easily thrown a couple\nAnd what he did against I I think showed how good he can be especially in that second half nine for ten and completely all five passes on the go ahead Dr I think he has it in Canada receivers create enough separation\nAnd one thing that Wisconsin is done well it it's not just about the wide receivers Jake first Garrett gross jacket on third down and so if you can sprinkle enough guide to keep Michigan's events honest and that's\nGoing to be huge one of the question mark there has been when the game has set up and Alex was early in his maturation [noise] maybe he didn't handle this beat up game very well like when he was really rushed in trying to get rid of a ball quickly and he's matured in that regard that will be tested tonight he\nHas any quarterback that can get his feet that is going to throw a better ball but I think it's been a pretty good job this season of being able to roll out of the pocket and complete path as you've seen\nMaybe a little bit more mobility no one's gonna mistake came for the fastest quarterback but I think that contributed to his maturation and the numbers reflect it I mean football focused and put together every week who's the highest rated quarterbacks and the best players and the Big Ten and he's up there and so he's shown on the field that he can take that next step what is it\nThat you will have your eyes drawn too early to see maybe a direction this game I take\nIt to me it starts with Wisconsin defensively and and what are we going to be because what happened last week against Nebraska if you're a bad you're listening it probably didn't do much confidence Nebraska ruled for five hundred Eighteen yard total\nFour hundred and seven yards passing certainly Michigan or has the capability to do that with their skill position players what shape Patterson coming off the season I Do a hundred eighty two yards passing against Maryland so I Want to see if this Wisconsin defense can get off the field on third down and give the ... and it's an opportunity to do what we think they are capable\nOf doing Jesse appreciate your pension board ship and we'll visit with the on the radio this week and\nEnjoy the game tonight

the time they played was constant last year that the stumbling began from Michigan so [noise]\nI I think when we talk about from Wisconsin how how good is Wisconsin you start to find out some things I think he's pretty much the same thing about Michigan starting tonight\nEarlier this afternoon we watch Ohio State kind of sleep walk through a game at home against Minnesota that being said they still wind by sixteen and again that they didn't pay a whole lot of attention to it seemed\nThat they were not part of that game I was watching Minnesota's running backs and big holes to run down real high stakes defense is not to the standard that very used to and may stay the same thing about Wisconsin feel the badgers I have a lot of new starters Ohio State they don't have ... he's hurt\nBook and that's one guy and you think of a program like that there's such great job but they were given up a lot now at the end of it all Minnesota missed a couple of field goals turned the ball over Ohio State did not look impressive fence away in his game didn't run the ball very well but\nWhat helps those guys is that they have a quarterback who throws it may be as well as anybody in college football in Dwayne Haskins and went into outlet um spin it can usually good things are going to happen\nWhere the west is concerned I kinda hope maybe we see something different from the Iowa Indiana game but I Would do their work there I thought maybe that was one that could be a bit if they did their job that other game in Evanston was well I don't know what to say about it yeah if\nYou're if you're a Scott ... you're probably wondering what what else can you say to your team is just\nAs we mentioned last week there are some pretty good players on that team there's talent the quarter back to two receivers featured running back is very good but the vets Italy they've just had a world of trouble for a while and when you're up ten bleeding the game against north western team but I think is a dangerous one but\nIt was really struggled at home this season you find a way to lose you just enough to lose the rats can do that in the opening game against Colorado deterrent against Troy made mistakes last week\nAnd it's it's just a hodgepodge of things like a lot of penalties you get a shot down step it rolls back to the quarter back in a critical situation they just right now or a program is doing enough to ... we can we do\nMath final thought is here in this stadium tonight it's always special coming to this arena in this environment and here playing under the lights on the field and this has a set up where Wisconsin is going to have to answer some significant questions about what they can put out their defense\nOf their death is really being tested here as it was last week with\nThe first of all you don't have eyes they allowed or milk so your thoughts his also being tested against a Michigan off and it's just not afraid to try to pound the ball and yet the secondary gets the most attention not going to have Scott now some of the first out because of the targeting penalty\nBut they've had some other guys getting picked up as we saw last week and you're you're digging fairly deep into your death sharp by going to see a lot of rich shot while news\nHere again today among others so\nYou just you know Jim others try to find guys you can go in there and make some place to with all of that going on like\nYou really look for the Wisconsin office to help and one of the ways that can help to keep in Michigan is often softer field it's that old line if you can shorten the game a little bit as part of what was going to try to do tonight easier said than done against us Michigan decent I\nMet very good men Michael takeover it a few minutes game time

from a weather conditions factor zero it will be perfect conditions for a game but this is there is an atmosphere here that's unique to the stadium this facility and players have to deal with that\nYeah that does you know the door the coliseum since college football there really is and it's a it's an interesting set up and that there there is no upper deck here it's just one solid section of feeding all the way around it if they do there is no advertising is building a ... a lot like Notre Dame stadium where\nThey're not billboards and kind of or like the rose bowl maybe it's just very traditional everything it matches\nFrom a brick facade outside to the\nBlock ever paid under the tent inside one thing I Can't get over though is that the astro turf in this deal that they've got that field service that is so common these days but what I think of Michigan football with a big house I it's hard for me to get to her because it feels like it's been grass that my mind that there is a grass field there's grass stains on Michigan plays at home\nRight in and the thing with the turf then is that they can't over water outside the hash marks which they bend it\nMight not be on the other thing that is there's a hundred and ten thousand people that will be here today it's one of the larger stadiums I was in college football but I don't think it's one of the loudest one that has that\nMaybe the configuration sounded a little bit but um but I think that a place like Penn State of Ohio State that have similar numbers are are much larger much louder atmosphere so I'll probably be even my word for the veterans are on their down off it later today but that's kind of what I've observed from previous trips here well let's\nSee how that part of it plays out now from an injury standpoint the news that we already knew this week was not good way of Wisconsin most concerned from an injury and for that matter a first ... got Nelson now we get more bad news word decode addiction is concerned\nYeah unfortunately decode addicting will not play that game I don't think he'll address he came out here tried to do something\nShut them down and said that he's not going to go so\nThat means you're going to have to safety starting\nIn the backfield making their first career stars who that is going to be cut her remains to be seen it a little bit ... certainly be one of them they
