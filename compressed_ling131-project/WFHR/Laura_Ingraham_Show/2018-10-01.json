since two thousand and twelve is a team come from more than four games back\nWith twenty five or less games remaining\nTo ah to at least come close to winning the division the last time it happened the Oakland A's did it and they took over the top spot in the national or the American league west on the last day of the regular season they were four and a half back\nGoing to early September when they came back and they ended up winning their division is very tough to do the brewers have done it\nAnd now they have the one game playoff which is with the Chicago Cubs for all the marbles when it comes to winning division obviously if they lose their back at a day and Miller Park tomorrow night but you certainly would love to see them when down in Chicago a nasty day down there much like it is here today but uh excitement\nIt rains Supreme reign Supreme right now for this Milwaukee Brewers team in what they did yesterday and they just seem to be rolling the cubs yesterday\nThey ended up just steam rolling St Louis or they're bad started to come to light now the good news is is that they have not been able to sustain such a success all season long when they do that may have been up and down off ... brewers to a certain extent have been but brewers have had\nIt's a success and a lot of different areas than the than the cubs have but\nAnyway should be a good went down to Wrigley

irritating like Sam paper underwear cubs fans so they haven't oh let's go to day you're listening to us in West bend day walking to the program though Michael sure what's going on man\nHow's it going I'm doing well today are more\nActually cause you call them pass and was kind of get a new for the comment that with me and I just wanted to explain what me about comment and they had nothing to do with the fact that all in all the brewers\nCouldn't win couldn't get the wild card when you made the comment you and said right after that cup series you it said um after they took two or three you came back and I think there about three and a half back maybe for back and you had said the brewers are playing for the wild card trick and the my eyes\n[noise] they could win wild card at that they could play for the wild card so that they were two and a half back let's say that they don't even get a chance that they don't win the division and he still played for the ... do we're paying for the division that whole time\nAnd one that they could win and that gave you or the ... in that division in the Boston that said that they were so far back then I Know you couldn't\nWell here's my thing that I mean 'cause you're right you're right okay what people latched onto was if I was pulling the fact that they couldn't win the division\nAnd they could what my point was is the typically historically it it it's you know it's a huge help heal climb what they've done people don't realize it's only four games but what they've done is is almost miraculous it hasn't been done since two thousand and twelve and before that\nWas like eight years earlier to come back for more than four games with less than twenty five to play\nBecause you're not facing like the reds every day you're facing good teams tend to do that and to be able to now see in this particular seat is is phenomenal because what happens is most teams\nThat even if they catch the team of them they don't realize you have to not only catch them anti them then you have to go a game ahead of them so technically you're five games back and that's hard to do so what the brewers have done he's basically run up hills swim upstream against history and that's fantastic\nI get that it's just the fact that you would call it like don't even worry about the division they blow it and that that you know they were always playing for that division of joy Lewis council or the players that whole run\nAnd I guess that's what people 'cause that's what I talk to people they're like yeah I can imagine he said they they don't have a shot at it that it shot winter winter when it was the division they always are playing for that division ... or to like it was the case of that I just want the threat\nOr not get it I get it no man I appreciate it by the judge you assume he drops out but I get it but people wanted to act like\nIt like it was like I said they didn't have a shot I said they're playing for the wild card because playing for the division is but you never want to lose sight of that and who you're mathematically eliminated I get that\nBut the likelihood of winning you you have to comprehend what they've done you have to understand it may have beat the odds\nI mean even if you want to look at it as um look look at the odds that Vegas came out with at the time\nWhen we did the odds to win the division went from fifty percent to like eighty nine percent\nThat they were not going to win the division I mean if you put money down in the brewers dwindle division when they were Twenty one to play and they were four games back and you hit this thing today you're making serious cash\nSo\nThe odds were completely stacked against them I'm Glad they overcame yard but my point was you let an opportunity to go and now instead of playing for ... and really being close to kind of focusing on that division\nYou have clinched the wild card because the division now is so far away but they did it paid they did it they brought me wrong it's fantastic\nThat's fantastic but some of you just use it like this springboard into something like you're more knowledgeable and more of a fan and that's not it that's why it's horse crap I'm basically giving new fact in statistics and you want to do to ignore that and the ... in order to that's great\nBut when we give you something like that I'm only giving you for for a historical point of reference I'll go to Shawn listening to us in California showing how you doing that I mean what's going on\nI honestly I almost right now and it was fantastic\nI worked for him to search for that because I brought up with that but obviously I'm driving to get [noise]\nUm but I Do not like how I Know it's probably going to run and getting up um but I'm curious what you think about what is going to go\nOn let me see appreciate the phone call first of all the ... he's been your best picture I mean let's be honest I mean after the beginning of the season once you've really got going he's been your best best picture so to start to see and that's basically saying we're we're throwing the best of the cops\nJust seen has a one fifty nine ER and forced starts against the cubs the season so there you go twenty two and two thirds innings for earn runs\nHe has been lights out against them so that as soon as this decision as are just there you go paid five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight it's um\nHis team leading in career high thirty fifth started the season the fifth time he's seen the cubs us started last Wednesday against St Louis got a two to one when as a team clinched the postseason birth remembering went five innings one hit one Ron Warner and run a couple of walks three strike out just\nHi by the way we don't talk about your scene but in the Lorenzo Cain and the Christian yell at you knew stock is you know all the different guys were brought in it's a career high and when she was seeing a career high thirty fifth started the season for shifting\nAnd he started out small everybody went oh my God and I think it kinda tainted people's view he's been fantastic\nHe's been fantastic last evening\nWhen Thirteen and ten with a three eighty nine Erie and thirty to start from San Diego that was his then career high best when it came to wins\nBut against the cubs he's four and six with the two Ninety eight year a lifetime eleven games ten starts including two in two of the one fifty nine ... for storage this season\nBill I Would have added my picture eighth and this one get ahead or down in that nine hole second and third time through maybe it's an additional base runner for ...\nWhich wouldn't allow them to pets around you saw Lorenzo came yesterday and the game had a double and you're like alright it sets a table for Christian they can hit a three run no second third and first base a wide open what happens for in the air intentional walk\nThat's that could happen today so it's up to the it's up to the hitters coming up before yellow to force forced the hand of town on the cubs\nOr how would you pitch the cubs because the cubs had been a team obviously yesterday were on fire and they were hit the ball over the park and they've hit the ball better in the series against St Louis St Louis was almost like punch drunk coming in that series ever getting swept read by the brewers we thought maybe they might do a little bit more but they didn't uh but how would you pitch the cubs\nQuicker rhythm once you get an out let's go grip and rep and let's see if shot scene can get into a rhythm and get into\nYou know the cubs are going to ... they will try it and I don't blame them you know stepping out and ... is going to be one of them second and third time through the order by he will and maybe even the first time through the order he's going to try to take over and we all we have all seen that all year long\nThat they have tried to break that read them and in terms of the gamesmanship I don't blame them do the same thing with the quickest way to get this done as get shot seen get the get the fingers down getting out and just roll from right there\nI'm looking at this series between these two teams like you said there's no secrets is there anything\nI I guess anything any button and the manager's going to push that you think is going to be the magic button I mean obviously already she's seen today is is to me it was a no brainer I mean if you really want to them as you go with your best chance the only thing I can say is he hasn't been great at Wrigley Field you wanted to read we feel but is there any specific\nButton that you think is just sitting there waiting to be pushed\nThey can't wait to push it and you do have what's interesting here all four of these teams Iraqis Dodgers brewers in cubs they they all sort of have to play it in a two game ... sequence and I've thought long and hard about that and and that's a\nPhilosophy in her perspective that you're not really used to you're not really used to saying hey man we need to go all and push the chips in and get this when\nIt's not necessarily that easy philosophically you get caught and a half that the first one to lose two is bounced and the way it is so you have to play it in in that regard but in this particular game\nThis secret button is the fifth inning if the brewers have ah the league and the fifth inning that's going to be tougher council not to go with a string of bull banners that are going to go out there and get out to do their job get back in the dugout and that I'm Talking about carbon burns in the fifth\nSo are you in the sex can able in the seventh hate or in the eighth and then obviously Jay Jay and the night if you can get a lead after four innings\nMore times than not and we'll see how it shakes out because the cubs have been there man they've got some experience in step it up and postseason play so it's not as easy as that but get to get through for through the bottom of the fourth inning\nAnd that is going to be the magical moment there if they have the lead\nWho right now would be a rotation in the postseason would you would change is cheesy interesting for sure and that rotation because he struggled or because he's been good at certain points you keep them in there\n[noise] I I Would have to think long and hard about in in in a front three not having him in there and why a because there's such close games in the postseason and not that we're experts in the postseason because quite frankly we're not and that's unfortunate and hopefully that tight as as turn but\nUh that three run Homer on when runners are on base\n[noise] ah I think they're mortified would chase than are sent out there with that situation could chase and you know step up and throw seven innings of\nYou know to run you know five had baseball of course he could\nBut ... where a rubber hits the road is going to be when there's two or three runners on base and is it a game changing home run and we all know chase Anderson is susceptible to the long wall that can change the game that can change a\nYou know a close game type ballgame tier one run game and do a little bit of wiggle room for the opponent\nFear and that's why I think Jay Sanders it hasn't been in their\nEye or if by chance and I don't want to talk about the loss but if they lose this game I guess the good news is that yesterday they had a blowout win and they were able to save the top relievers Corey can able Jeremy Jeffries Josh hater\nSo those guys didn't have to pitch hopefully they don't have to ah maybe should've seen gives you five six innings today and you don't have to completely burned everybody up to do this and and the closest thing now I'm the cubs obviously more conventional approaching as a by the time it's all said and done\nWhat have you seen ends up pitching today\nAnd then they reach the division series that probably leaves weighed my lead to start game down correct\nYeah yeah and I think he's been man has been just battle and and the numbers bear that out his is a body language barriers that out to look at his face it's he has been having a blast out there and really one out at a time and and I I'm All right with that first for sure\n[noise] um before I let you go got to ask you a today's production\nType ball game I mean this is going to be a tight ball game and this is going to be a situational game every pitch every every inning\nOr their runners on base um you know it is that going to be a\nA sacrifice is they're going to be hidden behind runners how aggressive war the brewers be on the base paths that's that's key here to uh do they want to get some mojo role and enforce the hand watch the backpacks from ... um so you're going to have to ... situational\nJust grab a bowl of popcorn take that take the day off just to every pet yet and a half\nYou know we couldn't ask for anything more in that regard that collectively bill that the uh community the state of Wisconsin we're we're all hanging on a\nPet if you and we're in a day to to him if you think of this if they win today than they sit back and wait for the winter the wild card game which if the cubs win the wild card game most likely that wild card game they would start Jon Lester which means in your series I Would not face Jon Lester at least until game three or four\nAnd they have gone through part of that rotation so you don't even have to face Lester twice you only get him once in a you know the show big big I mean as far as a ... you know was was riding on his game today you win this game things really begin to set up for you\nOh they do and they will have ... regardless uh again they still have as good a chance as anybody in the ... the four four remaining remaining teams anybody in the an out and that's where the brewers are here\nAnybody they have as good a chance to go to the world series and and that is that's just the landscape now and and don't don't think that this is the brewers of old they're very very good baseball team\nJim can't wait for the post game show man I'll be driving up the Green Bay

G O wrote an article saying that he called a ... of the most aggressive manager in all of baseball\nAnd it took me aback for a minute and then I kinda thought about it do they have enough pitching I think most of us would have agreed when you looked at starting pitching do they have enough probably not what the way they used the bullpen this year\nYeah I mean when you started to see the bullpen feel any you started it started to see everybody have their roles\nYou kind of ... you know so did I think they look do they have enough starting\nGo six strong every game no they don't have enough they don't have it but because of the way they use the bullpen they look to the bullpen has an extended shorter and they've actually use the bullpen as a starter in place of a starter it's it it's worked out I mean it's been fantastic\n[noise] or just a few minutes ago credit council address the media and he talked about the status of his both and this is from Adam ... the quote\nThat was a big part of Sunday when ... junior Guerra in Jordan Lyles covered all nine innings in that\nEleven nothing one over the tigers we had to work hard to get through the first two days of the weekend there are still challenges with today's game obviously\nIn that it's not a wild card game there's a game tomorrow for the loser I think you keep that in mind we're going into this game today in a better place than we were yesterday we had guys off limits yesterday no matter what today we have to be judicious with how we deploy these guys mhm\nBecause you may have a game tomorrow you could possibly have\nAgain tomorrow [noise] see I got to think if shot scene is on his game and they gave you a limited numbers against the cubs a season it's very good enforced starts\nI Can't imagine he's going to pull shot scene early even if it is two times to the lineup if shot seems feeling it I think he's going to give him a longer leash just to fill up more ... less stress on these guys\nI'd like to think so\nI mean I Know we're talking about match ups and stuff and you may have some good bullpen match up that you could have in this game which means pulling shot seem would make sense but anything anything can change later in the game and the last thing you need to lose their game going in the wild card tomorrow and now all of a sudden you're\nThe guys you want to use in that game may not necessarily be available mhm\nEight five five eight three zero eight six four eighty five five eighty three zero eight six way because I I've got one here from David who says I think uh I think great council should unload the bullpen today on the Chicago Cubs and go ahead and give it has all this team has got to get this when\nThis is where this isn't mourning done this is one and move on regardless of what happens is that you're still playing baseball so you don't want to burn up every body\nAnd your your main guys in in what may end up being and losing effort so to speak you know what I mean I mean you don't want to you don't want to burn up everybody you know like I've just seen shows trouble in the second inning and then would start cities out I don't know if you do that\nBecause you still got to come back and you may have to go bullpen by committee or started by committee or whatever it is you're going to run out there again tomorrow night if you lose the game\nSo I don't know if I burn everybody up I didn't I don't know if this the all hands on deck game tomorrow would be if you lose but I don't know today he is\nBut like Joe said the fact that you didn't have to use these guys on Sunday they've got that extra break basically they had that day to recuperate eight five five eight three zero eight six boys go to Jim listening to us in Waukesha Jim how you doing to the man was added\nA this is a very or we go to the door county and we were up there over the weekend yeah they were out to dinner friday night Saturday Night and it was crazy every [laughter] what happened that police will go wild [laughter]\nEverybody was was going around to Cardozo one and the cardinals are winning it everybody's like oh this is talk about the Packers off I was going on and then you know we're at a wine tasting and there's all these fans in LA they actually have to be a cubs fan but it was she cuts\n[laughter] well the ... you know what they put it on yesterday against St Louis as well\nI Know it at the time they were losing like to developing that a card [noise] she was a cat you know I feel sorry for that I could buy a drink once I get them for free\nRight now no doubt that the first year of the [laughter] ...\nEverybody purchased the phone call everybody's on fire right now hey when when you're sitting in in the press box that limbo field and people are talking about the brewers score you know normally it's all ... all the time yesterday you could hear it kinda hey brewers scored again brewers scored again cubs are up Bruce scored again that type of thing that was going on [noise]\nWonderful I'm up in ... they are going to ... sports bar with by companies run just here and we're going to be on a hunk of recovery than when\nYou go to keep your fingers crossed they get a win today hopefully they can what's the score give me\nA five to five okay I'll go with that offer\nDo on the er during an operational Coby\nCoby haunting today nothing wrong with that always go ahead man\nHe drops off you get on board eight five five eight three zero eight six forty five five eight three zero eight six for eight\nAnd I thought he was gonna make a point about hater so we had in the screener hate or does it was going to lead to a quote from ... council earlier about Josh hater because he has struggled a little bit as of late [noise] how do you remember the three runs he gave up against the cardinals gave up by a crucial running that first game against the tigers but says what credit counseling to say quote\nOn the recent hiccups I don't have a perfect answer for you Josh is better with rest it's important for every reliever someone who is throwing his many innings as he had some more so somebody who pitches with his style it's important he was on the most or or yeah he was on the most dominant\nAll season earlier in September we use them a little differently last week obviously we're in must win trying to clinch playoff certainty so he's coming into today with two days off which is a really good thing or you go so I guess you would expect Josh later today\nWhy not unless the child the cubs you know he's one of the guys that got you there I I don't I don't think you just bloom out\nHe's one of the guys who got you this far it would be nice to get\nA turnaround support today it would be nice if the brewers finally get the hose they can kind of interest shell on\nThat way you don't even have to use him and now you give them even more rest heading into Thursday for the animal ds and then he's ready to go the way ... you know the the the the fear is if you do use them today which if you're in that situation you have to but now\nIf the brewers end up losing that game at the end\nNow you're in a situation tomorrow or it's like okay well see I said are going to be available or not right\nI guess it depends how long you pitch and maybe just pitch them for an Indian today then that's not as bad going in and tomorrow but at the pictures to weddings and the ... still find a way to lose that ball game and that's going to her going in and tomorrow eight\nFive five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eighty three zero eight six foray give us the shower what are you got going on today you're thinking about the the Green Bay Packers and the pitching the shut out yesterday or\nAre you are all brewers all the time right now is the brewers had down Chicago game one sixty three at Wrigley Field winner takes the national league central eight five five eight three zero eight six for a back to it let's go to Kyle issues and brown to your ... how you doing that and that was happening\nHey how's it going again yes their birthday and that was fantastic it was awesome what a great atmosphere right\nOh yeah beautiful atmosphere I think I ever feeling I Wish I was trying to get on to him out or the other day where he was taking predictions and I think it's going to be a close one but I think the thing that birds are going to pull it out I think it's can be fixed by game since our\nDexter five but I think that's what's gonna happen in the in this crappy crappy weather yep so on but the other thing is that you're saying that uh you know the birds have to watch you know who they put in there no in this game you don't want to have to watch your you put in there\nBecause if we win the whole thing you've got two days to prepare for the next time so by that time you'll have your guy pretty much rested again because you've got to be they break mhm I don't I don't agree not going with it all and the other thing is\nIs I Know the brewers have always been you know sort of if you throw at our guy you know we're not really to do anything you think this is the game if if one of the companies try to take it out one of our guys that we actually try a new one of their guys and all\nThat to appreciate the phone call that's a great question my my reaction to that immediately use it depends on what the umpire reaction is suppose the cubs could say come inside on yell at you and hit him okay\nIf a warning is not distributed I Would certainly hope\nAs long as it's not in a situation that you're going to put some ... somebody on base it with the winning run or tying run because you don't want to do that but at the brewers are up like two or three hours just having a good game and say they had him yeah I Hope they drill somebody\nWell you don't want to get into a situation where warnings issued and then suddenly you got a guy being ejected from a ball game you don't want to do it in a in a stupid way so I'm hoping that yes if it comes down to that yes there's retaliation but that will be something that you hold as a feather in your cap\nOr otherwise showers a in sections of the city early today a partly sunny and warmer light southeast wins as the day goes on um so that's what they're saying Hi from the mid seventies far north to low eighties to the south now I don't see that happening today\nIt is yeah this is WGN nicer weather forecast\nSupposed to be Seventy two am I reading that currently is it really going to be Seventy two\nAlthough we're seeing guys out there with a little bit of some bomb maybe it is we're seeing right now and the big screen TV ABC audio video big screen TV Christian yellow dj clapping his hands of the MVP what I Believe he's going to be a out there right now in a little bit of sun and a little bit warmer weather and short sleeves so maybe it is just to the south a lot\nWarmer than it is here in the state of Wisconsin who now but that's what it's supposed to be it's supposed to clear up a little bit so it's not going to be terrible down there is cloudy and nasty as it is here\nGoing to be interesting to uh you mentioned Christian yell at you against ... ton of the season we always talked about this this man had any weakness well he has struggled against can sign a he is one for eleven\nBack\nThen can time or maybe you pitch to him until he doesn't tell you can't get 'em out then again you know just so hot right now I don't even know if I take that chance I I'll tell you what\nI'm kind of expecting Christian yells you get at least one hit off of can you how to today if they actually do pitched if if the games zip zip storage early don't pitch to him but if the game becomes late in ...\nOr it's a situation in which he can hurt you\nThen I Would assume that they're not going to pitch to maybe I'll leave it at that we're also wondering also hinged on Lorenzo king if he gets on base of yellow it it's it's big time those guys those guys around yell at you have to be able to get up I don't know if you really want to walk Christian yell at you put runners on personnel that\nNo I agree a five five eight three zero eight six way by the way I tweeted this out\nRadio Joe and I showed you the picture we're doing the cousin subs things here in Studio to that

L. team al ... is a great feat um but\nIt's gonna be holiday gotta be overreacting actually good quarterback\nIt certainly brought their averages their numbers in the line I mean you know we were talking earlier you know totally yard age they're sixteen to lead to look at a total scoring defense there are limits in the league and\nThose two numbers are usually what I go to when I look and say okay you know they have never talked to in defense but let me ask you this are they really from what you've seen a top ten defense\nI don't think so I I think there's too many holes on that side of the football to say\nTheir top ten defense I think um yesterday uh giving up a hundred and\nForty four hundred and forty four yards that's pretty good you know you look at the first three weeks of the season and it wasn't so good um\nSo I think you know going into this week it's you know we've got to see the same type of a\nPressure from the middle of the of the defense and going to have to see some more similar turtle there's a the secondaries well\nWhat do you like about that secondary I was we were talking last night about Joe your legs energized Jones or John Jackson\nUm ah Clinton Dix boy I tell you what that pick that he had yesterday I was a physical interception [noise] um I it seems like maybe with that exuberance of youth in some guys that can actually back it up a little bit now granted Alexander in Jackson are still gonna go through growing pains but it seems like they have very short memories in big attitudes and\nSome people don't like it I like it I like that they already have a ... swag about him and and they've got a couple of big hits in some highlight moments to prove it\n... I bet you did did they go up there and prove it that's that's the telltale sign I'm you know everyone is going to go out and talk but they do it they they prove with um\nA couple of things I like about the defense I've I I you know you talked about those two gentlemen Jagger Alexander's or the athletic as they come they can turn 'em and he can he can stop and start on a dime\nThat's pretty impressive for a guy like that are ... and you look at someone like Josh jak says he doesn't have the top in speed and the forty hour gash plays much faster and he's got a really long arm so he you know he uses it wasn't as if to his advantage in favor of what we've seen it already in four games knocking away several balls\nOn he's going to get those interceptions they are gonna come just because of his aggressiveness\nLook also really really wanted\nTo remind Williams I Love for modern ways back there I mean having him back and I think is a tremendous tremendous addition to their secondary\nI was just gonna say looking at your mind Williams and the return he's very quietly been pretty good I mean the boring calling his name because not thrown at it it's one of the young guys throwing the term on Williams I mean they're still going to be said for a little bit of respect that the veterans garnered\n... and if you don't hear their name from a secondary standpoint that's usually a pretty good sign I mean there's the ball's not around them\nAnd then when you do hear his name is he's making place I'm not always on the receiver in front of him but by running after a running backs 'em and and then getting in on a on the ... so yeah I think having him as a huge addition to the defense\nI'm looking at the line backing that they had yesterday I saw blade Martinez played a really really solid game ... showings yesterday in that ball game you and I were talking about that are coming out of the ... the post game as well and just looking at the defensive statistics when they got to ah when they go to John shelling yesterday\nThey ended up with seven science in the day I don't know if that's normal\nReally indicative of Tyler factor with three of those things to talk about his play\nWell he got he got the at the end of the game you did beat the backup or\nA counter around the corner um and then he the other another sack that guy I Know that you gave them free by my count to the other one was with an effort play where um it was a twist play and ah I'm Clark came around the outside and they've been flushed it in the cage and he\nHe basically ran right into a which is okay it's real problem you can't I mean you can't take that away from and then there was a fall down on if you remember but it was the fall down sac\nWhere um they get nailed it basically he was the closest guy around there so they gave him the sec ah so I don't know a ... I'm not explicit you know I don't think anyone is again not ... getting many parades first ... um\nRoutine is also had a had a solid performance I'm certainly got a little bit more opposition and he has been last year but you would think those things are stark and cleaned up I guess the disappointing that part of the land back to the core is um is the uh the other back or who's playing and they're out you know opposite of a martini as it's\nOr if it's gonna be a or and bricks that those guys got and they place 'cause right now it's not very good\nYou know more said yesterday had a couple of physical plays got it on one tackle had a quarterback hurry along the way as well and I I I liked the fact that he likes to play physical you just need more out of that and ... is still finding is white three tackles yesterday really nothing\nUh you know huge to show for he just was right place right time and and kind of did his job very quietly but there is nothing right now that spectacular out of that particular that particular group that you know\nOther than claim as we talked about that to claim that you get him to ... and take away those two penalties you haven't held a year\nAbsolutely ... for sure what the thing with more it gets caught flat footed far too often street or in concrete that's probably the reason why they're willing to get rid of them and indeed there is it just\nDoesn't he doesn't react very well and sometimes he's making you know getting in the capital you barely moved to the ... they're running back as running right so that that's the part that's concerning the or British it's more of you know he's a\nHe's a couple of steps up above have white hit there because he's a he's a little bit on the on the center side you know white has two hundred pounds of eight to thirty so you know it's not a whole lot of difference there but there certainly are some so\nBut the other end of it is going to be that hard work ethic is going to be the guy in the future [noise] um but he's just going to have to to get more wraps and below bloody nose up a little bit\nTo me that you're seeing week as we continue the Packers football or a great stuff makes them feel it in yesterday we certainly appreciate talking at the end of the week okay\nYeah I had a great time make sure you get home and watch ever again\n[laughter] yeah I'm sitting here with a dog with it on right now as a matter of fact so I'll get home watch that and they had the Green Bay 'cause we've got the logical or pick up tonight as well so we're looking forward to they are free All right John sooner aircraft checking the rebate ...\nJoining us for a couple of minutes when there's not orange outline Schneider hiring drivers right now you work hard to treat you fair eighty plus years of begin to get a caller i._d. hundred forty prior to go to shatter jobs dot com why in the world you would pitch doing\nI have no idea but Christian you know they were they line drive back up the box drives and the first run of the game and the Milwaukee Brewers are up one nothing top of the third right now over the Chicago Cubs in what does that mean for the Milwaukee Brewers what does that mean for the Milwaukee Brewers well let me tell you something\nWhen the brewers a score first\nOkay where's that number when the brewers score first they're Seventy three and twenty eight on the season\nSeventy three and twenty eight on the season when your opponent scores first they were twenty two and thirty nine on the season statistically historically the Christian yell edge based knock RBI up the box\nGives them the better opportunity say to more than like a show next\nWe'll Michael's sports talk word am\nThirteen twenty W.
