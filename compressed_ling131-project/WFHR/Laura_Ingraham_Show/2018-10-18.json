team and I said they're going to keep coming uh there's no doubt about that I still think the brewers can win this thing\nThe one thing they need to do and and I think it's mashed with the obvious but when they come home on friday night they got to get up early obviously the bachelor the top of the lineup me to wake up Canada yes will they\nBoard I don't know I don't know I I don't know I I'm I'm not I'm not\nNews here but he runs okayed it was good to see him get a couple of hit yesterday but between him a Christian yell at you have to say goodbye who is just a vacant when it comes to hitting was runners in scoring position it has been awful it has been awful offensively the brewers\n[laughter] it's been unconventional to watch them used to the bullpen into pitching staff I mean if anything we've learned from this postseason is good pitching will get you there spectacular pitching will shut things down her show a spectacular yesterday he was ... there is no secrets\nSees number was going to have to go get a starter to it it's it's there's zero secret you're probably going to have one or two of you guys from the pen they're going to move up into the starting rotation which is great which is really great you're going to have a top to bottom pretty solid staff but whatever you take from the pen then that's a depletion of your pan\nYou're going to need something ... ... what could they possibly get they build they have like ten guys\nCompeting for five spots next year or knows the lowly may use in traditional starting rotation right but you need the there's the one thing you learn was yesterday ... came in and shut you down that's that you need that one guy and Brennan ... went out there and did his job yeah\nThere is no run support yeah and every time they go to the bullpen it's one less guy in the pen I agree with you about the run support I completely agree with that the issue here it's not the pitching staff no no no ... is the gay also Iran's Joe\nThey still have a five rounds yesterday is pitching they're gonna be five to want to pitching staff has gone up the address lately is really going to have a bad day with the real thing all of this different movement out of a pitching staff is because they don't have consistent starters top to bottom\nYou have to manipulate all of this stuff you know and do all these movements because you don't ever started I agree with you it has been spectacular pitching staff has been great but I guarantee you\nJosh later with the up and coming started he was coming out of the pen and they were going to make him a starter and they never did they looked at him and said you're another long relief guy\nRight now the emphasis on wrong relief going into in the next year which is the reason we saw so many starting pitchers this you're not get the big contracts\nBecause the emphasis on starting pitching unless you're Clayton Kurdish are just in Berlin or just isn't there anymore you want a starting pitcher would I Want one guy who's going to get me five ... or more at least you has been ten guys to choose from well then they better than I Am good because you have to have a one two and three\nBill I Am not worried about next year in the pitching staff that is the last ... honestly there and we we can talk all about this year over the next couple of months the off season is going to\nBe interesting I still think they're going to win the series but I just last night while you're making it sound like it sounds like third do they know they have already back on this and I'm saying this should have been over\nI agree it should have they have been able to close it out no Jeffers had a bad game in game two when I get it through eighth inning doom them starting pitching I Know I I agree with the fact that they ended up losing that game the other night because of the opposite is to be able to manufacture run which is something I talked about this this morning I was doing a couple of different shows this morning\nAnd the fact and and this was asked to me the same thing why does Craig council why can't you send up a pitcher to drop down about why can't you manufacture run why can't you and I said it you know\nI I I Want him to defend them and I say look they've done it this way all year long it got him the best record in the national league how can you sit here and this pick this then again they made a good point is well wait a minute championship teams do everything well\nAnd I said I Can't I Can't argue with that news team fundamentally when it comes to manufacturing certain run sucks\nAll right well I take a quick break let's do this we'll come back we'll take some phone calls eight five five eight three zero eight six boys also Herald Reynolds

to have you [noise]\nLet's do this is the phone calls in our ah Schneider orange outline and will be network analyst Harold Reynolds\nYou can watch the movie network will be tonight which airs lied before each and every game the L see as a games that are going on right now Harold how you doing\nI'm doing good man how are you\nWell we're uh we're recovering more nitpicking more second guessing you and we're trying to figure it out I mean the brewers had a shot and getting to to uh get really a stranglehold on this thing game for kind of slipped away from them and yesterday they weren't able to get the job done so tell me what you think of as to how this game has or how the series is gone for the brewers\nWell you know they are and how to be up against it because of the ... you know the opening that they're trying to do and and try to get through 'em and so you know they're gonna have to get leads early and hope they can hold on all parents to have which I thought you know it worked the first couple of games that are so great strategy\nUm I was listening to you guys going to break talking about manufacturing route but\nTo me I think they're the only team and the post season they're not doing that they find themselves down or do you have to be able to move or honors you have to\nWhen you talk about the bull pending I was getting into this discussion with Joe while the strategies and have worked in look pitching really hasn't been the problem for the brewers\nAnd I don't want to get in the next season but then I watch a guy like ... coming down the court shows aren't of the world are out there but when you got a guy that just comes in and shut you down relax is everybody that pan you don't have to worry about you just know what you're going with\nIt seems like there's just something different about a ball club that can do that and so going into next season I'm thinking at least one started up your point somebody from the pen or if you bring somebody else into the situation you need another starter to at least get yourself a little bit deeper into the postseason boil\nThe biggest thing is what happens is what you're saying now it was only in the course of the season I'll go back to when I was planned let's take Dennis Eckersley one of the greatest of all time right mhm though and Dennis Eckersley goes to the closer and I'm planning the American league west and I'm facing a ...\nI saw him maybe\nThree or four times a season you know ... now\nYou get into a playoff scenario you're seeing guys three or four times within a week span and so you start to see you guys a little bit better I started seeing ... the more and more I saw him the better I was able to have an approach was a throwback dorsal either he's not going to show me a fast ball and you start getting Tennessee\nAnd when you have bullpen guys continually coming out you start that low ads loses leaves them I think it allows the Hitler start make some adjustments and see the ball better start housewives\nSo that's that's one side of the bullpen and what happens in the post season and a seven game series you're seeing now is\nStarting to maybe catch up has a better swings are starting to see make adjustments oh this is what this guy's got to do his ball moves this way I'm laying off now that it's safe to that so\nThat the talent the bullpen and that's why a curse or or somebody like that who can go deep and the game\nAllows you to not see a guy that that you may not see two or three different times I hate or apply not going to get hit he's easily\nBut the other guys you start to figure out and get a little bit more ... or so that to me is the the bucket Blue Book banning in the postseason after negative of it the positive is yeah is it different arm every any it's very difficult for hitter hit\n[noise] you see the brewers coming back home they've lost two in a row now something they haven't done in a while\nJust before September a bike or when you come back home you get a little bit early you get your mojo back 'cause you don't seem to have that moment I'm coming back home is it as simple as that to to be able to kind of garnering the momentum or is there something else that this team needs to do to win the next to ball games\nWhile tens of scenery all his health and you know I've been I've been there to mellow park it's electric\nAnd they're going to feed on that that's one of the best uh ballparks in it plus a lousy to run into some balls to become a different Claire the ball's gonna fly it's going to carry you look at some balls that were hitting LA that didn't go out the home runs in Milwaukee\nYou know they changed the games grand says bottle that was hit the other day a ball that that came at the center or you know there's a couple of all to get out of the ballpark that are home runs in Milwaukee and now you don't know what happens with those games so\nUm it changes that ballpark changes how everything is played and I I think it's a little bit more of an advantage from Milwaukee because\nThe next time here's your forecast\nFrom the weather I weather center finished that they knew of the funniest thing though I think the of handling money power and\nDance and I love anything the only thing missing out on friday me that the the thing is not the kind of a higher than ... you have any mass our

of them to pay the Milwaukee joining us now and sugar a boy what an ugly ugly night last night and they come back now trailing three games to two after such a tremendous started to this series and um\nBut they need to shore I don't know how to put it that top of the lineup is just hurting them big time\nYeah they do all the uh you know the different ways to work around their pitching staff like they like they have been doing and I think also doing a great job doing what he has to do to win\nA on the pitch yet but you know he has scored Iran doesn't matter way pilots go on a bill one better if he's going to say but I mean you know it doesn't it doesn't really matter\nYou got to be able to score surprised at all and simply it's just\nIt's a shame because I think the theme is better offensively though they've shown bill I mean you look at the eyes and this order yell at the MVP of the national late getting on the stock is who was pretty good for them in September in August I'm sitting on a on Ninety five so\nThe numbers of this team collectively to Nineteen batting average\nYou ain't going to win a championship level with that kind of a hook that kind of seemed batting average bill\nYou know uh I completely agree it's good to see that guys like many ... Domingo Santana pitching roll a carrot crafts Travis Shaw the guys you play\nAlmost in a platoon fashion they're getting it done but your name mainstays like you had mentioned ... ... Aguilar having a terrible series are not being able to runners and scorn position at all or it's just he's fishing he seems to be lost his your main stays the guys who did it all season long\nHave really really let you down this postseason\nI Would be all for credit getting ... into the starting lineup or getting him into the game at the very least a writer who is pushing for a ... and he left at her and I can see where you know guys like Travis Sean granted would find themselves on the bench\nBut I think the one that that looks a little lost up there I mean the yellow ...\nHe he he talked after the game that he seems a little lost but I feel that you are I I I wouldn't it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world could sit him fourth day and somehow rearrange that order\nYou know shaking things up a little bit at the office of lived this this is the first time we've seen this bill and this this season long thing I thought with the addition of a stock is the batting order\nOr when they picked him up on the royals thought okay you know maybe that's going to be the joke you often means but bill\nWhether it's been hammered fame or wherever it's been it's been brutal offensively this year\nIt is or what we've seen at times where Kane and yell at you bring the guys are kind of pick these guys up and not allow the opposition be stagnant we see the times where they get shut out and then they bounce back they usually have a big game and I really thought yesterday was going to be a bounce back game I thought they were gonna hit the ball like but they're gonna start spraying it all over the park the top of the order gets going\nIt is baffling to me and then I kind of go back to the old adage you're my head good pitching shuts down good hitting and that's what you saw yesterday adequate encouraged him he just he he knows how to pitch him he's got a big sweeping breaking boys get a good number right now\nAnd and they just weren't able to get to the guy um fortunately when you've got a guy that can do that consistently over seven innings that that's a that's a tough nut to crack\nThey settled down in the middle of the things you know I thought they had a chance to bill in the third inning of the vote and Aguilar is up there and uh I mean they got one running in Cain hit the ball as hard as you can destroy the way center field yeah and I thought okay you know maybe this is like you said there I thought\nMaybe they're going to get that could could they be crushed shot twice in a series could that be possible and you know they had a big opportunity that they got the bases loaded\nIranian and ... of the play into them thinking boy if they if they get to run single here three nothing maybe that bill maybe that changes the complexion of gave a little bit\nUh if Aguilar hits the ball in that situation I think you could pretty much of knocked ... out of their game\nAgree that was getting up there this is Brian that's was getting in the fifties set right point and in that case if you get a pitch counted in the fifties and uh you know he continue to work you have a little bit you're going to get them out of that game um but you know if they put they put a cricket number up there and the third inning\nUh I I really believe that changes the complex to the game and you know I thought I thought what ... is great\nYou know I agree I was a fantastic job no doubt um let me ask you this coming back or you know and because they don't fly home until today for people that didn't know they stayed there last night they're coming back today [noise]\nUm so what was the mood like less than obviously don't want to lose a game but what we talked about the resilience of this team and the ability to kind of forget things so what is it like last night walking around the clubhouse [laughter]\nI'm looking forward to getting back home just like the Dodgers are looking forward to a returning the Dodgers stadium after a couple of days in Milwaukee last week I'm looking forward to getting home I'm differently confines of Miller Park there that are mentioned all the players were saying that looking forward to get back the Miller Park\nYou know what we've seen this before and postseason play where a team gets down to the series and they get back on how well that home cooking and they win a couple of games I remember several times government your different I thought the Minnesota Twins I remember when they won both of their World Series they were down ... to\nAround the world series three games to two\nCame back home for a game six and Nineteen eighty seven ... seven one both of those get a Nineteen Ninety One against the Braves won game six one game seven the brewers were down three games a two and the eighty two World Series\nWent the St Louis everybody thought okay the brewers are going to take this thing went to St Louis boss game last game six last game seven turtles in the world series so\nWe have those are just a couple of off the top of my my head where teams have come rally with ever since I I think it's very possible go in and for anybody to say I mean it's easy to get down on these guys right now\nBut for anybody to say the series is over I mean you're getting yourself if they were going if they were down three two going down the road that might be a different story are coming back to the Miller Park that crowd has got to get behind them tomorrow night and um you know there's a lot to play for you get to a game you went around\nAnd you get the game seven bill I think it's game I\nYeah I Am all bets are off if they get a when Martin I I I completely agree with you um I think it just me the key is you know you have to have production tomorrow night from came and yell at you or you have to get up early and you have to have production from those two guys\nTo win that ball game because of those two guys start to flow it seems like everything behind them starts to flow the guy that's been the benefactor of things has seen pictures as Ryan Braun and he he should have had a hit yesterday he had no absolute rocket down to third that just happened to have\nA an excuse me type of catch to it because otherwise it's either you either catch it or die from it one of the two but he hit a rocket yesterday and and he was robbed in that particular play as well but\nI I'm the guy who's been a benefactor's been Ryan Braun hitting almost three hundred in the series and he's been fantastic in the postseason so they can get that top of the line of kind of kind of manufacturing if you run I think they're going to be okay but if they don't eat is going to be a struggle\nI think you're going to have somebody stayed out of the fence of start around I\nHaven't had that yet the postseason or were you just say ... crafts I Would say you know the first\nAnd the series gets Colorado you had a pretty good series but nobody's really hitting well including crafts right in there um but I I I think you're going to have somebody step up to the plate and have a a three or four five RBI night\nAnd uh he's going to go somebody getting all of our real hard on us and uh and they have a big dive and the brewers are going to\nGet a win and I I ... I think it's going to be if you've been saying winder either going to somehow let the ... I think they're going to\nHave a convincing win and then setting up for a game ... that's just my gut feeling I mean it's hard to predict anything but that's just my got right now\nKeeping my fingers crossed jacket on said we'll see you when you get there are ...\nGoing to talk to you later and they go juggling goes to the chicken wings were showing one in five minutes on the banner flights you've station out of Milwaukee joining us for a couple of minutes on the Schneider only challenge none are hiring drivers right now\nYou want to car they treat you fair eighty plus years have been going to get to and called him a hundred and forty four prior to go to not have jobs dot com coming up tonight six to eight bill Michael settled back out on the road again this evening my Clemens is going to be with us tonight Joan mom is in Colgate we're going to be out there terrific\nPlaces well should come on out tonight six day Joe mama's in Colgate just west of one sixty for just a above subjects they were going to a great time that is the bill Michael settled brought you buy a printed Bud Light more about Michael showing oh by the way they got to win will tell you who coming up next to Michael ...\nKilled border film Michael sports talk network\nYou're listening to a um Thirteen twenty WFAN char Wisconsin Rapids central Wisconsin is twenty four hour information station [noise]\n[noise]\nYou CBS News on the hour sponsored by\nTheir works relief I'm Jim ... secretary of state Mike Pompeo is taking a wait and see attitude regarding the disappearance of Washington Post writer ... because she'll be telling the president this morning the U.S should wait a few days to see what the Saudis in church turn up in their investigation\nWe do believe that between these two efforts a complete picture will emerge for what actually transpired here and uh and we're working towards that we're looking forward to that wrapping up quickly and we expect that it will be done in that way correspondent Holly Williams\nIn New York Times is reporting that U.S intelligence agencies are increasingly convinced that Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman line it's comfortable in his parents\nSeveral at the Saudi suspect identified by techie reportedly had linked to the print including one not ... parent company Honda been found on hitting us here and here with previous they assigned as a diplomat in London\nThe president took to Twitter to Warner southern neighbors about that large caravan of migrants heading north toward the U.S know right off reports\nThe president tweeted this morning that what he called the assault on our country at our southern border is far more important to him the trade in a series of blistering tweets Mr Trump went after everyone from the leaders of El Salvador Guatemala Honduras and Mexico to Democrats for failing to stop the flow of immigrants in this country\nAnd the president threatened to take military action at the border to stop immigrants from coming into the country illegally bill re cops CBS News Washington former usa\nGymnastics presidents deep penny has been arrested on a Texas grand jury indicted him for allegedly tampering with evidence taken from the Karolyi Ranch in connection with Larry Nassar's sexual assault investigation CBS is Tony ...\nIt's all part of an ongoing investigation into a possible cover up of Nassar's condo that the ranch\nThey knew they had to do it now and everything else about everything out there doing\nOlympic bronze medalist Jamie dancer and former team usa member Jeanette ... are among several former gymnast that believe Olympic coaches Bella and more curly knew about Nassar's abuse but did nothing to stop it Facebook\nHas unveiled a new war room that's plans to fight any online attempt to sway us voters in next month's midterm elections Daniel glacier is Facebook's head of cyber security policy\nThey might be spammer is they might be people trying to perpetrate fraud some of them might be nation states and we have automated systems that will detect and remove millions I think every day or something like Ninety percent of the ones who can remove we knew that automatically\n... says Facebook disabled more than a billion fake accounts between last October in March of this year all three right now the Dow is down three fifty six vicious CBS News\nTo experience relief or muscle cramps and your legs and feet used their works really fast acting foam get their works released today and the pain relief violate your local pharmacy or their works relief dot com\nIT orchestrating stories from CDW financial trading firm had an aging IT infrastructure which mandated servers decreased efficiency and lost revenue\nJust CDW orchestrated in IT infrastructure modernization solution using H.

I'm not I I it's hard to keep up with it you know too much because uh you know really focused in on the NFL but you know kind of keeping a close eye on what's going on with the ... crew and whatnot\nI was I wasn't sure if you were dropping money on the brewers are you were dropping money elsewhere but you know every now and they have better ... man when you're starting to look at why do you think something might be a gimme a sea diving into the pool\nOh yeah I mean we have a great we have a great at the action network or I can just kind of hit click on TALK about being caught but you know a pretty good game preview of what's going down so that I knew dabble from time to time to because we we have the shark stuff over here\nI Am fascinated this week or ... the ankle injury we're not quite sure how he's doing I haven't really looked over that fence because of him so wrapped up in baseball however\nNew England comes to Chicago and the last I checked does what a three point spread in that particular game were were New England was given up three because the bears de France is just a good ... or ... or those two teams now that close\nWell I think what's going on here is that you're looking at a a you know some some of the ... the good advantage of the ... being factored in but I think that this New England off that is a lot better than it was earlier in the evening and\nI think it's a I think the way I could handle the game even though in Chicago I Know they did a party last week but you got ... thirty eight point\nUm or more in the last three games that are they going to take the package that early count but um we've got bored enjoyed adamant and Sony Michel kind of integrated into that office again on the ... not going to be easy for the bears or they have the number one ranked it's easier way but that we saw what happened in any given Sunday last week in Miami\nAlso we've got to another and if she north match you up in Miami has been good they're giving away a couple of points Detroit has to go to Miami I still not quite sure what to make of Detroit or maybe that's just it you don't know what to make 'em some day they can play really well some do they're going to play really bad and they're just going to look for us and terrible so tell me a little bit more about Detroit in your eyes\nShow the thing about the trade is\nThey they struck they're still struggling I think that um their bottom bottom sick in the past and run the easy way out and this is actually a somewhat of a surprising alliance or you know a lot a lot of people who are kind of

game to open up the search for um will take place tomorrow night as well so I'm looking forward to that also going to get down there here and a couple of weeks as a matter of fact [noise]\nUm are you like me and the sense that you look there's a lot of things to critique you can criticized for the most part this team has been who they are they've stuck to their identity there's some things are kind of make you pull your hair out every now and then when it comes to the Milwaukee Brewers but for the most part\nThey've they've held true to form and it's what got them here and you give them credit I like I said there's things I can pick out what are you still like me are you still believe in his team can win\nBut they can win this thing that they can come back at two games close it out and head off to the world series face whomever it may be in Boston looked so incredibly dominant um is probably going to end up being Boston but um\nDo you believe they can get to the world series arguably has more and more and more doubt sunk into your mind to the point where you're starting to question and outgoing and I'm kind of preparing myself mentally to say boy they had a really good season\nA five five eighty three zero eight six foray let's go to a Steve listening to us in Brookfield Steve walking to the program go Michael shows going on man\nWhat's happening yeah you know I just got to I I just don't I don't see it happening and fight with the winter I I just think that what the court game I mean for the rent there that was the game is coming to\nThat you know they're in the whole now with what we got another game no matter what I was just surprised that they don't play ... Miller\nIn tomorrow night's game you know that's what I thought they would do yeah I think that what he can do it but I mean that for the heart you know or if I thought that and I'm not going to bet on that that that can happen right I think Milwaukee needed to win\nThat game that was the game that was for about ... ... it's just a woman in Milwaukee favor I mean I don't know maybe ... tonight for the sake of getting out of this little pin down a little bit and see what happens that way they can that might that might work\nYou know it it's funny because I appreciate the phone call because\nI mean yells usually gotta God's you hear\nA you're not pulling them out of the lineup I understand that people want to shake it up\nBut I\nI'd be real reluctant to do that and I'm all for certain things that aren't working change him but I I I don't know it would be hard for me to pull yell at you and Cain and pat 'em lower in the lineup when that's\nBeen the success of your team for a majority of the season for better than three core seven eighths of your season you know eleven twelve severe season whatever you\nWant to measure it out is that's the way you you've you've gotten here so I'd be really really reluctant to pull those\nGuys out of the top of that line up and I I Know it's it's it's not working right now and I get it but something in me just keep saying that they're going to bust through it it's going to take a hit it's going to take something but it I just keep thinking they're going to bust through eight five five eight three zero eight six where he was going to can listen to his in West bank and how you doing man what's going on\nReally I uh I'm doing a underdog certain terms am I err on the glass half empty a field um the this team has been good to get it done\nThey will get it done I'm quite confident that uh it's going to make a tremendous storyline\nA four MLD that clearly I mean you're and you're listening to the broadcast you can hear every time the doctors do something great I mean they would go up and in ah in their voices when they're calling a game but ah no the only the only thing that I Would do it and to get this off and fired up\nI Would make it would make a couple of changes one um\nDo I get grander than in right field and I would put brought it for ... your struggle terribly and\nI I that's what I Would do and I would make sure that show was that second base\nI Would not be goofing around with ... and scope anymore it's time to put round on the board this theme that runs on the board we've seen it\nAnd you're right there are a lot of things to pick out but you know what ... pick at him now's the time to get behind the steam damage and adults get what you know what's kept me high demand and bought him know that hey we know it's a seven game theory this is different for her to the world series\nSo it's time to pull up your bootstraps but what about on the ball and put some cross before you and your picture some good they've been doing good for you all get behind them out and put them up on a board damn it\nFirst year that things can I look when you're talking about getting scope out on the line up\nAs much as I hate to sit guys you can't run him out there\nHe's he's been just awful just awful at the plate\nHe zero seven bats zero nothing nothing to show for it Seventy batch three strike outs nothing you you can't you can't you can't run them out there and and\nThe one thing that I guess when you look at what a Christian yells has been able to accomplish his own base percentages three Ninety five\nThat's fantastic for a guy that is struggling when it comes to the average department at one Seventy nine six eighty oh PS but he's got on base he scored five times this series\nBut he's also come up with situations were hit would bring runs in walks aren't fascist I don't mind that I I liked the fact that he's got that high but when\nIt comes to the big sweeping breaking ball we've seen that happen more than a couple of times now we're meeting account he seems to be either gassing or fishing\nI don't know which ... that he just needs one\nDisney's want slugging percentage under three hundred and two eighty six right now he's five five eight three zero eight six for eight five five eight three zero eight six foray gives you shall we want to hear from let's go to Tony agreed to Tony welcome to the program and what's going on\nI Do yeah I I just started listening right now we're out in 'em\nAnd then the last guy trying to do my thunder motivate what ... what would it be sad him um or or in somebody else play first base I mean\nI saw this that you know the statistic of him hitting with with the guys on base and it was like I guess what twenty batteries on base or something you want to ... am I correct on that\nUm yeah I Do I get along with runners in scoring position has about a zero\nYeah and and he just last night I have terrible was it was like and I don't know he's just not right what if we need you know I don't know if that's the way he you know you always hear about a\n... like the other guy the other caller just before me said we got it we got to get some runs we got to start running we got I mean there's no excuse for one out with two guys that we're not we're not advancing equal I don't care lay down upon\nAnything you know reports this too because if we're going to wait until the late already before it comes to us we see what happens every game these guys these guys did they start like never backs up to LA and and you know there are a number out there and and you know I think we're just we're just as good as they are as a team\nAnd we're our pictures of what can you ask for anything better you know right it's been great you\nKnow I mean last night we had these was quoted there is no excuse not to come up with something\nNo no I agree with that and I agree with you and you're running I Would have got hit by the pitch before I let them\nRead [laughter] lead into one I get it\nI Would I Would have more than what hey did you know wherever aren't thanks bill\nEspecially the big sweeping breaking ball ... shows\nMel hours later the ball game when you bring a Jansen but you know especially the big sweeping ... of of ... it's maybe Seventy four Seventy five miles an hour after you talking about an office be patrolling back he goes from Ninety One Ninety two and a throws a big sweeping breaking pitch for Seventy four miles an hour that is a that's a tough one\nUm we just need to get a little bit more production can shift it like the top of the wind up rather than having to count on our number ... hit her and her pictures they get extra pay 'em and if we can get some\nConsistently consecutive base that will be fine I mean just the pitching I'm not worried about we just need to make small adjustment that more right there\nYeah I Hope you're you're I Hope you're right I Hope they can do a day and the next twenty four hours to obey adjustments come quickly appreciate the phone call eight five five eight three zero eight six four I are used in the same spot that I'm at you know you can Nick pick a few things but\nIn the grand scheme of things I still think they're going to win this series let's go to mark listening to us in Washington DC mark how're you doing man what's up\nGood morning I'm I'm with you you know slump like yell at sense lumps happen you know you're a little off this or that it's not like the Dodgers are knock on the cover off the ball either um so you know experience may play into it or not but uh\nLike the last caller I just think they're too good to let this happen for too long but unfortunately it better happen tomorrow\nRight right no I agree with that they got to get it done right now but I I just I still think that it's going to take one hand it's going to take a big knockout you we haven't seen yellow yard either we haven't seen any power out of him and heat right now that's why when you see a large\nSo off kilter and when you see yellow so off kilter and they're just throwing the batted the ball they're just trying to stay alive they're not in their group when you see them starting to hit with our polling big foul balls down the line and really starting to kind of kind of zone in on a pitch then you start to feel like they're getting it right now they're not and hopefully by tomorrow they do\nI I I'm I'm predicting you know the breakout tomorrow uh it'd be nice to see eight ten twelve runs and then a candy bar the door Saturday\nThere you go that's all you need ... phone call a five five eight three zero eight six foray ...

there's something in me that just says that this is all going to work out and I I Know people are kind of put proving that idea but I I really believe it's going to happen I I just I just do so I Know you're in the same blower on\nWell you know one more thing is when they get to the world series and then you're going to be at the age\nOkay no I get I get but not hitting now what makes you think he's going to hit them\nWell that's true I mean if we can see it I Can't believe they're hitting coach or counseled not tell them to move\nOut of court closer to the plate or six inches even or

five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six forty let's go to Charlie listening to us in West Ben Wisconsin Charlie how you doing that I mean it was going on\nI'm doing good how are you doing well today man what's happening\nI think the brewers when to him out I don't really think they're going to\nBust out there that's all that much though but the thing you got to remember is really the ... the ball worth a darn either really took on the third game out of three and a role in LA\nThe score any wrong with them and they got those really towards the end it became a little bit more than that you really think that they're going to be her supplies and the second\nTime in LA I you know what I had a feeling that they could do that they could get to the head opportunities they couldn't knock him out of the game of Aguilar get hit or or God Forbid hits a bomb they couldn't knock them out they just let them off the hook\nYeah I you know I I agree with other people I think they should take a meal out ... really hit the ball since the all star break I just wonder what his stats are from the all star break on I mean it was set in three hundred going on the all star game pretty much they have a let down to like two Seventy the second half is shorter than the first to\nSay well we we have\nTo be better to forty second ...\nHe appreciate the phone call me go kind of go through the Senate and I'll give it to you here real quick because Hey Sue secular ended up with the two Seventy four batting average\nFor the season now when you go to his game splits okay when you start to look at where he was prior to the all star break and after the all star break you get to the month of July and he was ripping okay no doubt about it he was driven the baseball uh then they ended up because he was heading to Ninety eight at that point\nOkay then they go to the all star break any struggle because he ended up hitting too old to in the month of July okay average goes down to two Seventy eight [noise]\nBuddy bounce back in August to hit two Seventy in August and he ended up in in here to sixty seven in September so while his numbers weren't as good he's still did bounce back and wasn't if he didn't do anything at all ended up with seven ah or I excuse me a for home runs in the month of September ... home runs\nIn the month of August he wasn't it that kind of clip that he was early on but still he he did play pretty well now in October he is basically been nonexistent it's it's it's been disappointing but ah\nBut his uh his regular season numbers he had he not taken a big hit at the uh pretty much throughout July\nHis numbers what ended up much much better but as far as overall numbers but he bounced back in August ... ended up having to Seventy or excuse me a to Z yeah two Seventy in August was six daggers a Nineteen RBI\nNot a bad not a bad month a lot of guys to take that\nUp but he has just been nonexistent in the postseason eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six for a if you want to give us a shell please feel free to do so I learned the post season now that's a completely different story because he's hitting one Seventy two\nHe's won Seventy two an over in the series with runners in scoring position and he's been the guy is giving you some bombs 'cause you got a couple of home runs he's got a couple of ... but in this series he's been nonexistent taken only a couple of walks tens strike out so like I said he seems to be fishing\nSeems to be fishing for the baseball Christian yellow ten walks in five strike I'll just walk to strike outrageous fantastic uh three Ninety five on base percentage but\nI don't think they want to just take that away from Aaron Rodgers [noise]\nYou can you tell me with one hundred percent certain date that Randall [noise]\nEven healthy is better than the scale I Know right now no I Can't either that's what I'm struggling with yeah so I I don't know I just I think there's a scenario you're where scaling belongs on fantasy boss because one way or another that getting ongoing usage throughout much of a threat [noise]\nThat's really where I was headed\nThat oh I got it and you know I get it I just ah I just I I Can't see them eliminating Randall Cobb as as a weapon now they may put a different packages and running in and out of their uh I don't think that reduces snaps by a lot will say\nMaybe a little bit not by\nHow many times that Aaron Rodgers after publicly saying his fist on the table to get air and Jones more work before and joins gets more work\nDon't trust him in in blitz pick up when it comes to mind if it if they're going to have gone to an all pass game they don't trust you keep saying they do but actually speak louder than words they won't put him in a [noise] I agree that it's too bad\nThat's a question CJ suspended you both for the church arson Hooper or George Kendall into like\nA like in both this uh like in both of this uh this week quite a bit actually who are at least the falcons and red zone targets on people you know he is he's the falcons tight and keep in mind seduce hurt him release her whoever's going to get extra looks in this game and\nIt's a medium middle of the road matchup odds for him against the giants he's my number six tight and I've got George Kendall up a number three though he just a huge part of that off and\nHe posted a career I Won a hundred yards against the rams last year when they played a lot on the rams evidence given up a tightens up sound yes those not not a cakewalk for either but I got my couple of spots ...\nGot a question from listening to the gym bowling balls really how you doing man what's going on\nHey thanks for taking my call is this week to delve into cook gets used or have yet Murray a better shot yeah great question I'm dumb cooks practicing and full now what I loved about are delving\nLast week to help them out and I thought that was the right place to cook it said I don't want to be on the field until I'm One hundred percent on his hamstring injury because what happens every\nTime they rushed people back on the soft tissue in just from the inter so it really looks like he's trending toward being on the field for this game and at one hundred percent and I I Love that part of what's coming and\nPretty favorable match up all over the past three ah sorry um he's running backs the game over age ... against New York including Marlene back last week ran for seven yards per carry so I I think ... gets the majority of the working pretty favorable match up so you're going to start in this way\nToo out of three PBR was the key to de de De Niro duty you in coal marquee so a good one [noise]\nI think you've got to keep playing good when if you saw that you saw the Monday Night or just a just a sample size which does he do that you only need one clay to get past the defense and the other you know not\nHalf bad it is they're going up against the rams and the ramp secondary ever supposed to keep to lead got knocked out everybody's happening all over the ram the game flow almost certainly ... oriented towards the happy day here so we're going to go with mark he's still don't know I think quietly by the way on the waiver wire and a lot of ways\nHe got drop when a when he got hurt and then they lost Jimmy ... gave up hope on him now he's back to being a he's back to being a Bible player again rollout will give him to start here\nJeff ... seat juicy Milwaukee Jeff how you doing man what's up\nDoing a good what's up for flex well since I'm pushing her Martin or George ...\n[noise]\nWell I just told me that much like Mark ... Goodwin and I'm sticking with him here but I don't have a problem if you want to go George Kendall either I think it'll get warm deception I like camps for touchdown better with good ones and again if you don't mind the risk that comes with good one who doesn't catch a ton of balls but turn any of them into along gets he's our guy\nOh this one from Jason on Twitter says breeze or Winston [noise]\nWell you know last week a breeze on by\nThat makes it easier and doesn't it\n[laughter]\nNo no no wait a minute wait a no he's not owned by this week no he's not\nThey are uh no I think that that was the last week last week I thought it was last I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I ... I should know better Drew Brees got Baltimore of course he went over Thirteen quarterback this week it say um\nDidn't violate Baltimore's older TVs never be as a side note right now it's a ... year probably the ravens a I\nHave one bad game against any ... outside of that they're giving up two hundred for passing yards and zero point for asking us do per game that did last week Marcus ... many listeners know against Baltimore\nAnd more than completion then completed passes\nSo this is a up this is a tough matchup for Drew Brees my number Thirteen quarterback um when since got Cleveland it's a it's a easier match up but still struggling just to believe in Winston that I Need more a little bit more beer loves the tight end\nAnd um and this is a good opportunity at the Cleveland different set of struggled against tighten up chicken point short it's a lot of talking on taking ... to ... to the gym is when some even in tough matchup grouper\nThere you go a Mitch Trybulski or Matthew Stanford Stanford is going to do ... has patriots coming to\nYeah how about that um to risky back to back\nSolid efforts for ... I'm I'm a little bit worried about him versus build ballot jak which isn't always the greatest match up I'm over the last two games though\n... Seventy yard that nine touchdowns bill one that bright and he believes Seventy two percent of his path as which I Walk because he was so inaccurate before I'm Still is my number ...
