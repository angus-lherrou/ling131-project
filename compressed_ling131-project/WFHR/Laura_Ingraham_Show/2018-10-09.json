outcome from [noise]\nFrom the lake front to the river\nOn these these were with guns in sports fans come to Bill Bill Michael Steele named best radio show in the Wisconsin broadcasters were\nYou know here's your whole Michael [noise]\n\nMichael show is on the are you enjoying this uh this summer like whether\nThere's mid August like weather\nBecause I guess it's not going to last but\nNevertheless get out and enjoy it do a few things I Try to get out and cut the grass this morning bras is just a really high in the new house I haven't had a chance to cut yet uh and so wet that he just clogs up my mower so I'm gonna wait 'til she afternoon hopefully I don't get any rain this afternoon go home take it easy nothing going on tonight which is nice\nNo baseball everything's pretty much put the bad\nYou've got a you know no football tonight some basketball that will be on but just a nice night ice relaxing night get a few things done around the new house and be good to go radio Joe across the way I Do Michael's we're glad to have you on board\nAnd today it was a green gold Tuesday is yesterday was pretty much all breweries all the time back to understandable because certainly deserve it and the brewers are now being dissed by ... we'll talk about that coming up a little later on the program but\nToday is the day that we uh kind of open it up we play corner on what happened and is happening to this uh this corps of Green Bay Packers football team\nAnd I say in in that sense somewhat tongue in cheek but also as you start to to to hear the whispers you feel the tension you can hear the cracks you get the rumors um things aren't good inside twelve sixty five right now\nThey just aren't or whether it's on the field and the dysfunction which\nGuy is led by the head coach I mean he's ultimately responsible for everything and then you start to hear tensions running high inside the building here you know kind of people that have been there a long time will say I'm up in a Green Bay yesterday um I I come out of the logical or kick off and\nTalking to a few people that work over there and I yeah it's you know it's not great you know and then one of the references was yes it's kinda like at the end when Mike Sherman got fired and I went white\nAnd he went back to you know not that bad but you know it's kind of tense like that and I tried to back pedal and it's really okay I remember when my German got let go by the time my Sherman was let go\nAnd he was a I've always acquainted like Hitler in the bunker I mean every twigs snap inside that building was jumping what what who's there that type of thing if that's the way it is or assemble it's they're all that you can feel it slipping\nAway and people now voting the coach and the coaches now boarding the front office and he's wondering around kind of you know wanting to run the football team but also check on the job and ... you know how it is you ever been in an office building or in any place it well you know somebody who's about to go down the drain\nAnd every ... you're trying to walk around with kid gloves and you're trying to stop the snowball rolling down hill but it keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more heavy\nKinda the way I get the sense that it is right now in Green Bay\nAnd the shame of it is that they're not\nNow I don't know what they're going to be able to do now they should be San Francisco okay they should get a win here's your saving great by the way if they don't ... San Francisco just stick a damn forget it call it a day it's over okay but let me say this\nIf they beat San Francisco here's your a silver lining okay\nThey have than two weeks because the by we comes to self scout I had to figure things out now you brought in to other head coaches Joe Philbin who is a master at I'm In game management will say\nAnd then you have my pet and who has been slowly but steadily able to manipulate will say\nPlayers to\nDo the best they can what we're discovering is you've got athletes and I said there's so many times so many times you give me an athlete and I'll give you a general manager about to be fired\nYou give me a football player and I'll give you a general manager and a head coach who are about to win a championship this whole thing about going out and he's a great athlete and he's got a great speed gotta wings but I don't care\nI don't care give me a damn football player gave me somebody that knows how to tackle give me somebody that can read a coverage gimme somebody that is smarter than the hat rack that you're hanging you're damn hat on\nThose are the words of Aaron Rodgers he's one hundred percent correct me if you had to put together a full game [noise]\nGot to do it got to do it\nFive five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six forty when it comes to the Green Bay Packers [noise] where are you right now now I posted yesterday [noise] um [noise]\nA little bit about a Green Bay and about some of the thoughts when it comes to wear this team is ACT UP by the way for everybody that talks about whether or not they're going to fire the coach mid season\n[noise] I uh [noise] if I had to put\nA percentage on it if things went terribly terribly wrong maybe but this is not the way that this is not a knee jerk organization they move very much like an iceberg they just do they are very slow very methodical\nAnd they they take their time and and that's been a a great trait\nYou don't want to be a knee jerk owner that just starts firing everybody and changing things up willy nilly I mean you really want to do your due diligence to make sure that you can you know kind of thing things through so to speak and mark Murphy's been very good at that both in business and on the field\nYou well now it's his responsibility correct he has changed the communication structures like to\nSee or ... you would like to see him play this thing out all the way through the season right our list of how it goes because he has a new structure in place so he wants to see if this is going to work right he's not the kind of guy that's going to have this knee jerk reaction it's just going to fire McCarthy\nYeah he is he's going to take his time and he's he's going to make sure he\nDoes is due diligence to support what you know basically was part of his decision so we'll we'll see I I don't think unless I mean unless the locker room just goes away I don't think that they're going to\nThey're gonna make a change okay for those I mean like I said unless they wanted it surprised me it would surprise me but it would not shocked me okay um if things got really bad but I'd have to say if I put a percentage on maybe five percent of me would say that would make a change otherwise I just believe that\nYou let it play out you see things go on and you go from there by five five eight three zero\nEight six forty five five eight three zero eight six for eight what is your thought right now are you under the relax category are you under the panic category when it comes to the Green Bay Packers and I know look a lot of people are saying you know hey we shouldn't be talking Packers Pakistani blah blah blah and it's all ... all the time look I I understand it\nThere there's that's where you want to go with the positive but at some point\nWhether it's in the next week or two weeks and I hope it's not for a while but at some point the proceedings going to come to whatever you're going to have to turn your sides backed the Green Bay and you're going to say okay what what is this what does this pile of whatever that we've been looking at it and it basically ignoring because of the foreign run\nThat the brewers have made you got to pay attention to it I mean it's it's what drives the train economical you know a lot of ways in the state of Wisconsin\nSo a\nThis was from dusty who says do you think it's all Mike mccarthy or do you think Aaron Rodgers should throw his support behind the head coach get everybody else to say I don't think that's a great question and I because I don't\nSit behind the walls of twelve sixty five all the time and no maybe maybe Aaron Rodgers has gone to Mike and said Hey Mike this is working man what are we doing while you're doing this and this was my way or the highway and Aaron says well let's try this or can we try that or whatever and\nAnd and maybe went to ... and Joe film and says hey I don't know what's going on but the coaches doesn't want to do it if he's done all of that and then he has a right to come out and say you know what ... indirectly this sucks what are we doing and why are we doing it you know I this is very much a a very\nA a little a little drop in the woods and I'm gonna give you guys a piece of popcorn to follow the trail to say hey there you go uh it's personal packages why are we not gonna give Ontario Adams open more why are we not doing this or that\nAre in other words to say hey go to the head coach and asking these questions somebody has some ... and go asked the guy this because he has to be put on the spot maybe he's already done all of that and now that his last resort has to come to us\nAnd I hope that would be the case\nBecause if you are trying to work behind the scenes and you're just not getting what you want and then you're just saying well I'm just going to go to the media and just bad mouth my coach or in I mean let's be honest I mean he has never used the word Mike mccarthy this and that but we all know it's it's it's bad candidates in veiled it is what it is\nSo\nWe'll see you know like I said you got to get a win over San Francisco and then you've got to self scout you got to buy a week and then you've got to come back smoking because you have got a tough tough stretch for on a five on the road you've got to go to LA you've got to go to New England you've got to go uh to Seattle and then you got to go to us banks stadium and see the Minnesota Vikings\nYou know I mean you have got a hell of a run coming up and you better have all your ducks in a row 'cause if you don't you were going to get your ass kicked in your season is over before you really even say okay we're starting to figure things out you can't be going in a week five and week six going out to work in progress my ass this was supposed to be work in progress back during training camp\nYou're supposed to hit the ground running when you get to the regular season and his team hasn't been able to do it for years now\nLet's go to the phone calls eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight oh let's go to John listening to us in Madison on his own out there John how you doing man which habits\nHey I'm doing great beautiful day up there right yes it is um\nGot I got a question for you I I Know that some of it says water over the damn already but yeah I I kept hearing um the reason that\nUh we couldn't get clear lack a first it was but he didn't want to give up that many draft pick the latest thing I've heard was there was no way a with Aaron Rodgers a\nContract and having Matt you is a [noise]\nWhat's his name uh care through other guys they all had ten million dollar\nYeah claimed Matthews Mike Daniels Dave about GRE or I mean they've got quite a bit you know\nYeah and I'm Wondering if they would have not gotten Rogers contract down which they didn't have to do under you know the way it was they had him for another two years or whatever yeah what they've been better off going out and getting more\nKey players\nUm and and maybe the cat money's still to work out I don't know right but I'm\n... and then the other thing that bothered me a lot is is is uh Mike mccarthy given his um his veteran a time off for the practice clearly whether it's a veteran or the new guys this team is that and think\nOh right right no I I completely agree on on on Rogers is that you know I I hate\nTo say this but I've seen this with other you know a star players they get that big contract and just kind of like they let off the gas twice if I'm On the ball\nAnd they're wondering got you know hit in the back and tackle that he has no presence there was someone what an after him I I don't know I mean\nYeah well I appreciate the phone call I I look at it this way um first of all Aaron Rodgers and I'm gonna give him the credit here because he's not going to get a contracting let up Aaron Rodgers to competitive I give him all the credit in the world because he wants to when he wants to try to when he wants to do everything he can to when he's trying to be a leader\nAh and whether that's the right way wrong way I don't know I mean whatever is effective inside that lock room and inside the walls and twelve sixty five that's that's a for his judgment not for mine\nUm but when you talk about getting ... I I said all along I Would have loved to see him in Green Bay I Would love to see them make that work because he's a he's a game changing player now the way things are right now I'm financially it wouldn't have mattered\nIt let's face it wouldn't matter he's not playing off as now the options you go take chances and maybe ... go to Ben and went and got things back or got things done and they would have had his back but it it it doesn't matter because right now the office just seems so\nOut of sorts it's just not Chris I guess that's the way to put it they can run the ball they control about Aaron Rodgers can play with a sense of urgency and look like Aaron Rodgers you know they've been able to run the ball with Aaron Jones he's been able to rip off some decent garbage give you a good yards per carry average Jamal Williams is a good one to back every now and then you throw in time of gum ring\nYou know the titans of cut passes at times other times they hadn't been opened\nAaron Rodgers to Jimmy Grams' work once we work the way we thought it would work just hasn't been as frequent successful wise as we thought in between the twenties ... great inside the twenty ... bad\nSo there's a lot of good here but they just can't put it all together for whatever reason eight five five eight three zero eight six right will keep up the phone calls also mark Daniels our guy from forty forty I mean one at one point nine F. A. W. N. F. L. and Green Bay we're going to get his perspective and all of this as well coming up next middle Michael ...\nMichael sports talk [noise]\nStay with us now for news update from am Thirteen twenty Mike Warren reporting for W. F. HR well in the paper has announced plans for a major upgrade of its meal in the village of beer and let's bring in Carl he'll get an update on that story for us today\nA shuttle and only if you come up with a difficult situation third along for instance otherwise he's going to say that that person out groping for the entire series or no matter if it goes three un out or go Seventy five yards for a touchdown\nSo that's why you see so sporadic ah play for Aaron Jones\nRight now uh but he certainly made and they hit yesterday that though we might have to find ways to get them on the field more and I think I Would get everybody a little more excited to see this guy touch the ball a little more often\nThan they should be more though I mean he still\nGet yeah here's a scene from all Williams just art and you're still going to fear theory in particular crime I've got Murray a and I think a Jones should take their place in Montgomery snaps I really do but they still have a concern about him and pass protection is by far the worst of the three\nAre and they're getting way too much as it is\n... that I agree with a ... and they keep saying well he's a three down guy well no he's not because you can't put him in there and you don't trust him in the second half of a ball game when you're throwing the ball predominantly and you only get one touching that is until late in the fourth quarter that's the reason people kind of look at Michael cardio well\nYou're talking to both sides of your face you know when you say oh no he's the guy and we can all see that he's the guy just he's he's not a pass protector and you understand that I just wish that you know sometimes might regard you would come out and said because I put it this way it's obvious there's obviously every other coach in the national football league you know what I mean\nYeah I think so I catch the ball that's for sure but uh you know the running backs are targeted much a so here's primary job in the passing game as protection and he's not very good at it you know what kind of trust emitted that's why he's out there\nUm I wanted to ask you more defensively speaking give me your thoughts in where there's team isn't in the way that my pet news used a lot of these guys\n\nAre forced to through the whole rotating secondary thing that we've been hearing and seeing you know under ... percent of the last two or three years Kevin ... bumps shoulder last year\nOther bumped shoulder and camp comes back growing cult comes back looks terrible it says ... you know and it's just so or Alexander with the growing or it's just been a revolving door back there again and you know you're forced to play Tony brown you know\nStupid readily ... not withstanding you're in trouble um I think the safety placement very suspect so far this season\nBryce is that they can't or not necessarily a thinker\nPot Clinton addicts just guessing wrong way too often he's had three interceptions so you know you look at the numbers and go wow he's among the leaders in the ... you know it takes a but you know he's also I think one of the league leader sitting in blowing coverage isn't giving up touchdowns are getting\nStiff armed on a on a open field ... ... it's been very suspect play on the back and put down that down bill I Do think that the practice and that that\nAh they've been placed in ... Dickie Leslie adverse situations much of the season and outside of the chunk place that provides Redskins got in fact about leaks ah they they sort of clean that up I Know golladay got a great big\nCatch against John Jackson who's coverage was pretty good except for the not just the last moment um\nBut the rookie will learn from that but I think down the down I ... I'm okay with the how the defense displaying and the second half of games\nUh you know they've given up ten points in the last three weeks and it's always giving up in the first out as much fall to the office is is that the parents\n[noise] um the special teams obviously amazing Crosby you a topic of conversation and everybody was asking whether or not he's going to remain with the team was there any question that they wouldn't hang an amazing Crosby we've seen this before where he just went awry and all of a sudden he gets back to become still one of the better ... kicker and Packers history\nWhen I was a time lately ... yeah they're going to stick with Mason Crosby it was a miserable day I mean there's no question about that\nUm you know and I'll give credit freeze stood there and he he didn't pull along well or or anything else to talk about the shaky operation a you know or their stance in the whole they were all there he just was off target all day in a dumb it's just phenomenal\nRacism is for field goals\nIn each of the last three seasons and he missed four on one day he had a rough two thousand twelve when he missed I think it does and and there were a lot of questions about whether they would bring him back that was halfway through his career\nAnd he is the second half it's been pretty good up until Sunday is\nThey're going to stick with Mason Crosby\nYeah I I never thought for a minute that there was even a consideration that they would move on I Know I don't think so\nYeah that just seem to be what everybody was talking about I just kind of scratch my head on that show here's my question to you or how likely do you think it is that they're able to turn this thing around\n\nHere well first saw this week that the forty niners then you've got to have your prefer eleven on each side of the ball for an extended period of time uh and that's asking a lot\nAnd here's the other ... now we've got a new general manager up there a and I'm not sure what he's thinking I'm you know and they can step on Aaron Rodgers and the risk for McCarthy and there might be an under ... here that uh is Rogers drive and the bus here to make the coaching shows\nMe I thought about that from time to time you know he's a genuine of his career and is wrong with a car the aspirin quite gotten him over the top or the last couple of years\nAnd I'm Wondering what project is it a check yet another officer mind or something else here to give him a shot at the finish line and do which might be open to that if there's team stumbled badly\nA you know but it's just five hundred ... a playoff per second straight hair that might trigger an ATM to get a guy in here he wants to work with I mean he's worked with McCarthy but it's different and he's got his hands on his branch out and I don't think\nYou know mark the would be a first to listening to that possibility\nAnd I was going to be my next question because mark Murphy and Mike or type but\nI think they all know that that window of opportunity to start slamming shut relatively quick if things continue to go ride good Chavez always Mart we appreciate a man\nBy ... ... talk to you later there you go that's more Daniels and don't you want to fill in Green Bay are fine affiliate their thanks to him for\nShopping for a couple of minutes fourteen forty AM one at one point nine F.

have to\nSay you are to err on a mission to waste as much Miller light as humanly possible and they are very much succeeding at that so far this poll she's OK well those are the guys if they have a if they have one of these at Miller Park those are the guys you got to look out for\nAll right well we will ah I'm bringing an umbrella just in case you know maybe maybe that'll be nice you can gouge someone's I\nYeah maybe one of those a full body suits you know like they were like has my teams with that big plastic shield them in front no\nThey are they are are they are good at finding the the neck gets you know they'll get it down to the neck opening\nOkay we're really uh really either expensive clothes or really bad close\nTo having one or two and cause it's been great to be a van to watch all of this um I think the most phenomenal stats is the fact that the only guy that has an array that isn't zero in postseason for the brewers who's been Germany Jeffress the bitch amazing\nYeah that was a record uh two rounds allowed and the national evolution series was in Iraq or a the Rockies which is a really good often and and definitely have better off as of course field but but not a pushover team anywhere they scored and one of twenty eight innings\nAnd as you said it was that um that that was what was a bunch of single German Jeffers mhm\nSo um yeah they are pitching the ball really well that is the strength of the team car council said that it's the story of the the series that's really the story of since the start of September they have the best theory and baseball let's blow to the Dodgers are second\nThe story I think the narrative going into the series is going to be the brewers pitching and specifically the bullpen against the Dodgers\nI'm excellent group of platoon players their position players are set up as a very very effective platoon than a bunch of different spots\nAnd they're going to be able to match up really well against the brewers picture so it's kind of kind of be\nStrengthened strength um and oh by the way Clayton ... a bunch of times because spurs fans\nShould have been rooting very very hard for the Atlanta Braves yesterday in fact the Dodgers got through him for a and can land a plane crash offer game one and a best of seven is a very dangerous down um that is that that sets up very well for the Dodgers so these are two two very good teams\nI'm so there's no the the Dodgers are dangerous team they were I think after being in the world series last year probably the national favorites going in at least up there as you know maybe with the cubs maybe with the nationals going into the season and the Dodgers had of weird regular season where they were\nAnd good and bad and the comic e clear way in and again one sixty three of their own but they look very formidable writing\nIt's a it's a big challenge for the brewers and it's like a kind of said at the beginning there there there are similar in a lot of ways in terms of having a very good deep bullpen\nUm and in terms of just having a combination of position players and there's no they play the platoon was\n... they do a lot of the same things that the birds do 'em they just do also do it with a hundred and sixty million dollar payroll or whatever it is so they're they're like they're like the same but different all the same time and I'm it it it it it matches up very interestingly\nFor a seven game series and then the other thing though that stands out to me is the ... or just the hottest tea and and we've talked about this all season you know you you try to play herself into a position to be relevant in September put yourself in a position to get into the tournament\nThe brewers are ... it's not necessarily about being the best team it's about being the hottest\nAnd the brewers right now are the hottest day eleven game winning streak the last time they want to many games in a row you're all getting ready to go to George ... you know mom and dad the kids from the baseball yeah I'm so this is you know that that seems streak is a very big memorable part of history\nThis team right now is is just how does that seem wise\nAnd um you know now what are these off is going to do for it they probably want to gain today you know but unfortunately they don't have a game I saw friday so they're going to try to find a way to keep this interesting\nFor the next couple of days keep themselves in a kind of game ready I'm a bunch of guys said after they swept the Rockies that the reason they've been good as they treated everyday like game seven of the world series\nSo can they can they do that now in BP over Miller Park this afternoon and try to keep sharp a had a ... game there'll be a that'll be a challenge\nShow there's always buddy we will see

I I don't know what went on behind the scenes I don't know if there's more to it than that but I'm\nRogers maybe he's still not happy\nBut then they get rid of joining Nelson we know that was a business decision\nBut in the article it says the lack of a running back but he's also that has said that you know Aaron Rodgers troubled\nWell the running game was never looked at as the legitimate entity anyway is looked at it as the bastard stepchild to a guy that wants to throw the football\nSo quarterbacks wanna throw the football I don't know if you want to run game and it seems like at least when when Aaron Jones is running the football they they have one you know there's probably some things as applause there with blocking assignments and such that that might get to Aaron Rodgers a little bit but you're talking about a ... a second you're a guy\nWho [noise]\nThey they they finally have running backs that looked like running backs\nThe Packers obviously making Rogers the highest paid player and he goes on from there but that I Am dynamic between the coaching a player after twelve years has something to be watched closely and it goes on from there to say McCarthy has only signs or next season\nAnd that could be one of the issues that might be one of the reasons they didn't run down the hall to say we got assigned Mike mccarthy right now because they're leaving the door open to that this doesn't work we we cannot waste any more years of Aaron Rodgers inevitability\nSo wait and see so it's a short article it's it's to the point but if you're in Rogers is is it\nOnce you've signed a contract for that size amount of money you are worried about player personnel is done there's only so much to go around\nAnd I'm Sorry it just I I've always said guys to talk about ... player personnel moves after they take all the money you can't do it ... it it's bad form and in fact was leaking out it's bad for\nIt is what it is uh getting back to some of the comments from Mike mccarthy and some of our deciphering of all of this ah might McCarthy said there's more to playing running back then just running the football\nField is more to the plane that position just run into football [noise] um so I think Aaron's doing some things I think the most of those great things and definitely having passed on some things that are in terms of diversity that are tasked with with all three guys in there I don't think this is clearly\nJoining us not orange Richard how you doing I'm good how are you the\nWinner wells show or give me your thoughts as this brewers team has now won a Lebanese straight they only gave up two runs and you know Diaz and it seems like the buttons that gray council is pushing a are turning out to be the right ones right now\nYeah I Do with it the better team baseball right now I don't know that there's a team more kind of team that went to great book and great a a an up all over the\nOver the wall and they have a lot of interchangeable parts it's really our couple three years it's been a year or last Ninety four games and uh\nAnd mark ... decided to change course in a bright young yeah but the Astros David Stern what David Was and I think mark was real\nPlease tear down but they told him you don't need a complete tear down Doug Melvin left this organization in really good shape and so there's a big thing for me over the off season was we all today that he had to go get pitching\nAnd I remember sitting limited springs rather than his office and it was a you know random order Corbett burns\nOr he finally my early contract a we had a chance to go get two stars whose stars or into Cain and which should yell at you and uh they made us better and we've got enough pitching so here we go we'll find out\nYou know it's interesting going back to their conversations spring training I bring this up all the time to show news when he he and I sat and talked to said four thousand three hundred and Seventy four routes\nHe said that's all we need to get we don't have to worry about who's an agent who's not do it we've got pictures top to bottom we can go get four thousand three hundred and Seventy four hours and I looked at him like I have no idea what you're smoking but give me some of it\nAnd it turned out that he was moving anything he got it right I mean just go ... one of the best ... good guys you get to the fourth and fifth inning and\nAnd see what you can do and that's only been doing all season long and they've been doing this whole thing we're looking stern bullpen and just say let's go get al ... and ... that's an out to the next guy doesn't have to get ended his words are we seeing the changing of philosophy when it comes to starting pitching in major league baseball\nA sea change and uh I the or that\nTerm for starting pitcher the initial out get her a there was a T shirt Mart or opportunity in there I sure would like to get a [laughter] ah but\nI mean what we're seeing is a sea change this year what Tampa Bay the Tampa Bay had the second the second best DRA in the end of the game after going to the\nTo the eye opener in weekly tell you why teams do that you don't want your starting\nPitcher facing a line up three times that the numbers\nHere say don't do that you know if you have to dress in there or you see that on that surface you just you don't do that or it's a good point and the other thing is the most Ron Paul scored in the first day the fewest runs scored in the open so why not treat the Thursday night\nThat that is bringing that guy that can do short with big stuff and then you allow your starter who missed the big boys basically started a face like for your time and then he piece it together her hair and let me just say bill for spraying for the Astros and the red Sox\nI take or the race is unsettling to opposing hit is he's got ice organized like ... like like George spring or they want to do with their face and they want to know the game plan like the video all that but how do you prepare to face\nThese guys are three guys or a different guy\nUnsettling the guys because you have to learn on the go see guys over there in the dugout looking at AIPAC before they go up there but it's not the same place at a guy second or third time too so it's a revolution and no one has done it better than the birds that are raised with a ... a\nA but it's a it's it's you know it's it's an interesting evolution or watching in the game that both in terms of the defense of the line but and now and how to get those twenty seven up\nNow you've got the bruising the Dodgers Dodgers very good team a week says that basically not worried about the brewers I don't know how much mood to bulletin board fodder means in major league baseball but it certainly I guess his at least trigger the fan base here in Milwaukee was going to get a mound when he comes to the plate so\nYou give me give me who has an edge going into the series\nAll first of all I Would not I would not advise restraints booth quick because uh he's the guy that feeds off that um\nOr don't want a mirror images of each other's the Dodgers both had come together\nUm the difference would be that interview and her shawl all of your well\nAgainst the uh I guess the Braves and then ... that's a pretty good study group but they're both in has sort of coalesce or sixteen and twenty six point\nWe were preparing for a you know obviously they are and they see us as a third straight year they want that you know after the next day here they probably can't seven in the world series last\nYear um right now I think you know I think the pitching match up those to the earth I think there's no question that goes to the doors\nAren't they I mean is that the athlete can be the end of the day and we'll figure out I mean it was crap it's one of the great this is what's so good that they just say let's say the guy that other stuff themselves look out\nAnd says this guy get help for X Y and Z why

managers and need to talk to people and you talked managers\nIt's just a it's a neat place to work with off your back on the phone calls we got a lot of people want to talk to the brewers baseball bottom of the hour Brian bill like the super bowl winning coach with the Baltimore Ravens now with the NFL Network he'll be joining us we're talking baseball Joel then Todd listening to us in my nominee falls Todd how you doing today man was up\nYeah I think before you got to ... ... is that the\nPlayers on base to get them over to that effect could you give me honest I'm not sure what the Dodgers in the badger hang up your prediction\nOkay sounds good um [noise] the bad your game I think is\nGod I I I Want to say the badgers can win this game and I think they can but they have to play almost flawless football\nMichigan has been\nBut they're ... they're they're so far away from ... Michigan football was\nBut I'll ... I'll give the nod to Michigan because they're at home if they were coming into camp parental I think it might be a different story but I give the nod to Michigan because they're at home but it's almost to me I mean I don't know what the Vegas odds are but to me it's almost a pickup\nSo if you're if you're into that I don't know how they're gonna get past Penn State down happy valley that I don't know I'll I'll pick Penn State all day long on that one\nBut Michigan has been kind of like the badgers they've been expected to take that next step they really haven't had times they've looked flat out bad or some of their wins you kind of go what what was that you know so there are two very similar teams and\nJust because if I had to flip a coin I'd probably flip a coin and whoever the coin landed upon I take that team I I Want my heart wants to see the badgers be outlawed I hate Michigan okay not a fan of Harbaugh not a fan of Michigan are the best thing they ever come out of Michigan I guess would be more so Charles woods in but\nIn the grand scheme of things I I Want to pick the badgers but just as if I'm going to be real about it\nI'm going to say Michigan at home most likely Michigan when a ball game when it comes to the brewers and my production\nThe brewers coming out of Colorado I felt at the time were the hottest team in baseball and had there been a game say today\nBrewers pick up where they left off and they just continue to roll I don't know what a four day lay off is going to be the one thing I Do know is that it means that the pitching staff which is what you're relying upon gets a lot of rest and the brewers pitching staff probably more so than the Dodgers needs the rest because of the way they use their bullpen and they use their players\nSo I think right now when you look at the Dodgers line up\nA you know please hitting the baseball okay uh Turner is hitting the baseball right now but you start to move down and you look at a guy like say a camp or who hasn't really you know played a whole lot but\nYou know he's he's struggling a little bit Muncie is struggling a little bit Machado\nEven though he had that big three run Homer the other day he last night he is struggling a little bit Hernandez is struggling right now brand dollars struggling right now so either one no Ballenger is is just ... awful right now or hasn't got hit in the postseason\nSo he does have for a walk so he has he does have a good eyes go for walks you've got a base for times but he he doesn't have a hit in the postseason so either that string is going to continue and these guys are just faltering in the postseason under the pressure\nOr you can look at the opposite side go these guys are due to bust out I'm hoping the brewers pitching staff can continue\nTo ah to to dominate basically and we believe that um all season long they're going to have a hiccup do I think that the brewers are going to sweep the series now but if they win this thing four games to to it would not surprise me one bit not one bit because I think the brewers have it in um\nI really do her going back to what crank council said that at the beginning of the season he said this is the playoff team and then the other day he said we're a World Series team we've developed we put some pieces in place you've got guys have experienced they're going to a World Series but the Dodgers look there are only a year removed\nFrom this exact same position is not like they don't have experience here so uh this is by no way shape or form going to phase them but I'll say this\nUm for for brewers fans to bring it and be louder and more boisterous than what they were in Chicago last year\nYou got to bring it to that place was on fire at Wrigley Field so you got to bring and if you're going to be better than what the cubs brought last year and make that an unpleasant environment for the uh the LA Dodgers a real quick let's go to Dave listening to us in Oshkosh Dave how're you doing today man what's going on\nThe other great how about yourself oh wow what's up\nFirst and foremost water fun ride this last month is than manned yep what it's all said and done that and be fond memories of the season um as for my postseason MVP ah for me it's kind of a toss up right now between courtroom burns and Josh hater mhm I mean ... and\nTwo games to salad outings you know gave a small wedding and then hater pitching and all three game they say they're a while and save the day but now I think there there is and that really impressed with a lot of the guys so far yeah\nAnd then ... unless it's in LA or Kansas City everybody scratch their heads going how can we be good one day and not the next and how do we get it fixed and who can be fire a I mean it's throughout the week which tells you that there's a lot of parity in the league and the difference between one team in the next is very very minute\nPackers game coming up on Monday Night against to San Francisco after that they have the by week and then they get into a juggernaut they get into going to LA go into New England they come back home for a game and then they got to go to Seattle and they go to uh go to Minnesota uh it's not easy a that puts a lot of pressure on this particular game doesn't it\n[noise] ah every week becomes more and more pressurized you know the formula is the same ... in order to be good to be a a dominant team or really good team this leak\nThe formula and it's always been the same one at home split on the road beat the teams are supposed to be\nAnd split with the good teams so yes when you're at home against a team you should be a lot of pressure on that one 'cause you can't stop because that one's hard to get back means you got to go on the road and and get a plus one on the teams that are pretty good ah so when you're now facing the rams in LA\nThe the hawks in Seattle and you have to go to the Vikings uh yeah that you know that that's one that's a tough road and you can't afford to lose to a forty niner team at home um and and that just puts a higher priority on who you're where you're going to have to wait on the road\nMay coach speaking of ah of teams and on the road and and this time of the season I mean when when you look I mean the bears are sitting atop the division at what point do you look at them and say\nThat teams for real I mean I listen to you all the time doing one of our our other stations down in in Chicago down at the score and regardless of what they believe in ... at this point that defense is real and a half and and that can carry it can it\nCan and and the ass NFC North this little like the AFC North\nIn that order was perceived to be one or two teams the top I mean everybody's a part of it including Detroit now whether they can sustain it you know Minnesota's kind of bounce back a Chicago May come on I'm not going to say come back to reality when you're playing that good a defense the quarterback is progressing and learning and getting better\nSo yeah this is going to this is going to be a dog fight to the end and everybody in the division\nAre pretty soon as it begins to work itself out it's going to find your not only in the NFC North\nYou're in the end of the wild card division because you're going to start looking around to see who else is going to be vying close wildcard\nOr look at the rest of the NFC you got a lot of parity right now or in the NFC East obviously in the south has a one team in New Orleans that really stands out Caroline only with one blemish and we know what the rams are the rams are just an incredibly dynamic team are we starting to see finally just a little bit of separation with these teams or is it still too close to ...\nWere were ... you get an idea that I think we have a pretty good idea like we said we know who the dominant teams are\nAnd that that's going to change you know not change but obviously they'll have a last year along the way some place we know there are some teams are just flat out struggling don't know how much better they got a bit so you know it's it's very uh you know it's very it's a it's a U shaped curve in terms of the league is very tight\nAnd you want her to either way or it's going to put you want to above or one below five hundred um and so that's one of the league is right now and that and an injury a lot of things are going to change along the way but I gotta feeling\nYou know there's a lot of teams that are going to be right on this bubble a boy that looks pretty good they look oh boy what happened yesterday I did not happen okay and then they come back to look good to get\nDone with Brian abilities to promoting head coach when the ravens now with the NFL Network all of their
