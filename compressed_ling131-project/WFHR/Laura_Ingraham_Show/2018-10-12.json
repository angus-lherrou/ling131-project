not the first for the last you know that you're a battle with them and then obviously the pure stuff was really good\nPeople make a big deal about his fastball velocity being down um but he's probably

with\n\nMichael show is on the air we're glad to have you I very rarely ever get this and I got to be on it's just one of my first in this realm in a long time\nWe bring in now from Fox Sports ... will be analysts World Series champion with the Yankees and Ohio State buckeyes brethren right there next words you're joining us Nick how are you doing\nOh man what an intro bribery Shiite that man I'm here with amazing\nI I don't I don't forget fellow Buckeye that doesn't happen I got over it rather than\nI Do I'm getting ready to get you on and I get a message pops up right away it's from a guy named Greg ... says please I listen every day it's a really weird favor but could you tell mix wish I had a huge man crush on that guy\nHe was one of my favorite player's ever always wanted him to be a brewer thanks for having going as regret\nJust walk some ... ... ... ... weird but I had a fabulous [laughter] I'll take\nIt you know what I Love her out but\nUh so tell me what your thoughts are first of all the Dodgers team coming east and then in essence a matching up against his brewers team and the al ... they call 'em in the way they do things\nThat you want man couldn't be a great battle uh I I think if you look at it on paper or you look at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the first thing that really pops out to me is that like the all stars the caliber of talent that you can break off the bench a obviously\nStarting pitching could be a questionable thing you've got quake Kirsch all it was definitely a guy who has done his business over his career but then after that you got your young pups you know you got your Walker ... kind of an X factor uh you know no you're right you get a great start the other night which was awesome and he's done great the second half rich hill as well\nUh but I think there is\nA certain um I guess you'd say somebody to be worried about for the Dodgers or it could be that either that bridge to get to the back into the bullpen it can be Japanese because he looked good the other night and we all know about his struggles early in the year but\nOn paper it looks like the Dodgers are the better team but then again if you look at the swag the excitement level of the Milwaukee Brewers\nJump on board with that how can you not be excited each and every night when you watch the team take the field so I think it's going to be a great match up I'm excited I'm super so\nThat the Milwaukee Brewers have made that leap made that step to get themselves back into the playoffs and ... got that Christian yeah like low paying for on the stock is come on man these guys are excited to be there no doubt about it and they have the talent to meant\nNo I'm listening to a lot of national talk and it just seems to be that everybody is hung up on this starting pitching versus the quote out gutters\nAnd if you watch to see mostly as long as you just the way they do it I mean there's nothing different they're not it's not like all of a sudden they got to the postseason went oh well use are both and they've been throwing guys were two and three and four innings with eighty sixty Seventy pictures\nAnd then going to the bullpen and letting the bullpen handle it all season long why is this such a hard a philosophy for some people to just grasp\nBecause it's new and people are a little hesitant to change a baseball game that has been the same for almost a hundred years\nAnd with the with the new age ... analytics paper metrics or the game we're seeing so many different styles of play it in my opinion I think that's awesome because it gives your team and identity and gives your team something that represents them and by the way at the end of the day\nIt's all about getting outs right ... getting people out and score and more ... than the other team so in my opinion regardless of how you get that done\nYou got to be you and your team to be you you've got to have a blast doing it and with the way the Milwaukee Brewers the strength of their ball club is they're both at so why would you not paid or the way you play the game to bring your best players into the game at the most important top so I think with what they're doing right now\nIt's exciting a it's a lot of fun but I think in general no one's ever seen it done before and I think that's why the hesitation comes in because\nPeople are so used to other things being done and I think the way the Milwaukee Brewers are doing it is different and people are a little as a tenth of that\nWe know that in the postseason the brewers have been great at runners with runners in scoring position but they're also second in in the teams that are in the postseason as far as running it runs its going position does it bother you that the Dodgers\nThey're bigger bags even though you did have a chance to get that bomb and the last game they're bigger hit on his have not really produced as much here in the postseason\nYeah you're right I mean if you look at both both line up then you look at obviously the the caliber of of batting that you have in both lineups the Milwaukee Brewers guys have drawn such a tremendous job so far I mean even aircraft what five for eight in the theory\nI mean come on and that's absolutely amazing when you get production out of that are out of those guys but you don't necessarily expect them to do\nThat ... death with jumpstart your squad because you know what Christian yeah which is going to do you know what the reds okay there's going to do so to be able to get help from the other guys in their line up I think is obviously crucial as well now here's the deal\nOff in between series now that can affect the bat or a little bit so I think moving forward got the end of the F a squad that is so excited to be there that no one really thought they would be\nBut you also have guys like Mike ... runs okay these do tough one world series if you ever have those guys on your squad can definitely help the attitude of the team and when times get tough it's nice to be able to lean back on those guys because both of those guys have been there and done that\nTalking with Nick Swisher Fox Sports ... will be analysts there you want a World Series you know what it takes to get there how much does experience play into this when you talk about leaning on a guy like low Cain and ... and some of the guys that have had a chance to actually get or even a guy like brown who's been doing it now see us before but hasn't gotten past that around how much does experience playing into this\n... absolutely here in in my opinion uh I think experience is the greatest tool that one can have and I think if you look at the Atlanta Braves and the Los Angeles Dodgers in that series right there I think it just went to show you that to have experience in not\nTrouble you know it's not freaked out when things are kind of going against you it's nice to be able to have that in your back pocket because you know what to expect\nThe crazy thing about the play offs is different you can be in the third inning with a runner on first base to out and the crowds going crazy like at the bottom of the night so I think the general you have to be able to control your emotions something that I've struggled with big time because I'm an emotional God was to be able to have that or something to relate back to\nTo know exactly what those feelings are light that's why I think in ... in ... in a little bit uh I feel like the Los Angeles Dodgers have a little bit of advantage on that because they had been there I mean this has been there for what five six years in a row they know exactly what's going on it's been a minute from Milwaukee\nBut hey you don't always have to be the best team to win and that's the great thing about baseball man that's why we got to play 'em up\nYou went through those who do lean on\nOh come on man I Derek Jeter who do the best in the day man like Mr restaurant Tobar Mr November whatever you want to call him\nHe was one of those guys that just knew how to like for myself he knew how to call me down and I think he also knew how to call and everybody else and by the way as a player in the locker room how easy is it the following the footsteps\nOf Derek Jeter it's pretty easy man and you're talking about one of the best it's very easy to have a guy like that and it's very easy to follow somebody like that so I think that's where your leaders tend to step in I think that's where your experience that Ben and I'm super excited to see a man because I think in general\nFor the brewers man they're hot and there are a lot of fun to watch and they've got some super swag going on I'll never forget earlier in the season I think his name was or any hit us first home run this year mhm an egg and somebody else put him up on their shoulders like he was Rudy Rudy gr\nI don't care who the match up as and we can talk all day long about Houston Boston or whoever might represent the ... the brewers get through the Dodgers here it doesn't matter these guys have been playing playoff baseball for a long time and I like those odds I Do\nA gym we just didn't expose your on and he said usually during the regular season the the saber metrics they mean something over the long haul in the postseason he says it's more about clubhouse in leadership and\nWe know that David Stern went out and got him was because she got all the rooms okay he got guys that have been there done that how much do you think all of this and the positivity that they can bring knowing that they want a world championship and know what it takes to get from point a to point B what does that mean inside the club else in your opinion not to mention there led by a guy who's going to um\n[noise] it's it's huge and it and it breaks down a too that a connection that those players have and and we saw\nA crowd council address at once these acquisitions were made that he did communicate with these guys and and it's brilliant to to sit down and talk with Travis saw that hey we we brought in most but now we're going to need ya ... we're going to also make some sacrifices you sit down Eric themes and say Eric dude\nHere's the deal there's going to have to be some sacrifices made you you're an important part here [noise] important piece here leading up to this point but at at this time\nOr we're going to communicate to you that this about team and and it isn't about statistical information it's not about what contract you may or may not be going for none of that it's not about your future it's about living here and now and that's that's where I cried council\nYou know in this club houses is going to come in handy or\nWhat what turns the series one way or the other in your opinion\nI think it's the brewers ...\nAnd and it has been the brewers off as they've been doing enough just enough but you you gotta look at the the recent history here first of all of average to say that that are often is going to put up a big number soon you hope it's tonight maybe tomorrow night maybe game three\nBut it's common it's someone's going to pop a three run shot here bill someone may hit a grand slam here bill soon and\nAnd when when that happens that might be a page Turner there in the series a because they've been fighting and scratch him for runs here and there you get the unlikely back to back from Marcy in and ... and I'm not talking about that I'm Talking about\nWhat Craig council predicted that who's who's in the playoffs going to hit a three run Homer I promise I mean that's what that's what the man's that now he turned out it was a solo shot a travesty off may get a a a an out better to against left hander here\nAnd maybe he pulls on or or goes ... and and as a three run bomb but that's come up with\nAll things told I think we know we get with the starters they're going to battle we know we get with the bullpen\nThey're going to walk down that often sets the wild card here the defense of that has been tough to they've been they've been really good but it set off and says the wild card\nWhen ah you know Craig council announced the starting rotation uh it's interesting 'cause we're all thinking ... he's been your guy\nA and then you look at the logic of it and what you can always just brought to the table the fact that there's a you know a strategy to this when it comes to match ups flipping guys around ... and some of those lesser hitters that aren't really kind of stroke into baseball right now\nUm you can kind of see how the brewers got to where they are ... philosophically speaking\nYou can and at this point I'm not gonna dealt with Craig council makes in terms of decisions with his with his pitching staff I he is by far proven it to me and they should be proven that to everybody else\nI Know we're not going to agree fully a hundred percent with any of the ... everything any manager does that's just the nature of baseball that's the great debate about baseball\nBut I'm going to stop doubting that dude big and and not that I have been the last year because I really like this you know all you know we've all that every single pitcher going out there and doing a job and getting whatever outs are required I'm all for that but when he when he goes bullpen and game\nFirst playoff series in seven years at a lot of people said what are you doing\nAre you crazy this is the I mean this is a big time here this is a post season\nAnd it came out just just ... it was it was it was amazing and so I'm not going to doubt it um I Do want to see Orlando are seeing there with these left these uh with the balls beaten to the left side of the diamond I think Garcia is key here and you may have to give up\nAs I just discuss the options of us go in there but but you're going to have to have some defense in their cars I see a lot of ground balls left side the next two games\nA gym I don't want to get ahead of myself people around you know World Series in celebrations in such you know we've kind of wax nostalgic about it a little bit um but I I just don't want to get too far ahead I think\nA ... as much as we talk about what can the brewers due to women series the Dodgers are dangerous team they've got an off and they can open up they've got a very solid pitching staff the nod for the ... certainly goes to the brewers but if you go round the diamond pound for pound\nThat it's a hell of a match up and these these two I mean the Dodgers were just there so they got the experience as well they know probably better than anybody what it takes to get there and then to take that next step so\nUm I ... as much as I Want to talk about the experience for the Milwaukee Brewers and what they need the Dodgers this is this is David ... so to speak [noise]\nBreak it down to getting that first out today and that's what it comes down to an end and really after a couple of outs key it's it's super key to to send a message to the Dodgers airplane a baseball game this isn't a fashion show LA you're playing baseball you're playing in the dirt baseball and it\nDoesn't have to look pretty from Milwaukee and cried counsel as as really in a in a manner of speaking has agreed with that that it doesn't matter you stack up when that's what matters that message has got to be sent a bill that that that's the message that has to be sent to the Dodgers team\nPeople talk about the thump from the Dodgers I looked at it hit us ten ballplayers with some really good power numbers homers an RV eyes\nYou know the brewers have seven as anyone noticed they go Seventy right in some big time some numbers they can go toe to toe with that team but the message has to be that this is about making a play this about taking a good swing on a patch this was about force in that what's interesting tonight\nIs about forcing cursory auto to work that pitch count up because it may come in handy in a seven game series working\nWorking working or do you or do you attack him you attack him and get him back to where he was in the playoffs years ago and that was awful so you do have now that strategy I'm really interested in I I don't know about if you guys have talked about\nThat I Know you're you're right though we haven't gotten into that but if he starts out pounding the strike zone and he's doing it with fast balls in breaking balls you\nGot you got to go after him but he started throwing at breaking ball and throwing it for strikes you got to move up and you're going to start becoming even more aggressive because the more he gets to agree with the breaking pitch\nHe he's deadly but if he not hitting it for strikes you can make him work all day and and that's the key to getting to ... he's not throwing the breaking ball for strikes he can he can make it really tough on himself early on\nYeah and you'll see we'll see early on in the first couple of innings whether he's going to settle in or not and to get him to settle in it is often protects him and he gets to settle in and they often for the Dodgers puts up a forest spotted a through the first three or four innings\nYou know that that doesn't bode well so you've got your decision to make their\nI Want to see a a guy like zoo's a guy like moose one of these guys take him for a double digit at bat and continue to battle hymn follow him off at the same time\nYou know you're putting pressure on these guys you're working out that pitch count and every single time he has to have a ... having count as a bonus for this baseball team so\nIf he's on your right if he saw it and you're probably going to have to change your tax just a bit and start attacking him if he's not than work him make that big boy work tonight and and that could come in handy come game for\nSix or seven if if it goes that far then one more thing bill I a with a ... amount of walk off victories for the brewers at Miller Park\nThis year ... just ... your seatbelt brewers fans it could happen it absolutely could happen in a walk off fashion that puts this team into the world series in this series\nAbsolutely could happen game six or seven you prepared for that\nIf it happens to be careful there some larger people running around out there and they drove her underwear at you they knocked over ... okay when you're out and kill his bleachers and I'd be careful I wear a helmet\nRight there on blue mound I Know are talking with the folks over there they said that um they were standing room only a Thursday and friday\nBecause of their proximity and I suspect it's it's gonna be a ... a a

welcome [noise] do I\nGo show is on the air and are you ready brewers nature [noise]\nWe're now eight hours away from the beginning of the NFL's see as the Milwaukee Brewers hosting the LA Dodgers at\nMiller Park gates will open up in five hours\nAs far as the parking lot gates and then a forty minutes after that be a ballpark age will open and I'm sure there's people already down their first in line to try to get into this thing has brewers fever is certainly overtaken the state of Wisconsin\nNot just the city of Milwaukee but the entire surrounding area and the state itself in a guy that you can see on the Fox sports broadcast Fox Sports Wisconsin Jerry August the now joining us an e Schneider orange hotline Augie how you doing today\nBoy what a great day for a baseball game in part\nAbsolutely you know what any days a good day for a baseball game and Miller Park whether it's a April or whether it's October because then at least you know you're playing October baseball so I Want to ask you how much if any do you think the off days have either hurt or help this gene\n... of or co I think it helps both book when you get a\nCouple of days just to get away and then come back and I think create conflict in it right he gave them a off then he had a\nWorkout on Tuesday and Wednesday and then uh yesterday for preparing for for this but I think it's good for everybody just sit back they've gone through a lot they just want some really big ball game show just how you read dial in they get ready for this big series\n[noise] what do you think ah because everybody has an opinion on what can turn this thing what can turn it into positive or negative light and that type of thing so what do you think needs to happen what do you think the brewers need to do to walk away and not even with a victory in the series but I'm just talking about getting more\nI think execution plays begging this in this series with both clubs I think the team that actually huge better is going to win when you look at this club\nBoth clubs reverse it all uh I think when you look at their starting pitching their starting pitching is probably a little bit better than the brewers but when you look at the book and the focus better are uh the book is better for Bush and I think when you look up as of diversity agility that both teams have is is just about the same\nSo I think it's just going to be execution and you look at what's been the success of\nThe Dodgers lately it's really been that have been able to get a lot of wash applying pressure what has been successful for the brewers getting walks applying pressure off as of late and playing good solid defense so I think when it comes right down to it this this series will be won by execution\n[noise] when people talk about the ... when I talk to Nick Swisher the will be a Fox Sports broadcast a little while ago about this but it seemed like nationally they look over the fence and they say this is kind of a gimmick I I I don't get it I don't want to embrace it even though the brewers have been winning with these out get her mentality for some time now\nUm why ... why is everybody because I'm sure as a pitcher you probably looked at this been thought what the hell why are people so reluctant to take the brewers serious when they talk about out gathers in a in a pitching staff\nWell it's because of the way they're doing it this is something that's very unusual and baseball we're not sticking to the the history of baseball and and doing the things that most clubs do by having designated starters and and

go\n\nGreat council magic commercial that aired a awhile ago as a matter of fact when was it was that two thousand sixteen I Believe yeah twenty sixty early twenties yeah he\nWas named to the manager the Milwaukee Brewers and and the brewers knew they were gonna start tearing it down and remaking it and that's when they needed to change things it was no longer come out and see this this winter\nAnd this was ...\nIt was brilliant marketing in the sense that it basically said if you're brewers fan take ownership you're born or brewer you've lived abroad or most likely you'll die a brewer and take ownership\nAnd it was it was brilliant brilliant marketing because you basically told fans give\nUs a little while you're one of us just give us a little while and now here we are\nEight five five eight three zero eight six four eighty five five eight three zero eight six for eight oh we'll wait we'll wait the brewers release oh at least\nBall their roster the Dodgers has been out a while now the brewers have not released there's yet\nI'm sure the Dodgers have it but it is it's odd it hasn't come out it's been over an hour and one twenty minutes twenty five minutes male jokes that ah they were supposed to be in the lead authors\nAnd are we still have not seen what the NFL cs roster looks like\nFor the Milwaukee Brewers it's it's a conundrum we were going to sit here and break it down to talk about it but we still don't have it so we're always taking their time\nPutting it all together eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight five five eight three zero eight six point she back to the phone calls talked to a gym in loyal Tim how're you doing that I mean it was going on\n[noise] bill I'm exciting time in Milwaukee I'm I'm going to a I'm going to be in Marshfield and I'm going to be watching it if not the\nOh I Love that relies on our show there before it's fantastic\nI Know why I came over and watched it when you had your show yeah fun place um [noise] the one thing they have to do is they have to keep the Dodgers from hitting home runs they got to kick the ball in the park and that can do that I think they can win the series and I think they're going to go with Thirteen pictures\nI notice now get but um I think they're going to go searching pictures I think they're going to put for the annual back in there to hit to pitch against the individual left hander ...\nSo that they had to eleven so who else do they then bring on Sosa dania would would give them twelve who else would they bring on after that\nWell they they had Davies pitching off among other day from what I heard okay and I think they'll taught him I think they'll put him in the pitching staff as well\nYou think you bring them back for the you know see us okay All right we'll see what happens why we appreciate the phone call and enjoy nuts deep they've gotten that Steven Nazi to two different bars too great places a lot of fun up there in Marshfield hell yeah great place to go [noise]\nUm this is from Pedro who says he's going to be watching it on Phoenix, Arizona Johnny is listening to his right now and he's down in Tuscaloosa, Alabama\nBig time brewers

eight three zero eight six for let's go to Mike Mike how you doing buddy\n[laughter] no I Would take another caller I\nAm I going to have somebody needs to go home like him throw yourself on something [laughter] I've never gone to a caller news in the mid ... let's go to Ken listening to us in West bank and how you doing today man what's going on\n[laughter] that was hilarious he actually might have been talking out of beer or\nAt home I go to yeah they're given those things away today from a three to four thirty or something like that right at\nThree to five there's like a hundred and forty bars that are involved yeah and you could walk in each one and have a Miller light yeah I'm a I'm a I'm course or a you know for the for beating Iraqi so uh that's out there I think I Would I think it's intriguing I I think that the Dodgers\nArrogant is intriguing especially with the bulletin board material that we put out there mhm so\nI look at some of that and I go with the brewers they can easily be motivated by a number of different things that that they need to there they are that damn good in my opinion\nI don't see this going to have five games bill I really don't I think the brewers pitching is that good I think they're obviously they're middle reliever bullpen is outstanding and bacon had I mean no two ways about it this team can happen\nAnd if they can hit those runners entered scoring position on a consistent basis LA it will be no match for\nThey're going to go ahead and they're going to put them away and I do see babies being on the squad because he has been exceptionally well against the Dodgers so um\nPlace so we got to do a better job of\nThe little things and and penalties are part of the\nSudden the next question is what are the coaches saying to the players I mean order when they get breakdown in the position groups you know what are they saying about how do you get your head and the game and avoid these families even though maybe the restaurant to keep tack and here's what Dante Adams had to say\nSomething that might talk about it so you know the the combat apparently they are going to happen because it's part of the game but\nFree snap and discipline and stuff like that we got to make sure that we get those out because all that does it limits you know open your eyes and holding and stuff like that going to happen is part of the game but we also want to limit that as much as we\nMight go when you're talking about devine to Adams ... ... you know this is an off it's an easy to get a better start ... we've got Aaron Rodgers saying that the matchup down feel they need to get him to Baltimore he's airplane maker how do they do that\nI don't know how can they it's like we talked about last night I think I think the voluntary Adams and ... I think that there are more shot plays that they should be taking early in the game projects\nWith a single ... safety device ... dealing with a calf injury but he's still got separation pretty good last week against the lions he says it's so hard but it's coming along\nAnd you know when they talk about the little things it it's it's actually pretty tactical there's a lot of things that people do in the hand to hand combat\nAnd whether you're going to turn laughter turn right depending on how you know you get the inside or outside leverage from a defensive back and and where you're supposed to exactly be where's the window going to be in his own defense and so devout they talked about\nThey just made it he thinks they're close and being more on the same page\nTo just the executions all the small things I mean you know I got to make sure my ... you know to make sure he's he's in his in a you know who may consider ways than it is a small thing that that that leads to the place you know Arizona's like the [noise]\nHe doesn't like the ... so you when you are now that are going to make sure I'm continuing walk into a field and those are the ones that spring in a can put us in a position to be overly [noise]\nThe other thing is is that it's\nLeadership leadership from a receiver sang and you know what I gotta follow through on my ... feel ... that could be the difference between Aaron John scoring or just getting a first out\nYou know I was gonna say the same thing goes with special teams I mean I that as much as we talk ... defensively specialty has been a ... you know makes you cross beside they've had some sloppy moments there too [noise]\nThey've had sloppy ... and let's talk about the safety position Tomahawk Clinton did acts as a former first round pick a guy went to the pro bowl and twenty sixteen and now the drop off and you would think after\nYou had Mike a high go to the bills and not Morgan burn that go to the Steelers this guy who's in his contract year would be just all over the field and and making a case he he said this quote to the Wisconsin state journal right now\nI'm playing each and every game like it's my last I don't think I'm going to be here next year\nThat's how I look at it I have to be honest with myself\nYou have to play a game to game while they're losing by sixty points they had to go out there and perform this is my biggest interview my career so I've got to perform regardless of what the record says it's almost like he sees born let go and like a high go any figures yeah the Packers aren't going to read them may\nMaybe he's already checked out and they got Josh Jones a second round there from last year athletic as heck everybody knows he can go all over the field but here's what his comment was one he blows at sixty four yard\nI'd kick returned from time Montgomery early in the game at Ford Field against the lions here's what he said why he got called for holding\nUm as far as like what happened on on those ties long return 'em in the back or you know what I what I could have did better by getting my head across maybe they wouldn't call it um\nMaybe I could in his late on a dime and they want to call you know what I mean he he sold it you know pretty good managers anytime anytime a guy falls behind a return or\nOr any type of return saying they are they're going to call it that penalty nine times out of thin is this is it the nature of the game and how\nHow they look at it you know what I'm saying I'm they they thought her dog I blocked in the back a\nFifty fifty is also\nSo not my fault but you know I look at it maybe it was maybe just felt it was a bad call but you kind of go in the not my fault route\nOr this teachers need to do a better job all the way around like I mean I don't know how to put it I mean you guys say they they deserve more playing time and want to be in there and and I get it but you know damaged you got to be technically sound you got to be better\nJosh Jones should be one of the starting safety is we shouldn't even be talking about is how how Clinton Dixon Josh Jones both athletic on the back in and one of them added to the pro ball and instead you got control Bryce another on drafted guy Jermaine why that is pushing to get in there\nUm you know what's going wrong with the draft system and being able to secure and not give up the Seventy five yard touchdown says the findings and on and on and on so this was Josh Charles he does a show called Columbus live in Green Bay at a club and it's sponsored by the Green Bay press Gazette\nAnd he was talking the other night about oh I'm sure he had the ankle injury at the end of training camp but he was sort of that got to say you're a second round pick man you should be a starter on the defense right and here's what Josh John set\nThat's why that's what I'm ... I mean you know take a plane is sitting around with them to to not do an opportunity to the theme around my right arm around\nOh no you know I I don't I don't like you know what I'm saying some guys some guys but ... everybody for the game for different reasons you know some ... game because what comes with what they can get out of it some guys as they enjoy just getting a check every two weeks you know they're okay with just being a mediocre and not improving and just being one of the guys on the team\nAnd you know me on the ... I Want to work for what I what I did you know what I'm saying I don't want to get a check and feel like I didn't do nothing for you know what I'm saying especially when you know that you could be out there you know what I'm saying you know you can contribute to the theme you know that that that will hurt the most you know what I'm saying so it's it's tough\nGeorge Jones is Christoph ... is not playing it because if he wasn't then I'd be concerned so the fact that he's hungry and he wants to get out there I think it does do something about him but there's there's more to that\n[noise] I Wonder what they're doing more to it is\nWhy I think you have a better chance of being the starting safety if he could manage to not screw up a kick return for sixty four yards and get called on the ball carriers already Fifteen yards ahead of you down field\nFaces another words Mike mccarthy saying look ... you know try not to get a patently un special teams and never will put your back in the gay\nMike how badly do they need this wanting to play a pretty clean game against San Francisco\nI think I think it's really sick right now I think it's I think Israelis and San Francisco bad they've lost by a couple of points even though Jimmy ... been out now for two games they're productive team then they've got plenty of weapons and I'll give you a full previous to I mean I've been watching some type of them that\nI don't I'm not trying to hide the game I'm just telling you\nThey're they're I don't know who the really bad team is all over maybe the giants proved that last night uh you know there's a lot of these teams have got plenty of town there isn't somebody that's just completely void like the browns have been the last couple of years to modern way and you talk to him about mistakes on the back in the secondary here's what trauma and told me yesterday afternoon\nIn vitro we just heard outfield\nTurnovers and even when we did get back on the field with sharp position show feel position as a defense you know we got to hold them to\nMore than anything and we had those opportunities we got him to turn down a couple of times\nA couple of miscommunication and as you said at that point on the third on his own money down though\nTom if we can get out of those down where you know with the although I Would have been in their hand\nI mean part of it is these right we talk about that last night you're a couple of mistakes away maybe a couple of more wins you know what I mean so I I don't know how good the Packers are I don't know if there are a couple of mistakes away me even worse football team or a better football team but they got something's got to give this Monday Night and it's going to go by we trying to figure this out\n[noise] yeah I'm a car they had a really long explanation today I've got that for you right now but he talked about you know all kinds of little things that they're talking about things that things that are being Mr meetings a execution all that but I'll tell ya\nI don't know there's like a car through right now I I think he's kinda grasping for for answers I I think he's feels like his back to the wall a little bit and he's repeating itself and not getting seeming to get his message through\nAnd he can't get his quarterback you know a ... in second they still got plenty of players plenty of weapons as far as like they've been decimated by injuries [noise] um it's going to I'm tired of the time they had about work in progress and and I I still think that they\nThey're almost four four to six quarters away from from really being or they should be if they have any chance I think those are going to dominate go deep in the playoffs the season\nMy great show with John again on Monday okay\nThank you John you later there you go Mike Clemens medical series written joining us for a couple of minutes on the Schneider orange outlined drivers right now your card ... eighty plus years ever going to get don't call them a hundred and forty four prior to go to shatter jobs dot com more though Michael show some boomers cheddar mixed\nYou are listening to them my cool sports network [noise]\n...

[noise] Miller Park we are under now seven hours away [noise] six hours and forty minutes [noise] forty\nFive minutes away from this contest getting underway between the brewers and the Dodgers [noise]\nCan't wait to brewers just released to their animals cs roster will tell you what the change was momentarily just portion of the program broad you are terrific friends over van horn automotive you heard me talk about this group now\nAnd I've had more than a few people that have said okay tell me a little bit more about because of this Ninety a test drive by what what's the catch there isn't one some jobs you ride around the block at a car dealership and you think okay this is cool there's really rides nice kind of nice smell okay great\nVan horn though no no no they offer the Ninety Days test drive program it's available then either FCAT locations in Plymouth ...\nUh you can take a ride in a brand new whether to ram Fifteen hundred Jeep Grand Cherokee dodge charger dodge grand caravan Chrysler Pacifica whatever maybe it has Ninety Days with no obligation match right if you're not satisfied just bring it back and in addition\nA him for her know digital commitment by the way but in addition if you do by you can save up to to grant\nSo I just went out and I started driving a couple of different vehicles and I thought you know what let me drive this for a while I picked up a two thousand and Nineteen ram Fifteen hundred is like a luxury car wrapped in a truck I've been saying this for a while I got an today the seats were on heated and so was this theory well I didn't realize how much I like the heat it's during world so I had one\nThat was it the truck center in Plymouth I Love this thing you can as well whether like I said it's a it's a ram a jeep a dodge whenever it happens to be busy at ... van horn auto died comments van horn auto dot com and shopping and tore that qualifies for the Ninety Days test drive program that's exclusively\nAnd van horn again go to van horn auto dot com\nSo I I was mentioning seven forty seven and if you don't know what that specifically means I'll tell you\nThis was from Ken Rosenthal I just posted is a little while to get to know ... is a good picture in a very nice guy\nBut what were the odds that he would start game one of the NFL cs after posting a seven forty seven E. R. A. in August on August thirty first day the brewers got ... Gonzalez from the national to make them eligible for the postseason Russia's move\nHad the look of a desperation the natural response to the brewers actions then and now could best be summed up in one word as really with a question mark\nIt goes on from there but basically um the brewers getting into the you know the ads and these different approaches manager Craig council kinda understated or the other day oh we're going to use are pitching a little bit differently than traditionalists would like\nAnd it's he's absolutely right it's different than what traditionalist would like which I think is part of the reason that so many people are kind of knocking it\nBut I also know that looking over the fence from what we've seen this year is a lot of people get it now what they did for those that don't know exactly what to join I talked about yesterday\nFather and I don't see as roster is exactly the same except for key on ... did not make the roster saviors to Danielle\nDid make the roster bashed the difference\nThey carry twelve pictures instead of eleven Seeger's today and you know he's on the roster and then you've got off at the roster key on Bronx to one of the outfielders so you keep your infield is the same scope still their experience is still there\nCain Granderson Domingo Santana and yell edge as your outfielders and you bring in ... and Daniel [noise] as a lefty and Craig counseling and David Stern looking at this thing going when he's ... he's we're going through these guys around\nDo some of their lesser hitters so there you go that's the roster\nNothing shocking near Jones pretty much what we thought would happen\nYeah I'd said yesterday or the Danielle should be in an extra left handed pitcher that you need and the debate came down to ...\nNow I was trying to make a case for Jonathan scope to be removed because he has not been hitting the ball well at all he has a career one for Nineteen against Dodger hitters he's old for eleven between Clinton Kirsch on rich ... combined that includes seven strike out not to be interesting tonight\nDoes correct council put Jonathan scope in this light up against her shah\nUh you'd like to think he wants to get as many writers in their Jonathan scope being one of them\nA full see well we we really we shall see and I and I understand the logic by putting Jonathan scope in there regardless because it is a right handed batter and you have so many let painted pictures that you're going to be dealing with throughout the course of the series from the Dodgers so there's a legitimate arguments both way\nOverall I'm perfectly fine with how it stands and Ariel baby\nHere we go so uh what I Want to know from you is your predictions predictions for the animals\nSee us we're going to start and right here right now and also keep it coming because a lot of great places\nWhere many of you are watching the games that I Love hearing the names of all of these bars I Love hearing the names of all these different places or a friend of mine Mike who is listening to us yeah down in Cincinnati set a dozen your buddy Jimmy morning\nOwned the holy grail that's we're all going to be watching the game go breweries if it can't be the reds I Love the crew a and Mike appreciate it but yes I think uh I think it is Jim morning as a matter of fact I went to high school with a guy but he owns a holy grail right next to\nA great American ballpark and that's a great sports bar down there I've done a mole eggers show from seven hundred W W down there a couple of times but\nA good people I've also got one

listening to the game are not going to be in the realm of TV going to be on the in the car driving a McKay\nSays Nashville, Tennessee we had to Nashville or a little bit earlier as a matter of fact of the people all over so it keep it come and we want to know where you're watching the game we want to know what your production is gives your thoughts now as far as my prediction for this series goes I've said all along I thought the brewers committed when this thing and five\nYou go to seven I I get nervous six yeah it'd be great to win at home\nBut a lot of times these series do go six by the way I just think that if the brewers stay rolling they're going to win this thing in in five games if they don't they could come to an end in six with the Dodgers celebrating on the road\nSo I'm saying brewers in five to win this thing and ah tonight's game I'm going to be watching 'em and we're going to dinner um there's some things going on with the kids so we're just going to go out to dinner we're going to catch it someplace that it's on a sharing tomorrow or they're going to be there\nThey're going to be there in person but tonight\nIt's going to be hanging out in uh watching it somewhere and the first couple of innings and then after that\nWe just got the house and it's got this giant enormous great room and it went this just massive television so I'm going to be kicked back like in a movie theater probably about the fifth inning and just a toasting up and and just watching the game unfold I Can't I Can't wait I'm just to be extremely excited for this thing to see

arms to the watching from the third row of left field brewers in five I Know you're not my mother but how much do we need to bundle up for the game inside Miller Park a hash tag October baseball [noise]\nUm how much need to be you know what I might Simpson is the heat so on and I would dress like it's a sixty five degree day that's probably about what the temperature is going to be once you get a big crowd and everybody starts jumping around\nThen you're going to be good to go so I'm not overly concerned about it but\nUm that's that's kinda my my guess is usually gets about sixty five degrees if you're out in the outfield and you're you're near one of the openings maybe a little bit colder especially in the winter it's kicking in but for the most part it's not bad once you get in there [noise] um\nThis one from Jack Jack alone because I uh ... uh McCarthy's press coverage does bother me seemed to be full of crap twenty four seven but I've got the Dodgers in sick 'cause I'm a a brewers fan but today ... days off are going to hurt the brewers momentum watching the game at ... blue ribbon on blue male or a buddy fledge throws a ah\nHe says brewers in seven this was your brand
