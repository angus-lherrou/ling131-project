[noise]\n\n\n[noise] so I'm On the Monday that we would be sitting here today and talking brewers baseball in the sense of getting ready for a World Series I Will say that I said they would I really did I felt that they were going to win it I felt that that a bunch of explosion would have happened on friday night and it did\nMatter of fact I feel pretty good because I had a buddy of mine in Vegas and I put my money where my mouth was I said ... drones are over ... gonna whether you like are you serious I said do it and I did it and sure enough one money which was nice\nUh I like fifty bucks ride I kept the rest of the winnings I wasn't as confident but I Do believe that the brewers we're gonna win and I don't often bet so I put fifty bucks down again on the ... when the game I said it would be closer game though\nAnd ah unfortunately it didn't even turn out to be a closer game and it didn't turn out to be a brewers when the brewers go down five to one now\nMe emotional reaction was visceral\nAnd the step back reaction needs to be common sense and reality and that's kind of where we're at today because\nYou know again the best record in the national league for best record in baseball and all of a sudden everybody's stinks you know council decision stinks I mean Jeffress stinks y'all it stinks I mean it just it was it was\nI don't know if it was drunken comical or if it was angry or sad\nOr if it was people that have money on a game that lost money I I have no idea\nBut you know look you yell at each got you hear Jeffress gotcha here hater can able\nRon gotcha here\nYou know there was a couple of guys that\nJust didn't produce the way you would have hoped going in the postseason specifically in an ally and I'll see us but I had pounded the desk time and again time and again going into the post season and the old adage held true yet again good pitching beats good hitting which is why you need good pitching\nConstantly you you have to have it so you know a a team that had been there done that one it is what it is the one thing I Will\nSay go back to two thousand and fourteen\nTwo thousand and four team the Kansas City royals ended up as a wildcard in the post season\nThey were young they had some veterans they had some guy started to come of age they had some good pitching they had a collegiate like atmosphere they had a family style atmosphere there was one for all for one they had a a manager Ned Yost you wait times made some bad news at times made some great moves and they all believed in one another\nAnd they promptly went into the postseason and got we have four games than uh nothing by the Baltimore Orioles\nThe next year they came back and won the whole damn thing you know I'm not saying that the ... going to come back and when the whole damn thing but you have to sometimes walk before you run and maybe just maybe that's what this year was ... in the grand scheme of things\nAnd I always try to look at the big picture and the grand scheme of things you're you're probably a year ahead of you rebuild\n\n\n\nWhat\nDo I go show I mean we're glad you're on board today hopefully you're having a fantastic day procedure hanging out with us talking to ... baseball kind of post mortem on the season and don't forget the season is never over when it comes to our friends over cousin ... so you're the\nProud sponsor the program want to remind you that coming up right around the corner you've got the opportunity to get yourself into the ... and the ... the ... the buckeyes the patch or should I say calling and Bucky the badgers a taken on um\nMinnesota golden golfers and what we were just basically doing they want to bring into the game watched about over ... in addition to that\nThey then want to make sure that uh you know you're going to be able to have yourself a good time so they put you know big tailgate party put you give your Jersey or by the way customers Jersey a year's supply of cousins jobs along the way all good stuff all fantastic so all complements were friends over cutting subs cousins jobs this word they believe in better\nLet's get to the phone calls and that kind of do the post mortem on all of his Sean listening to us in Madison Sean how you doing man what's going on\nHey bill bear with me and I'm trying to get my voice crack sure um\nI gotta tell ya I stood on the stand her game seven and I watch Dr celebrate all hands are finally how the ballpark I went from Matt ... fat appointed\nAnd now I'm optimistic I'm over the last two days here I mean let's put this in perspective we had\nAn eight or tier salad you know Brad Miller thirty eight year old catcher made up his team throughout the year we made it a game seven ... and I'll see us\nWhere the journey and then starting pitchers made her take games I mean next year we'll have the whole team back I'm sure she'll be looking to add more people around dirty kind of make the stream better\nWe got him in alpha coming back who either while we average he's healthy burns and ... on your lap and they're all ... and I mean their future cases\nAnd my final point is Craig ... what amazing job you're dead people questioned him all the moves he's had to ... with the players that he had and what he was able to do with the same as just short of amazing so just a great job there next year World Series and hundred and fifty seven days to opening thanks\nVery appreciate it he drops off you get on board eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight by eight three zero eight six for eight would love to hear from you I'm when he talks about all the moves the Craig council had to make\nHe's right lotta moved a lot of thinking this year was a tremendous year when it comes to the managerial ups and downs of Craig council\nUm not every move was perfect I mean a lot of times you put guys in position to win and then you know if they execute they execute you'll have like a genius and if they don't want the unity of for doing it\nUm and they're you know what it was\nA true terrific season in the sense of\nThe growing experiences both manager in team\nI'm not going to sit here and make excuses for some of the failures because there was times I think that you\nKnow I I did the team didn't do enough I ... and I'm not going to bring up the bunny thing specifically other than the fact that I don't know if you were listening to the broadcast on Saturday Night um you get a lead off runner on and John smoke just started talking about fundamentals of baseball\nTheir unconventional and they swing for power and they swing kinda gripping and rip it and and he said I went to ... council before the game and I said Craig\nNot me but this is this is John ... email you said Greg I I you know if you had to manufacture run which they've had to do a couple of times you had to manufacture running really just dropped and a bunch of sense to get a runner over him in scoring position who would you say your best interests and he said Craig didn't\nKnow and and Joe Buck's at what he said Craig doesn't know they don't do it that's\nI'm Sorry but if you can't execute the entire basket the fundamentals\nNow we know you hit the ball you see the ball catch the ball throw the ball and all that kind of stuff but there's a lot more that goes into it there's there's there's hit and run there's the ability to see all the time we base\nAre getting cut off men not overthrowing allowing runners do advance putting more pictures and stress on your pictures you know a lot of things fundamentally sound baseball that you don't always think about\nYou know it's a fruit flies over the head of a man and a guy goes in first or second suddenly you got to starting pitcher again pushing out of the stress because we've got a man on second and now you have to change your philosophy with a guy the plane\nYou know rather than a ground ball get you to ... you know then you start thinking about okay the next battering the match ups and is it puts undue stress on the team the same way you can't execute fundamentals\nAnd I know the super metrics love to say hey there is more results high risk high reward in the long ball and Powerball and riveting rip it I get it but sometimes you have to\nYou not want to you have to when you were a team of struggling figure out ways to manufacture runs for at least to manufacture energy\nAnd if you can't do it and the manager doesn't know who can that's\nUtah I'm Sorry but you have a shortcoming and those shortcomings when it comes to postseason baseball will eventually be exposed\nPaid five five eight three zero eight six point let's go to Scott On the Southside Scott how are you doing today man what's going on\nUh [noise] yeah I'm doing okay it's I'm disappointed but I Believe we finally the first time out of the foundation in place for the future and you know I'm optimistic in a positive way\nYou know like you would have just said about you got to be able to manufacture runs and I says I Believe what the people we have we can make it we can make this happen I we have to make some changes I Believe we have to find life out a starter that can go a long distance you\nKnow kind of like uh some of these guys you know some of the some of the stars that that the Dodgers had that that we're able to Jamaica video\nBut you can like you said you have to be able to that was that was their downfall of the race they lost his game is they had died and starting British and and couldn't get him out and that was a key but I Believe we have a lot of good things in place there's some people I'm Glad I won't be next year\nThat I'm I'm Glad I'm hopefully they won't be back here but I'm\nI'm hoping to have all my craft comes back next year 'cause he's the positive you know yeah yeah he he's a he's a positive a\nMan and the and this and this organization\nBut um for the first time I can say I'm looking forward to next year I'm I'm I've never said that before and yeah you know they broke my heart again but you know after it was over I was like okay you know I feel bad but then again I'm a pot as far as far as we got and\nI'm looking forward to next year so hopefully we can make some changes and uh but the future I think to work out\nFive boroughs you're the man he drops off you're going to ... five five eight three zero eight six for eight they'd find five eight three zero eight six for eight\nGive us a shot want to hear from eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight and a if you can chime in if you've got a thought regarding the Milwaukee Brewers going in the next season or maybe the or the combination of the season\nFeel free to bring it feel free to bring it let's go to Anthony Anthony how you doing it I mean what's happening\nHi Bill thanks for taking my call your\nWondering whether or not they have maybe too many of the same kind of hit or in their light up as far as there are a lot that goes a bunch of big big swing in fog or type guys who went around to fifty but often can't make contact when just moving around her over as what's really needed I Wonder if they couldn't use another\nMore of a more and more of an upper level average hair who doesn't depend as much on hitting the bar the ballpark so that there are more guys on base for the ... the drive in in the first place and\nAs far as dive and scope and whether or not you're bringing back I remember looking at his style and when they traded forming even after the hot streak that that got him that player of the week award it was only hidden about too\nConcerned at the time that if that was the peak of about a bottle of wants to stay in hot streak I only gotten him to that point I think that's probably going to\nEnd up being more honest to twenty to thirty hitter as far as as everyday performance that's kinda how it ended up being with and so I don't I don't think I Would bring him back because\nThey've already got a bunch of other guys are lined up who who play off at the same way I I I'd like to see another another contact that they will not Atlanta and I do but somebody who who thinks that way in their approach to the plate I Wonder if that wouldn't help them prevent\nKnow scoring seven eight lines one game and then then nothing or one or two runs and actually make make things a little bit more consistent they'll yeah and the gap and their pitching staff I think\nThat you keep Miley and\nI Would take burns and ... with them and they're starting rotation they all our our arms of a lot of years ahead of them and I agree with what you are what are the people that in that\nThat's a lot I I\nI Love to see Jimmy Wales and come back but to me a gym and don't see them back that's icing on the cake that's not the cake\nYou I I don't know if you rely on that\nNow they know better than I Do about whatever his progress happens to be but still it's it's when you Aaron out that's still a major surgery that you're airing out this isn't like today's version of Tommy John surgery\nWhere nine months down the road you're starting to throw again and you know I'm a loving months down the road you're feeling really good about it that's not in\nThis big deal\nI'm not counting on Jimmy now\nRemember he was supposed to be back in June\nAnd then he couldn't he had a set back then he came back in July and he has a bit of a setback\nAnd it was August and then it was a shock to make the postseason roster he wasn't even really thrown off of a mound much less airing it out at Ninety six Ninety seven miles an hour so I'm not saying you can't just simply saying I'm not relying on that if you do you're crazy\nThey find find a three zero eight six forty eight five five eight three zero eight six for a give us a shall we want to hear from its got kj kj what's going on man\nHey Bill Stegman calls today or\nYou have to seize the moment and the brewers did not do that the growers totally for great season and their fans are but again you have to see some of it they have their opportunities they let them go by the wayside\nA I think there's got to be quite a few changes ah in the uh season coming up\nI I just got a short list that I just thought of a while I was sitting here on an all or I look at our story is Danielle Jennings\nAnd question mark Davis and taste that arson and like you said you don't know what else was going to be also look at actually are may be on the\nChopping block scope for sure I I think that they're going to bring in casting hero and play second base one hears positive that I have it is a land or sea a\nWhat a great series he had he had a hit and every one of the uh games and for all intents and purposes you should have been in the rye you should have been waiting probably six seven eight are leaving the guy to really get the ball\nI mean he was wearing the ball up every day\nAnd so we know what what we got there with him so I think he is a lot at shortstop going forward right now\nYou don't know the stock is get me back I take him to stop it does not come back you got Travis shower place or if they can't talk is I think you know travel shot at first to play every day first and get rid of a oh look look look what St Paul is banned\nI at first they tell me first baseman said they had seen the last seven years ago\nRight you know you're so I mean it's\nJust been a revolving door there I think they're going to put ... first play every day if they can keep my stock has a lot I think you would go back to a third\nAh everybody else you know hey you know obviously you ... you got yelling at each um you know Braun 'cause you know pretty much use his ear 'til the end of his career unless something a miraculous happens\nAnd and you know what he was all this money this postseason he was worth the money this guy was he was\nI have to say that but uh you know you don't know what you're going to get going forward and you only play like Ninety something games who knows if he's got to be healthy next year or you know how many games go play where the money's being paid right\nI get I take you to talk to you soon I mean there's a lot of good points I don't know necessarily that I again we went\nLast season thinking something completely different walked away can yell at you and we thought the ... the starting rotation was going to be garnered and it was it sue this year I the only thing I can say is if if if I had to put money on it\nA a starting pitcher doesn't necessarily make him a number one but they will go after starting pitcher other than that I think everything's up for grabs there's going to be some tinkering but the other thing to remember I go back to a travel show I said when we entered the courthouse in Phoenix, Arizona back during spring training\nAnd I said show you know glad to be back he said we're like families should the faces they haven't changed\nEverything's the same he said the same spirit seem enthusiasm everybody's got to each other's back you know it was just it it's like to be picked up where we left off that's kind of a feeling you're looking for going forward in the next season because next season is really the year that you're\nShoveling more chips to the middle of the table you're not getting crazy I mean if you're indeed saying we don't want to go crazy because we want to make sure that things got longevity I understand that\nBut again I also go back to broadcasters prognosticators saying all the cubs are going to win two to three fourths World Series barrier for years to come\nAnd I kept screaming at the radio saying just when one shut up and just when one because it changes so fast\nChanges so silly raining and I'll see as then they went to a World Series and wanted then they went to another and I'll see us and this year they they lost the game one sixty three and then they get\nBounced exactly you don't even know what they're going to look like next year because they are going to have to make a bunch of most 'cause a lot of the guys that was crazy about baseball so let's go back to two years ago three years ago when the cubs a\nBeat the cardinals and the postseason right got swept by the Mets and the next year they won it all everybody said oh man these guys are only going to get better guys like Addison Russell title short or they were up and coming\nRegret that the crazy thing about ... you can't just assume these guys are going to get better that team won a World Series and now it's like man he's got can't hit record to run one rod in their last what like twenty four innings they own baseball is actually\nThe same problems at many points to season at the brewers at where they would unload and explode and you'd think here we go to your job man you know what I mean it's it's exactly right you got to continue to morph into something you've got to continue to make moves\nYou know and and they just have not been that team that everybody was so afraid of because they had that lumber company down there especially Wrigley Field and they just they weren't the same this year\nThey just weren't and cubs fans know that they looked at this thing with a lot of frustration and figure to figure this way as bad as they were offensively at times may still ended up in game one sixty three and in the postseason\nAnd there were still one of the better run producing teams in the national league which is crazy but it's just\nYou know it's there's just so much that factored into it now because you go into these called how they now like numerous games uh eight nine ten or eleven runs except for one account and then that's running about pitching in the postseason there's so much film out there now where I feel like Twenty years ago it was like pitchers figured you out but they weren't watching\nYou know three hours of film on hitters you go into the clubhouse after a game and an analytics and all this stuff and you see guys are watching film right away breaking it down pitchers figure guys out a lot more easy\nA five five eight three zero eight six four eighty five five eight three zero

buddy during the\nShow or what have you taken away from the early portion of the season regarding not just blocks but NBA basketball in general\nThere's not a whole bunch of defense and there's going to be a ton of Jack and three the cross blue this year and you see in that early on that uh you know a lot of these teams are shooting three five forty three on a given night and do that are sitting there going to be left behind which is what people have been crying about what the socks\nOff the last couple of years with Jason Kidd as coach clearly that has changed\nA and they determined that if you're open even if you're John Ensign with two three the other night uh take the three and just keep firing 'em up and help you make a bunch of all that essentially it and what is doing is creating spacing and training driving wines or metal fan and Jonathan Bledsoe and so forth so that obviously the positive to\nThe uh the interesting thing I was I did to the time Warner Cable sure of the spectrum sports show which day was the other day\nAnd what some of the guys around yawn Ishmael give because ... is one of the best percentages in the highest score inside the pain we all know that\nWouldn't now used to be where young has started to move to the basket everybody collapsed on your on us because they weren't hitting the three now they've got guys can shoot it or you can only assume that this was going to benefit young as in the sense that\nThe latest now not going to be occupied by three and four guys who's going to be occupied by maybe wanting to uh when she can still overpower so this game with the outside three should benefit you on us in a big way\nFind a personnel and all that different other yeah and you had at earth ... rather broke Lopez obviously a and those are two main contributors are the guys that you've added and then you add it a a draft that can be concerned though\nI always played a really well how can you play as well not necessarily a good laugh game but he probably pretty good the first things getting twenty minutes a night a and these guys are are obviously getting better at it and you hear the stories on Fox Sports Wisconsin about\nBruno they're pretty much donor blood on hunting and got to work with ... thumb around doing nothing but shooting for you to keep shooting I thought it was practiced frequent shooting that was clearly a plan coming into this thing for everybody to work on a three point sharing this with how they were going to attack it on so far so good that a couple of them\nWe have seen a or is this the beginning of the ... maybe should I ask you a the end of the mid range jump shot\nI don't know that's a good question um I I don't\nSee I I just don't know I mean it it appears that way I mean I you outside looking in and it looks like you're not going to have as many of those jumpers it looks like it's going to be like I said a bunch of three points shooting and not at the last three points shooting how you can be free state behind the three point line and just go ahead and Jack it up anyhow let's see what happens is\nTime Tommy Thompson keyboards guns than working with Governor Scott

red rhino horn rod you can find them over there as well uh miss portion of the program brought you by our good friends at a quick trip chopped your turn into something there again today I can give you all the ...\nI just I've been here almost every day she was good I got a breakfast in which I got one of those big southern sweet tease those Arizona sweetie I grab one of those this morning all that good stuff right they're starting to grab one of those used my rewards cards filled up with gas that's a huge part of my white man\nAnd it's funny 'cause sharing our route to do its grocery shopping other day and she said nope won't trust my milk from anybody with court trip or the egg the cheaper the bigger and the new doesn't spoil it seems like that's likely or milk it goes forever I don't know what kind of cows they have there but it's fantastic\nThat just a few reasons this job in that's what we do it's what we have two of them right down the street now they built another one down the street and they're like growing\nIt's like a really good fungus to have and are those this personal program brought you buy the best fungus around looking for quick trip as the best way to put it oh let's do this just bring him in a good friend from CBS fifty eight to Kevin ... are joining us or Kevin let's put a cap on his season's show\n... let's start with what do you what do you think this season meant first and foremost\nWell for one it's it it meant that she will be using the word rebuilt several times a year they went to ... you know in the last years\nWas to put themselves in a contender status and then kind of go over how tender status they took a\nYou know a couple of big savings in the off the train or yellowish the signing of Lorenzo cold and they combine that with some of these products from the sensors are the tree and it's like either that or a you know step in and build a nuclear ... which is like the twenty a letter to me\nAnd what it means to me now in these guys are sticking around I mean this is not just for this year next year but for a couple of years several window in Tony eleven it was closing in Twenty years just just I'm just going to start\n[noise] what are you doing this off season to make this team better\nWow that's [laughter] that's an interesting question right you got a\nReally you've got a lot of [noise] stacked with good arms most of those good arms combat could find a guy or two I think to to boost it\nBut I don't know if I Would do much with the bullpen starting fascinating case study because you've got people that want to go get an ace and that's fine you know if you want to spend that kind of money but Craig council kind of ... in this you\nDon't necessarily do [laughter] I used to operate as much as the dark and use a ... is a broken arm that is not as essentially as it used to be in the story is going to be a fascinating thing or the birds me\nTo go with that nothing in that category\nJust randomly richer for somebody that I just think that they'll do is I imagine like a stock is just going to hurt the second question that you have to adjust\nIt could also ... got maybe for one more year but other than that there's a lot to change the singer and that's a good thing\nFor me if I'm wrong ... Fifteen million next year\nYeah it's a it's a good luck in your mouth\nI Believe it to the actual things he may decide to walk and see what got\nYou know what their editors made assigned to to let that happen so um it's it's a theory about that I think if you could pretty safely say the ... probably won't be denied that are not jumping the gun sooner but I think that that\nParticular experiment with scope is not quite a while and traffic showers find at second base and that certainly help because I just want them to stop and shop by you know goes back to a third where he was great I think you'll be good again\n[noise] um are you talking about starting pitcher United said what do you know I did this last week to actually the brewers what they did the season has changed the landscape monetary for starting pitching in major league major league baseball at least in the short term\nBecause they prove that you don't need a two hundred and fifty five million dollar arm to get you there they went toe to toe with the Dodgers who have that and they ... they they came a game show to beat him actually had the one game too they beat him\nShow in the grand scheme of things do we see or because they they did it the same way down in Tampa Bay and they started to win ballgames do we see now the shift of the J Kerry and his complaining and going to their union saying\nWhy isn't anybody paying us that major league baseball may point to the brewers and go we don't have to because this is the way that the future is for major league baseball\nIs the is that kind of a revolution that that the brewers are [noise] we haven't really says this comparison very much but it's the twenty eighth team the Moneyball this one did\nYou have to have is when they when Moneyball was first in St Louis\nEqual or paying a lot of money runs and that was the things that was you know garnering the big ... contracts and we'll have a didn't have the money to spend so they found other ways they looked at the analytic some got guys that got on base you know they found ways to get value on their choices are spending the same kind of money\nAnd the brewers are you know who are always kind of an issue\nThat's come down he says that grandkids all\nI have not been able to have that kind of picture they may have found the solution here with the way the way they operate their pitching staff and it screws and a couple of different ways it makes it a competitive and it keeps them from spending all that money in the case of an asteroid Alex didn't work out to all this year\nWhen you look at the rest of the division we know that the pirates were kind of kind of not they were in the middle of this rebuild and then\nThey decided to go forward and that failed miserably we know the cardinals are trying to get better but they're also aging the reds arena full blown rebuild kind of but they still have the big salary around a of their first baseman so\n... is it is it are are we again just saying basically is the ... jobs\nAnd if you go pound for pound person for person depending on what the offseason moves are the cubs still should kind of be the favorite but not I I you know how do you look at the next year\nYou're you've got three and really a strong contender next year and and the thing about the cardinals and they will do something when they are and they're trying to take that next step forward they were just a step behind or able to keep their momentum they\nWould have been right there at the end of the parents so they really look at it as a drink and I think the cargo through some stuff in the season I don't have a you know the thing that the necessarily don't have which is this you know I heard her Kroger monitor say the revenue stream that will allow\nThem to do for movement that if he doesn't pan out doesn't pan out we've got a little bit more of a margin for error because of the money that comes into that franchise so\nI think both those teams trying to get better in the house isn't I think the brewers including just because they're young guys you know there's an older that they're a little more experience and these three crews\nAre going to be a blast of what the shack next year in for a couple of years to count you end up with those kind of got to be central to chat with the end of July hearts\nI almost feel like that went for the lions as more impressive than when they beat the patriots into Troy because I feel like Miami is the toughest place to go play especially for those new kickoffs because South Beach for the weekend you know half of those guys are going out and you usually get the hangover fact there and they look pretty good\nNow you've got you know the the well the bears went from being the top dog to now because they're tied mayor now tied to the bottom so they completely shifted spaces meanwhile the Packers are sitting here three to unwind and they're ahead of the lions and bears only for the fact that they've got the the tie with the Vikings but the Vikings given get the wind yesterday\nBiking now sitting in for two and one\nAnd the Packers sitting on the horizon ready to go to LA and LA\nThat that that team is for real\nFor real I mean as far as their total defense goes no Seattle is three and three they played one game less than the rams but as far as giving up points and then ...\nThat rams de France has given up I think it's the third least amount of points so far this year man and I you look we can go buy total off and all that kind of stuff and that's kind of what people do or a total defense with total numbers but\nI I look at what you've given up they've only given up one hundred and twenty eight point Seattle with one game last has given up one hundred and Seventeen\nA Carolina Panthers one hundred and thirty one um the like the bears have given up one hundred and thirty for the next closest team cowboys at one twenty three Redskins at one Twenty one so I looked at Rahm Stephen I'm like damn that teach for\nReal ... earliest scored more touchdowns in the entire bills came\nRight [laughter] and he was just on on on a on a on a train yesterday against McDonalds yesterday was fan theloop Donald yesterday was fantastic and he was all now again they were playing San Francisco San Francisco is going to the team but the Packers made San Francisco acumen\nAtlanta I don't care who you're playing if you have three to four sex and the game you're doing something or oh yeah\nI mean I Am and they're not even fully healthy right now man met you on that secondary slowly healthy you know they have sand shields he's just a nickel corner there right I mean granted you know he's coming up the injury we didn't think he was ever going to play football again but still I mean when that you're nickel corner who you're guides covering the slot\nHere well off and the secondary yep\nAnd then in the meantime patriots get yet another when they squeak went out against the bears but they're five into a and again sitting atop the AFC East there are getting better than Miami Dolphins a couple of better than the the jets and the three games better than the bills\nPittsburgh sitting atop the AFC North three two one Cincinnati we're do themselves a huge favor if they would never again ever again dark on our doorstep or our airwaves by ever playing on a a primetime game again why\nDo they continue to I mean I Know why but why do they continue to get primetime games and and then the giants as well to a theme that just do not want to see on\nPrimary was released foreign three it looked like magic going into the game but I I got all my friends down there today and all that kind of stuff so you're going to address is ... yeah you guys suck in primetime Andy Dalton chokes and goggles on it every damn primetime game and sure enough they did it again last night she's got a six and one\nBengals look terrible going to foreign three the only highlight we didn't have was the volunteers perfect signing and which you\nProbably took somebody out with a head shot and then decapitated unless you're on the way out and then decides to flip over to car to the concession stand\nYou know and then you've got to add a pac man Jones being arrested two hundred Thirteen year olds as he drives out of the parking lot joining you haven't seen any of this team you know right so and burger it's already been fined by the league and you've got Steelers asking the league are thrown out because of last week's game so\nYeah that Houston sitting at fourth foreign three and a the AFC South is not very good you got the ... Blake Bartels Jacksonville defense continues this water you are Indianapolis with Andrew Luck just it it just in getting it done\nOr that defense is just awful over there as a matter of fact they've given up almost two hundred yard two hundred points the season sitting a two and five meanwhile you've got\nI which I think the charges are pretty good football team the unfortunate thing is is they're playing against Kansas City yeah Philip Rivers having a pretty solid season that defense isn't too bad they've given up a hundred and sixty three points but they've scored almost two hundred and consider this though that she saw fence has put up two hundred and sixty points so far\nThat sixty five more points\nThan what a than what the the chargers have who are sitting again back at five and two it's it's just it's crazy how good the cheap so bad with Patrick my home she used to that piece on his mom last night by the way I did before the game yeah crying yeah I like that can go ahead I'm Glad\nI'm Glad she's happy but I kept waiting for something\nYou know something else like well this tragedy this happened you know there was no nothing it's just she just crying there it's just mom crying I'm going to get teary I'm like okay what what what am I what am I missing here because we had him on a Super Bowl Patrick wells yeah oh yeah oh really came to a game radio row yeah they brought in right over to ... you know we had a great interview with\nUs on college man I was watching the game there is some game he threw for like a hundred yards literally like seven hundred yards in a game yeah he had six touchdowns at the half and I was like this kid's going to be the real the air but\nDidn't know it was going to come this quick for him\nSo I'm watching this thing yesterday and I'm thinking to myself the whole time and they're showing all the different pictures and there's a couple of pictures him you know work in radio around thinking that maybe I might have ... see myself but [noise] so anyway um\nI was waiting for the story and it's just this is the monitors habits because she felt Kansas City would be a good home [laughter] you know she was like thank God he's not going to New York yeah\nI don't want to be going to New York or LA or a city you know yeah I Want to just to be a good kid and a good Midwestern city and he's grounded and you know and he goes out and just you know not just throw the pick last night and it was woefully under from football\nBut nevertheless still another good night for Patrick homes for the second or third interceptions he\nI I Believe that's only the second intercept show I thought and I thought that he was going to throw a lot more exceptions cause\nThat will make some great is also the thing that could be his downfall and some games as he just puts that thing up there you go get it man but he actually went to a quarterback camping in the offseason when he came started talking to yeah who's going to a quarterback camp everybody goes either one down in Miami ... Arizona or out in LA and San Diego\nAnd as soon as ... quarterback camp wouldn't talk about where we're going to work with two hall of fame quarterbacks and three other quarterbacks\nCurrently in the league\nAnd I I just keep wondering I Wonder who else he was working with yeah you know I mean was it so much risky right or was it ... you know or was it something else you know but nevertheless\nOr whatever you did [noise] boy he's been fantastic hey I saw the story I don't know if you saw this because I think it should be more hyped up and nobody's talking about a J Glazer had a yesterday so the Texans quarterback the shot Watson right\nPeople have been kind of ragged on them this year he banged up they wouldn't even fly him to Jacksonville here to take a twelve hour bus ride he's got a bruise long\nRide you got a broken ribs you can't even fly right now there are still going out there and play it it's just amazing and they're still drilling this guy they can't put them out of though yesterday you cannot say to everybody in the media\nDo you want to do when the NFL you look like an idiot you can't say that you can't do that you know because first of all no\nAnd second of all that's what you are paid to do right you can't now making excuses why you can't because it's hard you just can't we all get it but you can't do it when we come back go I I the story is a shame but it's kind of like football me life and it's it's it's\nA tragedy and I read this today and I went whole use one of those palm before had moments and I thought how time flies in how time flies and such a sad way more than Michael should actually\nListening to Michael sports go forward [noise]\nYou are about to end to Wisconsin Rapids community the it has come to tell me what's said to be a finger\nDoing the open some six and nine PM October twenty twenty ... twenty and twenty seven missions seven dollars and ... father [noise]\nI'm a volunteer at United Way people around the neighborhood what they think it's safe to me why fight everywhere were playground more ice cream trucks\nI was thinking more money in the pocket the local families come tax time can I change my answer\nWas just kidding about the ice cream when it comes to getting better tax refunds into the hands of local families what this place needs you to donate or volunteer go to United Way dot org because great things happen when you live United front ... and the account though [noise]\nHey Chris heath either on your phone again\nAre you trying to figure out those crazy soccer schedules [noise] no I'm actually streaming HGTV stuff streaming yeah we got some information from ...

watched it ah LA game yesterday and they are so good and what I saw out of the Packers against the forty niners that label field and then I saw the forty niners do really nothing against the LA Rams

if you're the Green Bay Packers I mean\nI I Aaron Rodgers can only cover up so much and nobody's firing on all cylinders right now you hope that he's healthy but how much better team he would just say completely healthy Aaron Rodgers\nI mean I think it's a fair question to ask and right you know by week's sometimes could work wonders for team that obviously that they watched that game you know two weeks and speculating about Mike mccarthy or you know any other changes that might have been working to\nImprove the mood around the team so you know I always believe in the power of motivation and all that got me ... and everything and health is certainly going to be a factor\nBut you're right it's it's hard not to stack up those two games you just mentioned and say\nAre we not looking at a

cool we've got this great room and I called the great run because\nThe great that is inside the fireplace can hold twenty logs that's how big the fireplaces gee I built a ... I built the fire on a\nOn a Saturday Night\nOh excuse me you know friday night pregnant I attend logs dinner including and usually what I Do is I like like a ... now so I like the ... like ten maybe eleven logs in there and it looked like I was standing in the middle of the room with a match it was so small I'm like that's kind of pathetic\nHalf my would pile is gone now I have had bought a half a scored a witness for the God there's nothing left so anyway so I did nothing\nNothing I just I sat out I sold furniture people coming over a guy that end table I got a guy I Know a girl yesterday her and her husband and their daughter came by a when we moved here and there was this couch set\nMember like the country style it it it it was it was one of those couches three cushions and it's got all the little shown in buttons oh yeah Hi wings on the side and it's kind of like what we're going to country home mhm\nAnd it's got the feel of burlap you know it looked cool goes in the bar we got a country boy go it goes good in a bar\nSo she'll never sit on it probably makes me edge so I got to get rid of it so that off so we flip it over I thought it was some crappy set you know and it's\nFlip it over it's like this historic hickory collection from Stein hospitals worth a ton of money at the time yeah you know I saw it for like a hundred bucks\nYou know what what's the toughest thing you had to get rid of is there anything like that you really put up a fight for uh not really I mean as long as we have nice stuff and it's all organized looks good I don't care OK doesn't mean it like Sherry will fight me to the death rate for\nA bookcase [laughter] you know yeah that looks good here because our designer said so yeah to me and my parents or whatever you know I mean\nI my thing is is that she's like you know go ahead and you take the room take the bar mhm okay well the bar small I Can't get all my stuff into one room yeah\nSo I've got awards I've got murals I've got sports pictures I've ... I Can't put it on the first of all doesn't go there but we've got this great room and the reason I called the great room again is because of the great but it's forty five by\nTwenty six that's how big this room is now you think you're like OK forty five feet that's\nThree of four of the room or in right now so that's a that was off duty apartment in college yeah\nAnd it's it's it is it's white it's twice as wide as rumor it you know so it's it's stupid big and we got a couch you know the section like nine ten pieces and there's this it's a hundred and ten inch screen and it looks tiny it it just so we\nWere trying to figure out ways to fill the room in and maybe built in office I I don't know what I'm doing\nSo anyway that was my weekend I started moving furniture around I have we got these two big giant sliding doors he's patio doors lead into the room and you can you could back of trucks room you know like a car show room there so people are just come in and go and you know it all or is this the ... of people on the Facebook Marketplace person\nTo hold it up I said I mean the the hardest thing I guess was I bought this leather and micro fiber couch when I had a Harley bar in my old house and I love that thing it was because it was a really wide armed couch\nAnd sat really low so I Would go sit in it but I Would always put my ashtray right there and like a smoke cigars [noise] that was my couch but I think I did that maybe ten times\nIn the last year and a half since I bought it yeah and it didn't have a ... hardly a mark on it and that was kind of maybe the toughest thing to get rid of that other stuff it's like you know whatever yeah my dad had brought up a like a last year\nAll the trophies that he had saved from me growing up you know going all the way through college ...\nThere was boxes and when I played professional softball for a while when I got out of playing baseball and football and everything\nAnd we play it on his national team that won these tournaments all over the country we had trophies that were ... like seven feet tall I use them for ... and when I was like the bachelor apartment yeah do you come and you're like oh yeah there you go throw their hat over there and it's a it's a trophy you know I'd through all that crap\nI see I did the same thing my wife's like you're going to want to remember this in ten years I'm like I I I wasn't a thing I remember you know I got the memory awards don't mean anything you know and it will it really\nDoes it I I appreciate being recognized re appreciate certain things now like stuff that throughout my career you know doing this there's been specific words that have been given I I was given an award for community service like from the Fisher house and from\nThe VA found that means something to me you know certain things that I people I've met giving an award to or something and ... along the way certain things regarding the show it's nice to win I don't do this because I think that we are going to win an award for the program today I used to be recognized by your peers\nThat kind of means something to me but other than that some of that stuff it's like I appreciate it\nIt's not that I don't because I appreciate the thought more than I Do the award right you know 'cause she keeps asking me like for Christmas and stuff what do you want like I don't want anything I don't need it right be nice to meet you know exactly do do do something from your heart don't do something that requires a charge card you know I'm right\nSo in that room that's like a you know I I can sit down on my bar and I just won't be able to enjoy myself I Want to sit there peacefully and be able to do nothing that's\nKey but here but the day Ramsey show weekday six to eight on AM Thirteen twenty W eBay jar [noise]\n\n[noise]\nMichael show continues and I promise to kinda keep things on the rails in this particular segment as we get off the rails in the last one I Want to do this judge radio Joseph ... had a chance to sit down with aircraft\nUh after the season right before the game but after that she was just after the game or before again I Believe this is after the game and pulled out he did some stuff pre game but I Know you've got a chance to talk with aircraft after the game as well\nUh I Will get back into some uh you know football stuff and everything but I I wanted to make sure that we spend enough time talking brewers baseball as well because you know there there's a raptor the seats\nWe'll get to ... get to that in one second here going to pull that okay let's see them like the phone call and then we'll get back to radio Joe where there are crowds I'm Marty what's going on man how you doing today\nMarty their Marty Marty\nMarty how you doing there for a minute I saw you are to after the weekend I had what's happening\nYou know I enjoyed listening there I hear they're man cave you are also very interested in\nJust a couple of comments I wanted to make bail\nUh put with her as I was just telling your guide to the call that after the color of your calls\nAfter a brutal Dodgers this up through game six the ... or ... or we're heading to thirty five with five ... um the Dodgers were into five four three homeowners\nAnd as far as what runs the brewers are we're leaving to run for game six twenty three and Eighteen and if he had the score from a ... game the ... court I'm twenty four twenty three with runs right there mhm right ... and then you would make it as far as like free agent who's out there\nUm for pickers or perhaps out there um Martin Luther comical carbon Lance\nFreelance led a ... a ... a guy out or will Estrada Real is out there too so they're they've got Nathan of all day with Boston Matt Harvey and also the list or if my late on that list right that's what they offer free agents that are out there\nUm there are a couple of other things too I I you made the comment about um God's both with a bunch of ... and I thought that was very interesting comment right there another interesting point and when he asked a day of Robert he had the same reaction that what the Dodgers and that he didn't have one for the Dodgers either\n... so that was quite interesting and it's a small things like you said deepens wouldn't be happy and kept like in football even when you have to get through all the way you know when you have some kids so\nUh I'm In ... okay in game a seven okay Saturday Night bill got I'm Craig brought in a drought hater in a third you know and the third inning and I just thought when he brought into the relievers into you know early at I mean I have the verdict on that the whole season at all or not\nNot really a whole season but once you get to the post season is kind of a different thought process it's it's a\nIt's an all hands on deck I look I did not really disagree with any of the you know council moves and I know that he's got more statistically saver metric we at his fingertips than I ever will but I thought there was a couple of times they quick hook guys in fear of bigger innings\nAnd I get it that you don't want to let any get away from you especially in the postseason but I there was a couple of times that I thought you know they grabbed my only a little bit early just seen a little bit early I\nI I I didn't it's not that I completely disagree with it it's just that I thought maybe you're out thinking yourself and because they had done such a great job we didn't really questioned it all season long are we didn't question the postseason ... but I thought there was a couple of times where maybe they might have over something so to speak to make sense\nYes it does and what type one final thought ah I I was reading on just comments like on Facebook and or some people have been saying that season was a total failure and they had to I mean I don't think market not feel that feel that way I look at the money they got for an extra six games at Miller Park\nThat's all you know if you think it's a very serious you know if they think is a total failure and Marty appreciate the phone call if they think it's a total failure they're being very shortsighted\nBecause there's nobody that I Know they pick the brewers to go to the world series this year\nNobody maybe the when Ninety games\nMost people pick them behind the cubs I don't think there's many people out there I Know a few did but not many people picked him to beat becomes a news division ... you know show to not only get to the post season when one sixty three\nThen winning the postseason then have oh by the way the best record in the national league\nI not many people that I Know pick that so no I I\nI Would disagree as far as being a failure there again I go back to two thousand and fourteen in Kansas City royals they had a young enthusiastic team they put some veteran pieces there they started to grow the guy to a a an American league championship series they were they were swept four games to none by the Baltimore Orioles\nThe next year they came back one at all\nWhat it all\nUp leading the Mets in the world series sometimes you're going to walk before
