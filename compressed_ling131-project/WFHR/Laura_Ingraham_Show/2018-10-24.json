discussions that they wanted to get into um regarding are not only the season itself but moving forward as they head into the off season and obviously in the next year\nA council started out I'm On kind of the the\nEvenly matched series between the brewers and the Dodgers and you know\nWe spent a lot of time kind of playing the long game in this organization but like stats in the house yes are relevant is who is the most games you know when they won for we won three ... and that tells you is close I think\nAnd I ... either way it was a good series and and you're trying to find a way to win games and when you get to play out it's just try to find a way when games\nHe's right I mean we sat and kind of dwelled over statistics with runners and scoring position and who wasn't wasn't hitting the ball alternately you're making moves to just kind of put your guys in position to be successful and win a game I mean that's that's ultimately when it comes down to he was also asked if he regrets any of the decisions that he had not in throughout the series but specifically in game seven\nYou know I think of anything that the play the game was the the yell at you follow the deal is but I was caught I mean I think that was just a big play with a huge momentum playing the game\nAnd I think it probably changes but I don't know how much it changes any of the the pitching decisions we had to make so I'm from that perspective it probably didn't change much but that it was just a huge ... feeling of the game I think it had a chance to really change change things in the game\nDecision allies [noise] you know I I don't I don't know I mean I don't think ... there was anything we would have done differently\nYou know we we had four guys pension none of 'em got ahead so or maybe they could or some of them definitely but it's that they were all going to have to take an ash bat against pitchers that weren't proudly great matchups um so\nNow what do you change anything you know look\nI might have changed maybe a little bit of pitching let a pitcher go a little bit longer\nMight not have allowed ... to go as well I mean I don't know I mean you can pick different things hindsight being what it is but\nAh he's right we tailor made that sliding catch in left center field when he took that what would have been a multibillion hid away from from yell at you and really been the momentum showing at that point that that was the wind out of the balloon moment he's absolutely right and he also discusses how many are or how he made you utilize the distorted next year\nYou need eight or nine stars to make it through a hundred and sixty two games season so if you just look at it from a very traditional standpoint you you need that many pictures and starters\nIt's definitely part of the runs with experience I think for all these everybody that goes through it there are some things that are easier to second time through for sure some part of the experience is a little easier and a little more you feel like you've got a little more savvy going into it\nThe next time around what's important is that as we move into two thousand Nineteen or is that we put together a really good team and then\nWe execute a a good plan and and we understand that uh the sacrifices that we're all gonna have to make again to uh to go to go on a run like this again there's no question I like going through it and then the enjoyment we all took from this last seven and a half months but uh we will do that\nOh one more well to more things actually at the end of the day he said look a this was an entertaining run for everybody\nSometimes we have to take a step back and realize you know ... why are we sitting up here you know we're we're entertaining people ultimately that's what we're doing we're we're a\nVehicle for entertainment for people if we have a chance to if the result of this is that the community is talking to each other and people are that don't know each other are sitting down and talk and brewers and strangers are high five and then man that's what it's all about that that's we're doing a good thing\nI'm all for that and I think that that is the the the rewarding part of it you know the recognition I I can do without personally it's not my favorite thing\nYou know but it but in Wisconsin It's always done in such a um genuine thankful way that it uh that you know I really don't mind that [noise]\nThere you go that was great council coming up and the next hour we're going to hear from David Stern but I Want to get some of your thoughts on this because [noise] uh

heard Craig council [noise] just a few moments ago before we went to a commercial break you heard all his his courtroom yesterday\nMany of the things that he had to say talking about everything from air crash in his performance or land or sea or in the postseason a you know he talked about pretty Peralta I talked about the the match in the series and any decisions he may or may not change I mean you know all of that stuff\nShow the question becomes um how much of this success but the brewers had this year\nIs attributed to the movies is attributed to thinking is attributed to the ability to be able to to to you know ... people in and out I mean this if you were playing along at home as a manager is is a couch manager\nThis is the reason I Love the national league\n[noise] because it's about matchups I thought about just throwing your best nine ... up there and letting your lumber company go to work I mean this is about matchups it's about\nUh being being able to bring in a a a reliever at the right time double shoot double switch is shifting guys around versatility depth issues about everything this year managing health\nSo tell me how you think Craig council did how much of that success can you say you know what a great council did an unbelievable job because it's really easy if you say following Twitter\nTo listen to the loud angry voices that don't say a word when when they win and do nothing but criticized when they lose which they did very obviously a fewer losing days than they did winning did\nSo honest opinion about this franchise moving forward about this managerial position moving forward and how much credit do you give to crate council versus just simply the guys in the field\nPaid five five eight three zero eight six forty five eight three zero eight six right now a ... one of the first thing that was brought up yesterday\nWas a ... was a restaurant\nAnd the fact that yeah they did manage his level of health and he was better in the postseason that's what you're automatically wanting for\nTheir war admittedly some days that you thought what are you doing why given him a day off when you have a day off tomorrow\nOr it was frustrating are they really throwing out their best line up where they winning those games see if you would have only one one of those games you didn't need one sixty three and you need a bird your

Michael's radio Joe across the way of showing a Twitter Advil underscore Michael's ambulance corps Michael's right radio\nJoe sports you can always find this on the radio dot com and everything about the program is right there and take a listen to that as well\nUm my ... worth the money to bring him back most likely is going to want to check the free agent market however if he could say convinced the team to say you know what I'd like to stay good things are happening here you're on the uptick I've been through this before I can be a leader ah I'll stay\nHe's ah he's looking for Fifteen million a year or more because that's what the brewers would owe him if they decided to pick up that contract and he wanted to stay as Mike moose stock is worth Fifteen million a year\nIs he worth the money to keep a third base keep Travis shah given before offseason to work at second then you have our CEO word short and Aguilar and company over at first base\nThings would certainly seem to work themselves out wouldn't that because then really all you're looking for is death and pitching as it\nEight five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six forty might was shock has hit a two fifty six for the crew\nAnd I don't know that bolsters\nFifteen million a year to be perfectly honest with you\nAs much as I'd like to say boy it's he was a breath of fresh air and really got going on I mean he's he's just you know that's that's kind of a cry from the two Seventy two that hit with Kansas City last year and I remember the year before daddy playing just twenty seven games got hurt hit two forty year before that\nHe was a two eighty four hit her with a three eighty four three forty eight on base percentage\nBut the year before that he was to twelve hitter at two thirty three and the two forty two so he's easy add up and down off the bench of seasons and the grand scheme of things you kind of big well maybe your do\nYou know you had to Seventy two last year or two fifty one over all of this year between two teams so maybe you do for that to eighty year maybe that bus the odd years right here\nBut at the bus down your good for another Fifteen million bucks\nEight five five eighty three zero eight six for eight Mike moose stock is I Will say this did surprise me uh by the ability to get to the baseball at times he did have a few hours he was not as sure a glove\nPrize me with some of the stuff the more the knocks against him was he wasn't a very good defender and he looked like a pretty good defender perfect no are seeing now put a pretty good defender I I I like when the stock has brought to the table I just again I don't think it's Fifteen million dollars worth of what he brings to the table\nEight five five eight three zero eight six for eight years to show would you like to see my stock is back with his team let's go to Brad receiving Brad walking with a program do Michael sure what's going on man\nThey're more than ... ...\nI Would absolutely like I said the other day like English Pakistan I'm creep up Travis also go to the alarm you know doesn't have the yeah the first half of it this year\nAnd at first base an option you know to play in Charlotte they're they sometimes\nI'm Clark or leadership you know like I said the other day there was an article that was written that when it started in ... council came out into the dugout\nFor stock as far as the first guy that was there and try notice mhm but I have a leadership like that you know am I going to pay every now and you know it's like um for fourteen or Fifteen million\nYou know in ... park and said\nYou know appreciate the phone call that's a that's a good point because you look at a Christian yell at you and her originally you look at the numbers you thought well did they give up too much and then you thought what do you do at Miller Park and sure enough I mean he shined he I mean everything that you thought about Christian yell at you what could come true did come through\nCircumstance position\nThe division I mean everything about it he excelled because up\nAnd he was completely content and happened he's playing for something as opposed to being you know locked in Miami where you're not playing for much but would you payments doctors Fifteen million plus I mean that's the question eight by five eight three zero eight six white it is hard for me\nTo separate Milwaukee from larger payroll\nIt because again they've always said well look if this person can help us or we're not going to let money standing away well is he ... you have to look good value to\nSmaller market teams have to get the value for the money you can't just throw it away and say well we'll go out and get somebody else you're not Chicago you're not LA you're not you know you're not Boston not New York you don't have that ability\nCan't make that up they're gonna make a lot of money this year next year\nNo doubt about that they've got a lot of young guys that are under contract you're not paying a lot of money too and in addition to that you're talking about all the fans that came to the church sales this year next year it's going to be even more as rivalries heat up and down Milwaukee actually has a target on their back\nPaid five five eight three zero eight six forty when we come back\nAndrew Wagner the sports exchange west came at a very question whether or not it's worth the money\nTo bring my stock is back with the Milwaukee Brewers whether it be as a leader or third baseman or anything for that matter sports to the program broad you might ... new mail medical training guys with ET all over the state and beyond the borders location agreement in Milwaukee and if it's a ... erectile dysfunction you have going on whether it's you or even a partner\nOr call it for the phone call maybe Ninety eight percent success rate is worth a phone call\nFor one for four or five five four for five one that's for one for four or five five for four or five one\nThrough arbitration I I'd I don't know how he fits into it I Know David Stern said yesterday that you know he was a guy who's had experience that success of the big league they didn't see it\nUm you know that's a that's a\nKind of a with a double edged sword there because if you just let them go then gave a pretty hefty price for rental um but if you bring them back\nAt that price tag you're looking you're moving recruiting duty less than a guy that didn't exactly come through for you ship or they're probably going to be the biggest decision whether or not to non tender or Jonathan scope\nWell that's my next question I mean yeah you would say okay we gave up when the guy we gave quite a bit more but the alternative is knowing what you guys are not getting anything and bringing them back you take a barrage respond to basically a paper weight you know I mean one off once\nDo they do have faith unless you look at Johns skull it's not like he's been a flu guy you know it's not like ... what we saw the last couple of months is the norm\nHe's the guy that has evolved very hard they hit the ball very well oven at play decent second base whatever reason it just didn't happen after that trade or that he wasn't actually player of the week\nOr just before the traits in Milwaukee so you'll be obviously it had\nSuccess including this year it just so looted him after the deal we've seen that happen before but I don't think we've seen the guy fall off to the extent that we get\nJob in scope over the last five weeks a year\nWell the other thing that when you look at this team in the way things kind of went down um are you guys got cold I mean it wasn't necessarily the pitching the that you know re routed them in the postseason you obviously got some good starts in the way they did it all season long as the way they\nThe post season I mean I I'm not ... ... people were ready to get Jimmy ... out of town he didn't have a good series but you're not throwing the guy on the gotcha there and you're not throwing the guy that had a good season it was just a couple of games in the postseason and ultimately going ...\n... ... and how easy that knee jerk reaction to all this stuff and\nI I think it's the football mentality of the state you know people in the state or are kind of ingrained in your head to look at things the way you look at the hackers were everything as individual at one time you got to look at the overall big picture grand scheme of things the entire package when it comes to baseball\nI mean you look at what those guys did from day one game one sixty three and then the playoffs yeah you had a couple of bad on their um you can't look at J. J.\nAs the reason that they're not playing in the world series and I peppered stuff I Know but you look at the four losses the brewers had to the Dodgers they scored a total of seven runs\nUm that that that's not going to get it done I mean that often says more than enough\nProduce a when you can still say oh well you know they're still looted the very beginning with great but if you're often is putting up runs man chances earlier in the game you're relievers aren't walking such a tight rope every night that's where the\nKitchen became a problem when they had to walk protector one right lead every single\nNight uh it was it was just they played well I mean they very easily could have in the world series they just couldn't hit when I needed to\nAdam and Kelly did a great job pointing out just how ridiculously even the series was historically a crack house what kind of poop coon bat but listen the brewers are right there they were right there the very end\nYeah they got knocked around a little bit that last game of home runs killed them but that was a really good series they just didn't have enough often when I needed it\nHey I before I cut you lose your in a minute or two a no credit counseling all the moves that he made we asked a question a little bit earlier you know how much of an impact was gray counsel on his team on the season versus just guys going on in there and getting the job done and I said look\nThis is one of the reasons I Love nationally baseball because the cerebral side of things for what he did I thought was nothing short of amazing I don't know if you agree or not but I just started thrown out there\nI I agree with you I mean I I didn't have a man who vote I did a I Would have a hard time picking Craig even what the implications of that because\nI mean did anyone in the national league maybe with the exception day Robert ... more than ... I mean you look at the pieces of the puzzle that he had from day one of the season\nI'm mixing and matching and putting them together every night that Matt just\nAnd look what he did this year was pretty impressive you got to take her kept to him because you're right he was a nationally a guy that you're that literally had to ban it every day\nYou know it'd be easy for a guy to go down and write nine names and the starting lineup handed that looks go Mm um but it wasn't like that you know he had a lot to work with a lot of talent to work with making that talent fit and making that tell work is no easy task\nAlways good my friend we will talk again down the road and we'll probably talk a little bit during bug season to a ... device or form okay\nSounds good well if you assume\nBy by tequila there you go that is Andrew Wagner the sports exchange joining us for a couple of minutes on these Schneider orange hotline and\nOh by the way it should not have been doing it for a long long time eighty plus your column eight hundred and forty four pride or go to Schneider jobs dot com eight hundred and forty four prior to go now to jobs dot com\nMissiles from Gail who says do you think that David Stern will remain with the team I Know there's been some outside interest in his name is being rumors about I Would hate to see him go uh you know what let me answer this question when we come back I'll get into that as well also up to the job of the day be or I should say that we're just going to be joining us for national baseball insider\nWe'll talk with him about rumors innuendo those that are out there as well but we'll talk more about David Stern and the job that he did specifically coming up next to Michael show\nSixteen station strong goals for\nHey Chris on your phone again are you trying to figure out those crazy soccer schedules\nNo I'm actually streaming HGTV stuff streaming yeah we got some information from their star Internet providers pitching cable and streaming TV they're just so busy we don't have time to watch the TV channels for for them to try it\nTurns out we love it he can still get all this fourth and I can access our who play on my phone for me there ... or saving a bunch of money\nNow Jimmy wrong call go there\nAnd I were just talking about that someone has to do\nWhat you could live with their ... then we went right to their office and there were so helpful in getting away real quick fix to new Internet customers now we just pay for their Internet streaming subscription it was really easy just several players that now that you threw\nIt sounds easy enough thanks for the ...

always hanging out with is the Green Bay Packers are getting set to take on the uh the LA Rams on next week is the trade deadline and there is a lot of discussion about maybe the Packers should or shouldn't go out and get [noise]\nParticular players there's cases to be made for picking up levy on bell there's patients case to be made to pick it up or Patrick Peterson a dumb areas Thomas [noise]\nThere's a lot of different players that are out there right now that are\nBeing floated around now Patrick Peterson the Arizona Cardinals who said flat out we are not trading it now he says he wants out we'll see what happens but the cardinals and Patrick Peterson man or\nA Steven will try to shutting try to shut down a lot of that trade speculation saying it's not going to happen but we'll see Michael did well also has tried to stop the Patrick Peterson outta here bandwagon that is rolling down the tracks but we'll wait and see them areas Thomas the wide receiver\nA lot of rumors out there the longest tenure bronco knowledge Jay on Monday that he believes there's a chance his team his time is coming up in a in Denver I talked about living on bell\nAnd a ... is a funny quote is out of USA Today it's as good luck to anyone including Pittsburgh hoping to orchestrate a deal for an ... signed a player\nWho's plans seem in comprehensible while it's easy to see the appeal of landing a two time all pro it was only twenty six or the amount of unknown surrounding bell including whether or not he would even remain with any team this past season\nAh because you've got that fixation on testing the open market which seemed to be too great a an obstacle to even consider trading\nOr another running back with John McCoy could eagles struggles to run the ball and Sundays lost the Carolina uh get more into that Philadelphia or any other team we're looking to reshape the ground game and they want to make a move the best available short term option might be McCoy the dolphins wide receiver divine the park or appears to be out there wide receiver golden taped\nA ... a ... beret and ashamed re for the Broncos aligned backers\nI Would von Miller rookie first rather Bradley job among the new few bright spots on defense Denver's pass rush should be set for years ray and buried Orenstein to be on the season when the Broncos could find eventually help uh for one or the other deficiencies by shipping them off to a team in need of a boost on the edge\nNow that seems to be more comprehensible then going after living on bell or even Patrick Peterson to a certain extent\nA radio raiders safety Carl Joseph and their corner out which I don't think they're even looking at corner at this point in time I mean it would be more line backers of the cardinals have linebackers Buchanan had us on Reddick um\nTheir defenses just falling apart Wilkes has made it clear that he's got little use for two of the teams recent first round draft choices [noise] um so they they don't have anything going on there right now I don't\nI don't think the Packers are going to make a move to be perfectly honest with you\nIf you're going to make a move you need to pass rush probably if you want or one day at least and you could go in the in the right way of buried or re out in uh Denver but I don't know if you would even end up doing that\nSo as much as people want to say hey break the bank rate bring Patrick Peterson is not the same impact players Mac\nSo why are you going to break the bank for Peterson but you wouldn't do it for Mac doesn't make any sense\nI mean granted ... one of the bigger contract it's going to be an extended but it it why why do that and you you know you're you'll never get that value again and let's be honest in this particular case whenever you're coming up against trade deadline you're you you always seemed to overpay unless the teams just desperate to get rid of a guy\nNobody's training for a living on bell so please stop with that Packers aren't bringing him in I mean unless they gave him some kind of a ridiculous contract which they're not going to because they are highly paid off as a player as a quarterback and it's not going to be living on bell\nAnd living on bell is kind of showing his colors for as much as you want to say well you know I understand that it's his body he's a commodity and such look there's not a lot of people that are going to walk them him in a locker room\nYeah and that was going to be the whole year and it was just kind of the school when you think about what the bucks are all about this year it is that thing\nAnd you think about the third quarter and the next game the ABC the bucks go on a Thirteen from the three point line or do you see them get out scorn that quote of thirty five to seven ... doubled up by the New York Knicks were not a good basketball team and the next during that time ago eight or nine from the mid range\nAnd you know that's what we've talked about the bucks won a force mid range jumpers defensively and they don't want to take any ... they want to weigh three so they were getting everything they wanted\nThey just weren't making their shots and large he was making there is and I kind of lay that out too young to post game against the next and says like hey you know you you have this new system and how do you how do you still believe in that system as everything you're doing in the system\nAnd you get your butt kicked like how do how do you kind of a handle that how do you think do it and he just looked at me and says we were doing the right thing that's that's how we're going to play and he then went on to go through the the math behind it all and said\nI Know that if we force the other team would take too is you will not be taking choose that we are going to win if we get the other team to choose and we take threes and he's like and at times they might make ten it around\nAnd we might miss all of our shots but we know the next time down we're going to come down and we're going to get a dunk we're going to get a lab or we're going to get a three things like and that's how we're going to win games and to me it was just\nIt was one of those moments where you're like wow this they totally believe in this and that's not always the case you know uh the times and new system is great and everyone's going to love it is what things are going well but when things go poorly\nThose are the times you question does this new guy really know what you're talking about is this really the new way that we should play basketball and\n... you could just see it that night that these guys are totally bought and they've only spend with my own older for what three months at this point I mean they have to work with them for that they've only play three games and and they're ready to start where they're they're totally bought in\n[noise] um wanted to ask you about the development of guys because one of the things that I thought was rather interesting is the sense that as much as we talking about moon holes are being you know a coach did a lot of people are kinda buying into a there is also the he's not there to develop a lot of guys either win and we now I mean don't you get that sense\nYeah I mean I think with him at the big thing will always be when I get\nObviously Jason Kidd didn't do enough last year and and that's why he got fired you into now plenty that are so I I Do think there is going to be a focus placed on all of that but I Do wonder if a boon holes are kind of comes on some of the changes that you've made to his system\nBeing the things that can help guys develop that\nYou know is this going to be a the three points shooting the wide open game is this going to be\nWhat can get ya has to be a U.S thirty points per game scoring I Would guess make doing holding things so you live to Chris rattled them a lot of people said he was kinda tapped out a twenty four ingredients gory you can't do any better than that I wrote about it today at the politic Wisconsin like he's totally changed the way Chris Middleton Place say he was one of the best mid range shooters illegal last year and now he's\nCut his mid range shots and a half and now he's gone away from a three and journals three games he's averaging twenty four points for game and I I Do wonder that you know\nI don't know is is there is going to be like a growing pains with development where you're actually seeing young guys out there and you're thinking all bad yet but I can see that guy getting better\nI I just think they're going to see him play different brand of basketball and uh if there is some concerns from the front office about development that I Would guess those are the things that my ... going to that\nThis is how I'm getting players better and getting them to take better shots and I'm going to get more out of these guys that than any other culture going to bring in\nThe uh the the development of a guy or you know when we talk about the same bomb maker\nOr are you talking about him to now hinting you don't know because\nHow much do they want to utilize him in really build him up because obviously they would love to get rid of their contract they want to move from one next year is going to be the year when she was going to be some free money here so are you trying to showcase guys you get the better or you just simply trying to win now I mean so he's got kind of a different balancing act this year than what even Jason Kidd had last year right\nYeah I mean I think that's on make our question is fascinating it obviously we haven't got to see a lot of times I was fired because he had a problem than about\nA ... during the pre season and now during the regular season we seem to be a healthy scratch whereas on the games and the woman that I Am a suit up rather than Christian what who they made it inactive and\nI Am very curious to see kind of what Don Baker can do in a kind of what chance it gets because when you think about the things that may have very good\nObviously three points shooting is is that the top the list so uh I think there has to be some attractiveness to having him shoot threes as opposed to as you mentioned John Henson out there shooting through so I think that will be a big thing at first either it's going to be I think kind of on the defensive at the times where we've seen in the awesome is where\nHe's out there which involve screen he's running around he has a lot of energy this ... doesn't do a lot of that they're they're ... they're going to stay close to the basket they're going to stay in the land they're going to try to pass a mid range jumpers and had a contest some shop so that is something down maker hasn't done well with his career\nOr so or think about reasons why maybe before they should at St but\nAt some point you know you've got to get those chances if if the boxer going do magically create another asset out of nowhere sacrament John hence because of that contract he said already like\nThat contract is never going to be an asset ... Baker you in some of the stuff that John Ensign in doing\nThat might be an asset so a ... at the balancing act there is a really tough\nInteresting especially adopt always got to chat with jet again next week big game coming up in my opinion and we'll see if they're able to get the job done appreciated okay so you're ... you're going to want to touch base real quick on the book the one hundred things bucks fans should know and do before they die give us a quick thumbnail sketch where they can get it\nOr you can get a Milwaukee locally you can get it up a book so I Know that they have it urban watch also has it down on walking the streets or you can get it off physically there otherwise that over the Amazon you can head over to Barnes and noble and get it there as\nAlways my friend would surely pretty soon we'll talk soon okay sounds good thank\nYou very avid there you go that is so Eric named joining us our bucks instead of a reporter for the athletic joining us for a couple of minutes on the Schneider orange hotline or the box is they look to go to for no is tonight scheme in your opinion if your ... your phone boxes many of you to\nTonight's game of big game show I think it is tonight's game is when you go undefeated you put his stamp on things you were definitely heading in the right direction and for everybody talking about how damn good really is tonight tonight you punch that myth right in the face more they'll make a show next\nTo Michael sports network\nWarning you own your own health care for where are you in your area or\nEgypt graduating college smelly or in some ways\nIt's open enrollment we brought on health insurance and very educated when all your\nJoined us or eight or six Saturday mornings right here on WFAN ... for real wealth radio brought to you by Dan ... it would very financial services\nHere some fun activities for the youngster in your life on friday there was a family tricks and treats\nHalloween party got the south would county YMCA and port Edwards it's for children ages twelve and under from six until seven thirty it's free with a donation of non perishable food item\nFun and games and activities and be sure to dress up the entire family for the costume contest\nAlso on friday McMillan memorial library dug the jog performs a juggling extravaganza for children and adults for all ages and at one o'clock celebrate your day off from school also at the library for grades six to twelve from five thirty seven thirty play live version of the board game clue\nTravel from room to room in the library to solve the mystery of the murder register online space is limited costumes are encouraged but not required\nOn Sunday from one thirty to three thirty there's trunk portrayed at St lukes Lutheran Church twenty eleven ten streets out from Wisconsin Rapids everyone is welcome to visit the decorated cars in the parking lot portrayed games there's free hotdogs chips and hot chocolate into shelter house and a costume parade at two thirty\nBring a food item to donate to swept or school supplies for operation Christmas Child run for all ages\nWe'll have more activities for you next week right here I Am Thirteen twenty W.
