I wanted to see the brewers raised the cubs I I wanted to see the brewers beat the cubs and get that monkey off their back\nAnd many of you agreed I was on Twitter last night talking to a few of you and and many people were kind of driving in many agree there was something that said no you know a screw the cubs you know they've been on top of the division on top of the national league for quite some time blah blah blah\nOkay that's fine that's your opinion good to go with that but as I sat there last night\nI always say you find out who you're rooting for once the game gets underway so the games underway and Colorado scores scores were so I'm like yeah and then I thought to myself wait a minute I'm rooting against my own philosophy here and as the game went on and the cubs you know had that big bomb it big homerun\n... kinda like okay I get to see what happens\nKnow and it's going on and on and now I Can't take my eyes off of it Sherry and I are still we were going to be unpacking

room right\nSo as the game draws on\nSelf more and more and more kind of leaning towards the Colorado Rockies and she turns ... well that's that's not what you said and I I Know it it there's

wide about this Colorado team of makes you a quiver and if anything if anything and the brewers past success against Colorado does that play into this at all gay indifferent whatever first shouted you today hey Jason West Alice ... have you been man what's going on\nWhat's going on Bill thanks for taking my call\nHey why are you going to show up to one of our events coming down the standing on Thursday night 'cause if you're not there you're you're you're you just you you just gotta go someplace else you've got to move\nOkay All right I I I'm going to try and make that said I don't live too far\nI Know you're over in West Alice ... you're not that far\nIt takes time now\nI can make it over there hey listen ah the Rockies or our team they got old enough and it's a you know with our NATO cover story Charlie Black men da de can put up runs in bunches problem is with us guys you got to jump on them real quick they give up runs in bunches of\nWell mhm so uh\nThe thing with the brewers they're Iraqis are tired team right now they've been traveling from one place so now\nIt's like three cities in three days or something like that isn't it\nYeah for sure so uh it is imperative that the the brewers job bottom real quick and and hopefully get into the uh get their goal and involved and shut them down the first game of the series is going to be huge\nUm the brewers have to get that that uh keep the whole field and uh and uh make sure that that they are they kicked out and uh and keep the pressure on the rockets\nYeah I got out for this study that\nTire buddy mild to see if not calling me I'll send you an over hype about Dr Tiller okay Jay in West Alice joining for government\n\nThey have a fight he's right or you want to jump on them early you I you know here's a couple of reasons one\nYou don't want to get there and and lose or losing spectacularly crap testing fashion\nAnd then think to yourself you really belong 'cause you don't want to do that you want to get the confidence you want to get the ball I mean this is a team that has shaken off things all throughout the season remember the five game losing streak they had going into the all star break it took them a little while to recover from that and eventually they got going again\nOnly to win eight straight down the stretch and put themselves in position they are today so they can shake it up you in the postseason you don't have time\nTo wallow in in what happened yesterday you got to keep moving forward you're only as good as the next day starting pitcher you're only as good as the runs you put on the board you're only as good as what you're you're you're mentally capable of and this has got to this is a team with ... Cain Jefferson guys that have been there done that so they can tell you what it's like\nSo they've got a little bit of that leadership in a club house um and obviously Ryan Braun went to an end I'll see as they end up getting me by the cardinals but he understands with that you know what it takes to get through something like this you know there's some guys in there that have been there done that a crate council obviously\nHe can tell you what it what it's like to be there and didn't get to that point and obviously when a World Series but for the young group of guys yeah you need to you need to get in there you need to jump on them early and it's not necessarily that you have to jump on them early just\nPound them you've got a pound them into submission and you got to get the when it's that you have to you you get on them early and then you take their best shot when they start to come back and then you new kind of move on from there and then you say okay I got this it's kind of like you know when you play football\nIf you've ever played football they always say there's nerves you know you get butterflies you're you're kind of jumping around you're anxious you know you're doing your stretches your jumping on the sideline in this and that and you get out there and you're nervous you're looking around you're looking around your minds racing\nAnd you're thinking of all the stuff that you've taught or been taught you think of all the things that you need to do you think your technique low shoulders head to the side you thinking about arms wrapping up lifting leverage to you know all that kind of stuff you're talking about inside leverage outside leverage watched there has to watch where they go\nWash their eyes watch the ball you mean all that different stuff and then finally when you get out there and somebody\nPops you you get that first hit men it's football okay you're not thinking anymore you just plan and then it's football that's that's what I'm Talking about when it comes to the second best bunch eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight or go to Fred listening to his in Green Bay on a mighty WFL Fred how you doing man what's happening\nUh five ten people enjoy it for that matter the Rockies I've ever uh you know I don't care who your core but shorter class at medical patches of course ... class go I'm looking forward to their home to your mother and a five year\nThere you go I like it at All right I appreciate it that I could imagine if I had\nA story of voter I school I didn't I wrote him about them and Sports Illustrated of Arctic two years ago yeah there were nationally nor and high school where they are\nYes they were remembered Jerry fathers' their head coach and he ended up going towards Notre Dame\nOr they had a fantastic wedding or you could probably tell me what it was\nA I had it with her life has one more thing grow we have a local high school a tree and here they've got the fortitude in October last week and you feel good when you're walking off the field as a player\nBut gross players almost all of them over to the other change a manager who was confined to a wheelchair and they hired him at a God or tear trigger are\nYeah no I received a phone call man when you hear about the sportsmanship like that that's fantastic I mean that that was my point was when when I got ran over\nIt wasn't being disingenuous what he was saying to me and saying hey you need a hand up you know let me help you up that type of thing there was a genuine hey you know let me give you a shot\nAnd [laughter] you know you get so amped up at the opponent you know when you watch their mannerisms and you're like punk can I'm Better than that and I can beat you and you get it and then a moment like\nOkay you know and it didn't it to me it maybe even angrier because it let my guard down I Love to play with a barrage that anger that that's what football was you know so\nAnyway a five five eight three zero eight six for eight five five eight three zero\nEight fix for eight if you want to give it to feel free to do so reminder as well back to our friends from New medical they uh you know they treat guys with the all of the state of Wisconsin and beyond the borders or if you're looking to get a senior stamina is not good and you can't cheer and stand for an entire baseball game the way you used to you may want to go see new\nMake an appointment right now as you say hey look I got a game coming up on Thursday or friday\nI Need to be ended his thing I Can't be falling asleep in the fifth inning\nSo are you may head over to new man gives you some low T check that's what you should do or have you got to ... and going and right after the ... gonna victory you're like you know meeting new more and more men and if that's not happening and then you need to go get that check as well or maybe you went to the ball game and you're a season ticket holder and you had\nAnd that's what's been happening and it's on a fun to watch\nTalking with Bruce catcher Jacob Nottingham joining us on the Schneider orange hotline what's it been like working with with crashing opinion of the season and what have you learned from those guys\nThat it's been great uh I just met crafts um\nWhen we were playing God I'm In uh he's been awesome have these worked with me a lot is gone over a lot of things on how to read certain situations and um and many pain has been awesome he's a he's taking me under his wing a lot this year and\nA kind of takes me and helps me if it's what people were throwing because he's he's one of the best in the game right now throwing and um even Steven a vote he he does so much for me um I Know I Wish I was out there playing and\nUm but he's very he he's been taking care of me since day one and uh even throughout the game Steve is pointing things out on why we do this while you do that and\nUm I think it's been such a blessing being here and having a guy like that or take care man\nReally sue Steven Vogt still a voice in that club Elson huh\nOh yeah he's a big voice I mean everybody looks up to them [noise] um he was almost like the captain of the team you know\nRespects them and I mean I'm sure you have something he is going to give you the best answer and I'm ... and I know that's what he's done with me and I mean I Know I hang out with them every day and I'm going to grant as much as I can\nSo take us into the clubhouse is before the media gets in there before everybody gets in there and start springing champagne what's it been like\nTo see not only you guys went in St Louis but then to take on say the the rivals so to speak into winning Wrigley Field what does it mean that has that sunk in yet to the fact that you guys won on rival turf places you have not traditionally been able to win over teams you traditionally have not been able to beat\nYeah it was big I mean but um it was really cool\nHow many ... fans write it out there and we could and obviously hear him every time a something big was going to happen and uh it was definitely a cool experience and um I Know like I said earlier you got to be the best and\nNo matter where it is and I know we sure are showed up ready and um they came in our favor\nI was going to say it ah everybody's mentioned the fans and the fact that the fans have shown up I mean putting a close to three million people through the turnstiles obviously huge Miller Park but\nUh it's it's got to be a good feeling because we've heard so much about say really north that becomes Miller Park they have so many ... fans or at least lousy brewers fans at Wrigley Field the other day\nYeah it was that was awesome I mean you almost just a few to start smiling because of how could feel that there's so many fans there to back us up and\nI'm obviously is we want to win on the ball games for them just as well so you know it was a cool experience and um I think our fans out them so\nReally I mean that that that will the fans there were that loud and that ah that we are almost\nFeel like there was only we were friends there\n[laughter] that was fantastic say real quick before I let you go so uh so so now you're heading into the LDS a a place in Milwaukee traditionally has not been over the years it's been very few and far between um nervousness or anything like that or is it business as usual how do you guys taking an approach on this\nI think is treated how we've been trading just go out there and play hard and um play the team um and then to fly over they'll take care of itself\nJacob pleasure chatting with you okay I think that's a lot of guys\nI talk to you soon there you go Jacob Nottingham joining us for a couple of minutes on the Schneider orange outline

to say certainly ah guys look up to a Christian yellowish entertaining the MVP but in the grand scheme of things when the guy like that says the guy that\nClubhouse leader the guy that's taking me under his wing the guy that I pick his brain he's been our leader every game Steven vote\nWe I mean we hear about other guys that are players but you don't hear about a guy that's been banged up but still alongside going okay this is what you need to do is is what you have to think this is what you have to see this is what I see what do you see you don't you don't hear a lot about those guys those guys become almost forgotten entity\nOh Stephen boat has been there a ever since he got back from um oh the surgery went through\nAnd you know this could be it for Steven boat I'm not sure what his future holds a professional baseball player but that man every time I go into the clubhouse he's there\nAnd he is definitely a presence I'm so no I mean it's it is amazing and not just even boat but the amount of veteran leadership that there is throughout the clubhouse and for some of you that you know don't want to accept it\nBut you've heard him give two big speeches and that's Ryan Braun Ryan Braun is certainly one of the leaders of this team Lorenzo Cain Microsoft stock is Curtis Granderson in these guys are all tremendous leaders and you need that kind of leadership\nUm even when a

new show twenty targets that\nCan stop you know and then moved there to play one eye if you toss 'em [noise]\nSo we got to find ways to get involved and then Jimmy as well\n\nGet in a number one spot [noise]\nWalking back to the program we're glad to have you think so much of those are the words of Aaron Rodgers those are the words\nOf a of of the broadcast team from CBS Sports as they covered the game and um it's uh it's interesting because if if everything that has said is true\nAnd Aaron Rodgers goes in and delivers the speech to the team and says hey you know no excuses go out and execute ... ball game and then after the game in Athens\nOr at least seemingly um you know kind of points the finger or directly points the finger depending on what you believe rent it Mike mccarthy than [laughter] it's at the very least hypocritical\nAnd to the very most embarrassing\nSo just one of the kind of bring it to bring in bringing to the forefront and you know what\nThat could be just a post game frustration but how do you tell everybody you know you can't point fingers at the coaches and then you do it at the podium in front of God and everybody eight five five eight three zero eight six forty eight five five eight three zero\nEight six for eight\nYears just shouting five five eighty three zero eight six for eight um let's see here let's go to Tim listening to us and rice like Tim welcome to the program that will Michael sure what's going on man\nHey Bill thanks for taking my call um I I guess I don't read a whole lot into that I think they put it into perspective you know it's very competitive bad I think they have a good relationship and that's obvious I Do have quite as often as the execution problem their traditional starters but\nOne of the most glaring thing that's happened over the last few years is an avid several times at work or second in three seconds before or throw the twenty\nYards down the field Fifteen yards down the hill trying to go for the instead of just six or eight at first out this is bad real problem with this off fast and part of that is Aaron Rodgers\nUm [noise] you got to get the first out\nA way of lost first out because of that stuff constantly and it's bad execution so that's my church that thanks do\nAppreciate it I'm I'll tell you one thing that ah his age it's been frustrating many of you brought this up\nThe\nThe clock management I mean as much as you want to talk about what Mike mccarthy may or may not do may or may not call Aaron Rodgers may or may not change his lemon scrimmage\nWe've talked about clock management many viewer charming and saying you know look some of these things and Aaron Rodgers gets frustrated with his his own fault because he runs a clock down they run out of time outs they don't have the ability to score a lot of that stuff I agree with we talk about it all the time\nAnd is there a positive to running the clock down as far as they do well there is to a certain extent because wants to defend starts to make shifts and the defense can see the clock winding down as well\nThey're starting to dissipate to snap which means they're starting to put themselves in the movement which means Aaron Rodgers can kinda see where their their coverages are where their their Blitzer czar whose coming who's not because you\nGuys need to be in place within a second or two\nAnd that gives you were in Rogers maybe a little bit of a mental edge for as much as we get frustrated with running the clock down to the very last second in allowing you know the defense of say okay one second go because otherwise it's the way of game we also then get a chance to say OK Aaron Rodgers now sees where the pressures are coming from sees where the match ups are\nAnd it gives him that extra split second to be able to make a quick or decision to get the ball down field so I understand both sides of it it drives me nuts personally what I understand I did not saying I agree with it\nBut I'm simply saying I understand both sides with eight five five eight three zero eight six forty five five eight three zero eight six for eight so we often I mean just where does the hiccup lie I guess the best way to put it in\nWe're always looking to point the finger always looking to the to place blame for many of your charming and saying you know Rogers got paid now he's in that I don't want to hear anything about the pay okay the bottom line is the guy's got a banged up knee he looks a little off\nHe hasn't been the same last couple of weeks he's had a couple of missteps and some throws in Aaron Rodgers normally you know he he can throw a football through all you know\nHe can throw a football through a a a class rank from forty yards out Ninety percent of the time so I'm not overly concerned about Aaron Rodgers I think he's just kind of adapting right now meanwhile Mike mccarthy when he was asked about Aaron Rodgers comments and maybe this being barbs back and forth is with Mac as\nFar as comments you know the last guy I think we've we've done this long enough in here [noise] um you know conversations that you have with with staff players and so forth anything that can be a correction aid for the best really internally or you know so that from off from my\nYou know position that's not going to change um [noise] I think you'll always recognize individual person on the door to the [noise]\nThe have the day that we know that you hope to have all the time you know we read of all we do some really good things are passing game wasn't quite where we'd like to the Ben I'm that's why you have the video and then they go back for things all on Monday so I've already been proved\nIn the rye and game of other protection was better than we do we just had some\nSome functional mistakes that uh we're just going to continue to work out you know it's just like anything in this game and it's just really the message of the whole team I mean are are different said\nDuring their best selling of the day and and that's really what the message should be about you know because we took a big big stuff as a defense but more fully what are we gonna do it and I said well how do we build off of this and um\nWe have to coach butter we'll play better and and and that's that's always our focus [noise]\nOr it might McCarthy did what are you supposed to do and that is pay no problem I've got this he's not going throws quarterback under the bus he's going to be the coach\nSay everybody's got an opinion we're going to coach better they're going to play better we're going to get better and keep moving forward and it's the right thing to say you know it's a tough situation when you do come out swinging\nNo well you know it had Aaron Rodgers hit for those passes that he just was off on you know we'd be talking about a whole different ball game\nYou don't do that you don't do that you know so he comes out says what are you supposed to say I'm\nSure behind closed doors he's probably thinking what the hell is this guy doing was Heathrow me under the bus\n[noise] not sure if he saw Tom Silverstein space in a press cause that Pakistan's dot com yesterday when he suggested that McCarthy and Rogers should be put into a room and mark Murphy you should just but the higher it out with these two I think in essence\nIf you do that and you have to have management come and figure it out look what happened between ...\nBelcher I didn't want something Brady did\nOwnership sided with with Brady and everybody talks about it now being a terribly fractured relationship\nBecause you had to have somebody else can you you can't you got to work this out man to man by yourself\nYou got to come up with a mutual I mean I don't know I see I don't know what it is behind closed doors I don't know if if those two are just it just seeding or if there's just me against you or in this particular case they just didn't agree and there and took it public and his ... and to a certain light I don't know\nI really don't know I don't I don't know what the respect level is behind closed doors right now I Do know one thing the guy that was brought into basically be the buffer here Joe Philbin\nUh I Wonder where all of this is with him because Joe is the guy to kind of always went between ... and Erin could say something joke and say something joke at talking to Mike Mike could talk to Joe and it was kind of like this trio this three headed monster that became the fence for the Green Bay Packers\nI don't know where it all that fits in\nI Do know one thing I I I Want to see this off and get better right now for four games into this and I am sick and tired of hearing a pre season you know Aaron Rodgers knows it\nOh that's okay they get on the ... they get on the same page and practice was like four or five years now with this thing has come out and not look good it's been sporadic not consistent\nPutting up a Chicago traffic to sleep in my own that leave it at that but I think I think I think it might [laughter] it's tough because you got to believe that if the cubs or the ...\nThey would have gotten moment come back and then fired up to come back to Milwaukee and and and take back what scares you know um 'cause at me and they would have won the brewers have success against them they were all tight Mitt affairs I'm\nSuper rich works a little water five and two against Iraq because here so it's kind of course the peace but I think\nI think people who's the brewers to not have to go back into another five game series against you in the face twenty times already this season um that's just looking at bad but the grand scheme of things I think it works out a little bit better for\nYou know it was it was interesting I was telling a story earlier I I really am one of the cubs I mean if you're going to you know kind of kind of get that monkey off your back just beat them shut up their fans get them out a bill or part just beat him and this thing and end their season but I got to tell you I sat there last night against my own ...\nFor the Rockies I there was I don't know what it was I don't know whether it was just seeing the expressions on cubs fans faces is Walters drove in that room last night the thirteenth ending\nI don't I don't know what it was but I just thought you know what okay this is good this will be good for not great for baseball because the ratings we know Chicago women all over it but I think it's a good match it for the Milwaukee Brewers to talk to me about this uh this Colorado team coming in and the fact that the brewers have had success against them\nThis is a team that is kind of like the brewers and that they're they're built around the pope's favorite phenomenal losses first of all the top three in the national league and just about every category a second un P. S. or second in total runs scored\nSecond slugging percentage third in in in total batting average so they can hit the brewers pitchers will have their work cut out for about a very much like the brewers worry if they get all ... they're going to the bullpen\nI'm ... and it took that both a little while to get together a member of the Rockies spent about a hundred million dollars during the off season to bolster up that group\nAnd it took a little while for them to get going in the last month the seasons the two best relief to are the best reporters in all of baseball or the rivers and rock you so there's going to be some similarities between those two teams and you know we've been saying all along baseball's becoming a full time gave a special playoffs I think we're going to see that this year\nI'm looking at a there's Tiedemann is far as the rosters go now or you know join I are going to talk about our own rosters coming up you're surely about what we think is going to happen or should have been regarding the Milwaukee Brewers in the postseason is there\nA give me a million or two you'd think okay we've we've come to know this name but this name should not be around to come and postseason\n... and then we all know the obvious when I got to believe that air than while the at out on the playoff roster just did you talk about being snake that this year you know you have high hopes\nTo come back and have a nice consistent campaign um and then he gets a thumb injury and when it comes back and guards plant so hot can't take him out of line up\nPlaying time sporadic famous did not do well and that's going to hit her role it all down scratch\nUh so I have a hard time seeing him ending up on the playoff roster I'll tell you one name that I'm curious about now I'm ... because they're playing the Rockies I Wonder now are spreading Peralta ends up on the play offs roster just because of the success that it's bad\nNow he hasn't had a lot of action in the last couple of weeks\nBut he has done very well against the Rockies and his two starts so I Wonder if he ends up on the roster now as a justice case\nUh of course adding in kind of leaves you may be shorthanded another spot but you know Craig council and David Stern thought outside the box all season long one putting together officers in line up some rotation so I Wonder what we're going to see a friday if we're going to see friday and the series at all\nYou really think they ended up throwing a game me a bullpen\nWouldn't or who didn't surprise me if they did I mean honestly um I I I don't think they would like it just it wouldn't be shocked me at all if at some point you saw something close to a bullpen gave\nJust because of the arms that they have at their disposal\nUm because they're good that's the thing is one thing to have you know nice guys go out there which I don't think you're going to see in each Christian ending but when you've got guys like the brewers do who are so good in such limited doses I Would shock me it would be very surprising but it wasn't shocked if that makes us\nWho right now or is the most other than Christian yellow Jimmy who is being probably that that most unsung heroes do you feel the Milwaukee Brewers\n[laughter] that's tough I mean listen everyone has kinda pitched in and that's the thing I I yell at has gotten\nThe headlines but over the last one I mean everyone has done and I'm actually working on you know you look at the brewers acquisitions since the deadline okay and and All right we could kind of scene was stock is that everything after that kind of raised an eyebrow out and do Jonathan Gold was oh we're\nWhy do they get him and then you go and you get geo and then you get to pick up joined Lyles off waivers\nAnd all of those guys they may not have been steady and consistent since the day they came over each one of those guys are just plain scope had the big grand slam bomb there not here without that\nHit a big hit the other day I Can't remember exactly on the top of my head so my notes that need to look at ... at last Sunday already had a a\nYou had geo and you had Jordan Lyles and he had a ... it just all these guy or a certain junior gear up all these guys that have kind of been written off\nHaving playing the role is when you look at the unsung heroes I think you have to look at the entire off because at some point in time every guy one through forty has done something in a much needed situation to get them to this point\nAll real quick before I let you go\nAnd Craig counseling what he's done a lot a lot of people have a very vocal I very might small minority of people but that tend to critique every move being made I should look you in it with the best record in the national league you don't have a lot to complain about you kind of look foolish in doing so\nI got to agree with you there that's the thing about baseball I think it's because there's such a football mentality at the state\nYou know or every single ... gets broken down you can't look at it like that in baseball yeah and the heat at the moment\nYou know it it it it looks question on it that this that and the other thing if you missed the playoff game like they did last year you can say well what the hell with this guy thinking and the and the brewers kinda snuck into that position by this their teeth there wasn't much of it\nBut you got to step back and look at the entire one hundred sixty to gain picture and say wow those moves really paid off and when you talk about managing\nCouncil literally had to manage this year you look at all the pieces that he had to work with and to make them that\nBut to also make them fit without upsetting anyone I mean you look at the guys that had to take reduced playing time it had to look at what Travis shock you know travel show finally got the chance to be an everyday players tablets itself it with everyday player a legitimate cornerstone player\nThen they go on the getting stock is let's say if you ever had was shot a second then they go out and get scope and now they're tell them hey you know what we love you you one of our guys we need you split tired and to get a guy to do that and to accept that role and embrace that role in the worst that rule that says something about the guy that you know got the conductor the top\n[noise] good stuff as

guess my question is I Know I I wanted the cubs but I found myself rooting for the Rockies last night to Bruce have a better record against the Rockies so in essence this is an intriguing matchup it's probably not what baseball want it because the ratings would have been different had Chicago been in it\nBut uh this is still very intriguing imagine\nI think it's very intriguing the Rockies or a team that\nThey are never slept on Iowa always believed in you know you know I'm a big fan of black their manager or I think is one of the smartest baseball guys and with the firing a buck Showalter today uh I think he might inherit the title of the smartest baseball manager um I just think that the Rockies do it under the radar\nVery much like the brewers if feels very much like similar teams\nUm you don't have flashy names on them out\nAh but I think that there isn't going to be competitive I think they're often there's nothing to me that\nAnd they are a better rotating than they

Rubio mine as to what it may look like\nBut I wanted to get back to the phone calls because I wanted to make sure that everybody's voice was heard on this\nAnd we were talking about Aaron Rodgers and Aaron Rodgers a you know some of the comments made during the game broadcasts between ... and Dan Phelps that said that Aaron Rodgers had spoke to the team untold deem they don't point fingers just you know whatever the coaches do we do we go out and executed and there's nobody to blame let's just move on\nAnd then after the game kind of had some strong comments that seemed to be any way\nBy many account insinuating that something was amiss between him and the head coach now there's people writing about it and saying lock them in rooms and make them work this out in\nThe Packers are dysfunctional and the only person has been fired has been McCarthy he needs to go and you know they pay their and they didn't pay Mike and there's a lot of different things here and I just wanted to get your opinion and all of this let's go to Jim listening to us and walk a show Jim thanks for all what's going on man\nHigh I own a make a comment about Aaron Rodgers here\nI'd say McCarthy has got to step up I mean a few years ago Rogers was coming off the field and he was he had a finger at a McCarthy's face and I thought to myself what Lombardi of done what Bernie whatever chased him right to the locker on ... and even homerun wouldn't take that from right\nIn the morning or the or the body when the training them to Cleveland or because they didn't have ...\nYeah it in a Ringo want to renegotiate his contract and they told him you're talking to the wrong guy already traded\nHe went he said hang on a minute and made a phone call in and traded them away for I think a bag of football or something like that\n... thing when Rogers is he gets a touchdown pass somebody goes off the field during this Heisman pose one farmer you thought he'd be running on a like a kid and they only to relate to the guy 'cause he was really happy I'm really happy that you know but I don't know it's just something about Rogers or I don't know when we get there is\nNo go ahead Jim finish up\nThey should just keep it in my mouth shut because he's the quarterback he's not the owner of the team and he's out the coach that's\nWhat we have coaches horn and make the decisions you know and after every game or a car through they talked to a Rogers like what the heck you know\nWell I appreciate the phone call they they they've always talked to a far they've always talked to the quarterbacks going all the way back to bart star win or lose quarterbacks always get to Mike in the face always Brett Farr always went to the podium coaches always going to the podium both go to the podium\nBut you always get the star player you get the quarter back you know that kind of thing that's that's what they always always done so it's not like far as getting or a Rogers getting some star treatment as far as celebrations\nYou know some guys run down and celebrate with their team other guys this pomp and walk off the field other guys\nBut you know remember J college it was like somebody shot his puppy you know you could throw in Ninety are bomb eighty yards in the air hit a guy in stride do when a ball game and he looked like all he wanted to do is you know walk over to the sidelines and lay down and cry curl up in the field position under a bag of balls\nSo I don't mind celebrations it's you know the guys that celebrate by themselves and not with their for their teammates that bothers me\nYou know after a big sack running twenty yards down field do some kind of crazy dance that's you know is what it is\nBut I you know and\nAs far as just the speech itself it's just kind of insinuate said there's there's maybe a little bit of their their so to speak to the gym listening to us on the west side Jim how you doing to the man was going on\nThanks for taking my call belle sure I just thought of ...\nPoints I think that's a quarterback Roger caliber Brady breeze or even Peyton Manning now retired guys I Believe half it'd be better than their head coaches they've got to have\nSimilar or heating football IQ from the film room and ... and everything but then they got to have the athletic guilty acting man for reflexes and tuition fee of stuff um and I think I think Roger has always been respectful obviously when you take these to comment you know either\nOut of context they're compartmentalized someday they certainly uphold one another but\nI guess my two points are that I think there's two different issues going on here I think Roger Jack in the team up about following\nThe game plan was him feeling that they should have been three in on that one more than one and people weren't doing or following the plan I think that path game I think Roger followed the plan and clearly he would he would argue that McCarthy plan was good enough to win\nAnd sure enough a veil about any of their FCAT locations in any one of those cities you can take a ride in a brand new ram Fifteen hundred or a Jeep Grand Cherokee or dodge charger caravan Pacifica Chrysler for Ninety Days no obligation like what the hell is this about\nI'm not kidding if you're not satisfied you can return it with no additional commitment or you can buy it and save up to two grand and I just I I started driving I wasn't a pickup truck guy but I started driving his two thousand and Nineteen ram Fifteen hundred\nAnd eight hooked me it just hooked me it's got all the bells and whistles of luxury car on the inside and yet I Am in the process of moving still and I and packing in so many boxes in so much crap in so much stuff in the back of this thing and then I'm going to go get firewood and\nAll this different stuff I'm using this truck for it and it's fantastic I Love this thing check them out a van horn auto dot com that is van horn auto dot com and you could shop the inventory that qualifies for the Ninety Days test drive program that is all exclusively\nDo what I did go to van horn auto dot com and see what I'm Talking about as van horn auto dot com on\nRadio Joe and I sat down we started looking at a this week uh as far as the brewers I'm twenty five ... man roster\nAnd do what we thought as far as pictures go and outfielders go and who's hot who's not getting ready for this and how the U.S and they want to go first or you want me to go first [noise] uh I think you should go okay um so I started looking at pitching staff and I thought OK obviously it's it's you you got just seen\nYou've got ... hours you've got weighed mightily okay so that that right there we went with yesterday [noise]\nAnd then I started thinking okay what do you what happened to be doing long relief is you know junior Guerra yeah courtroom burns\nA ... you know I'm sure you hit not pitched well but as of recent he's been lights out would rip his pitched really well\nSo I started looking at this and I thought you know ... hours I Can't trust you know no a vigorous today and you know Dan Jennings has been unreliable I Love would break Peralta can bring maybe for for a a a longer stent but I found\nSo I'm I'm going to go with Anderson burns I'm going to go with Guerra Gonzalez that Davies Josh hater obviously Jeremy Jeffrey scoring enable that that goes without saying wait Miley and I'm going to go with Zoriah in ...\nI'm now we talked to Jacob Nottingham a little bit earlier today and unfortunately he didn't make my cut when it comes to catchers because you've got to go with ... I mean that's that's without a doubt [noise] ah the outfield\nOr its Braun it's Cain it's yellow each Domingo saying ten has been hitting the hell out of the ball and I like I really had the ... was between key on rocks and Curtis Granderson\nGranderson has this experience\nI'd keep Granderson and probably leave key on rocks and off his interchangeable but\nI I I liked the experience of Granderson Eric ... not going to be they're not going to happen as an outfielder or an infielder I'm obviously it's it's going to be have to say goodbye\nOr it's going to be ... as it's gonna be traveling Shaw pronounce ... as you go to guy for being all over the field are seeing scope ... or ... ... you know defensively speaking fantastic so as I mentioned everything is not going to be there's how do you know is not going to be there\nSo that's going to be the roster that I'm going with\nSo how many physicians players how many pictures or if you have to add up my pictures one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve\nOkay only twelve okay you know what I think elimination of position of players made it easier to keep twelve I didn't start out with twelve pictures but when I when I started adding it up as to what I was in wasn't going to keep it made it easier to say I'm going to go to all pitchers\nIf that makes sense I didn't start out by saying I'm going to go semi pitcher I sent my pitching staff first but I think in the beginning there was ten and then I started to go with the position of players and they gave me an extra spots winded or an extra couple of spots so I ended up adding\nA cause I was ... I was back and forth on a friday Peralta I was back and forth on Dan Jennings Indian Jennings not so much because he's been really lights out but because we're talking about experience here at this point just being of war veteran\nSo pretty Peralta who's been good and longer stance he can come up come in and eat up innings Jennings is just kind of been there done that but he hasn't piss real well so when I ended up kind of switching people out that's when I ended up with the twelve pictures\n[noise] okay so you got ... I Do okay [noise]\nUh I Do I can flip him in ... at any point in time you can talk me into that [noise]\nYeah I had I was doing this for over an hour last night or during the cubs Rockies game and I I just [noise]\nThis is going to be a really tough call for a couple of guys um and the free for all the thing is interesting because he's pitched well against the Rockies his major league debut is against the Iraqis and he had the ... strikes out Thirteen guys I'm not\nSure if that carries over the the issue that ... that I it was pretty ... he's only pitched twice in the month of September and I'm just not sure if\nThat's a good idea to throw them in this situation so I got pretty for all the off this day and I'll start with the ... that's a no brainer\nThen your relief pitchers include Josh hater Germany Jeffress Cory ... ... says Daniel burns Brandon Woodruff\n... also makes it\nAnd is act Davies\nDavies though I'm Still kind of debating because there's a couple of other guys that could you can make legitimate arguments for that you could have been there over that David says well one of which is junior Kara one of which is Jordan Lyles no one has talked about Jordan Lyles he has pitched well\nI'm In his last day to parents is in fact he is not giving up a run in his life state appearances and he's been able to soak up ... for this first team but that's why I had I have twelve ...\nMy only geo hater jeopardy ... story is to Daniel burns Woodrow Jennings Davies then position of players I decided to go with Thirteen originally I Thirteen pitchers twelve position of players I decided to add an extra clear to the bench so that's what I have\nI'm starting catcher maintain your\nAnd your first base shots second base moose at third RC a shortstop and then in the outfield obviously it's yellow Cain broad then the bench players spy bench players which and crew crafts air not Paris Curtis Granderson Jonathan scope and Domingo Santana [noise]\nUh I had a hard hard time trying to leave key on Brock spin off because I Know they want to use them for a defensive replacement ... a\nPinch running situations I get those arguments and it was very tough to leave him off of that but Domingo Santana\nHas been huge off the bench with this team has been great since he came back and really when you're in this situation where where are you going to be using so many different pitchers and you're going to need pinch hitters to come up and big situations Domingo Santana has to be that guy he has to be on the team\nNow the other guy that I was a little conflicted about put it on this rosters Jonathan scope and here's why\nJonathan scope\nAs much as I defend him as much as I tried to defend that trade the David Stern is made\nScope has not been playing while as of late you know and it's hard for him to really get any spark he had a good moment over the weekend against the tigers are where he had that big R B I double he had the grand slam earlier in September a against the giants which led to a when\nI put on jobs in scope on this team because I'm just hoping that he finds his magic again this guy he's the thirty home run hitter\nHot so I don't expect him to see in a ton of starting lineup\nSee that's the reason I put him on if he doesn't perform well in the in the U.S but he doesn't make you know the U.S roster maybe not what you're playing and two ballparks that are very very home on friendly and this guy does have that power and that's the reason I kept\nHim on the ... it's ... it's very borderline at this point Eric famous sorry buddy you're not\nYou're not many cognac Eric themes if you go back and look at his numbers since August first he's reading a book thirty three eight to thirty five on base at two eighty three slugging in sixty eight played appearances\nOn his walk great eleven percent his strike out rate bill\nFifty percent yesterday yeah ... striking out in half of his head back into the\nWinter it's better than more to it it's better than ... out of every two it's like one out of every one point eight five or something like that it back to strike you know\nIt it it is it's really really bad Eric fame if this guy did a little bit more he's easily on this team but I it took months this guy has been able to figure it out you can't put them on this roster\nNo you can't try to figure it out once you are ah once you're in the postseason now is when you got to perform good went to court break state to your thoughts coming up next we don't like a show\nWhere in Wisconsin bill Michael Moore's talk for it [noise]\nDoesn't matter", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Wisconsin Rapids", "day": "03"}
