Kansas Bruce team went and my question is always why not what leads you to believe they can't and they said well you know they don't have that starting pitcher I said well wait a minute I understand what you're saying because it's non traditional and I said and I was right there with you but here's my question\nThey have the best record in the national league why do you believe that this is a gimmick but they can't do this why\nWell you know and like gimme gimme a legitimate reason as to why because they've been doing it all season long if you get four innings out as just seeing the turnover in the bullpen more power to you and I said specifically now when you go to\nAnd then you've got an off day and you go three and then you got it off day and you go to\nHere's the deal Wisconsin's the interstates constructed in the fifties and sixties need to be rebuilt and that costs real money yes we made significant investments in recent years but we can't afford to haul these projects mid way our economy depends on the interstate system\nAnd well maintain local roads and bridges responsible state wide approach is desperately needed agreed to go to just like the W.

market basket ball and the NFL AM Thirteen twenty W F a jar\n[noise]\n\nBack to the program Michael show on the air we are glad you were on board today hopefully your enjoying your day [noise]\nGood Wednesday to you [noise]\nSo [noise] before we went to a break we were talking brewers baseball and I said there's one thing that could derail this team [noise] and this is what I what I Believe [noise]\nThe only thing that could derail this gene [noise]\nIn my opinion would be this break [noise] that's it [noise] that's it I I look at this team and I think they were just kind of rolling [noise] it was almost methodical [noise]\nThey're just just moving on next next game next you know that type of thing and\nI I the only thing that I think could derail this whole thing is if\nThey just the break just took him out of their rhythm budget nothing more just a break took him out of their rhythm I just believe that this team's a good team I Believe that they were kind of firing on all cylinders before the break I um\nI I just I I think they can get this job done\nI really do I get it done I'm excited because I didn't see it all culminate\nBut\nI'm I'm thinking the only thing is going to slow this team down right now is going to be the\nThe the break does it take them out of the rhythm you know we always talk about athletes are creatures of habit you know if you're going to take an athlete out of his rhythm you're taking him out of his his habits and I don't want to see that happening but other than that I think this team's gonna win\nI think they've got the ability to when I think they can win I'm excited eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six foray\nWant to hear from you so give me your thoughts how confident are you\nKnow just brewers team is gonna win judge liberal or do you think that this is this is not a ... you know this is this is not the brewers from years ago that this is going to be a tough all paid five five eight three zero eight six for eight\nOh let's go to Brian Brian welcome to the program what's going on man\nHey great show as always thank you you keep it there even though there are a\nAnd there are a couple of comments have real quick is that what I think the birds are going to have to be themselves don't go out and try to do what you you know you're not capable of doing it for yourself what maybe next week um\nI think they can't is that what you said about runners that's going position but I think Robert ... there are ... won three out of seven of them during the theory that was what I call that with without it\nWithout shot that conveys are the within a minor league can able within a minor league\nUh this team of the different angle ethically and they and they have to win to win and what I mean by that they can't expect to get that break off from the um they can expect to get that third call a strike they have to be a grass stuff they have to be a third of and one key thing I think if they they have to make those Dodger pitcher work account\nIf you call in the first pitch and your popping up and you know after the third in a a person I was only catch twenty two year playing right into their hands getting cancer and then the game late again make that work that call and and and they're capable and they show that the lap maybe\nTwo months what I'll go walk to get in that just yell at walking mhm players have been there walking the much more than they did last year and I think if they just take a deep breath\nCalmed down they may have the advantage in pitching\nBut I think the brewers may have not equal may have a right answer and hitting it just got to be patient and do what they do and all these pond and exclude the gulag Reagan stay in the Rockies still had the advantage when they were out oh too I I all the word but I just think just for yourself I nobody wants a smaller market in their\nEye on that level of service I had taken some of the rocky time they open downtown where they were staying in a game\nAnd cover the guys in the car will tell me they don't want to and then they don't want the birds they're they want the Dodgers against whoever the American league\nAnd and that's sad that it's come to that where it's all about the money but I really believe there's something special about this brewers team they seem to get the right balance that the right time to write pitch\nCounselors doing an amazing job with the rotation of pitchers and if you're looking at both and they didn't ask sorry or they didn't have a ... decent players that weren't even on the roster back where they play the Dodgers right after the author right and and don't forget\nYeah which went on a monster care right after the all star break mhm stuff has to deal with and I think the ...\nIf they just do what they do and don't try to do something different do try to be ... gym do what you do and I think they can wait and I I really believe that they may bring a new effort to baseball with baseball pitching relief\nA mixing up and not having a standard starting pitcher going painting I think they have a legitimate chat more than probably added two thousand eleven\nI think because they appreciate the phone call that's a great question is this team better or does this team have any more legitimate shot at getting ... World Series in two thousand and eleven team\nBoy that's something to think about he by the way because you didn't know the brewers won the central vision championships to commemorate the historic event big time batch dot com they're offering the officially license Milwaukee Brewers central division teams signature bad no it's thirty five inches I use to hit with a thirty six\nThirty five but that's okay because you're not going to hit with anyway\nIt's going to have a facsimile of signatures of historic brewers roster with the booze logo in the words to thousands of the teen central vision champions on its the bet limited to five thousand bad cells from one twenty nine Ninety five [noise]\nGo to big time batch Don Thomas big time batch dot com right now in order don't do that they always say don't do much it's going to delay and it's you by the time you go there in two seconds is going to get your piece of British history right now call them eight six six to eight zero bats\nEight six six to eight zero bad or I just got a big time batch dot com and uh you know see the exclusive bad such a big time match dot com that's big time best outcome called eight six six to eight zero batch trademarks and logos use with the permission\nOf major league baseball back to the phone calls to Tom in West Alice John welcome to the program and what's happening\nHey bill um I the way I look for the brewers I says the only way they can lose if they beat up so\nI really like the structure of the team um one thing is I think the person who who is going to get this team together and the ones that more like a major Morgan is there a craft I says there's the catcher in the ... the news where he you know this is his time for him\nTo make a move in and he wants it and if he can get the other team the younger Kim to uh go around them I think it's gonna be a big plus one or the hill is running you know if they're going to use the credit Peralta in this series at all\nOh don't know in waiting waiting to find out what the final Ross is going to be you know see us ... here we are not to we've not gotten to the roster point yet\n... it'll be interesting because uh uh it it's going to be interesting because I Know that they use them over the Colorado series\nI Wonder if they're going to be for there so we wish we had died yeah it's a ... budget\nHe dropped so if you're gonna born eight by five eighty three zero eight six four eighty five eighty three zero eight six for you if you want to chime in and do it let's go to Jesse listening to us in Jackson Jesse welcome to the program and was evidence\nPain and I I first want to send out an apology to create council member in September I was all bent out of shape so right on to him he doesn't win manager of the year major league baseball is really screwed up and it it turned out that when GM off the air\nScrewed up I don't think people realize what this guy has done when it comes to evaluating talent so now I'll get my point but brewer\nI mean you know you know I'm a season ticket holder and I get upset with them because if you live and die with each ... each with them I mean it just it part of being part of a baseball team but I don't\nI don't see the brewers moods and the theory of winning\nAnd the only thing that can really hurt them if they start playing already\nThey're hitting when they're both hitting and their pitchers they're the worst thing up a opposite team and come up with is when pitchers are pitching and they know that they can even be\nYou know the old adage you don't don't don't take the evidence and broke so keep doing the same thing you're doing\nBut you know maybe you know don't don't have the problem of where you you posture and that's the main thing when they haven't done so far this year they haven't pressure mhm they haven't done that and that's that's a good thing\nAnd that says as long as you guys keep doing the same thing to do but you know see if you can maybe score a couple of more runs and stuff but if they can keep you guys in tech we've got a shot you\nKnow I I agree for the phone call eight five five eight three zero eight six forty eight five five eight three zero eight six for it's going to listen to some brand new your mark how're you doing salmon\nBoarding bill confidence level\nMy confidence level that it was ... ah you know I've been watching the within my fiance and I and go into a lot of games this season these guys look great I think they can not only beat anybody I think we can go all the way I'd also like to say I'm\nIn regard to a good thing with the birth stab wound up in the bullpen I don't I don't you feel this way but I always kind of thinking that the way that ... has been using the um the bowl and it kind of reminds me of what I mean ... it used to do back in the day\nHe would he would he would you know just constantly uses pictures he wouldn't be a you know he would use them in different\nConfigurations\nAre ... or I don't know so that's just my take I don't have a great day\nBy president man he drops off ...\nHe probably five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eighty three zero eight six for eight I Want to hear from a lot of things to ... go to Peter listening to us in Oregon Peter welcome to the program I can see what's happening\nHere how're you doing this is the first time I've ever called in any talk show\nOkay go ahead I'm a little real nervous bill but uh you know the one thing about the brewers are\nAlso being so innovative and I think for baseball pure just that you know when you go from the norm of\nPutting a starting pitcher and they're running um five six senators and then you put in all these relievers and uh you know guys like Iraq or in Colorado will definitely when the next two games\nI Wish they'd call in mind that now\nAnd the thing I Love about council and innovation of also uh I used to coach like little league and senior league teams and you know you try to get a you know you wanted to get everybody in the game and the way ... it's just amazing you know there's\nOn the patch is ready to play and I think that's the great thing about the brewers and you don't see anybody complaining when he pulls the guy on the seventh inning and they put in a new shortstop or they put in the new right fielder for ...\nIt just keeps them all ready to play and there is such a pool I give costs so much credit for that no complaints from that you know it's just it's amazing\nAh and I think we should get a manager of the year with no doubt and I think that they can do a wonderful job against the Dodgers the key for me is they need\nTo score first fight they all you can get that book and then if they don't score first Dennis Hopper right but uh how do I do for my first\nGreat how you brought up some good points appreciate it do still have to be a stranger thanks so much as always bringing out well now that the

relievers a DJ and lay mark as a child but so many chances for uh\nJust the be all for a while back out tires or you just sit there I T the daylight I look at it might go work out that he that shot up today at all [laughter] whatever shut up yeah oh that's\nA it's kind of impressive but like I said you get stuff from everybody which is kinda cool\nUm when you're sitting there talking about the the the way that it gets done um was there any talk about Frank Thomas or Alex Rodriguez saying that this was a gimmick to this is the way the pitching staff who's a gimmick and it'll never work it will never lasted does any of that stuff seep into the clubhouse\nWell now I Know I don't think it does or if it does that they must be used in it as a alright then we'll just prove you guys wrong as well so if it is the but then they're they're doing their best to prove them wrong\nI'm with the ... it seems like everybody's contributed during the season reading was runners and scoring position wasn't your forte in the postseason it's been it's been better than average um show has there been something different is had been\nYou know as far as telling guys may work to counter workers particular picture in this particular way because it seems like there's been more patients at the plate\nAh yeah and I've noticed that too and I'm like I say I throw the pie every day and stuff like that and you know just a little about that stuff but that goes on a a ... called goes over with um the chase that lane\nAs well as our analytical heat on our theater at meetings that are up and some meetings Waco or stuff like that exactly what the pictures gotta do to you and stuff so that actually has a\nHas a bunch of stuff has a bunch of people probably you know in their air maybe they're just working at it though and hey\nSo here's a story you might relate to I used to post in job board only to end up with hundreds of resumes to sort through it took me to go through all of this\nJust to find a handful of people who are paying for my job it was overwhelming settled process would not smart\nI mean it's not easy to find a network architect financial analyst childcare assistance but then I went to a different career\nFormal they're powerful ... thousands of people with the brain yellow tape from all the Syrian for my job or\nActively invited them to apply\nSo I could hire qualified

just\nSo we don't feel that will be drawn buggy six on the label and look for our summers off the plane was measured certainly [noise] [noise]\nWe farm is everything you mean for ... seasonal\nWeather realm big myself\nWhat you need for these are the best actors snacks these\nNothing new to paint can figure\nAny reason last campaign for the\nEverything\n[noise] building rail line\nMichael's here yesterday scores tomorrow scheduled to today's opinion every day on Thirteen twenty W F a jar\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSo Michael show we continue on [noise]\n... baseball talks back a little bit later on that is okay but John you're white man a lot of people Gemini breweries wise [noise] ah this was from Mark Mark writes a the CEO queen comments should fire up the fans I don't think it's going to be much to the team [noise]\nThoughts that's exactly what I said\nYou're\nGoing to go out to play baseball it's not like they're all of a sudden going to get into a ... or something like that with with the Dodgers in hip week or something like that but it's one of those things that fans grab on to what they do\nYou know I said before or it's you know it's not gonna it it's not going to change the way the British play baseball it's not gonna\nYou know maybe it it it just like I said if you play it\nIt just may be because things right now are very casual maybe it brings your focus back or something to that effect you know but I think once you once you get in the Miller Park once you\nKnow the lights are on what you see the cameras following you down the tunnel as they get ready for the broadcast and they say they walk into Miller Park here comes you know the\nYou know can get to go contender for the MVP Christian yell at you I mean ... just going to still come out and play like rich ... you know it's not like you're gonna change that but\nIt it just one of those things that the fans get used over and that's fine because you want for every uh put it this way for everything we talk about when it comes to Wrigley north\nAnd how the brewers have said man it's tough you know you go out and most of your crowd is is not even for ya you know they get an energy from you the pitchers get an energy from you they get this this this\nLevel of of palpable\nFrom you know that type of thing that's what you can do as a fan as far as what the brewers do or what they need you know all they need to do is go out and play decent I mean even if you're not there was nobody in the stands still go out and trying to play baseball\nYou know they're playing for themselves they're playing for the name across the front the name across the back in the team inside the clubhouse and they're all playing for one common goal there playing on a championship that's what they're doing\nSo whether we got there doesn't make a comment does mean hell beans but it does the fans and that's that's part of what it is to be a band\nAid five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six word I get to the phone calls just coming up here\nMomentarily Nelson right ... hey guys and fired up about this brewers team the only thing that scares me is not being able to win game one you get down early you could lose some confidence thoughts on that because this team has some veteran but\nWe just got done talking to a cheater about it you got guys that have been there done that you have moose stock is you have the rents are came you have a guy that's been around many different teams and crash you got a guy and Jeremy Jeffress you've got somebody infield outfield behind the plate somebody that has been in there and won a championship and oh by the way their managers\nAnd he won two of them and he was a part of a big one when it comes to the Marlins and scoring the winning run and then getting part of being part of that rally in Arizona so you know what it's like to continue to battle through the postseason you've got enough experience there to draw from now it's just kind of keeping things lose some of the young guys not knowing any better\nAnd you go do what you do me it's it's it's not that it's not rocket science once you once the first pitch is laid out there other than maybe the weight of the outcome of being larger it's still baseball it's still the same thing you played the part didn't get bigger\nThan the strike zone didn't get smaller you know the lights didn't get brighter you know maybe they've got a little extra paint on the field and some bunting around the top of that place but that's it so baseball sort of frat listening to us in Green Bay Fred walking to the program go Michael show\nI built a clerk on my caller center Cochran is sure we love the Packers in Green Bay but are flooded with baseball catcher who is there are excited about\nThe tape a real number one and competitive sports has never underestimate the opposition I sure could walk that or is it out or their estimated river walk one guard might\nBut are they respect everybody here nobody\nBut I just wanted to remember ... when my grandmother lives about night before and uh I Know you're right about it all but ... is here\nWith that one not to not truth that court pictures on that staff of it all at\nThe ... you had to check them very ... chapter very cool and yet that shy and swept them and the giants were inferior shape but it just ... my quite that everybody can be a group\nAnd I just called gr Shater who attend chemistry is a big plus it it got into college who are a lot of credit for their\n... you know I remember he had the beginning of the season he's the one that said hey we we got to become a family and and it it's it's played through eight five five eight three zero eight six boys appreciate the phone call he's you're absolutely right\nEight five five eight three zero eight six for a do you want to chime in more emails to get to his well hey you want to let you know the brewers are case you didn't know central division champions\n'cause you didn't know to commemorate the historic event a big time bats dot com they're offering unofficially license Milwaukee Brewers central vision team signature bat thirty five inches [noise]\nUh it's it's got the facsimile of signatures for this historic brewers roster on it with ... logo and the words two thousand and Eighteen central division champions on it now the bat is limited by the way five thousand these things are being made at one twenty nine Ninety five if you want to own one of them or numerous\nGo to big time batch that kind of comes out right now is you can start getting into a\nYou know maybe holiday orders go to big time bats dot com that's big time batch dot com order right now due to delay get your piece of brewers history right now call them eight six six to eight zero bats PATS\nEight six six to eight zero bats and uh it's an exclusive bat said you can check 'em all out a big time bats dot com the big time bats dot com or go to eight six six to eight zero batch be ATS the trademarks in the logos are all use with the permission of major league baseball\nThere you have a more emails to get to this one is Eric and Eric's says I'm liking would counsel has been doing I think he's the manager of the year for those that have bashed him this season I Would like to see them come out of the woodwork now and say why he has been almost perfect in this postseason the use of ... the other night was impeccable\nHe ended up pulling him when we all knew Jeffress just simply didn't have it not a knock against Jeffers just simply preserving the when\nThat's what good managers do feelings be damned go out there and do your best to move on and live to fight another day this team has one and they will continue to win because Craig council has that experience that he's honed over the last couple of years that is from Eric Eric pre shape email\nOr eight five five eight three zero eight six four here's the other thing to remember coming up in about an hour from now a brewers reliever Jeremy Jeffers we will talk with him or he's going to be joining us coming up here at the bottom of the next hour and we'll ask him you know just say hey\nA couple of struggles a but give us give us your thoughts you've been through this before\nOr anything different also coming up after the top of the hour the top of the our national baseball insider chef everybody's going to join us and coming up in about Fifteen minutes from now our buddy Michael reconnection sticking service because that has become an issue\nOr the left my mind I think that the brewers are playing before that um they had too many guys left on base um you've got to get them home against great teams if not you know naturally you're going to lose so they yell at each\n... if I'm the Dodgers or anybody I Walk him I put 'em on faith and see who else on that team getting documented right everyday bill\nBuddy yeah I've been saying all along I Can't believe that they\nHave consistently pitched to Christian yell it's now the benefit is is that the guys behind you know which would be the benefactors in is that they would be seeing better pitchers with yellow John and yells you can steal basis don't pretty that's the other problem if you put him on he can steal a base so all of a sudden instead of just having a guide first with one or two or nobody out\nYou know you're looking at the possibility of having a runner in scoring position just off of the fact that he can still bases so that's the reason I think as some of the time they don't just put him on automatically because he becomes a runner and scoring position now it's\nSo the guy behind them if they want to set up a double play but [noise]\nUm because this team's been hitting well with runners in scoring position so far this postseason it's it's a double edged sword you know who you're gonna have beaches Christian yellow tj who can or the guys behind them if you set him up and put them on base to set the table for the guys back there\nEight five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero aids before your buddy bread and sturgeon bases ... percent confident the bird was going to win the world series or brewers are going to get to the world series I should say they're playing confident they're having fun I wouldn't be surprised\nIf the if the Dodgers I wouldn't be surprised with the Dodgers when you see as such buddy brat this one from Steve who says\nI'm looking at the brewery series against the Dodgers and thinking to myself just good game one and they're going to start rolling all over again I'm going to be biting my nails on friday night I'm going to be there or pay two hundred and fifty dollars a ticket looking forward to it go brewers\nEight five five eight three zero eight six point let's go to Tony listening to us in greenvale Tony how you doing today man which habit\nI felt was that it broke up\nUm I I think\nThe most important thing to me is I think is they have to get there and they're not going to be included they're all through the nothing\nUm I don't believe it's going to be like that I think for I think the games are going to be maybe just a little bit\nHigher scarring you know I Know there there are a everything was so good but there are three game series with Iraq but I mean doctors getting hit you know and I mean of course getting too but you got you got to get out I'm paying the call now you know you got one yet\nI think that was against the Rockies but even um\nEven even wrong got a little bit cold and you know what I mean they got it\nJust there's somebody on and they got to do with it and I mean that's how I look at it the the heat at me and all this going to be the skin and then they take care of themselves\nFeel pressure he drops off you're going to more than five five eighty three zero eight six for his father's runners and scoring position going to the post season the teams that are no longer in it Oakland Cleveland Colorado Atlanta Chicago\n\nOut of one through ten all of those teams did not hit with runners in scoring position their body one sixty seven or less\nThe only other team that was in the top five the New York Yankees they hit two hundred with hundreds of scoring position\nOne through five the Boston Red Sox they're hitting four hundred thirty five batch fourteen hits three doubles a triple a bomb Twenty one RBI nine walks for strike outs to stolen bases zero caught stealing always runners and scoring position Boston\nJust gets done Houston number two\nThirtieth ... eleven based knocks two doubles no triples one Homer Thirteen RBI so quite a bit less than the than the Boston Red Sox\nNow this is where it gets interesting the brewers at number three they're hitting two fifty six eighty one O P s now UPS or the Boston Red Sox one point one one eight the Astros one point zero three three\nThe Yankees point seven five the Dodgers point eight five one the brewers batting average with runners in scoring positions to fifty\nBut there will be asked is lower\nThrow PS is lower as far as the teams that are in the top five the team with the least amount of runs scored with runners in scoring position is the brewers\nThe brewers scored eight times thirty two at bat eight hits one double that's it six RBI eight walks twelve strike outs\nOut of the teams that are still remaining they by far the most strike outs\nThree stolen bases one caught stealing the or the Dodgers the Dodgers depleted Thirteen runs on twenty eight at bats pretty good ratio their their body one Seventy nine though with runners in scoring position but an eight fifty one O P s fourteen strike outs eight walks twelve RBI supposedly brewer six\nTwelve RBI three bombs\nThree bombs that they've had now for those runs or three of those runs came in at three ... three run bond that uh that uh I'm a child at the other day\nBut still the Dodgers fifth couple behind the Milwaukee Brewers brewers third best in teen batting average with runners in scoring position right now but the the lowest O P s of the teams remaining in the postseason paid five five eight three zero eight six for a real quick ... jump river orange river door\nOn our with our office on the line there you go what's happened and I know what

I Believe is click bait world\nYou know they are so centralized they literally only focus on stuff that will draw the attention and these networks are fighting for ratings so hard that\nYou know when I was a serious acts them for example we would do a segment on the brewers we do a segment on the raise weird do a segment on the Dodgers you know like we never we never did it and my question that I was always asking is\nAre you alienating the twenty nine other market wouldn't you wouldn't mind doing such a thing and I think that you know we have this play the hits mentality that's the nature of the media business because you know in the ... pm were on I'm going a little too inside but it\nIt it's all about clicks right and so the cubs the Yankees the red Sox the Dodgers were always the topics\nAnd now suddenly the brewers team is here in so many people not to blame but to their detriment having theme is seen as much as we have and you know I Will I Will be honest\nDo I fall into that trap about certain teams yes I slept on the Oakland A's the fear I slept on the Arizona Diamondbacks because I didn't have a lot to do for be either city but because of my relationship with you and with the station and with the city I have watched probably over fifty brewers games and ...\nAnd so I I'm not surprised by hater I'm not surprised by you know councils line up so I'm not surprised that they didn't have a starter like I'm not surprised by those things and I think that it's not that I'm Better than anybody it's just unless you've watched this team play you really don't understand it\nI said yeah you have two teams that are trying to race long curses I said that's not the health of a sport right\nSo I look I Want the brewers to win because I've been doing this for the wild things along that's my only skin and the game but the reality of it is is I Can't tell you that it is healthy for a sport so that the networks and the league is praying for big market teams to make a World Series so they can get some decent number\nThat's ridiculous and you know as far as ratings are concerned out in LA\nJames had a press conference that out drew a Dodger pennant race game\nTwo to one started well star power obviously have something to do with it as well and more at the stars and the bigger markets I get that but you got a a potential MBP sitting in Christian yellow is right here in Milwaukee and I just keep wondering how many people are gonna tune into secret and you know actually play\nIt's a great story but if people don't tune in for that that's not a statement on the brewers I think it's a statement on the sport\nThat'd be great in fact that it\nDoes that tell people outside you know I make that joke about my trout all the time remember I said to you know play come out of a a soundbite when you come out of a break with a random soundbite from my trout and give a T shirt to the first person that can recognize his voice mhm do that in any other city for Christian you'll\nAlways get my friend we appreciate it looking forward to the weekends you'll be fun\nThat's got to be a lot of fun I enjoy it Milwaukee be said have a great time and just no I Will be live tweeting the games\nThere you go what follows death ever that Jeff ever good stuff as always about doctors in there you go to our national base boys that are joining us for a couple of minutes on the shuttle launched honorary drivers right now you work hard to treat you fair eighty plus years they begin to get done column eight hundred and forty we're probably going to not have jobs dot com or you know Michael Joe next\n[noise] six stations strong might go\nBe probably prevents will Angelina [noise]\nOr will Angelina performing arts Wisconsin Rapids product overnight the Rolling Stone looked at very well Angelina as one of the new country artist you need to know [noise]\nHe's your tickets any time it seems to be our debt or recall Seventy five for twenty seven maybe we'll Angelina Wisconsin Rapids October Nineteen yard come human warming connection [noise]\nFootball's on TV I watch it\nWhen I'm watching there's only two things do get mad at my recliner and one of those the trip to the buffet table ours always includes grilled bras and hot dogs on village hard fun at halftime we bring on a huge platter cold cuts sandwiches made on country hearts multi grain bread right here in the mid west\nCountry heart the Billy charts bread and butter always fresh and delicious [noise]\nHey Chris on your phone again\nAre you trying to figure out those crazy soccer actually no I'm actually ...

pitching Stabenow aide Susan I kept saying they've been doing this all season long this is nothing new so you\nKnow is this just do you guys just looking at different is relievers just to say this is I says what we do I mean I I don't I don't know how to put my finger on it but you don't need Clinton courage to go out and get you eight innings consistently\nI mean honestly honestly let's just just break down the game of baseball I mean if you if you really really look at it on the started goes out there if he doesn't give you seven\nTo eight and a six to seven innings or whatever the case may be if he doesn't do that he'll get you to the fore and look at the rest of the game when they went it is this dominant out of the book fair so we're just we're just taking the game and make it simpler to\nWe had him to the power arms the mentality to go out there and get out as quick as possible as less pits as possible and get out of there and handed off to the next guy that just has been Amato

yes if you have a bad game you cannot wait to get to the ballpark the next day to be used 'cause you just want to go out and redeem yourself\nYeah because honestly I mean there's I mean it happens what every every player that those that have happened to have a bad game you know what he's done well and that's why we say look at the positives of what happened you know ... when when a situation that wasn't all you look at the positive because we want to get back out there and\nTo wreck basically what you know you've done wrong you know and I felt like the next day and I knew what I was taught my goal was among them up plan was in and out without executed and wanted to look very well and and you're right we do have to have short term just because\nThe memory if we try to keep we keep
