Aguilar with the bomb uh but but\nHe's a hot topic of the game I mean he scored a run yesterday three for for a left on base couple of times is six twenty five batting average in the postseason he's just been\nFun to watch and and the guy that you know when they were talking about retiring batters\nHe should be you know maybe I'm the guy that should be retiring you know I mean he's talking about his career he's self deprecating him he's just a fun guy to pay attention to and he hasn't won it yet so we're gonna get him to hot stick to the game brought you buy a forensic Clements\nClemens snack sticks you can take them anywhere put 'em in the backpacks put them in a gym bags put them in the er the kids' lunch boxes whatever it may be stick them in the console your car put them in your desk

win a year's supply of those things by the way you can also go to bill Michael sports dot com that's bill Michael's sports dot com and get yourself registered and now we draw weekly\nBitch there's something about this team is used to be rolling right now just big grinding this thing out and they're doing it by inning by inning and not gain by game and uh to to kind of pool and slow that momentum ah makes me a little bit nervous\nYeah the the bass got to get going no I was talking to Iran after the game and he thinks that night that he may may maybe they don't have a carry on but the\nOne thing is the ... the great you know they help to the Rockies to the two runs in the in the Rockies look very tired in the series they look very slow at the plate the bath looks slow and\nThey're run at the end of the season might have taken its toll murder the brewers on the other hand they despite the places they've gone to and they've clinched and are having to go to Chicago and then you know the two games that park last week and then they come here\nThey still look like a fresh team so there's something to be said about momentum in a series and an ad in the postseason Adam sports in general\nSo yeah yeah I Can't agree the other four days we'll see what happens in the mail they happened to lose on on friday I'm sure you know first question that the U.S media types all be asking is welded\nBefore they lay off or do you some harm or help the best the best the best way to pick me up if we're going to pinpoint one thing a and this has been a problem all season long left on base these ... these guys just strand island of guys\nOn base throughout the season so uh you know the four days off good ... maybe that regenerate the basketball because you're gonna have to hit if you play the Dodgers\nUm I I Would well both teams I mean pretty Freeman and company you're pretty good in Atlanta but I agree with you the Dodgers have the ability to put up some runs I was talking about ... inches a little bit earlier\nThe brewers right now as far as uh they're they're running to the post season goes if you look at the run differential\nThe brewers coming out of the national league which had the best record in the national league out of the three division winners have the least amount of run differential the Dodgers are plus one Ninety four the Braves are plus one or two in the ... plus Ninety five I mean you're right hitting with runners in scoring position as season hasn't been always a perfect for the Milwaukee Brewers\nBut look how many games there there have been this year bill where they got a one run lead in the fifth or sixth inning and we're just hanging on by our fingertips they can all boy here we go now it's all the pressures on the the relief court can hate or get out skin ... able to get ... get out\nYou know house burns going to do a real Jeffress closed and things out I mean they've been so dependent on apple pan in tight game that run deferential doesn't surprise me at all because you know I test tells me it's like every one of these games are dating back to the regular season from\nWhenever a has just been a grinder how the game\nHere's the thing to think about though with all the teams that were in the postseason issue the brewers are right behind Boston and Houston for hitting was runners in scoring position a Boston stupid they're eating three Seventy five with hundreds and scoring position in the Houston Astros were getting three thirty three but the brewers are heading to fifty\nAnd the Rockies early hitting point zero seven for show is bad as it's been their third best in baseball in the postseason right now which is just an oddity\nThat that that's a little alarming uh that that is that good um they they have had some budgets stock us and crafts at both come up with some some key hits but you know just look at the runs yesterday uh you got you got an RBI ground out this quarter run home run by a healer ah I'm\nI'm sort of ... said jeez yeah jazz bassist regular uh goes yard and you know as you are loves hitting at Coors Field\nAnd then you get the parents' fault of the wild pitch and then the the block their produce to more run they feel they manufacture a couple of runs with a scheme to win it if you think about it the ground ball past fall and the the bar so um they're the runners of scoring physician throughout the season it's just been\nAn issue it was bad 'cause the brewers actually when you go back to the regular season the two top two teams in the postseason Boston in Houston were number one number two in the regular season the brewers Twenty one they were twenty first ranked in a in a regular season hitting would runners and scoring position only hitting to forty six so no I ... I agree with you with the concerns are genuine\nYeah and and the thing about the scoring of runners and square position you know we could say in baseball it's a little different from other sports were you know what can you do if these guys if he if you don't hit with Reuters and scoring position if you know the other guy and the other team is trying to get you out too so\nIf you if you can't hit with runners this great position that's just a it's a bad number and there's nothing you can do to correct it but actually do it for work\nRight hey uh give me your thoughts on his pitching staff or is there any concerns at all because he had to okay outings in one rough outing a sandwich ten is there any concern it all by Germany Jefferson your part\n[laughter] you know I I had some concerns when he didn't pitch in that ... I was like what's going on here yeah and then he had the rough outing on Thursday night and the first came back and won and then you know they they got him out of it they don't waste any time yesterday\nUh they did not waste any time we have six friendly with a closer I'm I'm Out\nHe he walked the guy gave a double and they got him out of there and they got a heater in that game to see the shots and there was a lefty coming up the flight to but\nI don't know that the that maybe they don't have as much confidence in ... as they once did because throughout the season and Jeffrey's has talked about it that he's had a that he can sense that counseled federal a great deal of confidence in him but\nI don't know in the last week something isn't quite All right I don't know what am I Can't put my finger on that I don't know what it is I don't want to speculate\nWill remember he pitched extremely well against St Louis closest things out they have the celebration he's not available all of a sudden against the cubs the next day\nAnd we we didn't know why I'm you know I mean he knew he wasn't available to do the show\nAre here in Milwaukee and he did not have a good outing\nFollowing that the first game against a as a matter of fact in trying to close things out in the ninth inning against Colorado Rockies game to he looked really good and he thought okay it was a blip and then last night again\nNot the best to command or the fastball wasn't nearly what it was didn't have as much break on it now nothing usually does up in Colorado but still it wasn't a great outing for him and just kind of wander 'cause they're relying on him I mean\nYou know I I've recorded I recorded Jeremy Jeffers Josh catering according to the nasty boys that I grew up in with his back in Nineteen Ninety they'd beat the Oakland A's and the world series with the Cincinnati Reds I mean\nThose guys were just dynamite when they finally made it to the hill it was game over and that's what it's been so hard the season for these guys so they don't have Jeremy Jeffers really throwing the ball which may be this for game or these four day rest might do him the most most good so to speak but they need him\nOh they do and they need everybody else because they're starting rotation is it NO NAME starting rotation yet when my weight and violence and\nWhat about the credit that guy goes he pitched into the fifth inning whereas maybe five years ago were saying oh God I take the fifth I think that's it you couldn't get more out of him\nBut this is where baseball's going right now where if you get four or five innings out of your starting pitcher especially this time of the season that's a good thing wait you know give free HIV kind of out of there in the fifth inning when the going was good and you'll take that you'll take that old dog effort so while it's just how\nHow funny baseball has changed here and the brewers have been a big part of the reasons why things have changed they're no longer starting pitchers or middle relievers or closer there were just simply ... according to cast of characters\nAlways good to enjoy the smoke shops out there in Colorado Chuck it we'll see you back here when you get home okay All right bill\nI buy duck is a better go jet Freeman Schneider orange ...

Ryan Braun giving this speech they're talking about the speech they gave going all the way back to spring training and uh Joe you and I were there at spring training there was\nUm it was a different level of optimism\nThat I had felt in a long time I guess might be the best way to put it it was I'm Travis Josh said it best she said you know there wasn't a lot of change\nIn the off season and he said it was kind of like coming back to a family was like a family reunion he said this was our family but we were gone for a few months but now we're all back and we haven't skip the beat and at that point in time I kept thinking to myself is this going to be the conversation I look back to and say okay\nI I there was that the the foreshadowing was there for what was about to happen now granted there's new pieces that are added shock as you said at Granderson is at it I mean you start to look scope is that you go through the list of guys that they picked up since then but\nUh the nucleus has remained the same\nAnd I keep thinking to myself what was indicative of this team that that I Would have said okay I could see this coming and that might have been more so than anything [noise]\nUm that might have been the conversation I think that might have said I had a brief conversation\nThat he said it was this was one of those years he enjoyed coming back to work not that I didn't in the passage just that he couldn't look he couldn't he was looking he couldn't wait to get back he was looking forward to getting back to baseball\nFor other years we're kind of your rehabbing you're grinding and you had you know hand issues and some issues and cryogenic and suspensions and and media scrutiny and everything so he said this was a year they just look forward to come back\nBut I also thought to being in that clubhouse in Arizona it was very loose was very enthusiastic\nWhen the deals went down for Kaine and yell at each I remember ... so many brewers on Twitter worth just went crazy over that I mean they they made it perfectly known that this is awesome\nSo when it carried over into spring training you know that's all everyone wanted to talk about was Canaan yellow and what these guys are going to bring to the table and you know based on how well these guys didn't you know last season at how they proved a lotta people wrong to win as many games they didn't come just close\nNow all of a sudden you take Cain and yell at the end of the equation and you think man where we are going to do some bigger things this year and our goal is the postseason that that that is there for the taking we know we can do it\nAnd it was it the only guy he's the only guy that we remember had a chip on their shoulder and was pretty upset was key on ... because that was a guy that was trying to fight for a job last year you know he had the twenty twenty season struck out a ton\nAnd his job basically he got kicked out of the way for the other two guys\nAnd so key on ... and had to really find\nHis way with this team and you saw it midway through the year he was making a couple of clutch defensive plays when he got his chance when there were some injuries that can yell at you\nAnd then here we are key on Braxton fast forward\nTo last night he did a home run\nYou know not only does he make the twenty five man roster print the fence and his speed he hits a home run mhm\nThat had to feel pretty good for a guy like key on ... and um so I kind of went on a little bit of a diatribe there about key on but you know that that was the only guy that I remember in the clubhouse that was you know upset like Vietnam really upset about his situation but beyond that the rest of the clubhouse\nThe attitude at the expectations it was all there and they were they were set for it they were hungry for it and my goodness they just they pulled through they pulled through I I just I Am so proud of this team they continue to ... you you you think to yourself\nA couple of months ago you think that they're not they're not a World Series caliber team but they're a team that you know they should be able to get get to the post season they certainly have enough\nBut now they want to live in straight games\nThat they're unstoppable they're making a little too easy they only allowed to runs in the entire series twenty seven twenty eight innings were scoreless that\nThis team can win the world series I'm not going to make a prediction and say they will win the world series but they can win the world series they can go toe to toe with anyone in the in the in the American league because you know what they always say you can't script October\nSo was that team this hot as the Milwaukee Brewers why can't they beat a team like right then why can't they beat it seemed like New York well statistically speaking\nI mean when you look at these teams we were talking about it earlier I mean a ... you know Boston has been one of the top teams in baseball I mean you know all the way through and through Houston and the same thing one of the top teams in baseball\nI was talking before about strike out the Dodgers they're a team of strikes out fourteen hundred and thirty six times on the season eighth best or a worst in baseball I should say sevens worst the Milwaukee Brewers\nFourteen hundred and fifty eight times this team struck out a now when it comes to scoring runs obviously the the run differential doesn't even compare when I'm Talking about like the Boston Red Sox and such but\nUh when you look at the say the O P s\nA seven Seventy four O P s as a team for the Dodgers seven forty seven for the Milwaukee Brewers slugging percentage just a little bit off these two teams are very close to when you're talking about on base percentage the Dodgers three thirty three versus three twenty three for the brewers team average though for the Milwaukee Brewers better than the Dodgers two fifty two verses two fifty\nDance of rice is threatening college

sandwiches do Michael sports dark network\nJust think about it put it in the back of your mind a five five eight three zero eight six for a wire bra and the question was posed to me and I I thought about this last night and the more vocal Ryan Braun has been I thought ah you know I'll just ask brewers fan I mean I've got my opinion\nUm and I wanted to ask your opinion but a buddy of mine asked me I was driving home last night he said you know his everybody pretty much were given Ryan Braun is that now just all in the past because he knows I mean he hears when\nYou know the brewers going to Chicago or something or even when they're in Cincinnati St Louis more so than anything but where he gets ... you know and it's it's just going to happen but um you know is it already passed that pretty much now\nAnd just thought I'd take the pulse now let me give you a quick I'm like I said\nWhen all this happened in the last you know\nSix years prior to the last couple of years I was as hard as anybody um\nBut the ... the different experience not me personally but let me give you a little background my son a working its way through college worked at a restaurant okay and so we're on the east side of town over near where Ryan and a bunch of the brewers live\nAnd my son had kind of got no rhyme brought a little bit served more than a few times and kind of became his guy okay\nRyan Braun and his wife and and such and friends when when they would come to town always would come in and asked for him always had a kind word to them and always I mean I think Ryan Braun put myself through college I'm always chipped I'm really really well thank them polite\nMy son never was never it believe it or not he's not the sports geek he think certain things are cool but he's not a sports he just thought it was really cool that he was kind of this\nAs outside fringe friend of Ryan Braun and uh\nYou know so I I'd seen Ryan and uh in spring training and I said you know my son wanted me to pass a law which I told told my son at the time don't ever tell them your dad as you know because I was hard on Ron I never would want that to carry over into that relationship [noise]\nUm but I told her I and I said you know hey my son but no longer working at the restaurant you are you kidding me I said no I said he went into the military and him and I sat down he had\nProbably twenty questions\nAbout my son how's he doing why do you do it what field as you want to go into that's great what does he aspire to be you know he talked about all these different things\nAnd it was it was probably a a ten Fifteen minute conversation and that the very end he said you make sure you telling me I respect the hell out of what he's doing you know good for him I Hope to see him again real soon you know and I'll I'll tell them myself but you know it it just it was one of those conversations where you knew he was in ... you know what I mean\nBecause he knew too many details about my son from talking to my son over the years and being genuine\nAnd some times you get outside of the sports bubble and you get somebody outside of that area and you say okay let me step back from this for a minute um but it it was just a really cool conversation about a guy that genuinely gave a damn about somebody um because the thought process was that he never did\nSteps along the way and now like I said I've been is critical was anybody but it's it's a dead point in time when you start to hear things are more for my son than it is specifically for my brother you start to step back and go okay wait a minute let me let me kind of recess or my thought process here [noise] um so anyway it was really cool and a dad moment in time I said you know what\nEverything's in the past you know move on move on it's been a hell of a season it's been a hell of a ride it's been a lot of fun and so that's my perspective so maybe it's tainted a little bit\nBecause he treated my kid really really well and and that means a lot because I Know there's always people that say you know we didn't get my kid an autograph ... by the way speaking of that um when share you know I\nTook the kids this past year to spring training or eastern went to work with me in the morning so I you know we started doing the show Joe at at eight am Phoenix time\nAnd there aren't any fans in the ballpark at that point in time so my son my steps on eastern ran down the first base line where the brewers would come out he just loves to run the ballpark I mean what kid at that age at ten years old\nDad's up in the press box doing a radio broadcast in the meantime he just gets to run he just gets to run the stadium he gets to run the shares he got to go down in the fields in the dugout and you know and then here comes the players and you got to get off the field I don't know maybe the third day of this\nFinally Ryan Braun comes outsourced tossing ball with him he was down the field but between the edge cedar and Ryan Braun getting getting a chance to toss ball a little bit it's just\nIt's just cool you get a chance to see other things but it's not always guys being jerks you know we're hearing all the horror stories so anyway\nA little bit different perspective when it comes to when it comes to end by the way when it came to my son ah eastern standing down in the first baseline they none of them knew who he was or who his dad was wasn't like they thought okay it's bills kid who's builds up in the broadcast but none of that he had no idea he was just a young kid was standing on this on on\nIn the stands there just waving the guys and they came over and you had like twelve balls swelled baseballs that he got out of it that whole week they're all sit still in his head board\nOf his bed he just thinks that the coolest thing ever [noise]\nUh he's already bugging me dad when we're going back and we're going back and we're going back when we got to go back when we go back to spring training when we go on a sprinter I wanted to go I was going to ask you the same thing when I had a I think we're going to be a ... in spring training of the week of march eleventh okay uh the barrage of a

I've ever met on the Milwaukee Brewers\nOkay so he's saying that are calling in Grand Rapids where are you going to a World Series baby\nThere you go to Mike He drops off you get on board holy mackerel he's all fired up\n[laughter]\n[noise] he's all fired up eight five eight three zero eight six four eighty five five eight three zero eight six for eight if you want to give us a shout by all

five five eight three\nZero eight six foreign oh let's do this let's get back to the phone calls and those two a day even tells a day walking in the program I can show was going on now\nBill thanks for taking my call man uh I'm In the same\nFlag and as you are where I'm I'm past it I Wish her fans would would get past it but I I'm not going to tell anybody what their opinion should be uh like the last guy I Lived there are so close to the world series and if they are going to win the world series\nThey're going to need Ryan Ron they're going to need Ryan Ron them play like you have lying\nOr they're going to need him to lead I think leaders meet in different ways I think you guys like yell at low Cain who stock and\nThey lead with her play on the field they don't say a whole lot but Ron is more maybe more of a leader and the climb out I have been great role and I think than embrace Ryan Braun for taking on this\nRole I I think they do I think they do yeah second chance sure\nI Know I I I think they do appreciate the phone call I I I think they do I think a majority I I'd say probably eighty to Ninety percent of fans\nHave said you know I go for it you know no big deal you know it's it's it's in the past that is what it is and kudos to a lot of those people it was just like I said it was a question it came up I thought you know what good topic for the show I'll just ask the question and\nIt inspires a lot of passion because right now people are like don't throw a monkey wrench in anything\nAnd like I said there's a lot of good stories out there people are now sending me all kinds of pictures of their kids were brawn people were sending me pictures of them were brawn\nSaying he's a he's a different guy he's a likeable guy he's and then you know what it's more of a love fish to for Ryan Braun right now more so than anything I think if there is any ill will it is a very ... will say outspoken\nMinority in probably the smallest sense of the word\nUm it it just is it just is but\nThere are people that you don't and and it's not that I don't\nI I disagree with images that I respect their opinion\nThere are some people just felt whatever but it's just like I said it's one of those things that I think a lot of winning a lot of things that have gone on a lot of things that have been said a lot of what you've had a chance to see even witness behind closed doors a lot of the not just from Ryan Braun a lot of his teammates speak out on his behalf\nUm I think a lot of what has happened is is well well well in the past eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight oh let's go to a Scott listening to what you want what does this kind of how you doing it and it was going on\nHey unit thanks for taking my call some of the stuff my summer done it too and I think you're right\nYou know this is a great topic I just find it and I apologize if ah I got into this life but um if somebody else made this point but the the hypocrisy of some of these cities that that blue Ryan Braun you think of a St Louis where you know mark Maguire admitted steroid user\nJohnny Peralta admitted steroid user and he was caught Chicago Cubs they've got Addison Russell who you know has the domestic uh assault\nAgainst his girlfriend in a life that you know ... or all this trap man who helped them with a World Series who has similar circumstances which which I think we'd all agree is much worse than pd use there is no doubt what Ryan did the way he handled that\nEverybody has a bad game that happens it's part of life got to deal with it the problem is they shouldn't have been in that situation but they don't they they have got to figure out how to play football inside the Twenty one and there's no reason for them to ... march that kicked her out there that off and then also look at look at the office to look at the kicker\nI posted yesterday that I think it's Eighteen times inside their opponents thirty six they walked around I think it's a walked away with I ate touchdowns nine field goals for Mr field goals and one turnover on downs\nA now inside the twenty the numbers are percentage wise about the same it they're they're moving the football and racking up garbage\nBut they're not putting the ball consistently into the end zone and I don't know if the play calls are changing I mean granted the decor bow used to say let them get inside the twenty and that's where we are going to play our best defense but\nI don't I don't know what to make of all of this right now I just know that consistently trying to put the ball in the end zone is not the easiest things for this team right now\nIt's a it's kind of blood out real simple pure personnel guy and you're looking at this ... on the office of sites\nInside the twenty yard line they don't have the players to be able to be consistent and scored consistently touchdowns they just don't everybody thought including yours truly thought that human ground was going to be the answer\nTo years are all be reached for tighter and missed and just the facts he's not explosive iPads to ask you dropped to touchdown passes yesterday ... one went through his hands the other one he's not he was an athletic enough to make a play on the football\nThat there you go and do you don't have much else for especially yesterday there wasn't much else\nBesides there aren't a Adams he's a possession receiver that's real reality they don't have a bruising running back they don't have dared bought that compound up you can give the ball twice inside the five year I might have pounded and they don't have that guy they they they're struck they don't have enough weapons offhand solely yes they\nHave some young guys you know I think you look at St brown and if you look at a and the best those are some guys to look at and say hey we can get some up with some mileage out of these guys not at least five they might not be till we five but next year but that I think if you keep putting those guys out there they're going to start\nGetting better and learning how to create space and those things are going to happen and they're going to get better but as of today after week five they don't have the weapons to score consistently but other than a field goal\nAnd now here's the other question is and I know they continually said that oh no Aaron Jones he's a he's a three down back he can be out there on and on and on\nAnd yet yesterday marry a carry until late in the game and the second half when he finally got his hands on the football\nUm they don't have men there so either they're lying and just basically saying look we trust him to run the football but in combat situations even though he's the most dynamic running back we have we don't trust him to pass walking and we were not the only thing I can consider but otherwise why would you not have one of your better weapons on the field\nWill\nExperience tells me that there's something missing 'em I mean I used to get asked that question all the time all crew so and so is it on the field you know we put them in the field and put her down an age when we knew it was going to be passing play because that's really the only thing that you can do is pass rush\nI'm not saying that about ... I'm just saying\nI don't think that there was that coaching staff is is completely\nI'm choosing my words nicely here ... ... ... ... [noise] to say that all of us see that he's the most explosive person now their football team are off as a and they don't see I I don't think that's the case I I don't think you know those guys I I've been around for a longer than most of us\nSo there's gotta be something that maybe maybe he can't think if only around certain place at a certain formation is I I don't know what the answer is because that's where I'm grasping at because\nOtherwise you would think he would try to feed this guy the ball ten Fifteen twenty times maybe not twenty might be a little bit too much the between Fifteen and twenty a game\nAnd they're not so for why I mean the question probably needs to be asked why not\nYou know of course they realize you not to be in the game and he got getting of all these situations but really why\nAm I a in it was clear yesterday as far as running backs go he was\nBy far the better running baggage just look at the numbers and you just kind of get it through the eyeball test and you can clearly see that he had something going on defensively speaking I Know people came down hard on the defense but\nDefensively speaking they were putting some tough situations yesterday and you can only go to that so often before eventually your deepest is going to crack I'm not saying they were taught by a decent defence but you can't put a top Fifteen defense\nInto that position and say oh by the way go hold them consistently\nCall yeah you know they had to shut the hell here you go first encounter one yard line pretty tough deal after forcing upon that that's that's tough you know and then that the other phone bill to that was a tough one um yeah so you know the the team the defense just set up\nTo be able to play from my head defense um but that's just\nThe way it is out next year year after it's there probably is going to change I Am very very excited about the young secondary right now [noise] and then let me ... everybody says oh John you know if it were I'm here today Jess Jackson has been for the\n... the harder you know what he stumbled a little bit on at and made a mistake but here's the best part about he was laying flat on his face and he got up and went and finished made to tackle\nSaving a touchdown now they've got to touch down a couple of plays later who cares [laughter]\nThat's a football player that's a kid that I Want to my football team because he doesn't give up he doesn't laid on how many guys would lay there and post\nHe stood up and got back into play ... and you know how could they actually got demolished on the air and the uh the stiff arm and he got up there and made the ... that's that's great football in the first play the game he natural and I'll play in the end zone against ... away\nThe way that he plays junior Alexandria and I think I think I think that um\nThe twenty he got he got a little bit of a bum wraps it from the media a little bit too I don't think he played that care about that one touchdown pass in the end though that wasn't his fault that would ... they're in their in quarters don't so there's four defensive backs covering one fourth of the field for some crazy reason Clinton excellent running to the sideline and vacated his own and\nThat's where the touchdown got thrown you also I think twenty is good I think he's going to be even better um and coming up here I think he got to work through some some of the injuries are but but I Am really excited about that secondary and it could be some as a seat at progress as it should progress getting better\nNow here's a here's the million dollar question and I said I tweeted this out early they look I there's a lot of football after playing God Knows we've heard or ... you know all the other things have gone along with it and I think we can run the table and I don't know what the issues you know it was saying is going to be\nBut they better do something quick otherwise we might be looking at the beginning of the end of Mike mccarthy all the other voices have changed inside the locker room except for the head coach I don't know they gave them a one year contract extension they didn't show a ton of faith\nI had the sense that if this thing goes said to you know nine six in one or something like that I'm either they're on the outside looking in or they don't get deep in the postseason we can be talking about ahead coaching change if things don't change quickly do you see the same thing\nI mean nobody cultures ...\nUntil they die one place it's just at some point in time we made a different voice you need a different path you need a different direction it's not uncommon in any business situation that we're\nCEO is only there for a certain period of time not always but most of the time there's changes the same thing here football you guys are here at the same voice for a number of years um\nThere's there's no real rift between a Rogers and at him and you know what you know it it might be at a time you know what the the the wealthy what happened you know I think if they don't make the playoffs I think I think obviously we're probably going to be\nUh going through your head coach from ... search in January and that's okay it's not bad doesn't mean that that that\nMcCarthy the bad person or anything like that it's just\nSometimes you know everything very good thing comes to an ad\nGood show as always we'll try to get later in the week and we'll see uh what do you what what the emotions and the words are coming out of twelve sixty five hours a week progress appreciate about we'll talk to you soon
