Bronner staffer Katie or Westbrook or I mean he's he's not dead guy he's a good player really good player above average player but I don't know how they use that guy\nTake on the Minnesota timber wolves and then they have the Orlando Magic coming to town on Saturday\nCan the bucks get through the weekend undefeated still\nYou still can the bucks in the bucks continue to roll on I mean they're they're getting it done measures are and it's it's been fun to watch so can the bucks continue this this this pace that they've been on\nYou know they they beat up a pretty good Indiana Pacers team they hung in there with Charlotte then they uh\nYou know the next came storming back then the bucks were up by Nineteen at one point and asking storming back to tie that ball game up before the bucks finally pulled way in the very end and then a very good Seventy Sixers team comes to town\nAnd you're thinking okay this this is where you're really gonna get the test and it wasn't a much of a task they beat 'em one twenty three one oh wait you're honest goes off gets a triple double then you've got Minnesota you got to Orlando then you get the test\nOn Monday Night you get the test on Monday Night and that is the Toronto Raptors\nAt the Pfizer for them and then by the way the boxer on the road tonight in at the target center tomorrow they're back home at the Pfizer forum\nSo they got to go on the road which makes too if they get the win tonight it makes tomorrow night's game but it's always on the road to come back home and play the next night a little bit tougher it just dies\nYou have a little bit a less you know we hit you in your daily up so to speak but then they've got it the Pfizer forum on Monday the Toronto Raptors come to town that's a big when you get Toronto and Boston back to back\nYou're really going to find out who you are in the next four games no doubt but his Minnesota things pretty pesky ivy Jimmy Butler's just gone off the rails a little bit has any I mean like I said good player\nI I wouldn't call them great is is is Jimmy Butler on his way to hall of fame career\nYou know that's what I determine greatness the bronze great staff great you're honest me he's going to be great\nHe's already considered great he's got to sustain but he's already considered great one of the top players Kevin ... great Westbrook great you can go through the list but Jimmy bottlers great when it comes to psychotic at times I think\nHow much he he reveals himself I bet he's the guy looked at me because I Can't believe I'm with me [laughter]\n[noise] so that Minnesota coming up the tables and then they have the Orlando Magic eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight or you ... bucks basketball\nWe just did just a general question for those that may be casually looking over the fence that last year maybe they maybe we're sitting there going you know what I'm I was I was a casual fan and then when the bucks went to the post season I kinda got into it\nAnd I'm looking at this team thinking to myself okay can they can they get a win looking over the fence I'm enjoying it you know\nMaybe I can get into that\nIs that where you're at right now or are you still saying no not going to become a believer until they win a first round playoff series and then when they do that I'm going to become a fat\nOr maybe you're all in any way eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight\nBy the way the rockets again making another offer a for butler\nThe rockets are offering what is it for a first round draft choices some kind of crazy number like that ... the rockets including for future first round draft choices and the most recent offer to get timber wolves all start Jimmy Butler\nI\nThat I then again first round draft choices in the NBA unless you're guaranteed all abroad or something or they don't mean a whole lot\nBut Jimmy Butler as well and they feel he's worth maybe if they get Jimmy ... he is that piece that can take them over the top but he's also that piece in my opinion that can make them implode because he is a he's a giant enormous ego head case right now yeah mixing it with some of the other guys the dam and Houston yeah [laughter]\nI mean 'cause he's not going to be the guy\nYou know are they are now Jimmy are kind of wants to be the guy that's what I'm saying\nBut the problem is with with with the ... and see if those two sees that the Packers they're feeling back there they have a tendency to make a lot of mental mistakes and\nTake a look at in the backfield too often\nYeah and this type of Mr extra plants are passing plant jerk off is awesome I pledge to pass\nIt through a really good job on the on the ... with the office of rhyme and making it look like it's going to be a run with and then all of a sudden it's past and you see these are heels ... having turned around and the balls on here so [noise] um\nIt you know the keys or I get I think they got to have to move to ... or they're happier in Rogers out of the pocket they gotta get thirty three in the in the game and then they have to be very good at the safety level\n[noise] I'm going back to a Aaron Donald a Ninety nine and you're talking about the middle linebacker was it a ... ... ... one of his name is a bulls guys very good if you're blocking or double teaming Aaron Donald\nHe opens up the gap for your line backers to shoot or if you're double teaming him and crashing down\nYou can comes around the outside and crushes you eat it just it is work so well and then you've got Michael blockers on the other side of the guy that you can't just all of a sudden I pay attention to even though he's six years in the league I mean he's\n... he's a big boy you gotta you gotta pay attention to him and oh by the way the guy is coming up the guts endemic ensue they've got a lot of ability to bring it from anywhere on the field because of what they do in the trenches\nFor sure and they move they move those guys around I mean you see on down those employee spot here but he's not step and one one spot and that and you can adjust for philanthropy outs at less and I and rights group circled the I mean it out but you know and and\nSo if you're going to double team him\nNow you're telling me you got sewer single you're not going to double team him one of the worst you don't have at some point you don't have enough block\nI don't smoke and it's like I think they're going to have to move\nA quarter back around a little bit if it were my on offense I'm running the thing I Would run right I I was up till now your stomach and say we're going to run one or two running plays wherever it Ninety nine years for going around the block at all\nUm and then I then I Would roll out\nAway from him in a split passport to get him so that his that tongue hanging from the middle of the second floor and\nYou can start playing some more football but I I I think that front for is really scary and then in showing the couple of factors there it's it's it's gonna be a tough sledding and became you know if you look in your ... going up against bell or the train wherever they roll out there\nIt's gonna be interesting I think they're going to have to establish the run and gave a lot of early age I'm ... and I think even if they get down by a touchdown they still have to run the plot otherwise you know you may not get out of there with a quarterback\nWhat do you think about John Jones right now playing him over control Bryce who's not played well specifically deep over the top\n[noise] well I'm not so sure the cerebral part of the game as he's will ... strength is certainly fast enough and he can run a any any athletic changed directions at all that kind of stuff like with\nMy guess is the reason why he's not playing as much is is that the cerebral part of the game he says is maybe is lacking [noise] um I haven't talked to anybody to have to find oh for sure but that's what that's what you got to kind of figure at this point is there something they're missing and it's probably upstairs\nDoes control Bryce have enough physically to be able to play that a strong safety losing\n... he he tested out off the charts it and he was very very good uh coming out of college the reason why you didn't get a big time scholarship was because he was\nGrades I mean really bad grades so um that's one of the challenges you have with him there this is again the cerebral apart but he's he's very physically gifted ... he's got all the short\nShorts a motion motion stuff he can do all of that um again you know it's just something is not something I can learn for Twenty years ago parents but some of you know to some of these ... can operate on the same people ... or ... ... is not as physically gifted is is price\nOn but I think playing ... center fielder playing him to eat or I don't think that's where his Strauss that's awfully\nEarly in his Peru I'm with the Packers or that and I think I still think so to me and he stood her up along the ... a closer to ... play centerfield\nSee I Do too and when you lost Morgan burnout you lost the brains of the operation in my opinion\nOh absolutely you know the real the real tragedy happened towels oh there's oh God yeah the injury a couple of years ago that guy was phenomenal as fast you hit it on he was um you know so say they've really been reeling there since Trump sign on I think he thought it was with a quick fix was like you know\nI mean the way that he's biting normal or some of these I mean I think you're right I think that was it was the plans of the operation and he's no longer there\nI'm In ... let's do this a real quick Arab branch of the Green Bay press Gazette joining us on the Schneider orange I like going back to college\nWe have a chance to talk to him a couple of weeks ago prior to the game and again San Francisco it you know he was on his way to all of a career if you look at these numbers in the advancement of where he was ... as opposed to other safety that were out there um he he would he could have ended up in the hall of fame with the way he was going\nOh you know it's funny because you weren't number thirty six right right [noise] member who's rookie year and I'm sitting there like the fact that\nThe guy right there is better than the guy that used to wear number thirty six crazy you know whatever we told him you know they like they ... they think you're nuts mhm like watch this guy move so not only that but he closest to the school of law running game and he grew up in ...\nWhich we can slow recovery fantastic football players just super guy but he didn't have the flat out speed and he'll tell you that that that that the college that all aside speech for as\nSmart as he was a play on ... uh own little guy and and you know those guys are ... you're not you don't find those guys very often you know the ... one the one driving on a new one you know who to try and hurt feelings and on athletic guy and that's Iran has you know those\nThe last one that they had probably was chocolates in\nArizona critical come around very often we write that really gifted Trump I gather either one of the other\nMy I always say that that you know look at the get here physically you have to be fantastic because you probably beating\nEighty to Ninety percent of the people in college that you're facing which gets you recognize so your physical abilities going to get you here's what's between years once you get here that it's going to distinguish whether or not you're going to be a great player or just another player in the national football league in a lot of guys call it by the wayside\nBaking bench to twenty five twenty times and they can run for for forty but if they're idiots upstairs and they're not going to be anything more than a a a piece of eating the commodity and going to be out of the league very shortly so no I get where you're coming from so often simply speaking his first time you've got everybody together you're all kinds of lines to gather you're running games together\nA Jimmy grams coming back and easy for me is not as painful and not as problematic after a couple of weeks off Aaron Rodgers getting ready to get rid of the bracing what do you expect out of his office now that it's supposedly ready to fly\nBall will be interesting that's what I think I I don't know\n[noise] I don't know I I I really thought that Jimmy Graham was going to add that missing an American you know it's quite down on paper black and white that I don't think that's the case and a lot of good I liked that his his physical skills are too far depleted\nUm now he's thirty two years old you know it's not through my gas it just doesn't go as well as he used to it and that's a problem with uh the defenses nowadays are so fast\nThe bathrooms are two hundred and fifty pounds slugs anymore to thirty two twenty five guys that come on and so it makes things a little bit more difficult but you know he still has to hide the co-op get it I really like to see him start making some place down the middle of the field or not the little ouch you know what I'm Talking twenty Fifteen twenty yards down the field\nBetween the ... making plays what the topic I thought what the what I Would really like to see the other thing I'd like really like to see how it's being able to take you know you look at your fast and he's on the receiving corps problem in the U.S\nJust wrote him run him deep and as soon as soon as the safety lays off and comes up on the run against his will hit him you know so some of those things I I Would like to see some work do you pass the brown which um I understand that that's kind of a charge at the Sistine of harsh but\nThere has to be similar to the other thing now that you've got a ... the ... passing things should be there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Wisconsin Rapids",
