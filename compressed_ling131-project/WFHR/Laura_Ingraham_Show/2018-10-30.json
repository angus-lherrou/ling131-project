reaction from that last night because there were some people that got it and understood it other people that say why he didn't ask the hard questions well what what what did you want me to ask that he didn't answer and the opening statement\nAh didn't didn't understand that I mean he addressed everything he addressed white brought the ball out he addressed the quotes tantrum on the sideline he addressed the comments from his teammates he addressed um\nThe discussion with Mike mccarthy short of reviewing everything in the meeting he discussed that\nUm he he he discussed or why he didn't talk to the media afterwards um which uh we we don't you know we don't ah we don't necessarily agree with but you understand players will tell you that\nTalk they just don't want to talk at that moment because they don't want to say something stupid\nAnd as much as that gets under my skin and as a media member because we just want something you know we want to hear something guy you know but I get it because if you're if you're pissed off at that point in time and you say something stupid\nIt's only going to get worse you're going to exacerbate the situation he knew the situation somewhat leaving the coliseum\nOr I don't think he realized the the intensity of the situation until he said he woke up the next day in his phone was lit up by people saying hey you can come stay with us because there's a a handful of idiots out there that think it's cool to attack\nAs far as family and his wife and kids and that's got loose in terrible and you cannot call yourself a Packers fan if

talk network now last night on the logical of kickoff program\nUh we had a really you could hear a pin drop in that place when a China gum or gives opening statement he talks about everything from the from the kick return the fumbled the quote tantrum\nEverything on down the road\nWhat bothered him the discussion with Mike mccarthy everything a little bit long but this was the opening of the show last night when I sat down and just kind of opened it all up to take a listen\nAre trying to make a brief um I spoke with the media earlier today\nAt a conversational coastal cars the big question was was even bring the ball out and keep asking me that question is if the ball was a ... the um\nUm you know I've also been a part of the two minute office where we went down to score and I'm sure you guys remember last Monday Night game um I Know if it's not the best ... office and the game was one of the best two minute to minute officers in the game\nWho is the best quarterback planet the game right now I'm two minutes with the whole time outlet we don't need very much time anyway somewhere where a situation\nI'm I'm also well aware of\nUm with the kicker was doing a\nFew guys pay attention to the game when he didn't want me to return to both he kicked the ball out of the end zone where he ... he kicked the high kick and I think it was intentional he wanted to land on the goal line um you know that's what makes the most sense and ... and going deep out of the end zone\nAnd um you know I'm I'm I'm a split second decision where I talked to cause the carpet about it and he understands it um you know he he told me how he would like me to handle it moving forward um but rather they catch the ball\nLook and see where I Am on the field and you know take a chance had been at the goal line or at the half yard line and then now I'm Still going to return the ball and you know if I don't follow the ball remember what the ten to twelve yard line and um\nSo I bought that high hang time and it was dropping down around the goal line I took a step back and say well I'm trying to get a running start on this and get as much as I can and get down I definitely don't want to catch this and not be moving forward and the ball you know like I said half your deep or your deep and um\nYou know I think if I fall when the phone with a ball we wouldn't be talking about this um [noise]\nYou know there was a lot of things that um that there was a lot of things that\nThat went wrong in that game and you know I'm definitely a full aware of what happened I take full responsibility for fumbling the football um you know I don't I don't ever second guess decisions on game day um you know 'cause when you're thinking you're play a slow and you know you can't play slow in his yeah\nUm\nYou know then there's the you know you are you know avoid the media um I don't ever or my problems I never have um you can ask my wife she asked me if I'm able to do this you guys talk to the meeting my wife asked me if she looks fat weren't address I say you want me to lie you want me to tell the truth [laughter]\nAnd I tell her because I don't know kind of person that um I Would rather take the truth meant somebody spare my feelings to only find out later that I was walking around with the wrong mindset so I've never run for my problems I wasn't avoiding the media I walked out um\nOh by followed me except for one guy one guy said he gave me the opposite and he said hey why you know understand what's going on um do you want to do this now or um we can wait and do it tomorrow and I said I present you for asking me that um if you don't mind let's just do it tomorrow I thank you for asking you that and that's why we did it today\nUm you know then I wake up this morning first about any sleep I got home um I really haven't eaten anything um well I really didn't eat anything until\nProbably would have been piling immediately following the game I didn't I didn't sleep until uh [noise]\nHow close my eyes about seven am I woke up about nine AM came and went through my day and I finally a softer and your eyes of the day was over around for or whatever it was [noise] um but you know I I was up at nine o'clock and phones going off in the world is happening like what could I have done [laughter]\nFrom in front of the playwright until now um and then I see this anonymous teammate making this comment\nUm and the conversation is shifting from a bad decision to a question of character a\nAnd you know honestly that that's what hurt me more than\nFumbling the ball a [noise] yeah I don't like my question I don't like my characters who requested by any means especially from someone you're supposed to be on the same thing with we talk about their brothers we talk about being\nFamily and plan for one another you know blah blah blah but you know stuff like that happens in Philly nobody's sticking up for you and you know having your back to help you bounce back um you know that one\nI Want her to a little bit um and did this and that was used to describe what happened a completely false um\nYou know from throwing a tantrum to completely um\nDisobeying the coaches I'm being selfish um you know I I think it was selfish to make anonymous comments about it's about a team may when\nUh we lost as a team uh I think I totally a place you know it's just unfortunately at one of my plays had to be a fumble on an elastic offer so um\nThat's pretty much how my days in going [laughter]\nThere you go that was the opening statement last night and there's a lot to kind of discuss their uh but he says first and foremost look a I'm not doing it to be selfish or he said he he you know he explained he said the kicker had been kicking it out of the ends on all day when he didn't want him to return to football he knew they wanted him to return to the football\nUm so he kicked it to the goal line he thought the insinuation there was was that he thought he was on the Golan\nAnd once you take it out of the ends on you're out of the end zone\n'em you don't you can't take me and then be at the twenty five if you take it on the to guard when you've got to go you got to return to football okay um so he also says look I Know the two minute off and it's I Know what we can do\nI'm not I'm not trying to hamper that two hundred dollar fence or be selfish with it because I Know what this is capable of or he also um talked about how he and Mike mccarthy talked about it\nAnd Mike understood where he was coming from\nBut said the next time we're in that situation this is the way I Want you to handle it a witch later he goes on and says basically take that second look down see where you're at\nYou understand the surroundings and he understood that he said even if you get tackled the town yard line you're at the ten yard line you don't lose the football he understands that to\nA he said I didn't avoid the media he said I just didn't want to talk about it at that time on one of the media members came alongside me and said because he said all I did was walk out\nSome people had some questions one of the meeting members that can we do what you want to do it now you want to do it tomorrow ties just said let me let me do it tomorrow he went later went on to explain he just wasn't in a great mood and just didn't wanna say something stupid and I I don't agree with it but I respect that\nHe talked about his character he talked about his honesty he said it wasn't a tantrum he wasn't disobeying orders he legitimately thought he was on the goal line straddling the goal line that was the reason he brought the ball out 'cause once you're in you're in\nAnd he said look it wasn't just me to watch this game ... not taken blamed for it you know blame it on anybody else because you like the pool responsibility for the fumble but he was in for a total of eight plays\nAnd he understands where the situation as he later in the program and you can hear this coming up a little bit later on basically talked to the fans and said look I'm not apologizing because I didn't mean to lose the football it's not like I did something agree just I just I I returned to kick\nHe said but I get the passion he talked about how he understands the fans passion is just that be passionate and be a fan just don't go after his wife and kids and that I hold holy agree with\nSo for those at one of the further up a follow up question my question is what question did you want what's the next question that you feel that you should have asked for that should have been asked\nIn some way shape or form that you think he's going to give a different answer to that is what I don't know that's what I that's what I'm ...\nLet's go to orange listening to his downtown or hard how're you doing buddy what's going on\nGood bell good great interview uh went to a guy and I wanted I wanted to speak briefly about the other interview that he gave right after the game or not or after the game but in the afternoon before he got on with you\nYou know and this isn't just what he said I heard Aaron Rodgers and interview or he was quoted in Mike Silver's interview the anonymous player was quoted and they're all talking about the taking me\nTaking me closer to me and\nThat really bothers me because\nThere was a rural that is just as free rein that there's no need to Neal\nThan any kick off that just touches the ground in the end zone in touch back it's automatic and so when I started hearing Aaron Rodgers\nTalking about taking any when I started hearing about it and on and this player saying the coaching staff told him to take a knee and all this taken me and even pi set in a few times in the afternoon I wouldn't take any take anything and they were saying\nRight now I I'm not being a ... I think the one that stands out or would it be their their high number of turnover is obviously when you play with the high level place you're going to have more possessions or trains more possibilities turnovers um bugs or not you know like you said you know ...\nYou might go into that game thinking out of this\nThis might not grow up in the box and review you know we're watching the game but you heard Jonathan clay and military was only one or feminine from the floor for the first three quarter you're probably assume that they were losing\nA description or an African American to think that\nYou know but instead they were up bike or clean everybody was was contributing everybody was um you know making plays working dinner on the ... and older brother from early unorthodox lineups and he ... at the truck with a bunch of guys and the good on that trust\nA ... and everybody you know ... made the mercury opportunity so they're not as clean or they've been really you know really strong so far this season um you know one through ten one through their communities that um and so it's been a very different bugs teams who are used to\nBe a big difference is it as easy as saying is the difference is moving closer\nI I think if you ask the players that I'll say that\nI I think when you have um a code like my boot and older who came home with a a proven schemes something that he came out\nIn the news that he really wanted to do every how to get these guys in the right spot for years now you know the box for an opposite ownership they've stopped they've had a talented team and they thought they had the guys\nThat should put them in a position to win and they still didn't get to the wedding part of it um and so you know you have a lot of the same guys back obviously from Keene new pieces you've mentioned Steven ... Lopez or at least over a connotation\n... those guys are are big factors um but you know this is ... and all that are put in and the way that he has a player's feeling or to shouldn't really be this kind of yeah they're all\nThey're all about it and you know they they feel\nThe the trust that he has them they have confidence knowing that everyone has a rule everyone has a has a part to play 'em they all believe in what's going on and just the levels of positive reinforcement that they're getting something that many have said they haven't got past\nAnd so you know just be the vibe in the atmosphere a round the team is new and and and that starts with a ... boots holders are instilled that as his philosophy around the the\nThe the it seems to be a different energy seems to be a different level of like um you know\nI I every now and then and I know you get this allied were do say well we're playing free or boy it it's great to you know now they haven't hit it versus a yet it virtually usually brings out you know everybody's you know ill wheelers don't do that effect\nBut it certainly seems like a lot of the things that they took away from Jason Kidd fundamentally\nOr coming to fruition but now it's because they're allowed to play basketball does that make sense\nYeah and I I think that they feel ... and recognize they're they're playing in a system that their strengths instead of wondering if they have the green light to shoot certain shots or you know they're doing the right thing to science of labor in how when you're aggressively crappy like they did I'm ...\nI'm ... I'm you know there's a lot more thinking a lot more covering a lot more communication that that's necessary and they're constantly thinking the game\nAnd I think that the the way that might soon alter has implying is you know he he even mentioned Sullivan more simple it's like hey we have these things we want to do you have you know ways that we want to go about things\nAnd outside of that to play basketball you know the pressure and go take openness out first of all I Love to have fun and and make\nThings happen and it's really you know done wonders form on both sides I mean there often is there something that\nObviously people notice and have been talking about a lot but that one of the top defensive teams and NBA right now to um which is a far cry from where they were last year so you know they're they're all just kind of comedy and what they what they need to do and they're grown\nOut there and do not have upon I talked to was the last night I was like he had a couple of days ago that he had the the kids but they haven't caught and that's like one or the last time you had this my current playing basketball man it's been a long time so\nHer response but I think he would probably be similar to her a lot of other guys to\nShow when you look at this team is the way they're playing and and and I say there are plenty probably as much of a team as a team as we've seen in a long time um ... what is the weakness\nYou know I think that there are going to be game where the shots don't call\n'em you know that happened to the best team uh happened last year the worst time to do for rockets missing twenty grew cruising the game or twenty seven when the game's excuse me and uh you know there there's going to be nights were just it's not working and the turnover pile up in bunches\nAnd you know other without a big lead and a half the battle back at some point um you know they're going to lose games like it's going to happen and so they need to\nUm be able to keep up their their level of commitment on defense even when you know there's there's ... shots and things aren't working on a fence or they need to\nContinue to adapt to defend the empty and you're gonna start to figure out how to attack them\nOr they're going to need to be able to to you know try something different and adjusting the game and two two or three different coverages on taking roles and things like that and so kind of getting into\nUm those adjustments is going to be a challenge and they're going to have to consistently be able to do that especially team started to figure out exactly what they're going what they're trying to force than do on the fence and find ways around that I'm so he said there there's going to be adversity at some point\nOr and and they're going to have to be able to respond and you know the next six games at five on the road including one in Boston coming up Thursday and then their home on a Sunday for the kings and they're out to the west coast for what should be a tough road trip or roller and even more about this came over the next six games for sure\nUh next question is I Know they play better defense there rebounding the basketball but is defense and ugly byproduct of what they're trying to do I guess for lack of a better term\nNo I think we have to remember one of their ... I mean my food and all of her stay in and day out of the earth and will address a team of the new plans on how he thinks they're they're handling things that you know that they have the\nUm the focus of being good defensive team of being a a good transition defense team\nAnd they really want to force teams into low efficiency shots especially contested one year they don't want to give up hope agrees with one of the box and you can do a lot and and if they're not doing that as much now they're not giving was calling around before the more liberal shots\nAnd you know that's that's all workers for all what they want to do a and so you know obviously going to pay credit higher pace and you know a lot more clients\nI'm generally speaking but even if you're giving up more points it's okay if that pays as high as they are still being very close with a with the way you're playing defense\nDo you like what you're ... I mean obviously they're winning but do you like what you're seeing or do you think this is sustainable\nUm yeah I mean I think what it was a sort of think they are and what they're doing it especially\nYou know last night without you out of time just goes to show how sustainable it is where\nYou're able to take you know above the rest of the guys and and put together a performance that you know I don't know if you don't have to notify youngest was gone obviously you notice it and and ... in a way that\nYou know he's just incredible player and a lot of great things on the court and he's still is the best player on the team no one denies that um but\nWhen you when you take them out there was no her drop off their different you know the ground there often go put up a hundred twenty four points in the Nineteen crews and had twenty nine and says I'm you know they they have the\nThe formula at least right now they'll have proven to stand up but they have the formula for a team that can consistently execute at a high level a regardless of who's on the court and rich combination that credit cut out there and if you look at their three points shooting which has been a major focus\nUm you know they're shooting like thirty eight percent right now which two years ago they had thirty seven percent per season I don't think that they had as good of a of a process then\n... down to thirty five and a half percent um but I think thirty percent for the seasonal so sustainable they're just they just decide now they're taking more threes and they're going to keep putting them up even if they don't go down early\nAnd you know there might be games they don't go down consistently but over the course female they they can still his high percentages and not really carry though\nDo you a real quick before I let you go last question do you ah just personally dealing with noodles right now he's not a big media member fan but to give me give me your thoughts and blue nose was coaching is a guy that you deal with on a day on a daily basis\nI think it's been a ... billion with him I think he is is good at um have explaining what's going on and and he'd open to discussing kind of you know that's his nose in or why they do certain things you know I think last year my first year full time on the beat I got used to you know\nKind of quickly um whatever it was nice enough to me but in general um wasn't a huge fan of of talking to the media and then we had Joe parties that are happening here who was very friendly very willing to talk but sometimes he didn't\nReally say anything or you have a lot of words that are designed not to not not much but I think so far dealing with an older I mean he elaborated on things you just got things and kind of a lot of the crew understanding what they do and why they direct\nHairspray ...

Bari Parker\nEven uh\nSilvio all of a trade and I think he's just like a a\nDetriment to this team is man seems to be in all the right places that all the right time he doesn't he doesn't go for the limelight he plays off the off the ... the ... the ... a\nShare of the basketball I think he's an outstanding pick up for the bucks I just wanted to get your opinion or those two players\nDon't know I look I appreciate the phone call I I Love with a box of done as far as you've already Parker's NGOs or I'm not even really worried about Jabari Parker anymore he looks really bad he he does\nI don't know if he's in the late next year it sounds crazy but he uh man he's given absolutely no out for what a great a move by him going to Chicago though because they play no defense over there everybody's all banged up they may ...\nSays ... they're not paying me to play defense ridiculously wasn't the smartest move to be honest with you know what I mean I mean it's just um\n[noise] I I\nDon't know what jaded him yeah I don't know if it was the fact that the second injury that people kind of left him ... you know clearly is playing with a chip on his shoulder and I understand that because of you know what what it is you are but I don't understand the anger\nIs it because people just kind of forgot about him you know what I mean come on look coming out to do he was all that mhm and then he was he would've been rookie of the year\nHands down he would've been rookie of the year and then he ended up in that December game with the knee injury and and you just never was able to climb out of that hole and he admitted that on the program last year that said hey wait a minute you know I understand where everybody else is on where you honestly that I think it was just the fact that he was supposed to be the cornerstone of all of this and he just\nGot surpassed feel like especially after a second the injury you look at a guy like Derrick Rose most of it's mental some guys just can't come back I mean 'cause you lose a lot of your physical abilities so you have to almost reinvent your game you're not explosive 'cause you've already was exposed as not as an explosive as a guy like Derrick Rose but he could get to the ram I mean he had lights up\nNow you have to almost changed the way you play the game sense you know you're sixteen Seventeen years old so it becomes a mental thing and I just I don't know if he's ready for that because he's not focusing on the defensive side really looked at often simply either right\nI I just you know he's had a couple of decent games but for the most part he hasn't done what you thought he would do but then again also playing out bad team really bad team and you know I mean the end and he didn't do himself any favors by going to play for free at Harvard no you know or a bird was a train wreck from day one\nAnd that organization has tried to backing because that's their pick and that's their guy but you can clearly see that that team\nDoesn't have a lot of respect for Fred Hiebert knows I was Fred whoever guy would have actually stay the names that Iowa State because you're like a guide their I get the money is really really good in Chicago the look at cost of living in Iowa if you could you out there and not have to watch what we are better there eighty two times a year yeah he\nCouldn't get fired there but uh for what they've done bringing in your son the earliest over a obviously drafting de ... de Vinci ... with the seven in the seventeenth pick 'em you know we can be the gate keeping a guy like are are are bringing in a guideline connotation\nUm you know they picked up a picked up a Christian would or just to stack that that that bench and I'm going down through the list of guys in my head but\nThe fact that they are bringing in brook Lopez or from the Lakers are in and he has been really solid uh as far as being a kind of a counter ... which is what you want and you're putting another seven foot or on the floor\nTo be a counter to what you on a springs and the fact that blood so and brogden and middle to enroll starting and they're all hitting from the outside it's open up the middle for you on us to do his thing\nUh I I just I'm excited I I mean I don't I don't going back to the caller's point I don't really think about what you've already Parker does or doesn't bring to the table anymore I think about\nThat you know what I Love to have seen the guy that they drafted stay here and be successful yes do I realized the deal that's been made into let him go get it okay a John ... made a good call he did the right thing and at times I've I've been hard on journalists and other times I praised him and this was\nAbout bringing the bar now there's a lot of good points look hey if you start out on the goal line that he did and I posted that a little while ago I posted in on Twitter\nWhere you can see clearly three yards deep in the end zone 'em and he took one step to get out to be ... he was standing on the goal line during the ... original kick and the two two steps back if you start out in the goal and you go backwards you know you're in the end zone you know\nThe fact that the kicker had been kicking them out of the ends on all day and they basically want you to return it doesn't mean you have to\nTry understand that uh I understand the conversation between him and Mike mccarthy I'm like I said I I don't understand what he's saying I don't know it's just generally agree with everything but I respect the fact that at least he's explaining where to start or some of you just say lying it's how do you know you know you have your opinion that's fine but how do you know you got to take it got kind of a word a little bit\nBut um but I I he's writing a ship the heavy not follow that football away we wouldn't be discussing this today I Know there was a whole piece done one of the national talk shows about how Mike mccarthy is wash the team because a guy\nAt the end zone and I don't want to necessarily believe that either\nWhen guys lose teams you hear a lot of players speaking out you hear like fractions of guys a lot of anonymous sources for the jags right now that is why that's the team that's gone completely lost its way Cleveland\nYou know talking about huge action players behind his back coming out in the Cleveland Plain dealer talking about sometimes we wonder if the coach knows what he's doing I mean those things are terrible match that some of the stuff that led to huge actions dismissal\nUm is it an ironic though the guy that was the head of bounty gate Gregg Williams is now head coach falling worries me right now eight five five eight three zero eight six point let's go to Jim listening to us into pure Jim how you doing\nGood what's up man what are you thinking [noise] well\nA couple things on their parents their games on the um [noise] more kind of thing is on the verge of losing his locker and well if he doesn't do something about this Montgomery thank\nYou wanted to do is let me ask you is what are you willing to do it by saying that do you does that mean you have to cut them loose\nYup you've had a oh we got to claim him last year for a while [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] yeah um [noise] personally I don't\nThink he's a great ballplayer to begin with and we can do better with that roster spots but that's here or there um but bottom line is if you don't do it's your boss do ya you're gone I don't care where you work and um this tantrum stuff in the locker room if he don't a\nCold and in fact there are certainly forty five tensions every day\nWell he was on the sideline and he said that he didn't throw helmets so what was reported he said he didn't know where people got to 'cause you never threw a helmet and he only won over kind of screamed out loud one time and then turn around and went back into the game\nUm I think that all the attitude I'm by I think he um he got to do with your Mars tells you are right or wrong\nNo I agree with that\nAnd now he's going to lose a lot colonel if he doesn't uh there\nWas something about it how just the players' backs I Believe in that you got to stand behind your players stand by your team was but this is a point where I've been here in the army and pull that a a kind of behavior that doesn't\nWork [noise] no no I'm\nThe other thing I'd like to make a comment on um as far as calling the players yeah I'd turn them over there and Roger is that what they call a place to do on our word God they won't be one less thing that my parents got to worry about and um I think Aaron would do a very very well\nThis is Jim and appreciate the phone call the problem is that you got a call personnel packages\nSo Mike mccarthy basically called the personnel package it gives them the play and Aaron Rodgers does things with it whether to run pass option or what have you but you know cause Aaron Rodgers isn't on the Sinai knowing if the guy needs needs a time out if the guy is injured himself I mean he's he's got a call the personnel packages\nSo maybe when you're talking about personal packages groupings and you can call specific plays um but I I think Aaron Rodgers has a pretty free hand and a lot of what is done in the office I think it's more than what people are\nYou know given given credit for it it's not this is not bread far during his hands out when Mike Sherman to during the play calling saying I'm only quarterback\nYou know it seems like it a little bit because of what he said this past weekend where mice in charge of the personnel groupings uh in in what we can do and then I Try to you know cause many places I can or at least have the options in specific place\nBut Aaron Rodgers believe he's he's an integral part of what goes on their own financially I Can't imagine that he's not\nPaid five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eighty three zero eight six for eight oh let's go to Dan listening to him a knock wood Dan welcome to the program what's going on man\nHey guys how are you on this on a good good good um\nSo one thing I've thought about one or that it hurt during that broadcast the other day was with what choice for that matter or how the players they're great they are so tightly knit together that they do a lot of things together they don't have the distractions whereas uh playing at a big city and to that point\nYou're talking so much about McCarthy losing that team in the locker it was going to turn it on him I feel like Green Bay it's kind of a unique situation to strike but the point where I don't think anyone I think your players or that you would be afraid to speak out against like because they just because that I feel like the players are so much more tightly together\nWhereas like we got through talking about ... or they\nProbably don't spend it that the players aren't as close together as they are a great big if that makes sense I I just feel like\nThere'll be a lot of turmoil and that one guy or those two guys that speak out against like park heartbeat whereas like maybe like what else ... get away with it at the ... just because the entirely different situation right at the campus at as close that makes I\nKnow that's just kind of that's kind of I think I feel like I feel like it's a very different situation where players look bad apart that player or\nAre there are too afraid to do it all\nYeah appreciate the phone calls since you've heard of ... talked about how he didn't think he was going to be there are and\nBy the way going back to the call before about how to marry as Randall did last and they ship them to Cleveland no he did more\nThe guy left you know time of Germany fumble football he took a ball\nOut that he thought was right on the goal line and and he was a couple of steps away from the goal and he made a mistake and took the ball out and formal to have you not follow that we're not talking about this today\nOught to be honest with you 'cause he's still when he got hit he was that the Twenty one twenty two yard line it wasn't like he didn't he was caught up to five [noise] he was still you know well out into the field when he fumble the football um but no Mary's rentals asked to leave the sidelines and\nReportedly left the building and went to walk them just laughed and just basically up and quit and then when they come back to the next week so I Know what\nTime again we did is far less egregious or going back to the caller products let's do this so I'm going to take a quick break we'll come back more to go Michael

borders you on the network we're glad to have you on board today\nA lot to discuss we talk some bucks a little bit earlier with talks and bruise a little bit earlier we've talked a lot of Packers and the time of gum re discussion has been a has been ramping I guess the best way to put it in and now we bring in an era Naegleria who's joining us in the Schneider orange hotline Aaron how you doing today man\nI'm doing well Bill thanks for having\nMe show you and I are kinda going back and forth a little bit on Twitter today and I I pretty much think that we're in agreement but uh I don't know if you had a chance to hear Erin are not airing but a ton of gum reserve explanation last night and kind of breakdown of everything but\nUh basically saying lucky I made a split second decision they did tell him to stay in the end zone he took a couple of steps back he thought he was on the goal line took off in the rest is history um she'll give me your thoughts and everything away everything has transpired and people's demand that he'd be taught to Mike McCarthy's lost a locker room in the state of the Packers is right now\nWell I don't think McCarthy's anywhere close to losing the locker room but I Do think it's an interesting kind of have a point where we we all heard Mike yesterday come out and say the time made a mistake\nAnd other always you know and asked whether they could go forward with high on the team he said you know there's all that football there's always plays you want to reflect on\nAnd I've had you know my social media I'm sure yours as well as been bill with people calling for him to be cut\nAnd I still I definitely think that's still a possibility but I don't think you know I think the Packers are always deliberative they're always going to take kind of the long view on things and if they are planning on getting rid of him I there'll be no point in getting ready to run early in the week when you know bill ballot jak all put in a claim and try and get them on their squad and you know\nBasically on them for all the information age and give them on Green Belt off inside rebates team et cetera\nAnd I also think you know we've got the trade deadline coming up today at four o'clock eastern ... every possibility that Green Bay could look to move him um as for the incident itself I mean there's a lot at play here right there's it's not just the\nTaking it out at the end zone when he was told not to ah there's everything involved around it it it's the tantrum on the sideline after he was cold\nUm and that's been confirmed I mean I Know my silver put it out there and I had a lot of people kind of doubting that report but I spoke to a couple of people on the sideline I spoke to a couple of fans independence it was visible from the stamp\nFollow up he admitted it he came over here and everything he said he screamed and they were already met any of that yeah\nExactly so ... there's a lot going on here so what what kind of had space and CNN et cetera obviously I Can't speak to what's in the man's head or heart at that moment but I Know that's a terrible decision that directly cost them the football game and if that's if that's my team\nI Can't go forward with that that is that is just my view on it I understand others differ but to me it's a blatant\nDisregard for what you've been coached to do and it costs you a football game you can't be throwing away games like that especially when all you need is a skill goal to win the thing he's got Aaron Rodgers has your order and that's what blows my mind like I told you on Twitter the second he had to step backwards to feel that ball\nReal quick call before I let you go give me your uh give me your thoughts on this team coming up the New England patriots obviously a very well coach football team they're very good with Brady we all know that we know they're very tough would you let stadium but after seeing when I saw the coliseum\nOr I say the Packers if they play that sort of game they can win this game and they could win this game almost going away I don't think the New England patriots or his good personnel top to bottom is what we saw in LA\nOh are you a hundred percent agree on the fact that the Packers can win this game I don't think it'll be going away I mean ... second building I really tough but I think I was\nIn LA game like which will be two next to a policy like the Packers match up better with I a hundred times it's a New England and I agree with you I think they match up really well in this game and I think yes they have every capability of going in there and pulling off way would be an upset but I tell you what I think it matches up well I think it's going to be a great game and I'm looking forward\nTo it [noise] great stuff as always body and we will talk to you again soon okay I felt I talk to you later there you go that is Aaron that color Leonard fly and I haven't I are\nIn a huge amount of agreement on a lot of this stuff are completely agree I go back to that [laughter] he's right you go back to the safety of you know and I'll posted I've got the the coaches film on this ah I'll I'll post this but\nYou can clearly see mark was ... wide open and Aaron Rodgers don't really look at them I mean for as much as everybody wants to blame McCarthy and I agree look out or run Williams instead of Jones pie at what point do you you you gotta give criticism or criticism as do\n... some reports I didn't want to interrupt you there is some breaking news like you guys are talking actually couple got three now that Rapaport he must have just tweeted this out you didn't squeezed out yet but he wants to sit on the NFL Network because a bunch of outlets have Packer shopping time I'd gum right before the deadline

cutting them by the end of the week will wait and see what actually happens but nevertheless that one of the rumors that are floating around out there right now the sports program he brought to my

good oh you got to do is say this is what I Want just walk in and grab a good chef right now ... where they believe in better the official sub sandwiches bill Michael sports talk network\nOh let's go to Mike listening tuition Ryan land there Mike walking to the program\nBill what's that doing great I Know what you're doing good I'm doing okay today what's up there\nI just retired from the paper mill after almost forty two years about two weeks ago\nOh congratulations\nYeah thank you very much and the reason I stayed there so long because I did what my employer told me to\nDo [laughter] okay [laughter]\nSo this is a professional millionaire who is supposed to know or ... feet are mhm okay right now during the pages back a couple of years here that the NFC championship in Seattle\nYeah remember that kick Bostic yeah they said don't touch a member of that before and that step in front of it yup in Boston went after it yeah I Do it was gone you know I get it uh\nSo I don't know if there's so much the important for the player or the important for the game what I see what Montgomery did is that he knew where he was I Do believe you did\nIt you didn't take arid Rogers hands of course you mentioned I mean it took it away from the Packers team went toe to toe with this game for a quarter of a football game you just rip the heart of everybody that that still lit author on that field\nYeah no I look I completely agree that it you shouldn't ... I I think we can all agree on appreciate the phone call I think we can all agree on that should not have brought the ball should have\nYou know his explanation last night I I understand it\nSaid look guys they had been kicking it out of the end zone all day this woman had they wanted him to return he thought it was right on the goal line we all know that had to go in or out in front of the goal line the goal as a part of the end zone okay so hit you go online and goes to the end zone then it's considered um\nAnd then it's considered to be a dead ball and it's touch back that lands in front of the goal line well then you know that uh\nThat uh it's it's fair game and you gotta you gotta grab that you got to go so we understand all of that\nHe ... he took if if you watch it and I posted a picture of it on Twitter where he caught the ball he catches the ball and take one step down to the end zone he started out on the goal line okay he takes just a couple of steps back small steps back gathers it in and starts moving forward I\nWhen he explained that he made a split second decision he wasn't sure if he was on the goal line or not because he's taken a step forward to catch the football\nSo he just decided to go any in in in a sense if he doesn't form of the football we're not talking about this but he did\nAnd it is what it is and as he said he's the first event he knows putting the bowling Aaron Rodgers hand gives them best chance to win he knows that he's not he's not stupid he's a part of that often so he knows what Aaron Rodgers can do or was it selfish maybe in the split second was he thinking about making a big play I don't doubt that\nTrying to put his team in the best position to win the game trying to get them better fuel position yeah I I get it plays one of my place completely get it\nYou know if he thought that it was going to be\nInto the end zone around the end zone you let it go let it let it fall and just walk away from it no time off the clock you're good to go see that was my thing is if you don't think you're out of the end zone or on the goal line don't run at all 'cause you're the minute you do your taking time off the clock\nI got the chance to work when they do the tailgate Tiller and it's time I got Murray it's played Martinez you know and and and he's going around this is his off season we have to remember he's going around to all these different communities and he just had a newborn kid at the time so I mean you know how that goes I mean you don't have much time to yourself you're not getting much sleep a you're eating patterns are weird so [noise]\nYou know I thought he was a good dude I'm off the field personally\nYeah I I I don't where I I don't get where it's all coming from I guess\nAll of a sudden it's just these he's just he's just problematic guy that I that I don't understand\nA five five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight years or shall we love to hear from me five five eight three zero eight six for a\nJust a just give me your thoughts because I that I don't get that I don't\nWhere all of a sudden he's become this this cancer risk problem ah let's get back to the phone calls talked to a who's been on hold cans in West bend can walk into the ...\nGood afternoon Billy hey you guys discuss\nAh the Mike climbing the interview from the camp\nThis summer and in fact just before the season started where he talked to kind of Montgomery everybody brought up brought up better as Mike brought that up yet\nYou know my my my two and bring it up\nIt was a very interesting interview that he had and I'm Mike ... interview backup because he was asked he adds time Montgomery you know what's going on you know with you with the Packers he goes I don't know what my role as are Fifteen nobody's telling me right I mean he was so frustrated in that interview\nThat something like what happened on Sunday\nDoesn't surprise me in the least because here's a guy who's trying to do something spectacular relate to being noticed\nA in a good way not in this way\nAnd um I truly believe he knew what he was doing when he decided to bring the ball out I mean\nLike you said that guy Saturday in fact you know being very wily the from all indications anybody that I've ever talked to that spoke when I started the guy's a sharp dude so\nThe fact of the matter is is that he can get what he was doing and uh I Do believe there's a lot of frustration there with him and I think that's good to look at what happened you know how they got rid of Jodie and some of the things that have been done much some of the guys that have been on the team for a while that word and receiving record\nBudget Montgomery 'cause there was a point in time when he was\nA I don't want to stand up where but he was an up and comer so to speak and then all of a sudden\nYou got kicked to the back burner injuries whatever but uh he hasn't been ... and he's not running back you know they tried to make them a running back Fifteen doesn't run the Wildcats and that's basically what they were using human cop poor in certain situations but\nCob like I said on Sunday he should be a return guy or one of the wide receivers that I don't get a lotta time why Montgomery was back there why Williams was back there in ... it makes no sense to me but the team definitely\nI I Believe can grow from what they did they had a terrific all around game for the most part except for one quite\nThere's no reason why this team can end up with ... wins and and make the playoffs you're so so I I you know the glasses and a half empty or there was a lot of good things that came out of funding and they're going to build on it and if that means that loading um Montgomery\nPhobia teams make trades all the time you want a better your team and and if he was somebody that would piss crumpled a and had had other botched going on because he didn't have a bigger role then it's the best thing for everybody want to go and move on you\nNo doubt Bridget a man he uh he uh gets off you get on a five day three zero eight six forty let's do this we're going to take a quick break we'll come back we got a lot more of the bill Michael show gets Roger Brian Dunne is a lot of people talking about this Packers stuff\nAnd everything is going on there is the rumor out
