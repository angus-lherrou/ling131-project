Shaw\nUp to a in a two two series right and then you lose that when you come back to North park having to win all those games game six and seven not that it can't be done but I mean that's extrapolating it out all of you know a long way but I didn't hear the health and I\nAre the top of your home yell at you Ron got through pretty good numbers gets ill so\nUm maybe this series bill maybe this is the game of the series where the often had to let them hang out a little bit today\nWell ... the other on the other hand you you've also got the bottom line up an RC uh obviously has come up huge in the series but at the bottom line up\nHas been just as good I mean they've been really really good when you talk about the way they've been stroke into baseball so I look I'm I'm excited for this team right now the way things are going because if you get guys like Travis Yahoo continues to hit well if you get guys like blonde who's leading to waiting in the postseason ... two Seventy three and and to be honest I\nYou know Lorenzo a cane and Christian yellow which aren't doing what they normally do in the postseason right now they haven't even hit their numbers yet\nYou were doing this kind of without their off into prowess I mean yes Cain and yell at you have gotten on base the walk because between them they've taken twelve ... wants to go to college but we're not even bringing it right now when it comes to the bad because pictures are pitching around them to get to the other guys and the other guys are making a pay for it so\nAs soon as they start picking them again thinking you know what the bottom line up scaling as you may see even more of an outburst of run support right now for the for the team in a way it's going\nTo yell at you you have to go on the Mexican walks there at\nThe U.S has been playing with the left side of the Higgs field or you know he's not putting it doesn't pull everything and he he he's been getting a lot of shark it brought her so the shortstop or third base but and you know that's the that's the way it's been for ... so far in the series so hey yell at ... such as such a great season\nAnd I'm gonna cut a little slack here that he hasn't been great off at college but I mean how can you sustain some superhuman things that he's done by\nBut I'll just walk up to I mean I Know people don't like walks because walks are aren't you know chicks dig long ball I Know walks aren't fashionable but he's got nine Washington scored vibrant I I mean I'll tell you that every damn day of the week\nAbsolutely I agree with you and he walked in the first thing to set up Ron double right forget about Ron's double that kinda put the doors and give the course of the early lead in all three of these games and another thing the brewers have their their starting pitching has been to a point where\nDoctors I've gotten off the flow starts off balance of like in this series and they wrote the old school called the guy you know the guy who's been\nReally the buzz kill all of this whole series has been ... or the Dodgers if the brewers when the series brewer fan the the ... have a big thank you Kirk right thinking up the place because ... behind the plate and ... and in the batter's box has been ruined ... killing the Dodgers\nTiny going back to him well he's the only he's had a good year and you gotta keep going back and he's a big hit for them this year so\nYou know they're going to write him out and they're going to but I mean the fans after he struck out and I think that's the only the only time last night bill where they showed some passion dies or bad is one of ... struck out in the night than it with the bases loaded they let them have it\nAnd I think that was just a matter of him because he was struggling and you know they find themselves are the two to one whole but for the most part I Wanna say Dodger fan for life once again last night\nWhen I was well my next point the only time they got parents she was when they wanted to do one of their own [laughter] you know the only time it really got ramped up was an amped up is when they were doing one of their own people he wasn't really for them it was more against them\nYeah that was it an otherwise you know first took patrol and there wasn't even heavy going after our CEO is the home run oh when it comes to the flight there's bowling right um you know the local ... which ... draws the most ... and I think we all know the reason why are they have them\nRight and two dollars and all of them but um yeah the brewers have or have control than on the series the bill I honestly think I I I really believe this I I think they're gonna win the world so I think they're going to go on and after the world series so I think this is going to be there your I just think the [noise]\nThings are lining up with these guys and um plus the ... the baseball gods have shined on them a few times this in this postseason I'm able to pass the ball last night you know a struggling sometimes get the closet and twice in the postseason they've scored runs on a path all around getting by the catcher they've done it a couple of different times so\nYou know I mean you know it always helps to have the baseball gods on your over your right shoulder\nTalking with John Freeman or the trucking Winkler show and one in five seven FM the fan Chuck

I'm just a little or no you're if you're in greenvale honey I'm a pretty broad for work so\nI did not know I was like I said I was I was there last night with a with a you know the the the crew up there and hinterland and we didn't really have any of that stuff on last night as far as the post game show goes\nOkay I get a kick out of office on I mean it's still it's a threat to us or ... or\n... with quicken or for and I don't know what were we were kind of taunting for yeah than our place\nI'm grown over the counter he goes you know for for for real hope prepare you go on and who did that for that through our first locked in their mind or you know\nNot for her contract already you know only open the song and only in their lap and then I think that's one thing you don't do it on the interview for for the game and then they asked on directly\nOn their first non song Ross who was on hold me for that for real personal you don't buy into it you don't want a\nYeah you don't take the bank on that is what he's trying to do is try to he's daring you to get one out over the plate so he can crush it and then you know there there was no reason to take the bait\nNone at all I completely agree and hope for you poking them from going back and say you're\nRight no I I completely agree appreciate the phone call you know you don't you don't take that you don't take the bait there's no reason to\nNo reason to it all you just you move on a five five eight three zero eight six for eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight staples what got you there you're crazy if you take that they absolutely crazy\nBut we do his thing and let him look stupid\nYou know the Machado thing the same way let the let them be the ones to make the mistake we're supposed to be the big bad LA Dodgers that have all this experience in the postseason and what is their experience show them\nThat if you do stupid things like you're supposed to get a younger team or a team that's considered to have less experience that they're going to take this bait and suddenly you're going to become more superior team because of it now\nLead them to the stupid stuff\nEight five five eight three zero eight six forty five five eight three zero eight six forty\nAnd you've got some young guys that are pretty good they're not pro bowlers yet but they're pretty good but the guys you're paying to be pro bowlers orange\n... they're just not there's nobody that's just completely shy Blake Martinez them in a solid season so it's kind of court or last night as a matter of fact coming back or you know it was ... it was stated a out of the forty niners lock room they were running away from Kenny Clark and Mike Daniels because they knew they could\nYou know and they were successful doing gash that Packers defense last night when they ran away from those guys they were pulling guards pulling tackles help pulling the center a couple of times last night blowing open holes on that right side getting away from Daniels and Clark and and they were able to be a you know manipulate that\nSo there are some problems I I'm not sugar coating it there's differential problems I don't know whether or not they're gonna be able to correct it but more so their best defense is going to be an op ed just firing on all cylinders and I'm not even a hundred percent confident in that right now\nBecause as much as as we witnessed Aaron Rodgers in that great\nTable there was also some Mr rose last night there was missed opportunities last night hanging on to the ball last night we will get into that I'll talk more about that but ... there was this whole thing about running the clock down to zero last night a couple of times they came with blitz stunk blitz is that they got a running start before the because they could see the clock was about to expire\nAnd and they got there in Rogers last night so there's some things that need to be fixed and some things that need to be sold scout and they need to make adjustments like right now sort of do and you're listening to us in Tacoma Daniel how you doing today man what's up\nI got doing what's happened\nLast night I was kinda disappointed with an announcer at all they talk about LA and how great they are in LA of all that stuff mhm and I think the rulers of things that keep the same thing around you know what they're doing and and I think they want the brewers to fail so they can prove\nThat basically that that a formula that ... doesn't work you know not having to start or like the other people mhm\nAnd number three hours looking at three thousand eleven and tell them now and all that probably earned a champion and I think that every now and that memory back then everything got that has got a lot of Prince Fielder what about next season right hired about ... the the let's finish this that and just like you said at the Packers\nBrings is this the hit and hit about ... ... is the second tier wall was to rebuild Hi do you do look at how bad doing or looked at the last for her for game now it could turn this that part about next\nSaid well no I agree with that in the thing about it is for the phone call the thing about it is when you talk about next season baseball football if you build a new quiz you're going to be around a while you know barring massive injury baseball's fickle and there's no guarantee that you'll be back there next year I mean you're you're looking right now the cubs were picked to win the world series I don't even still in the postseason [noise]\nYou know show it look you got to take advantage of the magical run 'cause you're seeing how hard it is to get there and must be honest is crass going to give you the same thing next year or so you're going to give you the same thing next year are you going to get the same amount of quality pushing out of every body that what you're seeing it this year there's only so many pictures in an arm\nWhen does it started to go south window guys start their problems when you guys go down when doing your players go down and not come back or they come back to they have the same stuff I mean you gotta take in baseball is specially you have to take advantage of the situation right\nHere right now let me tell you something I think\nYou look at court can able and how much he was struggling you sitting down and triple a clearer said\nEver since he came back he has been by far the best reliever in the bullpen none of an hater seriously ... had a couple of outings and September where he was given up to three runs to enable has been the lights out ever since he came back from AAA mhm\nOrlando Garcia has already hit three home runs more so than what his regular season total what's\nOrlando Garcia sent down in Tripoli for about a month comes back has been a completely different baseball player Domingo Santana you know here we're thinking he's going to be one of those everyday outfielders he's competing for a spot at the beginning the season\nThen he every played appearance he gets fails gets sent down a AAA he figured that out and comes back and now he is by far the most reliable pinch hitter that the brewers have\nYou know I I think guys like can Abel ... Santana they are paving the way to other struggling players to say look it's okay if you get sent down a AAA\nBecause look what these guys have done mhm go down there reset focus and come back in ... ... you know this whole sentiment about getting sent down to triple a is a demotion\nThat's not the attitude you can have any more as a professional player because you are seeing three different guys contribute in huge ways and helping this team you get to a World Series that that that that\nThat that should be a lesson learned to any pro baseball player out there because it's hard it's hard for your manager or your GM to come to you and say\nThat sorry we're we're going to send you down a AAA you we need you to work on some things I mean that that crushes you as a baseball player everything you work for him so I I think these are some incredible comeback stories that we've seen these three guys\nHopefully Fox Sports all the little feature on that that would be nice to\nHave five five eight three zero eight six forty they'd probably five eight three zero eight six pros go to Dan listening to us in Brookfield Dan walking with him it was going on\nGuys thanks for taking my call I did want to make a quick comments or your previous caller about kind of more mainstream and they'll be not not given more\nBrewer talker crediting the brewers and and I think it's because you know the bird's kind of fall under the radar this year you know there are not a lot of news anchors people watching the brewers and so they don't know the brewers and and everybody knows the LA for during the game yeah of course they're going to talk about LA because that's that's the team they know the the players they know\nA a more of an unorthodox comment I Want to make a point here quite council should be the Green Bay Packers coach and I kind of thing\nBecause your number one job to coach or a manager is to prepare your per game day\n... and and to play your ... player strength and we've seen council time and time again and even in the playoffs\nPrepares you for game day from the way they're prepping before the game to game decision to what he's saying in the locker room and and I just want to ask you got the question here because\nI I'm Still dumbfounded when you're losing the game and you're running Montgomery jumped on the bench and Jimmy crammed blocking why do you think there are some managers and coaches out there in the sports world like how far they can they can recognize the talent they can recognize the players strike\nThey make a decision with a place of their players trying to put them in the best decision for when and then there's other coaches out there\nLike electrical go uh I think we can all agree that that\nIt just doesn't seem to recognize the elite level status or that counted players that they do have designed plays around those players get the flu and the best chance to win ... why do you think that that that\nThat well I Know the whole thing would appreciate the phone call thing where they are and Jones is they kept saying he's a three down back and they trust them and they don't\nWhen it comes to the passing situation there are still waiting for him to get his blocking down and to protect the quarterback he is the dynamic running back there's there's no doubt about it you just look at these numbers he's the guy when it comes to running the football but he's not the guy that's going to be in there right now is there a trailing and they need to start throwing the football to come from behind it just\nYou know for for what they tell us and what they actually show was to drastically different things\nAnd as far as putting guys and the best position to win\nWell let me ask you this didn't they do that last night and then when I look I'm I'm not agreeing or disagreeing Mike mccarthy is or isn't a good head coach I think that message might be a little bit stale I don't I don't know I'm not inside the walls are twelve sixty five\nBut I Do know one thing for everything that went wrong last night he took a lot of grief and then when they finally came back last night it was all Aaron Rodgers\nYou can't have it both ways Aaron Rodgers held on to the football last night Aaron Rodgers had some bad passes last night round the clock down last night there was some bad quarterbacking last night he used a spectacularly talented spectacularly played quarterback setting a good point though thank you very much\nBut there are some things right now where they just have bad times does functionality and this off and she has yet to play a full four quarters of quality football I'm going to take a quick break more to go Michael shear next\nEverywhere in Wisconsin bill Michael sports talk [noise]\nSo for services the

were flat and we don't know why there's\nNo rhyme or reason to it it's the players is not the coaches and then there's times where they've come out and just like zombies walk through the pre game warm up and then came out with the world on fire they don't know\nSometimes you just ... you don't know until you get out there but trust me no player individually comes out and goes you know what I'm going to go through the motions then collect a paycheck\nBecause you are highlighted on every damn play trying to make a play your effort level at times may not be where it should be if the players away from you\nBoth for the most part no player wants to be manhandled no player wants to be beaten down no player wants to be shown up if you have any sense of self pride at all that just didn't have

tackled from different areas of field you can play different coverage is you can play nickel you can play dime you can play NASCAR you can play jumbo pack whatever it is you went out there but if you don't have the talent to when you won't win\nThat's when you look back upstairs and you say thanks Ted\n... square pegs in round holes all those years you screwed this franchise for a couple of seasons and here's the other thing to remember this is true that is rude but when you look at top for top five draft choices okay one through four specifically\nYou usually marry those guys sure so when you got a first run or a second round our third or fourth around even a high fifth\nYou usually marry those guys and those guys are on your team for four years they play out those rookie deals sure and if they suck you're only as good as your weakest link and if you're weakest link sucks that means you marry that thing for four years which means you're weakest link is going to cause you to suck for four years\nI I don't I'm not smart enough to tell you what it is a machine so\nThat's that's not been the machine that drew me so you think about it when you start drafting overpaying particular players because that's the best available at the time and it's really just a mediocre player\nYou become mediocre\nAnd you've tied up money in doing so and you keep guys on a roster that really don't deserve to be there at least not at the level of what you want to play\nThis to claim crime or anything like that is is this is real live\nDamn straight back to the phone calls a stock to Patrick in Madison ... own Patrick how we look and what's going on man\nGood great drop man overall area [laughter] wanted to get\nOn Thursday lots of sunshine with light thing into the middle of the

Chambliss Detroit in lady Smith Tim walking to the program and what's going on\nThey built a big I appreciate your aunt that's how you really made a lot of excellent excellent insight ... points I'm One of the things I'd like to bring up the\n[noise] you know it's kind of the stories out as to what they're going to do this year I really dread that game against the rams I feel we're unless something happens we're going to just get destroyed um\nI think obviously if we don't make the playoffs this year we tank McCarthy we'll probably maybe be gone I think it's a combination of things I think looking back of the year when you know back in Ninety six I think it was when we watch the super bowl we lost a couple of our wide receivers\nBottom all goes out and gets Andre rise which saves our season I think of the year ... we don't make a move at all we don't trade for anybody we don't try to pick anybody up and\nWe're in the tank it seems that this whole ... make adjustments for some reason that I'm not sure why are we lose one player our whole team falls apart and ask them that way for a while and I like to hear what your comment on that\nThey appreciate it I look I I'm I'm\nThings are good right now I mean if you had to make a decision today in the season ended the day chances are it might not back okay but I'm the Packers move like an iceberg\nVery slow very methodically you have to understand there's some dynamics your work yes mark Martin Murphy wants to win he also has a really good relationship with Mike mccarthy is not going to just throw the baby out with a bath water just to make sure everybody's happy\nYou want to do what's best for the organization do you want to change midstream right now with only a few years remaining were there in Rogers off the bench and we do you want to make that that that decision\nI think they just want to see how this plays out and if this is something that turns out to be really good then you know some of the things that are going on and maybe you're nothing more than bumps in the road but if they continue to be the same old same old [noise]\nAnd you're not\nTo the level of play that you would expect and you really as a general manager and as an owner or president you believed there was a larger amount of talent on his team that is not being put in the best position to be successful due to coaching and you make the change if you believe the message is still you make the change\nBut I don't think it's going to happen now I think it's going to happen at the end of the season when you valuations come and that's when they have to decide you know is Mike mccarthy worth giving a contract extension do\nOr is it just time after the old the bill Walsh rule of once you get the ten years or on borrowed time it's time to move on you know they're making the same decision right now in Pittsburgh with my ...\nYou know he's creeping up on that ah that that period of time so we'll see but I just I'm I'm waiting for this thing to play out yes it's frustrating I get it but I'm just waiting for this thing to play out a pie by three zero eight six for a a real quick one more phone calls him in for do you Tim welcome to the program and what's going on\nReally what's going on boss that I don't talk to you know\nA couple of quick point your previous caller said that the off and says you know that he said that there it it it had nothing going on the system is Dale I think he's smoking we number one\nOkay Number two air and get to play with twenty twenty five seconds left he's always he's taken it down to five or left because each walking into the best possible way compared to the line up you see in a defensive side of the ball bill so that's what they saw walk you know to do that okay\nAnd number three what I saw on the fourth quarter last night\nWas I think they were setting he has a lot better bell thirty eight out there he look forty years old I mean come on look old twenty nine swallows I mean he played well\nA a Ninety seven played well twenty played ball at the end of the game but when I saw an improvement the fourth quarter\nCompared to the first three and I watch a lot of intricacies really put a they were studying the ad in the fourth quarter to never getting outside you know ... I thought played pretty good spot duty yet it down the stretch out though exactly so it was I think bill wasn't palate last night I just think it was more fundamentals because they were getting their ass to get to the edge\nAliens died I just I think it was fundamentally the line on holding up their gaps then I just think uh\nJust think was fundamental but we'll see maybe I'm the ultimate optimist here buddy so a worker who flew nice to talk you used to\nGo talk to you soon there you go that's everybody to him and for most of us will take a short break we'll come back more than Michael show and the football frenzy is match\n[noise] six stations strong willed Michael Moore talking it\nDoesn't\nJoined us Thursday evenings or six o five to hear from Wisconsin badger head coach phone Chris Cannon\nWhen we do while you're up for some reason there's where they\nWere dealing\nJoined us of a kickoff rental Evan am right\nBelow Governor Tommy Thompson was governor I had to make some tough decisions to turn things around\nWe lowered taxes to create jobs\nIn Wisconsin fighting chance Scott Walker also as tough decisions to make parliament jobs\nBefore he was governor Wisconsin had a huge deficit unemployment in nine point three percent\nProperty taxes went through the rough Scott Walker's reforms turned our state around\nPeople are working this year than\nThe deficit is gone\nTaxes are lower than what Scott was elected mayor Andy made its Oregon but since then help bring good paying manufacturing jobs\nWe cannot afford to go backwards by raising income\nI'm Tommy Thompson let's keep Wisconsin working with Governor Scott Walker\nHe matter your experience matters and wherever you are in Wisconsin just help for all sexual assault survivors and their families\nGo to buy your side W.
