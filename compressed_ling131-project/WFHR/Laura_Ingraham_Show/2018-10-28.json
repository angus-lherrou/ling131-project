I mean even his own team is turning on him that's got to be extremely hard to be successful professional football uh wouldn't even your own team may pay you a let's go with the I Know where you're going to hear Cleveland got any money to add or go Pittsburgh you will keep moving look\nBigger Mayfield is he's interesting really far but you know what\nDon't you think he just all of a sudden it's kind of looking like the Cleveland quarterback to both of them in the running around it's like oh my God he may be too perfect for Cleveland he may be just another name that long a list of names in the back of the brands quarterback Jersey oh too bad for them you know I like to see them be competitive at least I don't know how this happens\nYou know how can you keep swing and miss a year\nAfter year after year player after player in Denver and Kansas City Vegas is the total is fifty three and a half when Kansas City has given away can like remember last week as the case two years ago report is the breeze\nIt was worth yeah I Do to a ... interesting note about the chief deep in their band do break you're giving up a ton of yards and they're giving up junkyards too big categories easily scare you when you're looking at a deep and but they're not giving up that many point they're stepping up when you get when they get into the reds don't keep an eye and his chief deep and\nEspecially when they get Eric very back it's going to be a interesting because it's perfect Andy Reid plan right I mean just score like crazy at the beginning and slowly ratchet up the deepest make that a little bit better so by the time you get to the last year a little better on the the people they ...\nA jet at Chicago in the Trump is the ... in Chicago that's why they're given up seven and a half\nTo the New York a GPS jets yes she had to do you like this might be the first time I pick the bears [laughter] and it's only because you're forced with either the bears are happy to pick the Jetta I Know the giants are at home against Washington Washington is one of those teams it's kinda\nWell look at the division is bad that that may be the best team in the division is that good enough but to knock off the giant ... so I think it is ... ... you're going to go Redskins I'm going to go giants and this\nOne uh because uh just\nTo be contrary to go home really honestly it to pick up as far as Vegas goes and home field advantage supposed to be worth three that means you would maybe kind of favor Washington near a little bit I'll go with the giants just to be different Seattle at Detroit\nThis is not the same it's not your not your older brother Seattle's me mad about that part [laughter]\nAh but ah at Detroit where you never really know what you gonna get forest Gump whether you like and this one I'm through our pick of the Detroit Lions look at you and me picking almost everything the same except for one so far\nUh Cincinnati is going to host the Tampa Bay buccaneers and James Winston who put up sixty times if you let him ah forget the running game they just want to throw and forget the defense to or maybe that's why Vegas that this is fifty four and a half\nPoint has been so have you ever seen the tomatoes over Fifteen your lives in just a lot of high scores wow All right that but this fatty\nAt home in a you know any dog has been doing it AJ is always doing anything who you are I think the biggest will will bounce back for the last couple of games with whom you know I have to do the same thing because they're at home there there are given up three points there at home that made it pretty even but\nJust because they're at home and Dick's then that's another reason I think maybe better run again Caroline is going to host the Baltimore Ravens a for this one and they're the ones I've given up the points on the road who do you like yeah pick of the ravens [noise]\nAren't going to take down to a figure it out at home will give me a man I Am such a home as I look at this list wow\nI'm like every look I've I've got every single home game\nFive just really really fighting so far yeah I'm On the house until now apple is pat Oakland is\nThree hours of fire sale or given away everybody they're positive draft picks the raiders of all for it now I'm going to call I'm going to go with the cold too because wild or they're just bad luck is going to throw the ball maybe a hundred times as\nA Arizona's gung ho San Francisco who bottom of the barrel and ah I was going to stay in the pack twelve oh man\nDon't know how well these guys would do in the back door probably not\nVery well I think I think the cars are like the browns or the end of the subject of the cars go this we're going to take the cards at home while you know this this may be the toughest pick on here for me I'm I'm going to go with Larry Fitzgerald in my home streak here says assured of\nBoiling Green Bay Packers travelling out to take on the on beating the rams\nThrough business the interesting it is interesting I I look Vegas total or fifty seven\nBiggest one of the week like object view over on that one might be able to do this can be a Packers nigger and it was one but I'm Still still a sticking with around yeah going with my home streak here I'm I'm with you I'm a I'm going to take the rams are in that one as well but yeah fifty seven points and I do like the over\n... All right uh Minnesota this is one of the more interesting game the entire week Minnesota Vikings been a host of New Orleans saints\nTo breathe or doing nothing but knocking people over and shoving them out of the way in the NFL record books and winning games at the same time organization realize how well they're playing when got Eli Apple to beef up that defense or a little bit what do you think about New Orleans on the road at\nMinnesota I think the biking is a little bit over into this year I'm going to say on the road you know what I look at you and me [noise]\nNow wait a minute hold on I think about this if I if I take Minnesota I might take an every single ... no I took Indianapolis or\nLike I'm going to go to New Orleans too so I have to row only to road games\nThis week part look we got through it in time we can do the Monday Night game which is rare for as a it's a division hey buffalo gets on Monday Night football for the first time and I think nine seasons or what their reward Brady and the New England patriots of forty four and a half\nA total from Las Vegas and a fourteen point pad\nThai food it'd be stupid to go to the bathroom specially when we're not using the point spread really would be stupid to convict them yeah no they just they they look so good\nAnd you know it's just amazing you know you see this\nBrady get to this this HGF injuries ball you know there there at this age where you know they're close to the end of their careers but they're just they're so smart and what they see it for a quarterback is what you're able to see in the end of the side of the ball makes all the difference in the world like all of a sudden one day at all clear up in now with my body hold out in the book\nI just stick around we get fantasy football information governor elect NBC Sports radio [noise]\n[noise] only one radio station central Wisconsin hands with Dave Ramsey\nYou were NBC Sports radio update the Dodgers\nPushed to the brink of elimination Bush got LA lab to Boston for nothing going to the seventh inning but then the red Sox likes they're\nStopping showed why they won a hundred and eight games on the season and some questionable calls for Dodger manager Dave Roberts pitching wise out of the open leads to nine or ... of the bottle brewery frames Boston ... LA night as six\nBecause they go up three games to one meanwhile college football what you need to know second rate Clemson beat Florida State fifty nine to than their rank order name stays on beating as they double up maybe forty four suit twenty two six spring Texas they fall as does number nine Florida\nMeanwhile any association LeBron James and company the Lakers come up shortly alibi one than

wildly parts crippled people snapping [noise]\nOr if he aggravate something I think this guy is is worth the start uh Oakland Raiders journey Nelson\nVersus the Indianapolis Colts there at home I'm Ari Cooper is gone is going to be more came as Brian is he and all of a sudden step up and be the number one target a for a a for a car in Oakland I don't know I think you're probably going to go with the veteran a majority Nelson first\nA and there's probably somebody that's a pretty good play today\nWill for while we were telling you a last week\nYou know that a will for so closely tied to Kiki cutesy now that will for is that I had the er or he's going to have the procedure on his name for the ... the the L I mean he's going to be out until next year that puts Kiki cutie back in line again next week in that spot that guy's an absolute I'd say once he gets a hundred percent because they've been doing a hamstring too\nUh that that guy's a wide receiver to somebody that you can roll out there every single week especially the way to Sean watch them a look the other night\nMan you had to like what you saw there now we've been watching and monitoring the progressively Sean McCoy throughout the course of the week in and saying a bed or if he doesn't go course ivory is going to be a full started because he's going to get a full load of work\nAgainst the New England patriots yeah I Know that's a tough for them especially on under the lights of a Monday Night football but it looks like\nA indications are now to Sean McCoy is going to be okay and he's going to be able to play on Monday Night football ... meaning to start [laughter]\nOh that means that you say that looks like he's getting through the least concussion protocol and it's going to be able to play it if you've got this guy or on your roster this has been a tough thing for you all season long it's going to try and run that guy out there and see if we can get some points out of volume he's obviously more valuable PBR than he is standard\nBut if you're going to roll that guy out there a man it's it's kind of a gamble every single week\nAnd I thought about training for a couple of times uh you know if the right situation if I could get him cheap if I could buy cheap because he is a starting back a talented guy he's just on a team or you know they're going to sell out to stop and run every single time when you consider when they're looking at a quarterback\nHere's an interesting thing to regarding the raiders because now Marshall Lynch has also gone because of injury now that means jailing restarted Doug Martin are going to run the ball which one is the better back I can tell you that we uh I spoke to a Marcus grant from the NFL Network yesterday on my show yesterday\nA talking to him about uh the situation and he believes this Doug Martin yes he is going to get the starred as the raiders running back in March John Lynch is spot however jailing regard as the guy he's the number two he's the James White kind of guy that catches the ball out of the backfield in what Marcus was explaining on it\nIs that you know the raiders not very good I mean they've got a pretty good I've been through line which is good for Doug Martin but they're just not a good ... and not a good football team\nSo probably going to be playing from behind a lot and that means jail in regard as the better back to own between the two because you know as they play catch it but the second half of a lot of football game this guy's going to be seeing a lot of targets were Doug Martin will be getting\nA quite the as a matter of a quite a large amount of rushing or because of the deficit that there'll be playing under so anyway share that information from my yesterday's program and talk and one of our experts over at the NFL Network [noise] um\n[noise] I in a a by week of God Doug Martin I'm going to roll him out there this week by week feeling on one of my team some kind of hoping that the the Martin can get it done in his first week of the feature back\nAh in for a Martian Lynch a CJ Duma uh Cincinnati Bengals tied in you didn't have a great a game and week seven against Kansas City but he did find the hands on\nA Thirteen yard touchdown you'll take it right buccaneers is due they're up against this week allow the most fantasy points to opposing tie dance and the tight end scored again at least Ninety receiving our door touchdown against them in five games in a row\n[laughter] now do know is about a Duma he did do the ... in the end zone Nancy scored a touchdown and you know you know the macro random at random and did the Mac arena is two decades old come on man and what I mean I Know you're trying to get creative with what they're doing in the end zone but Mack arena\nI

I'd like to say Geoff that it's going to be one hell of a football game but I've got my doubts of this Green Bay team as much as I Love Aaron Rodgers has just been a bit of an enigma there I think they're searching for some sort of an identity to be honest with you know they\nThey haven't been able to run the ball consistently and I'll be all kinds of wind plays been up and down of course Aaron Rodgers been hobbled by that name which is getting better I get it\nBut the the wide receiving corps has been banked up and sometimes they show up sometimes they don't show up they're going against a arguably the best defense\nIn the national football league and we haven't even talked about the defensive side of the football to me they give they give they give up way too many big plays and when you look at what LA's do it on the opposite side of the football unlike a lot of other teams in the NFL which\nYou know they want to throw the football and get it out quick two two and a half seconds a lot of crossing routes bubble screens et cetera or they open up by trying to run the football talked early enforce shoe to drop people down in that box\nOr because the defensive coordinator generally speaking is getting his bud shoot out because they're just ripping off big chunks of yards and then when they run the play action they run it better than anybody in the league\nAnd uh they throw it down the field they get big big chunk play so I see this as an uphill battle when you look at Green Bay schedule over the next five weeks I mean it is a murderer throw I I\nHeard Aaron Rodgers say yesterday that hey listen we got to play better\nAnd uh but but I don't think that these next five weeks are going to define us and and I disagree with that\nUh they have not played well and I know nobody's running away with that division right now but I if if they don't if they don't finish better or at least three into over the next five weeks they might find themselves too far behind in his division so this is a critical game uh I I don't know how ... can muster winning this one but you know that's why they play the games\nYeah back to back road games for the pack in LA this week and then at New England next week grueling stretches you said All right well before that today seven early games including the teams at home again to take on the Broncos mark\nThis may sound like a kind of a dumb question but if you're Patrick my homes in Andy Reid how do you keep things rolling now and not lose your average offensively\n[noise] well I was in a you know you you you and I think Andy has been around long enough to understand how it is that you prepare a football team weekend and week out you know you're going to have some clunkers here and there I don't think it's going to uh it'll I don't think it'll rear its ugly head necessarily against this Denver team to be honest with you I I think they're so multiple on the opposite side of the football Jeff\nAnd he's done a better job than anybody in the NFL incorporating college concepts things that for instance pat homes or was successful with an uncomfortable with when he was at Texas Tech\nOr as well as putting in things that we normally see in the NFL from an off into perspective and I think that keeps the defense of really are on their toes I don't know what's coming next\nUh the weapons he has to work with right now Karim ... to re kill and and Chelsea the tide in I mean that's as good as it gets in defensively has been the big question mark for me with them and and and I thought they played much better against\nA team that had been role in the uh the bangles or last weekend and\nA listen this is with Justin used it on the sidelines do with a hamstring they're waiting for\nA the safety to come back um who's had the Achilles issue and so I I'm I'm I'm hoping that they're gonna play a little bit better on the defensive side of the football but in answer to your question how does anti keep you know everything fresh you've got young quarterback many wide I he's ready to go I I don't think that's going to be a real big problem for them going down the stretch\nI Would imagine he talked so much does and he read about the the energy and just everything going on with that chiefs group and is it kind of like Mark as a player when when you're there just every week is just kind of a new week and you get to maybe add some new plays and keep things fresh that way and make it exciting yeah you know\nGet it you know listen people in the national football league players in in in particular are

Eighteen innings I Confess I finally I went to bed in the top of the Eighteenth I just [noise]\nYou know I start my day every day for in the morning here and it was a like after midnight\nAnd I finally uh you know finally had to shut it down I was falling asleep on the couch [laughter] so I went to bed on the top of the ... and I confess when Alex ... came in I thought it was going to be over\nBut max once you hit the big home run and the Dodgers got to win a game three and then they jumped out to the foreign ethically yesterday and I thought last night I should say that I thought wow okay\nYou know maybe this will be a series after all I pick the red Sox win and seven\nAnd okay you know maybe a you know maybe the Dodgers are are getting right here at home and they're they're pitching is going to be good enough and they're stepping up\nBut that didn't last long once ritual went out the red Sox just exploded on that Dodger bullpen blew the game open and they'll have a chance to wrap it up tonight with David Price ironically and I know you know it's easy to say well you know they have David Price so that's great for the Dodgers but you know what\nThe way the last two starts have gone for David Price and the way this season has gone for the red Sox as a whole I I wouldn't be surprised if you know David Price was completely dominated again in this came today so that's a tonight\nGame five David Price versus Clinton cursed job is just remarkable to just a on a on the flip side I mean the Dodgers are three one remember the last game seven of the world series to the Astros at home last year so there's very good chance they could lose the world series title on their home field again\nIf they don't win tonight and you know Clinton Kirsch of for over a decade of of being you know arguably the best pitcher in baseball\nOr I mean I don't want to say he's an afterthought but I think most people feel like the red Sox are going to wrap it up tonight and\nIt's tough because you know crucial set a great year but as as we've seen of late I mean he's not he's not the same guy now could he could be stepping up and and surprises and be dominant again tonight to force a game six in Boston back and bought absolutely it could happen but it's probably not will see\nA our baseball insider here at the network Seth ever it is going to join is coming up here in about ten minutes or so so stick around for that and a lastly the other big story the day comes from the NBA\nWhere the Cleveland Cavaliers we you know we knew that without LeBron James uh life was going to be different in Cleveland and you know I don't think anybody thought they were gonna start Owen six but they have and somebody had to pay the price and today Dan Gilbert and the cabs fired head coach Taiwan Lou after the onset starts\nAnd have replaced him on an interim basis with Larry Drew one of the assistance of Cleveland I mentioned this early in the show it for me my just my my gut reaction on the surface is I look at it like\nThe the cabs not that title ooh is you know the perfect kind of manager if you will\nBrian James when the brown was there but now that LeBron is going to uh I think clearly the cabs feel like ... who is not the exes and those kind of coach that they need or at least\nHas it been you know that they needed a change I don't know maybe they felt like tightly wasn't\nGetting the most out of the players\nThere on the roster right now nonetheless\nOr he's gone and Larry Drew is going to take over so that's what's going on or in the NBA today we've got the warriors with the late afternoon start today in Brooklyn going up against the net so that's the big news in the NBA tie Lou out after the own six start in Cleveland I feel bad for tie Lou because I think he's a good coach\nI think he was more than just a manager but you have a very impatient owner who you know despite\nYou know despite what would they say publicly or despite how they tried to put a positive spin and hey you know thank you for LeBron think he'll abroad for all that you did\nYou know I mean the bottom line is a liberal left and didn't want to stay there and it's back to the lottery in Cleveland you know that's the way it is so All right let's get to the NFL Scoreboard and we start in Cincinnati\nBuccaneers Bengals\nIt's been a bad couple of weeks for the

right away\nAnd so I I understand that part of it but the truth be told I mean the red Sox are just an absolute juggernaut okay I mean they're they're just they're I with all due respect um again I I understand Dodger fans here in LA they're frustrated\nAfter losing the world series last year and seven games the way that they did I get it it's frustrating get all that but really I I don't think it would have made a difference I you know this I've said before if you listen to the program and I've had different insiders on and I I'm not saying this to my own horn or\nThis Dodger this Dodger pitching staff as a whole\nYou know it it's been kind of piecemeal for for ... years and you know Magic Johnson and the ownership group\nYou know when they came in everything was great and then they brought in Andrew Freedman and they I mean they put a ton of money into the front office I mean they've got like you know five guys and that Dodger front office they're really really smart baseball guys okay but\nThis this Dodger pitching staff you know they've they've kind of piecemeal than patched together and\nAll I'm saying is that the way that they they lost to and you could make the case the probably the best move up the Dodgers made this off season was not resigning ... okay I give them credit for that\nBut they never really they never really went out and tried to to make any kind of a splash are really\nMake a big move you know to bolster that rotation or bolster that the bullpen now Walker viewer the rookie\nWas I mean a huge plus I mean props to them obviously they drafted him they liked him and they thought he was going to be special and that's worked out I mean he pitched brilliantly in game three friday and I didn't get the decision because\nThey went Eighteen ... but you know that was a good move but I'm just saying when when you're in the front office and you know the the whole objective is\nHey you know we can't do over the luxury tax threshold I mean you're you're here in LA this is LA\nOkay and you've got the Lakers getting LeBron James\nYou you have this little window here right the Dodgers have made it back to the world series two years in a row they're probably not going to make it back next year so you had a little window here\nAnd they just they decided to roll the dice play it safe play it cheap and didn't really do enough to address their pitching and it's it's it's come back to bite him because they're pitching has not been enough and it's not going to be enough to beat the red Sox\nI you know I don't know if one arm necessarily would have made a difference\nBut clearly you know to to think that they could be one of those teams in the American leagues with the the pitching that they had you know was not was not the mindset on the flip side and the red Sox are absolutely rolling what a great story they've been the best team in baseball all season long\nAnd they are going to end as the best team in baseball alright coming up

fantasy football players depending on the players you have all rolled through who's really having a good day\nAnd the kind of point that you might be getting up because of that good day for example if you had Carson once it was a good day probably got a lot of points and some leagues you would have gotten maybe twenty five point maybe even a little bit more than that because he had three touchdown almost three\nHundred yards but like I said it's still about finding that rhythm\nFor Carson once because you look at what Jacksonville and they're now three and five the eagles\nPick up that fourth win which is so important for them right but\nThere are missing pieces especially defensively and that really showed in that game I Wonder if they want to say something here right in the beginning before we get to the Dodgers game I watched the Dodgers game last night of course I was flipping around\nWith the the various games going on Notre Dame et cetera and college football I'm such a college football nut\nBut um before I get into the possibility of what can happen with the Boston Red Sox\nMy heart really goes out to the people of of Pittsburgh today I Am sad in shock then it it really does\nHurt my heart to see the hate that going on but specifically just focusing on the victims I think too often we forget about the victims eleven people killed in that synagogues shooting\nAnd this is just absolutely awful please keep these people their families in your thoughts I can not imagine that somebody goes into any place of worship and they don't come out particularly when they live\nLife and they're in their fifties there in their eighties there was Ninety seven year old\nWoman imagine making those calls to help the families that\nTheir loved one was not coming back from going to a ... bought service in a synagogue I can and cannot even fathom that I Can't wrap my brain around it hold your loved ones tight and really left Tom for hate out\nI get it when we're passionate about sports sports and trash talking is way different than what the what's happening in a specially\nAgain focusing on the victims and their families and just how awful awful awful that is so that was waiting on me as I was watching the game last night I was getting a lot of messages from people and I know a lot of people in Pittsburgh and I feel you um how awful that is too\nFor that community and and uh again the communities around the coming together to help which is so wonderful\nLet's jump into baseball and tell you that the Boston Red Sox and you know this by now right are on the verge of winning the world series what a wild game it was again this year he's actually has been a good\nSeries and I'll tell you what I guarantee when you see all pointing jammed a three run Homer he was not thinking that the Boston Red Sox were going to war back into this particularly when it all happened\n'cause in watching that game you know they're going along a lot of zeros on the board until you get to the bottom of the six and then what happens is much more low income through for the red Sox and the top of the seven\nAnd then oh yeah another run is that it in the eighth and there's a guy named Steve Pearce whose family has gone crazy over his accomplishment and that game the first baseman for the red Sox he had a game where he was too for for including this huge moment check it out\nOr on a show for the Dodgers there's\n\n\nYeah eight to four and you know ultimately the dogs will come back and the red Sox towards the more on nine six thanks again to the red Sox radio network for that\nBut Steve Pearce was really the hero in that game or his bases clearing double phenomenal and the two Koch hits in that game overall amazing he grew up in Massachusetts his father talked to him a lot about\nThe ... and his contributions and what kind of a player he was they were crazy for the red Sox can you imagine if the red Sox when he's a big\nPiece of the reason why especially getting that key game coming off of losing to the Dodgers in a heartbreak or that was more than seven hours long and took eight team innings what a game that was\nWhat a game that was exactly what a game that was an everybody is talking about it today and I want to say that it's a lot of people are questioning and I have also friends in LA who are in the sports business and I talked to a couple of them this morning and all across LA radio people a lot of people are calling in and criticizing Dave\nRobert The manager for the Dodgers for not leaving hill in the game in fact here's what he had to say about that\nConversation with rich man's should keep an eye on me and I'm from and give it everything our house was quoted a hitter\nSo um when I was here to see what he's doing and so the walked boulevards store to lose a little bit of drugs are under the or the next is that with for years and I'm a lefty on the venture and the director started all year long getting out and\nTry to keep those weapons on the bench\nFor when drivers\nYou figure you got a trip to get a guy who really ... and then to potentially\n... or to the other guys off the bench so it was more of just\nThe conversation I had and just realize and an undiscovered gave if everything had him we do to get your uh\n[noise] All right so you can question the move than you know you look at what happened with the Dodgers in all seven Dodgers pitchers in last night's game were charged with at least one run setting a major league record by the way I think that little factoid is flying around all over the place so\n... you know the red Sox were exhausted just like the Dodgers were they were down in that whole down for runs and then they dug themselves out of the whole because once they had an opening any kind of opening\n\nHazel\nAmy I'm On a football Sunday and also World Series date night Red Sox and the Dodgers\nWhen we look at the NFL let's dive into the scoreboard they get you up to date on all of that you know the bears leading the jets they really have had their ...\nAlthough if you look at a board they hit the halfway point leading seven three but if you look at a ball control meaning a clock clock controlled time management they really hit the numbers there since Seventeen Thirteen\nThat's where I was Chicago on top in Chicago trying to pick up their fourth when just have a ball by the way right now\nStill a whole quarter to go we're in the last one fourteen minutes plus\nA they've got a second and Thirteen along one at the jets thirty five right now if you're curious about Michel ... some people had him in fantasy picked him up a hundred and Seventy four yards and to eat these three Cohen\nFive carries for yards and also in the Arabic catch Seventy yards one touched down for him for the bangles they've got a a little less than six minutes to play against the bucks in Cincinnati and the third quarter\nAnd they are leaving twenty seven six team the gym it's Winston sills putting up some pretty big numbers but there's been some Mrs even on some short passes that looked like they were right on the money so James Winston for two hundred and Seventy six passing and a CD and what is still the losing effort\nJoe mix and fantasy fans I Know we are heartbroken is somewhere in the building we're going to get the hospice but when you hear the hearts down you know that this was a fantasy alerts I Know [noise] Joe mix then I Want to Joe mix and I had no ... I had no shot at Joe mix and I kind of\nUp my my uh third team in fantasy 'cause I went and I did I went for the quarter back first although the quarterback getting me point sixteen seconds I'm sixteen carrying a hundred and fourteen yards\nAnd two touchdowns for Joe mix and I love that so they put down their energy drink and the hospice was right there Jay Jay is all over it in Culver City our technical maestro really getting people together on the show\nThe Seahawks blown up alliance twenty eight to seven this one's in Detroit\nAnd he got Thirteen minutes plus to go in the game Russell Wilson and having a really good game\nFourteen Seventeen two hundred and forty eight passengers in three touchdowns for heavy spread it out David Morris got a touchdown Chris Carson hasn't touched down on the ground us so the sea hawks would love to come away with just want to pick up their force if you think of where we are in the season\nWe are in the last quarter of this one the Broncos and the chiefs there was a lot of anticipation about this a game of course the genes\nAre leading thirty twenty ... homes and there's so many people that love this kid that are played with him at Texas Tech no harm is such a work ethic blah blah blah we can just go on and sings praises and if you're a fan of the\nPerson fantasy player you really hope that ... keeps doing what he's doing if you have them as your guy because two hundred and sixty four passengers for such down for a touchdown for pat ... homes and there's still time left on the clock Sammy walking with to Dee Dee there's another fantasy dude\nSo he's get new ah he's getting your your points for sure\nAnd the chiefs are continuing to roll whatever he's doing you know he is really managing the clock well I think the combination of as much as I Do at the end the read in the past actually for clock management\nAnd what he did in Philadelphia and the later years boy this is his guy pat my homes is the right quarterback for him right now there's no question and the cheese and all the weapons that they have\nRed skins and the giants I've been watching this game and this game is a strange game Adrian Peterson Seventeen Russia's for sixty one yards right now it's been fun to see\nWhat Peterson is trying to do with the red skins the Redskins lead the giants ten three they got a first in tenet New York's forty nine right now\nAnd they are trying to pick up their fifth when they leave the NFC ease the cowboys this week picked up a bar in Cooper\nThe white out that they desperately needed another weapon but they have a five week so um this would be good for the Redskins to pick this up especially with the eagles winning their game and London against Jacksonville Steelers\nFeeding the browns right now twenty three to twelve Ben Roethlisberger\nPassing for right now two hundred and thirty five yards to the D's\nHere's a fantasy guy I Love I Wish I had this guy James Caan are sixteen carries Ninety six yards and a touchdown Antonio Brown two touchdowns for him Steelers have the ball right now there are a Cleveland forty one second and\nTen is a big emotional day for Pittsburgh sadly because of the eleven that were killed in that synagogue\nMassacre just awful and they're honoring the are the people letting them know\nSending the love did that in the beginning of the game and you see their the iconic logo for the Steelers\nSo everywhere you look and talking about you know it's it's really not about hate obviously people it's about love\nAnd ... again great and not not um that I wouldn't have expected the Steelers to do something the history of the ... family and how they pour out and reach the community anyway and they're all shocked everyone shocked him good for the the dealers\nAre stronger than hate it's on a Twitter right now are trending it's got a disturbed David in in the Pittsburgh yellow color along the way or the red and the blue which is part of their logo as well so um\nYou're probably look it up and be easy to find him stuff and so you can post it on your Facebook or Twitter in in uh in solidarity with a with a committee of Pittsburgh\nYeah boy I mean honestly just so ah so sad but but great that the the people in Pittsburgh obviously are pulling together and trying to recognize the the families and and held however they can\nThe meantime ah the Panthers coming off of that incredible when over Philadelphia where they were down Seventeen nothing and put up Twenty one points in the fourth quarter of what a shock or that was what a great win for Carolina now they're at home bouncing off of that when trying to pick up their fifth against the ravens\nTwenty seven fourteen they lead\nTime is ticking away in the third quarter and we're going into the fourth quarter of that game I mentioned the Philadelphia Eagles feeding Jacksonville they did twenty four eight team a lot of people involved in that\nFor Philadelphia and Jacksonville having to settle for kicks the couple of times and that took away points for them and made a big difference obviously it was all about that for for Jacksonville and that there will continue when it comes to a ...\nIt's wild you'd never touched down two hundred and eighty six passing yards but Blake portals I think in the long run it happen at least not the answer and you think of some of the weapons they have on that Jacksonville team but\nPhiladelphia I Would say got away with that one because there were moments Jacksonville could have taken over that game Dan Wilkins joins us next from USA Today

Holmes the superstar going to seven and one that she said about that they will uh barring some something unforeseen however\nWhen there's still time on the clock I Know better than just say book it that they're like three hundred and three passing yards absolutely amazing I'll tell you what was amazing I was watching this just before jumping on the air Adrian Peterson my friend\nBoy it's like new life for him\nWith the red skins and he just ramble for sixty four yard\nA for the red skins against a horrible giant defense today and the red skins are up on the giants twenty six twenty six\nAlmost at the two minute warning right now in fact there just underneath that time just kicked out so a\nBoring nothing the giants are going to be one and seven and the red skins who are already leave the end of the east will be five and two\nSignificant for fantasy people Adrian Peterson a hundred and forty nine yards and again the touchdown twenty six carries man you think of all the loop ... Beckham junior has an incredible player is\nHow frustrating it must be seven catches a hundred and twenty five yards as much as he get the dog he's certainly competitor\nAnd um this team is going knew where he lie manning who interceptions two hundred and fifty one yard\nBut uh the giants look sloppy all the way around I watched big chunks of this game and uh they're everything they're built to be horrible\nThe the rest of the action from the day the brilliance of me doing the show which I Love it I get to\nWatch what's going on a early in the morning especially with the London games and then I get the the big chunk of the games before we jump on the air and then we wrap that up and then sent it into the afternoon game so let's roll through those\nAnd it includes this one that just one final the bears knocking off the jets twenty four to ten ... ski happy in front of the home crowd another when they're three in one at soldier field so two hundred and twenty\nThink a couple of touchdowns Jordan Howard on the ground eighty one yard that it's such down\nAnd this is a nice pickup for Chicago without a doubt especially with the jets getting a lot of air hot air breeds into them about Sam Darnell Dodgers you know a couple of games are amazing how he can air that\nHe couldn't do that this time it was a much different story there when you look at the other side of it um it was brutal they just couldn't they didn't have any answers um\nYou know it just imagine Sam's Arnold\n... he did what he could do but he didn't have a lot of weapons around him because they've got a lot of injuries that they're dealing with\nAnd you know the bears in there when with that deep and they didn't even have ... Mack the Mac attack\nWas not there because it would have been probably a much worse than ever I don't know what have you done that them points on the board I mean that's how bad it would have been\nFor the buccaneers you got a fits magic back in and James Winston who was benched because he had four interceptions and the Bengals were role and they put up\nTwenty seven points in the first half to nine and against the buccaneers right now though the buccaneers are threatening the the Bengals trying to hang on thirty four twenty six left them four minutes to go in the game\nFour minutes to go this one just wrapping up a few moments ago sea hawks beat the lions on the road twenty\nFour team Russell Wilson had a nice kind of steady game Twenty one point that was the key in the first half of the seven of the lions\nAnd then in the second half just an adding another seven to that and the lions couldn't get anything going offensively even though Matt Stafford had a couple of touchdowns\nThe Redskins and the giants like I said and started this thing off you look at Peterson and you look at where they are and now that with just a couple of minutes left in it and the cheese Broncos that I mentioned a couple of minutes left in that less than two on both of those\nSteelers wrapped up the browns thirty three to eight team Ben Roethlisberger two hundred fifty seven passing yards and to teach these Steelers honoring\nReally um with their logo that's been altered on Facebook and other areas\nFor the the people who were killed in that horrible synagogue massacre on Saturday So some really heavy hearts but a big win for the Steelers\nAnd um you know to give people something to think about the shake them out of what is just horrific and and there are no answers for that is sad\nI mean preach love not hate no matter what nobody wants to walk into any kind of place of worship and fearing especially for their grandparents their parents or whatever and so many of them didn't come back from those of services you're\nUSA Today has some pictures of some tributes for fans game of the game is a tribute to the to a synagogue or one of the picture says hatred champ weekend a city of steel\nAnd they also have you know the players there than they have the uh the stronger than have a sticker on some of the uh equipment there at the ah Heinz Field as well\nAnd then says Pittsburgh is stronger than hate is another sign of spare\nUm and then the flags at half mast them a Pittsburgh fan has the starved able shalom a written underneath that on one of the ... there in the crowd so there's some a loving tributes I'm sure there's other ones that are too numerous to mention that we\nWon't be able to get to but uh I'm Glad to see the people's Pittsburgh stand behind a the I think was the tree of life synagogue was the name of a place\nAnd so uh you know our our here at NBC Sports where you are fair to speak for all of a share that our thoughts and prayers are with these families\nAnd you know if you know them um be there for them and uh don't talk much but listen to them just be there for them just you know being willing to you know London you know a hand and say you know I'm here for you\nYeah absolutely so that was just a Jacobs the corps who is our technical maestro and he's right I Would echo the same thing it's about listening in and that's it and just having that the shoulder and certainly the city of Pittsburgh I Know and I know that um the Steelers and again everything they represent sometimes sports is that\nA healing mechanism sounds odd to say that but I Know that from personal experience as I was\n... I went through nine eleven at WFAN in New York and I saw how the people really reached out and lean on the station in a good way and we were there to offer something some kind of\nRespite I guess from thinking of what the horrific things had had happened on that horrible day but certainly when we're talking about the the synagogue ... back into it\n\nGod\n\nLot\nOf Bengal friday not been it into overtime against Tampa Bay everybody ...\nNBC Sports radio Randy bullet their kicker his longest fit the by the yard we'll see what happens amazing what's going on\nThe buccaneers they were down in the second half Twenty one nothing they've come all the way back to either game\nThirty for each and Ryan Fitzpatrick the magic is back he was brought in gym it's Winston than chapter for interceptions so of course we'll keep you up to date on the end of that game but now it's time to try to nail the score with the crew from Culver City\nSunday night for the St Louis recruited brought up [noise] for sure [noise] with the middle school\nI liked that show up and put up or shut up\nI think than the Vikings jets big zoo here here before me to the fabulous show on Sunday and it just doesn't credible updates all throughout the week except for here on N. B. C. he truly is one of the guys at the at the sports radio network so\nJeff having said that ... year projections then\nPool it's been a little bit er I haven't been right on on the score but at least we're starting to pick the winners for somebody that's a plus ... [laughter]\nI like that I'll take it to anything I can do something right I'm good with it what do you think happens ear\nI you know it's it's weird I I Know it it it should be pretty black and white but [noise]\nI I really I I think the Vikings are are going to win but I'm going to pick the sinks to women twenty seven twenty four\nTwenty seven twenty four All right Jeff I like it cools so let's see what that thank you let's see what Jay Jay says what do you think Josh\nBut we're going to have a split decision right over here near to break the tie case because I think even though if they're pretty good I mean they're both very good teams Minnesota's fortune one New Orleans is five and one's\nA New Orleans is twenty some office however Minnesota is twelve and all sense and their defense is a little bit better for New Orleans is from Minnesota however I think it's still going to be Minnesota ever since her home the fans are they're the kind of a move the crowd\nAnd are looking for the average of scores I mean it's going to be Minnesota thirty four New Orleans thirty one\nThirty four thirty one Minnesota\nOur son break at that time I think Drew Brees is going to have a magical game not pick her cousins mowed it could be a high scoring kind of game I like a New Orleans and this and I like New Orleans to win it thirty for two or twenty seven\nThirty for twenty seven so it's kind of around that cut line for what they say the over under sexually want to say it's under but it's close enough of the line of that game was well over fifty plus in fact it was fifty four to be exact so I'm just a few under it\nI like it the Sunday I came as always entertaining my friends there is no doubt about it I don't have to sell you on it 'cause it is what it is\nAs good football it's ... it's it's it's almost like it's almost like the peacock network\nIs getting more than lucky so most of these games have been phenomenal I either their\nDefensive kind of games or the arid out game or a so tight and then that the big comeback it it's really been an incredible thing uh yeah and it's been an incredible season of Sunday night games a lot more specific than that by the way I did\nI did a little checking a little digging\nIs this past week and I'm man I'm\nTelling you it's yeah I think we're going to see another game I really do maybe a barn burner may be maybe maybe maybe and we'll see whether or not Cincinnati can make the kick whether Randy Bullock is going to be the hero or they're going to go back in to\n'em or they're going to go into overtime I shouldn't say back into overtime after giving up a tremendous lead\nBoy Ryan says Patrick has to be frustrated because what an effort to to with a to point conversion amazing shaking off to tackle making it happen and then to get to the point where they're at a thirty for each\nAnd this is it I mean he makes his kick them the bangles walk away with it in a scape after given all those points back\nOr else they go into the overtime 'cause there'll be like two seconds there won't be any seconds left on the clock by the tiny ticks by the time he kicks it rather old it should take off there's five seconds on the clock [noise]\nUm so what a crazy finish to that see it's never over when you think it's ever it's just like the Philly game last week it seemed like they had Baghdad and then Caroline and comes back even with Philadelphia with a chance to win it\nGetting right down there in the red zone where they could have scored a touchdown and that would have been it but we'll see it's a forty four yard attempt for Bullock and as I sit here I Am watching it so I can give you a the play by play of it to my friends so he's going to feel like the hero there is no there is a flak\n[laughter] too soon [laughter]\nYeah well for I can do better or worse if it's your team and\nThey messed you up or something happen if it's something if it's you know if it's on the other side no problem it depends on whether it's a holding what it is I'm at the penalties are declined or what the penalties are climbing with offsetting I don't know why [laughter]\nWhy nobody I was watching\nIt and telling everybody driving around doing their honey do list thing that that's a huge moment for him I said as long as there's fifty five but still when there's pressure at the end they had the edge to the bangles walk away with that good for them by the way the cold put up seven on the raiders\nAnd the ... go in the first quarter Andrew Luck\nSeventy yard and a touchdown blowout Cox the recipient of that and I'm\nA boy with Andrew Luck like to get another went on the board against the readers who are one and five we've got a bunch of vinyl and these afternoon games that are getting underway like the forty niners and the cardinals that one just kicked off the Packers\nAnd the rams same thing underway we talked about this Sunday night game\nBeing the game of the week I'm I'll tell you what it is such a great set up\nWhen you watch NBC getting all the highlights and the great interviews and all that kind of stuff\nBefore the game it's the perfect you know what I Do I can tell America would I Do\nSo I work out of the morning get prep for the day and then I'm just ready to put the dent in the couch although we had so many Denton the couch\nHad to get new furniture so I I'll watch the game\nDid you buy

slamming out the negativity so that gundy after what happened at the tail end of that a game Oklahoma State knocking off the number six team and that really kind of messes up the big twelve\nAnd ... in some ways it's funny 'cause I think social media is brilliant I I think there are great aspects to social media it save lives um news breaks on it that's real news\nAnd people some people are thoughtful have pithy comments I like to the comments or some decent trash talking that's not a noxious and rude and growth and crude and whatever so I get it\nSo I'm going to say like we open up the

they belong in the ... box and what is set up there too because\nYou liked the way that the reporter asked them the question of there's a lot of noise out there what what are we talking about he knew right away he's like I'm isn't social media is it are we talking about what are we talking about like he he lifts off three different things and one of them and social media 'cause\nHe knows that on Twitter things come out on Twitter all the time\nSo and he takes a lot of heat you know he took a lot of criticism\nThe whole season anyway has so far because he didn't stick with his quarterback Taylor Cornelius\nSo when you know they talk about the status of him the team that everything else um what's happening with the pope offensively ... you know are they running about too much later here's the thing college football fans are passionate passionate group especially the lungs right\nSo even even those that go there but you're gonna get you're gonna get flares you're going to get criticism by the way Packers just scored a touchdown\nIs Graham stepping up big and we'll see if they get that extra points so they put the first points on the board and what I think it's one of the big games of the week in the NFL\nIs you know you watch what the rams have methodically been able to do week in week out frankly exciting but never ever count the Packers out for the Packers putting

thirty four got the two point conversion it was Swedish took off the nasty tackle and then that's what happened the Bengals had just enough time for a little bit of a comeback less than two minutes to go\nAnd set up that field goal the field goals made and you heard of the rest is history 'cause they pick up that when the\nIn the meantime let's dive into the three games going on right now and what are those three games Indy and Oakland right now Oakland on top of Indianapolis Thirteen to ten I've been waiting for the game the\nThe rams and Green Bay and this one Green Bay on top seven nothing by the way that swinging into the second the first game I mentioned is midway through the second quarter the evidence of where we are\nFourteen minutes from the locker room as a to point conversion for San Francisco and uh San Francisco and Arizona they go to the to the edge safety I should say to the edge\nOver Arizona and and uh what's going to be probably a long long long\nDay is what I'm assuming and then the Sunday night game is New Orleans and Minnesota can't wait for that one kicks at age twenty it's on NBC and all of the uh the\nReally the the day what happened on the day is wrapped up so brilliantly by the NBC crew\nSo I look forward to this every single week what happened during the day and that was earlier games\nThan if the stats for you we have those and plus injury report we got a dive into the injury report will do that in our next segment as we motor through here and then I mentioned the Sunday game\nAnd we'll look at the\nWill get the Sunday night game from this perspective of the same talking to Larry holder a columnist for the athletic no law\nTo talk about their side of it and Drew Brees and you know what this game means to them except for what they have to do just frankly they act as an oath of it as they march in and try to figure out how to play that Mike Zimmer of it's pretty crafty as\nThe coach of the the uh\nThe Vikings and to me last year losing the way they did and then if the championship game to the eagle\nHe's had that on his mind I think throughout the summer going into training camp except for and then of course a new life with Kirk Cousins and what was going to be like and I think that era is just starting to really tick and this could be an\nExcellent game I'm I I think it's going to go perhaps just under the point total\nIn fact we do this nailed the score thing\nAnd I have I have New Orleans winning\nBut not by\nNot by very much my friends let's put it that way not by very much I I also want to dive into this right at the top because I don't want to forget it to me um\nA big role in my life and especially when we talk about the post season it's like\nIt's like a whole new season the you got the red Sox after the incredible season they had in the Dodgers storylines coming back after losing\nTwo of the Houston Astros\nTo to try to erase that feeling and get the chance to come all the way back and compete in the world series and now they find themselves in a three one hole at home where the red Sox can wrap them up in front of that Los Angeles crowd although there's a lot of Red Sox fans there\nDavid Price get the ball how fitting for Boston Clinton Kirsch all equally fitting if you look at the start of the theories\nUp he gets the ball for Los Angeles\nAnd there's all kinds of conversation about first of all that marathon game that the Dodgers one thanks to max Muncie in the bottom of the eight teams seven hours twenty minutes on friday I stayed up for it it was tough getting up the next day and then the Saturday game where they were ahead\nAnd and then gave it back so I mean this is that kind of a series where the red Sox have had their own heroes and the Dodgers have had their own heroes but just not enough I mean wow the pitching options now for the Dodgers\nDavid Price started game too on Wednesday\nAnd pitched in relief game three on friday there he is the picture like I said who wants to more than redeem himself with people who have trashed him for post season play\nAnd I think he's already kind of answered that bell but he would really answer the bell if\nHe was responsible for the world series wins the red Sox scored more runs in the series with two out seven team that isn't credible than the Dodgers have scored in those situations they've stranded way too many I mean just way too\nMany so there's all kinds of ways to look at the end where this could\nYou know could go and it might have been a surprise a lot of people thought that perhaps ... sale would start game five on Sunday night and Alex Cora decided to go with David\nPrice decided to go with price in dead\nOh my oh my and then you know\nYou've got day Robert The Dodgers manager who's being questioned about rich hill\nAnd not keeping him in the game as he was pitching well and then making the changes and then seeing what would happen so much so that the craziest thing happened you had the president's tweet about it and Dave Roberts\nYou know saying uh the president said what I'm happy tuning in I don't know how many Dodger games he's watch I don't think he's privy to any of my conversations with\nRich bill and what we said so much more than Steve here and um you know a crew lead the way the red Sox had a four run deficit they turned that into a victory nine six and now they're almost ready to pop the champagne but maybe not so fast\nBrought to you by Feeding America and the ad council\nWhy it's my time hunting troubling for finding lowest airfare to stumble

white to the outside right make that left to the right after this handing off our\nYear old and a half hour and that had a drive with Jordan our the fourth quarter [noise]\nAll right thanks to the bears radio network for that Chicago beating the jets twenty four and right now boy for ... for the rams added Houma\nThey've had to settle for that because the the Packers are beating them tend to nothing although the plot turns into a pass\nAnd how 'bout that the rams trying to shake things up with the trick play for they needed that 'cause they were looking so bad they had that third and one\nSo uh we'll see if they can convert and make something happen there Arizona and San Francisco in this one you would think maybe the forty niners eat out their suits terrible\nTeams but the boy oh boy the forty niners have had their own problems in this and and when I say their own problems of the cardinals are ahead three to\nEnd this isn't the SAT down with less than eight to go they get a field goal which do you know pretty big really if you think about how bad off and play\nAnd you know is that noise a factor crowd noise they're trying to get them in at the forty niners have been jostled up a few times they had a couple of false starts\nAnd they had a call two times out because of being messed up with what they were doing on the field so that's pretty big I think they're shaking them up and the J ... third so far not showing much of anything either three of seven thirty one yard\nBut uh that's where we're at at this point in that game and let me hit up the other game the other game of course is uh Indy and Oakland indeed trying to make something happen on the road against Oakland\nYou would think if you were looking at this game and I listen to what a lot of people had to say prediction wise we get thirty five seconds until they're at the half Oakland on top four teams and indeed trying to make something happen they had a a a good chance to do that third and four but luck with the in complete\nPass a short one to see why him and so guess what happens there twenty five yard field goal and uh they'll take the points but raiders Fort team the third team\nGoing into the the the half for that game you know Halloween is coming up and when you think of Halloween I think of a make a list of scary movies and I'm\nI'll tell you the top of my list from all time for a long time ago it'd be pulled her guys and also return of the living dead one of the actors who play a role in both of those movies has died Joshua Jacobs always\nGet in touch with

have the new one in six teams playing against each other I talked about that Josh Rose in trying to make something happen for the cause no and they've got six twenty seven bill left before they call it a half\nAnd he's trying to drive that ball down the field corporate the cardinals against the forty niners the Packers have the ball they're still trying to make stuff happened where the midway

Joe Buck's at us you know the bullpen got used up a lot everybody I think they had yeah pitchers pitch on friday night so if you can give Richfield one more ending of ending the third venue just avoid using one more guy\nNow I've seen some of the arguments why he should have been pulled he struggles fourth time around in the lineup is very hard he's an older guy there are a lot of like logical reasons I guess that's when you look at it like what was what was the managers got you got probably should have told you to keep her a Chilean\nConsolidation or even loan rehabilitation\nSeven seven for three to visit us online\n\n[noise]\n\nMy mother way to get your voice is three to six\nWeeks being twenty four seven bases NBC Sports radio\nNBC Sports radio dot com\nBack in ... up and pass coming out on a Sunday night [noise] fun\nSports we get lots of basketball a lot to hockey mhm tons of baseball it's a pretty pretty darn good football college probably give me a quick grade of tap your head for college this week as far as the excitement and drama\nOwe me I'm gonna see not to juicy for the college football weekend it was um [noise]\nIt was not as impactful some of the headlines make it out to be some of the teams weren't playing some teams are playing were just cruising uh I Would say looking real quick I'll go through him um Clemson smokes Florida State navy smokes a starting Notre Dame smokes navy\nTexas loses to Oklahoma State if you remember the damn patch for the day we're going to the games\nAnd I said I go to Texas Oklahoma State because I just had the feeling Texas would give up that they shouldn't Texas play off on the first quarter and then really turn it on the last three quarters but it wasn't enough Oklahoma State held him off this is terrible for taxes\nBecause they were in a really good position or their six into which is good but they had a a role going they're going to really this loss by three points to Oklahoma State and then losing the Maryland early in the season\nTexas she'll be undefeated right now [noise]\nGeorgia handles Florida Oklahoma handles Kansas State Kentucky is now seven to one and connected to be a top ten team in a couple of days\nI'm nothing too much else very juicy you know you go down the line I had Penn State and it let them go a real names you see them\nPick at the end of that game yeah thirty twenty four Iowa the former yard line if the Iowa receiver just turned around the ball in his hands yeah that uh Penn State we see on TV get to um\nNeal is the only the Iowa a quarterback is usually really good not one of his better games gave it up they went from northwestern thirty one Seventeen over Wisconsin and that's about it next week will be much more juicy\nSo that it's probably too late but Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence ... if he had started week one and just had the ... he definitely would have been strong candidate because\nThey're just they're basically like Alabama to their ... I mean\nThey put it day kind of ended the Florida State entire thing last yes right that was unbelievable and Trevor Lourdes I'd never seen a true freshman play that I'm going to throw it out there yeah he looks like he's thirty five years old\nAnd I'm going to leave you very ... years old yeah so but ah yeah I watch it a minute I called you know either side that were deeply about a ... it's been a number whatever All right I feel so good about that I have no idea what's going to happen now you've got three years but we'll see\nNext week is pretty juicy uh actually college football Alabama LSU and that's primetime perfect one versus four and LSU could be up a couple of spots couple to keep an eye on next week no redeeming northwestern dangerous\nOr going up the line Michigan hosting Penn State Michigan needs to keep rolling to go against Ohio State and they can get right into playoff picture\nThan a Texas in West Virginia was supposed to be good Georgia Kentucky now Georgia should roll talent wise but that could be one of those games that you got to keep an eye\nYeah I mean we get a caller we called Alabama LSU game of the century or do we not do that anymore\nI think we're off that 'cause we've had like seven of them and it's only like two thousand Eighteen\nRarely does that game live up to the hype is always like nine six or something although\nThere's a game years ago like seven years ago that uh ten years ago ... six three and was supposed to be the game down here\nYou know I Wonder how to do that but that's about ... to ... start earlier today in London it's amazing how the NFL Network has now surrounding these London games all our friends are basically in London right now Paul I don't know why we're not there Peter ... sidelined rich ... in a Forman booth calling the game it was sort of the\nTypical London game it was like six three as and I was approaching then eagles hold on twenty four when controversial fumble reversal by New York\nNaturally agreed is is uh what are we is this the ... here is is a bad one or the jags have no other options\nI think the jet well it's tough they may not have an option for this year but they should know what the young talent they have on this team that\nHe's not the future you've seen all his cards you've seen them with good players good wide receivers good running backs the defense\nAnd it's it's probably not going to get much better and you're going to let another season slip by well once you direct rookie cornerback a quarterback and have a rich contracting\nCondemned trying bringing up a decent a starter but I think it's more interesting in this game as that's the most Carson wins Carson when says look this year Twenty one for thirty three touchdowns he kept a lot of plays alive and made some great passes he ran double six times for twenty yards which you don't like but you know he's going to do it\nAnd he looked like he's fully back and I I don't want health but whatever timing and against the jaguars defense I thought when slipped fantastic\nWhat's funny his numbers are great I still I still see a slightly different player fumbling interception earlier\nTo hold off at ... ... actually it's not him off as as a whole does not scare you anything like last year did you feel a little bit non threatening a Jimmy Carter was playing better but there's no rhyme game so he's racked up a lot of passing sets\nI'm not fully convinced that of course I'm an eagles fan lifelong were born to be cynical like the other she's kind of like you would bears quarterbacks we can't believe it or anything\nYeah but you don't want the running game they had Josh Adams the rookie out of Notre Dame yeah he'd come in big back and if he can stay healthy because he had some problems early in the season that can be a nice bonus out of nowhere if that team for the for the eagles\nAll right well see I'm a little cynical and then ... you might win that division and is the most bizarre story of the year I think the Redskins feed the giants but Adrian Peterson runs for a hundred and forty nine rumbles down the field is sixty four yard touchdown right like\nI almost felt bad for running down the field is that it was an old man Adrian Peterson touchdown and he was still faster than everybody yeah he was about half the speed of the aging Peterson from eight years ago\nRight but he he looks like you know a guy who used to be a dream Peterson but he still has a lot of strength enough even number moves guy he was more of a power cutting back and he still has that 'cause he's still built like a truck\nAnd but he couldn't tear away from people like he was getting caught at the end but you know I'm Glad because he had a great career it it got muddled by a bunch of different injuries and suspensions\nBut ah he's he's back he's going to put up some nice numbers in it but it's going to trumpet someday he's gonna be at like sixteen thousand yards and you're going to say you should be a twenty\nHe you know I disagree with you on that because the legs of the legs you got so many carries if it doesn't matter because I'm thirty five or thirty to be the only reason he's doing this is because he took a year off\nThat is true that is true they are going to have the mileage 'cause he missed thirty five games of thirty three games for the chicken soup\nIs anyone ever going to catch Emmett because even if he was healthy I feel like I'm it's Eighteen guys guys run like that anymore\nNow let's see for an average out for a number of reasons they're tuned systems runny eyes don't get paid the devaluation of position at the idea that ... records going to get broke\nI Would bet my house on doesn't have in our lifetime\nI'm a thousand percent with\nComing

see a game\nAll his interceptions where his fault I saw\nA driving factor comes I'm ... I'm not you know no fence James Winston you stink\nAs stumped today Brian Fitzpatrick remember him from September comes in a loving to Fifteen one Ninety four two touchdowns just woke them up tied the game to point conversion Bengals cruised down and get the win but more importantly if you were the box would you dump James Winston I trade deadline and can you\nOh no no no no it's a trade for James I think that would you dump him\nYou know just get idle indices and returning from yeah well that's interesting I didn't even think that people have been talking about James is on the trademark either hurt anything but I Would think that the future is not James Winston because as you said coming to the year that you thought they weren't too high on them anyway not by the way that\nYou have to realize the one thing the Bengals have the worst events in the league so that come back with so inevitable I write you know quasi bagels and they actually fell below Atlanta's a number thirty two defense in the lead they can't tackle anyone so the bucks\nThat active Davis who played half decently the bucks would have won that game like fifty one to forty nine so it's but Jamie issue right David space one really good throw and then\nOne really bad throat and they don't make any sense I Can't figure out why he's not a better quarterback\nShe kind of reminds me it's apples and oranges Jay cutlery remember running Harrison said we could always count on color to give us one got the color is going to force a play that gives us an easy interception I Know it's going to him during the game and I just waiting for it and that's what James feels like he's got all the talent you big strong he can throw it far\nBut he seems like he's always going to force went in\nUm ... like Brett Farr pharmacy or gave up as many as he got\nUm so that you know he I think the career could be over there especially financially because they've got to pay him they want to re sign up for next year but he'll\nGet another starting job by the way I think he's got too much out he's got a great deep all the intermediate games where he actually gets in more trouble so I think he I don't have another NFL life\nCome more games on a hit bears twenty four ten over the jets only really interesting 'cause the bears are now foreign three witches sauce in that division traverse getting a nice day more so off the field and on the two touchdowns\nA bears play well they did it was all ... the ankle injury they arrested Columbus but more importantly brought to UC Michel ... you have to the stadium for Halloween\nYeah oh well I did I hear about are you kidding me is that get out of a sudden my phone's voter up palm paths I'm busy big cat began begat oh no first of all I just say they didn't play well they play they beat the jets without their top two receivers ... and ... and\nDon't worry at MIT arrayed do and then they that they go to the bills\nAnd Derek ... next week so we're going to have this like ticket it bears every five three to get in the playoffs their schedule is such cake um I just I'm just a little bit I I agree with this case where I'm rooting against my friend's ...
