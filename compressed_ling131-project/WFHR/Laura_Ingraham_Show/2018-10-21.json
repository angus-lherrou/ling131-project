radio on the NBC Sports radio mobile apps for\nThe short and we had an action packed our number one highlighted by the chargers holding on to beat the titans in London twenty tonight team to the story that getting the titans had the chance to win it at the end\nLike for able went for two but the play called didn't work out the way that he wanted markets Mario to who had moved the ball very very well with his legs on that drive and really in the second half Marquez Mario to rule that was right and try to\nPick up a completion on two plays had a penalty against the chargers but on both play is basically the same plane rolled out to his right\nAnd tried to find somebody open in the end zone where the past didn't work out and the chargers hold on for the win twenty tonight teen\nAnd they get a when they're five and two the titans fall to three and four and their struggles continue offensively although they did move the ball better in the second half they finally got the running game going with the Lewis and also Derek Henry\nBut uh the titans are disappointing three and four\nAnd other charges like I said a big when they're five and two right behind the chiefs in the AFC West well it was a big day for Philip Rivers through a couple of touchdown passes one to Tyrone Williams the other to Mike Williams and it is time to welcome back to the program kind enough to join his eye on a game day our quarter back here\nAt the network you hear him under center during the week mark Malone\nAnd mark is you know we have some really nice matchups once again this week highlighted by the patriots coming up that forty three point performance over the cheese at soldier field against the bears team that got sunburned in Miami the expected to bounce back at home talking about the bears and this one today and what about the patriots on the road well\nI mean listen you're taking on a patriots football team it seems to have gotten a treat under them a little bit meanwhile ... Chicago went down in Miami and had an opportunity to be ... dolphins and couldn't get it done in part I think that probably has a little something to do with the fact that [noise]\n... ended up with an ankle injury wasn't quite himself afterwards um and I don't know how close Jeff he's going to beat a hundred percent against his patriots team about Tom Brady traditionally gets the ball up as faster faster than anybody in the NFL which we'll minimize a clue back a little bit [noise]\nUh and and to me when you look at the Chicago team\nThis was about not Michel ... throwing six touchdowns which he did what two weeks ago\nIs it about him managing the football game and allowing that defense to go to work um I gained a defensive specialist Mac is healthy against this New England ... that uh is now got some balance and it's only my shell\nHas become you know kind of their their lead bell ... fuel and the running game you got James why does still run it\nBut there's a terrific job out of the bacterial and the passing game or we're seeing Josh scored now get more and more targets every uh every week so um this is a pretty good patriots team I Would be surprised if Chicago could beat them even if ah they're they're playing at soldier field but it ought to be an interesting match up to keep an eye on\nYeah looking forward to that one and another intriguing matchup it's a little bit later on the saints coming off of there by week or at Baltimore Ravens are the only team left that Drew Brees has not beaten and they have the number one ...\nYeah how about that how you would think Drew Brees would've done through the entire NFL of\nBy now but still has a beating the rabies ... this is interesting I mean you go back and watch the tape of what the ravens did defensively\nLast week against Marcus burial to and the titans football team again Mary able to complete a ten passes was sacked eleven times\nAh and they run this what they call it a ... type of what the defense were bunch of guys standing around the line of scrimmage and create some issues for the quarterbacks uh in terms of you know who's coming who's not coming where the read start and what coverage is they're going to be in the titans weren't able to\nTo solve that issue I think Drew Brees will probably tear that that defense apart it's about quick strike I think they will probably go up temple\nI I also think that you also leave yourself open to you know getting cash because people are just kind of milling around and walking around and uh you you start asking yourself all who's got what gap and one of the gap responsibilities here and if that doesn't get to his gap and play it soundly then all of a sudden you open yourself\nWhether it's ... or Ingram I think the biggest question with the saints and I really like this football team of four of the season opened up as as what what were they able to get fixed on the defensive side of the football that has been their shortcomings they don't have to be a top five defense if they can be a top ten or its top twelve defense I think the office is good enough\nFor them to uh to make a pretty deep run into the postseason as a matter of fact uh but I'm I'm interested to see exactly how the saints handle this this ... defense of of the ravens and I think that will ultimately a play a big part of who wins this football game\nBecause you know Jacksonville used to have the number one defense they were humiliated in Dallas they're back home to take on the Texans today are they kind of at a cliff right now talking about the jags him and this is this like a a key point now in their season and it's the shuttle wants to get to be able to make it through the season\n[laughter] yeah well first of all I don't think there's any question Jeff with regard to a turning point for this Jacksonville football than we thought they were the best defense in the NFL they'd given up Seventy points over the last two weeks\nA I was shocked at how much zone they ended up playing against the Dallas football team that really doesn't have any weapons at the wide receiver position and they just got gassed or didn't get much pressure on dad Prescott\nA they've got to play a lot better on that side of the football they've got to recover corner so I don't know why you don't put Bouvier and Jay Leno Ramsey a man of an situations especially if the Dallas you know they'll they'll have their hands full with with ah with full or and and uh and uh and Hopkins this weekend but beyond that you mentioned what's going on\nIn Houston with the office and particularly the Sean watching that is maybe one of the worst the NFL offensive line I've seen in a very very long time so they shouted Watson now is in part running for his life\nAnd he hasn't figured out yet when they get down and he's taken some unbelievable hits\nBelow Brian I think is still trying to call some place that have a run pass option for his quarterback again putting him at more and more risk\nIf he goes down with an injury and let's face it he's not as big as strong as for instance a deck Prescott as if he goes down I think the season is over in Houston so they've got to find a way to score and more points and become more efficient without dish on watching getting hit a because if if that continues to happen I don't expect him to make it through the season\nAre

office would be more dynamic because I don't even cook would be available for them in the backfield and he's a guy that not only can run the ball very well but he's got out of the backfield catching a

sums up to me the the whole play helping experience right I mean they look great at home when big games at home at the coliseum have that nice streak and then kind of losing the road and I don't know I I I Know they have a young quarterback but you don't see you don't see other teams like Alabama and\nSome of the bigger programs you know just\nFall off a cliff if they lose a player maybe I'm being unrealistic but just a little disappointed that I I don't know I'm just I I question this whole USC coaching staff for a while\nI'm I'm you know I'm with you I've been very frustrated especially with the redstone off and at least there I saw some lights go off a couple of weeks ago when they actually passed the tide in I thought it was in the fall over and and just than just gone unconscious for a minute but they threw the tide and\nThey actually went to the big baby elephants are backfield inside the red zone inside the five a couple of times a couple of weeks ago so\nI thought that maybe ... who's going to turn it around nice guy I thought he ... you know I Would have hired coach ... myself who's now down there at LSU us seek I really thought he was the man for the job back then didn't really hate the clay health and firing 'cause I thought\nA U.S he was just running kind of out of control and a lot of uh undisciplined but it's starting to creep back and they need someone to just understand the whole culture there and it's going to get to meet and this and some top that's back in ... in in into that team and then just you know put some great back into that red zone off as as they do the Baltics really that's funny but\nIt's so hard to watch when they don't put points that you know touchdowns in that red zone so yeah I I think the experiment like you said it's ... it's hard to watch and I I think it's over I think they're going to have to make a move here at the end of the season\nYeah and I'm with you with coach yo I I thought that he earned the job with what he did when he stepped in there and I thought it was kind of a raw deal the way that that went down but I'm happy that the coach Joe and LSU they didn't they didn't trip up after the big one last week that they had a number twenty to Mississippi State at home yesterday got it done and\nYou know I'll say this I I I'm not I'm not saying that they're gonna they're gonna beat Alabama but I'm just saying when you look at the teams in the SEC one thing that the tigers do seem to have they they do have a pretty good secondary and I'm just saying you know the way that to attend goodbye low and that the officers rolling for the tide\nI Am saying they they can maybe make a competitive game out of it you you never know if things go their way a big emotional\nI I like what coach always doing there with el issue and I hope it keeps it going [noise]\nI I Do too I think is a great guy I really think they missed out I I still don't understand the reason I didn't ... that LSU look sound like you said you know they went on the road to Florida oh okay they lost if they know they lost the game they're out of it well they're not out of it you know it's tough to win in Florida right now or just got a great defense they play fast LSU\nGame that one too straight on a big game at night at home you know LSU is probably the toughest place to play at night in the NCAA they came back with a strongly Nineteen to three and ... yeah I kind of agree with you I think they have the deep as do it I don't think Michigan has anywhere near the office to beat Alabama but I think they have a defense some that might make\nThe game interesting that they got a couple of break\nBut right now I'm looking at this I think you've got Clemson analysis you might be the only two teams that we give Alabama a game in a national championship setting\n[noise] yeah well next week we of Georgia hosting Florida that's going to be the big game and the answer to see um [noise] you mentioned Michigan I'm you know we I think last time you were and we talked about Jim horrible on his situation and you know to their credit after that you know embarrassing loss the opener at Notre Dame\nThey're playing better or they have a really good defense um what do you think of Michigan [noise] I\nI like their defense I mean they've they've played strong yesterday and the game that maybe last year definitely two years ago they lose 'em they spent the whole time\nThe whole first happened inside the fifty yard line of a Michigan State and they only came away with those seven points they just don't have enough off and I think the quarterback Claire still shaky\nBut they're getting better they can run the ball or you know you play Alabama you're not going to run the ball like Michigan likes to run the polish means you're gonna have to throw the ball and they just don't do it well enough\nTo beat in Alabama but I think this is the year ... gets off the hot seat and he finally reached Michigan State\nHe's probably going to beat Ohio State um I think he's definitely safest job for a couple of years and got people off the bat if he can get Ohio State\nIf he can get that when they get to the playoffs I think he's definitely got that will it's going to look for somebody else\nAll right David ... co host of the sports cast podcast you can follow him at bud knock her and of course a tell us about the

again at ... and you can check out his ... his his podcast these sports ... sports cast podcast\nBreaking down college football every Wednesday\nAnd so we'll see that's the way things kind of are right now I mean it looks like you've got Alabama all alone and then another level I I think George is going to bounce back I think they were just kind of\nKind of similar to like what we've seen with the Vikings and the eagles and the NFL you just you have that big season and it just it's such a high and yet you still come up short the way that they did you lose and it's like you you come back and just kind of takes a while to get get a crank up again\nAnd that sounds like an excuse\nBut it's not it just just kind of the way it goes but there\nI think they were kind of trending they were kind of do for a lost the way that they started the season but I think they're going to bounce back and get things going again\nAnd then you had Clemson looking really really good and then after that you know we'll see we'll see about Notre Dame we'll see about all of a shoe or we'll see about Michigan Oklahoma is going to be in that mix with ... you know I I think it's going to be tough for anybody barring injury\nOr to beat Alabama because Alabama's defense is going to get better as the season goes on and again to come by lowering metal is I think is he a lock for the highest but at this point\nUnless something happens he he's just show explosive and they can score so quickly within the quarterback I just don't [laughter]\n... it's not even about the defense for the other teams for me it's just about what are the teams in college football can you say had that kind of firepower to score that quickly and moved the ball they need to show\nAnyway All right we've got a lot of action lot a\nLot of action going on right now in the NFL lotta scores to tell you about to tell you what we'll do that when we return we'll get you caught up to date everything going on in the NFL week seven

I mean I have no problems we're going for two and the when instead of kicking the extra points to go into overtime for the call just didn't work out the way that the titans wanted to\nMark his Murray on a roll down to his rights and just kind of stood there trying to find somebody open in the end zone painted up throwing it incomplete\nAnd that was the ballgame Marquez Mario to himself said after the game was talking to the media said you know what I probably could have done more to extend that play and I think what he's trying to say is you know it probably should have tried to run it in a at

Michel left with a knee injury had to be helped off the field and then he was court in in the locker room he's not been ruled out entirely for the rest of the game\nBut it did not look good I'd be surprised if we saw Sony Michel back out there but the patriots are on top Twenty one is Seventeen with three fifty it'll have to go in the first half and we'll see if\nMitchell Trybulski and the

organization early\nI'm a ... or not we're not fans of this um and that there's a thought they they feel like this is this type of stuff is bad for the game if their their view on it and uh and and this is you know\nOver the top is this is essentially their view of you know bond says [laughter]\nI mean this is this is who he is I I don't know that this is what you're going to get in it doesn't it doesn't seem to matter the fine it it doesn't seem to matter even suspensions\nUm that stuck on what seems to be quiet and it was like a badge of honor or something or in this is who he is and you know the best thing for the bangles in their view is we need him after all the reasons I just discussed earlier their defense has been problematic they deep Lakers\nThey need somebody to do something and they they view everything through the football lead and they feel like\nThey are have a better chance to win on Sundays right now with him out there now that can be debated as well um\nBut you know I there there at the point where I think they're sort of their hands are a little tight because they don't really have other options for football side of things and you know they\nThey are not going to take any action against contest perfect they haven't they've defended him on almost every turn of all of these suspensions\nWhich have accumulated down total losses when you go in the game checks and bonuses and find those\nThat have been a that'd be given to them a ... point six million dollars I mean they've kind of been there in his corner of the entire time um so you know to think that would change now um you know I I wouldn't expect that anytime soon\nThat's just that's like in comprehensible to me it was five million dollars in fines and and lots of game checks a bull I'm curious and this is just a just me being the reporter than I Am in addition to doing this\nUm one I mean these guys talk to bond says at all and I guess more importantly whether or not he talks to the media how is she received with his team I mean do do his teammates like him as the leader\n[laughter] I I think his teammates for respect what he can be as a football player in his football intelligent um you know\nTo say that he has a hundred percent unanimous backing and that you know if if you gave an anonymous call 'em you know I'd be curious to see what that number would be people that are in sport um it definitely wouldn't be a hundred percent um you know they're so there is some frustration to that with us\nHe doesn't really talk it happens occasionally [noise] um there's been one three minute session when he first came back he ended abruptly a wind and a question was asked about it if if he was what he did the PR conditioning over the four weeks fetch and\nUm and that's kind of been that didn't want to talk last week um he blew off reporters after the game he had an\nAltercation with a Pittsburgh media member after the Steelers game who was trying to get him out was yelling\nAt him and tell him to get out of the locker room and this that the other\nIt's always something it's always kind of some sort of side show a with him and and a lot of people on the inside will claim that that stuff is created by the outside but um you know that's a I guess that's a conversation for another day [laughter]\nYeah All right ... junior with us here on NBC Sports radio right so let's look at this game tonight at Kansas City clearly you know the chiefs we saw they they just came up short last weekend in ... so you figure back at home they should have some some more electric plays\nBut you know the defense has been very very beautiful and like you said I mean the the the Bengals office has been one of the surprises in the leagues so far so they should be a shoot out tonight\nYeah I'd be shocked a pound the override I I'd be I I was yes be absolutely shocked to see you know both the defense of standing up when you consider the way these two teams played this year I mean from a from a bangles perspective I you know people that's how how are they\nThey they've done it happened in Atlanta couple weeks ago or were they won that game thirty seven thirty six and you know where it came out and they scored\nA touchdown and all for their first half drive ... and really have the votes on them to be that that's what it has to look like I mean you have to concede that you're an adult you can just get a couple of force field goals really good cheese point is all you're really looking for defensively to open the door crack\nFor for a year off to carry the day I yeah I I think um we're certainly a lot of points in a long game keeping me working late into the night is on tap tonight [laughter]\nSo I really appreciate the time last thing before I let you go just kind of getting back to to more of an Lewis media speculation aside I Know everybody talks about him every year but for for you know that I'm just just strictly for for him how much longer do you think she wants to keep coaching and and continue this wrong with the bangles\n[laughter] I don't know I you know I I think um he's clearly wavered with it in recent years I'm a of of sticking around I I think he's still currently obviously wants to keep coaching and and if it wasn't going to be in Cincinnati last year it was going to be somewhere obviously here comes back\nYou know I think that he he's on his two year deal I think he's pretty committed to that and they're currently committed to him obviously if they stuck with them back in January a you know they're ... they're going to probably stick with them after this year somebody completely fall apart and I say I get I think we'll be back\nWhere we were um at the end of next season and see where we're at with with with him and with Mike Brown and with everybody in the organization as far as what they want to do I think that'll be another tipping point\nAll right well in the meantime big game tonight bangles achieves it

to rip through the scores week seven in the NFL and its ugly Cody Kessler infer Blake ... who was benched\nAnd uh it's looking like they have no hope to pedal backing us even though there's still time left in the third quarter it's an ugly blowout\nJacksonville getting their head handed to them by the Texans twenty nothing sixth and change left in the third and it is a story of inconsistencies the op ed is terrible that inconsistent could get nothing going fumble jumbled and everything else but they've kind of have been like Jekyll and Hyde\nAnd that's probably the problem on Sundays Blake board all looks like a good quarterback solid quarterback right not top five in the NFL but solid\nAnd then you have the collapse like you do today like he's barely an NFL die that he's not allocated and he is self destructing anytime he get the ball and that's what's happened in the first happened with that is why ... was brought in\nAnd after getting pounded you know the way they got pounded the other week here we go again so all of those interceptions if you think about it to Casey\nAnd facts and fumble it's just the same\nParty all over again only this time it's at the hands of the Texans deep and they got to be eleven is because it's no trick it's a treat for them\nThey can easily walk away with their fourth when it's just a question of whether Kessler is going to put even any points on the border they walk away with that doughnut that get hung on their head for the law and then the jags would be three and four\nSo the rest of the scores as we dive into this and that's a good time to remind you\nThroughout the three hours and I'm here will do fantasy statue all here are on staff harp is and that means hey this has some great fan of the news or you'll certainly be familiar with the mash units sadly that mean injuries\nAnd then of course we had the blue box to for things that are just absolutely ridiculous like let's talk about the rockets and the Lakers so we're going to bounce around a little bit but of course the star of the day is weak seven in the NFL\nAsked for the bears boy it's been interesting day for the bears the bears on top of the patriots twenty four to Twenty one\nHowever were a handful of minutes into the third quarter\nSki six carry that one yard touchdown for Mitchell the making a big difference there than we bounce to the cold\nYou know just a little bit of a sudden I remember going to come back\nYeah your benched for colds and the bills and that one the colds twenty four the bills three that's with like a minute left on the clock until they flip over to the final fourth quarter Andrew Luck and this one finding a little walk after ... performance this year I mean look the colds or one in five\nSo if you were picking and all things being equal not that the bills are on fire man might have been a coin flip for some of you luck fourteen of Nineteen hundred and forty seven yards and three touchdowns\nHe knows first full season back got to breathe some life with a big fat paycheck that is riding on his shoulders into this team and he's been spreading the ball around I think that's made a difference and of course the bill haven't been able to stop 'em when they've gotten into the red zone and they were able to score they put a twenty four points\nIn the second quarter so all twenty four points came a then\nThe lions and the dolphins are intriguing because Matt Stafford to me seems like the would've could've should've guy and you think oh just you know carry on Johnson could do this and if Michael Roberts could do that offensively and the defense is there you know hey\nI'm maybe can be a different story for the for the lion's so twenty six four team the\nThe lions on top and a mat Stafford\nFifteen of Eighteen hundred and Seventy five yards and two touchdowns I mentioned carry on Johnson he's had fourteen carries a hundred and forty three\nYards the Vikings and the jets could the magic continue for Sam's Arnold would make it three wins in a row well if the game ended now the answers to Minnesota Vikings on top of the jets Seventeen seven\nFantasy people let's say the U.S Murray nine Carey twenty six yards and F touched down for Murray Kirk Cousins\nTalk about big paychecks Seventeen to twenty nine hundred and sixty one yard and a touchdown for her cousins a lot of people have him as their depending on where they filmed the draft and I'm a waiver wires and whatever they may have cousins this week I Know a lot of people that did the eagles\nShowing why they're Super Bowl champs or maybe the Panthers aren't playing well a Seventeen nothing I've been watching this one and we have Thirteen minutes left in the game Carson when looks really good solid twenty three twenty seven\nTo eight or nine yards and a couple of touchdown finding a favorite target attack or a catches a hundred and twenty four yards so how 'bout that\nThe buccaneers Seamus Winston\nHad that came up a game where he is very hot and he's continuing that are trying to continue that at home winning back the affections of the the home crowd 'cause remember was all about ... magic those first couple of games\nWhen the buccaneers were winning sixteen nine so the browns have the balls second an eleven at their own thirty three yard line right now we're midway through the third quarter there [noise]\nAnd then we got one final in the chargers knocked off the titans and what was probably a thrilling game in London twenty ninth team and uh Seventy five yard or found the feel of\nRivers into ... Williams hands making a huge difference obviously and wow what a tail end of this game because the chargers put up ten points in the first quarter\nAnd the titans could only manage a couple of kicks at the halfway point it was ten six LA\nAnd then the rest took off from their touchdowns for each side and then just playing it out in the fourth so a pretty interesting\nThat came and little swapping the beginning of it coming up later this afternoon saints and the ravens than that other Los Angeles team the one that's winning that six and oh the rams take on the forty niners\nFor the battle of sort of California I don't know that you can really say that when the forty niners are one in five\nCowboys and the Redskins still a rivalry there and this is that fed ex field and land over it's always a wild time then the night game which I Love the NBC game the Bengals and the chief Kansas City favorite by six and this one\nPatrick my home's coming off of that Sunday night thriller last week against the patriots were the\nPatriots barely beat that she sent ... homes on fire but Brady is Brady and they were able to make it happen and uh that was a thrilling finish to the game I can only imagine what this one's going to be like because listen the bangles and Andy Dalton there no slouches it's not even a touch down the Kansas City is\nTo the games Nineteen sixteen if they could afford to dress up and go to the games that it was back then they were called the Brooklyn Robbins\nAnd a Babe Ruth was the star\nPitcher on the red Sox crazy isn't it I Know you've got to get out\nBecause I was wondering you know do the Dodgers face the red Sox before in the world series but I guess it was so because I thought maybe there was this was going to be the first time 'cause the Dodgers ... face the Yankees for men\nYou know World Series too numerous to count now the Yankees have won most of them are the Dodgers I think only one one of those uh or actually to those outings or something I'm not many of them the Yankees have usually dominated but in this case the in Nineteen sixteen the or the Brooklyn Robbins lost to the Boston Red Sox\nWow isn't that crazy so history there's no history that you can really I think hang on here and I I I like both of these teams I gave a couple of different edges to the red Sox I give a couple of different\nUm edges to the Dodgers but boy oh boy I Can't wait for them to start on Tuesday and if\nIf you've got defensive plays like tailor made where he's Boston at full speed to the left\nDoesn't collide waving in the air and the ball jumps right there in the mid ... and the ending and and crushes the brewers if you can have those kind of defensive plays and then not bobble when you make the place you should make\nAnd then it's a question of home run versus home run because Boston certainly I mean the Dodgers relied on home runs there's no question about that and the Boston Red Sox had their share of home runs to win games except for it but they also play from small ball this is going to be a really good series\nI yeah I'm looking forward to it I mean I've never seen a number of ever seen the Dodgers versus the red Sox in the in the world series before I'm just the fact that was a hundred and two years ago this happened\nI'm just amazing and you know it's just it kinda breaks up the board um 'cause I mean if if the Dodgers in Houston again this year okay in a rematch you know the the The Revenge if you will but it's kinda nice to mix things up a little bit here and I I Confess as a Dodger fan\nEarlier this year is like what were the Dodgers thinking because they really didn't do many moves in the off season they got mad at camp and that's pretty much it while Houston was the world champion but they made several moves she moves a upgrade their uh their line up yet here we are the Dodgers are in the world series and the Houston Astros Iran\nYeah absolutely and then as you could play play a factor here for Alex courts and the first World Series\nAs the um the manager at the skipper as the guy running the team he would be the first rookie manager to win the world series that happened once before Bob Bradley will happen a couple of times above Brownlee did it last\nAnd you have to go back to two thousand and one in the Arizona Diamondbacks so that would be wild if we saw that speaking of wild [noise] I'll tell you what is a segue into this\nI mentioned just diving into the break and come back out on the other side like Chris Taylor I Want to make sure and make the catch and don't leave you hanging\nIf for some reason you didn't pay attention to the feeder system in college football I Can't believe it 'cause my favorite thing to do is talk about college in pro football and I had the best gig in the world and when I look at the games and I watched what happened last night it is so unbelievable\nIt there's no way you're predicting that Ohio State go down at the hands of Perdue but I Know I said I think it's every week it's such a trait thing and maybe I don't say everybody but I said a lot\nAnd in fact so much I stop saying it because I Would hear it from coaches constantly whenever I was going to happen it could be a trap game for us we're you know we're on the road and sure enough\nI'm glaring weaknesses for Ohio State and credit to Perdue the boiler makers feeding Ohio State and number two there in the perfect condition they lose to Purdue\nForty nine to twenty wow wow wow I mean urban Meyer what do you have to say about that\n\nReporters do choose or just work over the last game last year or more of a show [noise]\nAre worse off of [noise]\nYeah and you're going to have to work here you know wiped off to get it right because now we got all these one last teams in the Big Ten that game against Michigan looms large\nThere was a couple of other games that might not be easy and you really honestly what is the selection committee going to say when they split the difference because now maybe you're looking at one\nFrom the Big Ten and I'll tell you what um that is not what I expected I mean clearly clearly there were weaknesses and a lot of it was the defense\nBecause they couldn't stop very little you know Twain Haskins isn't the problem he he still is getting things done Twain Haskins still is not dropped from contention\nFor being considered for the the Heisman Trophy but if you assess this boy oh boy you have to look\nAt really what happened defensively and you have to look at you know maybe some of the coaches and I think that's what's being talked about a lot in Ohio today because everything revolves around Ohio State there is no question I went to school in Ohio I Know and that has been there since the dawn of time\nOhio State that with it so do you you know do you typically look at um the offensive line coach there was problems there is Duane Haskins got a little hurry I think some of that but\nThere wasn't much of that I was really to me on the defense they got to regroup and and certainly we saw that so you have Dwayne Haskins he throws for four hundred and Seventy yard third consecutive four hundred yard outing but um you know\nThey lose their on the losing side of the and the boiler makers play spoiler now they have that law and that law is a big law because their backs are against the wall they have a by next week and then they host Nebraska\nOn November third that should be an easy walk in the park but after that it gets much tougher and that Big Ten\nChampionship game is going to tell a lot about what happens next on the other side of things and I can't wait to see what the college football selection committee to on the other side of the ball in the winning category and let's face it we could have said that from day one and I did\nAnd anybody else that it has even watch them with say the same thing and it's going to beat Alabama\nReally is there anyone that is possible to beat Alabama you've listened to Nick Saban voice sounds like anybody could but they don't have any given day uh Alabama blew out Tennessee fifty eight Twenty one as they should of\nAnd here's what Nick Saban that afterwards\nIt was a really positive you know guy he's proven to want to be a really good player so he tries to do all of a shame to improve them get better he doesn't satisfy very easily I think that's the key to being able to overcome adversity and when you have a\n[noise] yeah and so here's the thing is\nThe star he is the Heisman winner in my opinion three hundred and sixty art for touchdowns jailing hurts always gets action and the games because the Clinton side is always blowing out everybody and he sees action in the fourth quarter Alabama's out for their opponents ready for this\nOne sixty five to thirty one wild wow wow wow what a start Catherine happen next on her five cats envy the ... the force radio [noise]\n[noise]\nDuring BCS sports radio with\nLike ... benched

Olympics would come every four years now are so lucky they come every two years of winter and then summer but I remember just being glued to the TV watching the Olympic Games and\nJust in awe of what these athletes for doing so when I got the opportunity to cover my first Olympics in Sochi um I had already covered Superbowl being on us and in New England and Super Bowl the patriots won the red Sox won the south it's one of the Bruins won all the years I was only five years but as fans were spoiled for that time they still are actually but\nUh so I covered all those big events and they are amazing and everything you think they're going to be and you know you get tears in your eyes and watching the championship banner or the championship trophy is being handed out and walk into banners go up at the start of next season\nThat's all amazing but when I go uncovered Olympics and I'm seeing firsthand this childhood infatuation I had and everything coming together on the global scale and being broadcast or as a part of it\nThat's really just the crumbling ... for me I mean there's just something about it um and I think in a way that watches the Olympic probably agrees and and cheers on these athletes and they have an opportunity once every four years is that to be able to\nShowcase what they do best and they have a you know we have lower Jones on the podcast a couple of weeks ago and she was like twelve second\nYou know my whole four years of training comes down to twelve second and then when you think of it that way it's just as they are the most elite at their field at that moment in time and um I really I really enjoyed covering the Olympics of all the other all the events like at the opportunity to be a part of that there's something special about the Olympic Games\nYeah I Love the way you put that we're speaking with Catherine tapping and who she catcher on a Notre Dame football over the place on NBC Sports broadcaster and\nOh you've got this on her ... her pod cast that really make some noise like I said what's that like is that what did you know you mentioned already an interview there that was awesome how to do that\nIt's funny you say that it's making some noise like I Love hearing that I was actually out of boating game last week and a fan came up to me he came down on the stand the kind of grabbed my attention or an hour before kickoff and he said um I just have to tell you my wife and I listen to our podcast every week we love it it was like that was the coolest thing here\nI've been really enjoying it we've had some amazing guest\nI've talked to some incredible female role models in in sports or whether they're athletes where Kerry Welsh Jennings we have low Jones on a concern them and then on the executive side kept the goal of who owns an NFL team at an NFL team and then a women's hockey team as well and\nNow they just got a lacrosse team for the poor little sports entertainment brand Amy ...\nWho's just an absolute trailblazing bad I think what she has been able to accomplish as well and then uh last week we had a bottle masters which to me I mean she blew me away I go into these potshots with probably two pages worth of notes and kind of ideas I think maybe the conversation can go and\nUh we try to get an topics that aren't necessarily you know the ... of this person's career I Want to dive deeper and with ...

[laughter] how how you define it is it like maybe it's happened to them in a fight or something but it I've never I've never been through this or\nWe're trying to figure out what happened I Would say he almost blue spit into his face more than like\nPull back and really I I mean I really wanted to find a Chris Paul was looted and then that's at in pushing drawn to in the face rounded up throwing punches um and then you know ... just like come in and out of nowhere off the top ten buckled trying to throw more conscious I think in the end polls gonna everybody's getting suspended Chris Paul will get suspended the game\nRondo if he's if they determine it was semi central that's going to be multiple games um he's getting at least one and probably a punch has been\nOne to two in the past I think everyone's going to get at least a couple because he kind of instigate it the whole thing um dissension took her to come down like you said probably in the next hour I was a study that they rockets play the night they're gonna be pretty quick with this um\nBut I expect every one of them to get suspended at least a game and a couple of ethical both the Lakers may get multiple days out of it\nWhile still at five from that which of course in everything you look at what the Lakers [laughter] buy from Matt how did you know when we look at the Lakers I mean at the beginning of the season everybody weighing in on the Bronx in fact how long does it take\nWhat kind of team are we going to the could you make any observations from what you saw and what you've seen so far\nOut of ... new retool Lakers\nIn both games they've played they haven't played poorly um but when it got to crunch time in the in this time you know this was like a one point game I'm at\nThe time of the answer that it was one on one one hundredth not admitted later ... couple of minutes of that game\nNow three or four minutes Houston just out executed I mean of course I'm James Harden hit some tough shots but guess what that's what James Harden does he just\nHe's a play maker the guy was MVP\nHe made some tough shots they got some stops they made some place there continuity and\nAbility to execute is just ahead of the Lakers that is what happened to them and the Lakers and the first game\nPortland I don't you know pull is a good team but what they really got his continuity it's the same guys running the SUNY system for the same coach in March and when he got to crunch time they could execute at a higher level they trusted themselves more to win the game got tight they've been in that situation the Lakers aren't there yet I'm\nIngram is not making plays with two quarters louder shot last night that they had that they're just not there yet and and the bonds quite that it's been a take time and he's been at the situation in the heat started slow when he was there there was slow starts when he came back to Cleveland um it's just the only challenges in the west where it's so deep with good teams\nWent into that hole gets too deep it's really hard to take out of it and at some point maybe ... you know maybe Monday Night against San Antonio or something just needs to take over the end of the game and get them at W. here\nYou go he needs to take over and I think that's what everybody's expecting to happen that's why you pay the big bucks and sit there in Los Angeles and the closer the because that's what he does\nYeah exactly I think I think he's got a really good job of trying to get guys involved there often looks really good when they run ... in transition they're great athletes with them as soon as they move the ball there almost two and selfish it once and a half for their half court still a bit of a work in progress there flashes of really nice stuff\nUm they're still figuring it out there still trying to get used to playing with each other and that really shows more in the bigger problem which is their defensive and there's just not shark at the rotations aren't sharp they're not helping the help or they're not ...\nIt looks like a team that was largely put together with a lot of new pieces a new guys who do roles and everybody's trying to figure everything out and like I said\nThat's fine the bronze done that twice and still made the finals but that was in the east and it's just a different animal that doesn't get you know like oh they got an easier game now it's the spurs\nWhen do you know it doesn't the spurs are still you know they've still got the Marta rose and in the markets Aldrich and great topics running a team that's going to be executed a night out like it's just there are no nights off in the last\nThat I like that no you said and who benefit the most from there to benefit the most probably team in the east right yeah we were to look down the road and what can happen it wide open this could change the faith in the in the finals after you've seen the same show for four years then LeBron within it right\nThe exact well

talk radio then then you hear what people complain about or they lamenting the fact that Denver was one of only four team that didn't pick up that starting quarterback in the drafting maybe could have jumped up\nAnd gotten Sam darnel or they could have gotten Josh Rosen or Josh Allen although yeah that's a mixed bag if you look at where they both are now our caller saying that\nYeah the ... there's certainly plenty of that uh especially before Thursday's game friday a little less of it although I think everyone realized chosen wasn't really the reason that they lost that game I I get that if you're a couple of pictures but not a line that's pretty atrocious there\nArizona at the same time you saw what happened when you take the best bass rush for the draft and put them opposite of ... which is what they do have\nI think when you see OK bond is getting triple ... double team than chips and and even when I'm On a little bit or when he was getting all that attention you have a guy like what the markets where it was like what ... early and bonds career\nSo I had to have gone up to to to get Donald that was the only quarterback that I was told the general we really really love and so then that is the past on Rosen Alan and like you said a bit of a mixed bag I like\nAllen's outside and I like Rosen's a skill set but yeah\n... until they until they end up in ... and you know we we won't know talked in in five or seven years of age aren't into Carson once but maybe not Carson wants today but Carson wants in general uh then\nThen you're going to be scratching your head but it feels like it's a little too early to officially great it one way that will be certainly people have been down on case can won't see Chad Kelly gift shop\nThere you go I agree so I'm finally when you and I are watching the game tonight I'm assuming you're watching the game can't city obviously and uh Cincinnati you got to be thinking about next week the Denver Broncos going up against the heat that no easy task for case Keenan the boy\nNo it certainly isn't and Kansas City is always a tough place to play now the Broncos have gone on the road and on there and the chiefs have come in here\nAnd one in Denver or it's just the nature of rivalry games right but the way the chiefs are playing you'd have to keep pace with them their defense is terrible but they're often says\nOut of this world so uh if I'm not mistaken I think Justin uses out tonight maybe whatever's bothered him still bother him next week maybe are bears out all the way back in and they played the chiefs tough obviously the Monday Night game a lot of emotion there are but there to to their better games this year they've been in law is the chief in Iran's\nI think we can build on that but again it goes back to that margin for error you can't turn the ball over\nAnd you're going to have to make places like they can't let Patrick homes\nRole to his right as much as he did and go make plays with that big arm or that he has but it's funny 'cause when the chiefs we're hearing and reading about it and talking to folks who covered the cheese they feel like they finally have there John Elway right not since lend Austin\nSure that Joe Montana for a couple of years were not designed Austin of they had their guy and obviously John Elway tormented them for Fifteen Years so they think they've got their guy that's going to torment the Broncos and and the rest of the seat for the next Fifteen Years and they might be right\nYeah ... well that brand it would have in the yard kicking around thank you so

Gurley always getting your good points wouldn't you love to have ... Gurley as a one of your fantasy guy so Twenty one yard that early going and to a touchdown for girlie\nMeanwhile looking across the board in a couple of other [noise] like that noteworthy make over last time\nIt exactly uh I Would think Phillip river three hundred and six yards passing couple a touchdown chargers beating the titans twenty Nineteen that's a nice one that was um I you know two point conversion charger stopping the titans that way it was about\nIt it was about uh some last minute excitement I think for the people in London at ... stadium nice\nGood to get up in the morning and have that I think have those games pumping and go and that's what I envy\nFrom Mae West coast towels because you wake up and I used to live in California you get up and boom you're watching the games right away there is no feeling like like that feeling the jets were hoping it was going to be three in a row for Sam Darnell but it really it was all Vikings all day long\nAnd ... there's not a fan of the stuff for your Fifteen carries sixty nine yards and two touchdowns from Murray\nThe Vikings beat the jets thirty seven to seven teams so therefore too and one her cousins two hundred and forty one passing yards and a couple of touchdowns for him Sam journals a couple of interceptions back three interceptions part of the difference in that and you know this was a home game for\nThe jets so the suit touchdown passes Murray running for two scores Vikings just pulled away and the second half of mostly the story of there\nAnd for the jets Sam Darnell he got to think about the number three overall pick he I look like in the beginning of the game I you know what if it's a cold day it's a little bit windy but it looked like he was going to handle it\nAnd he had a nice touchdown pass to Chris Herndon and even a touchdown run but then those pick off we're so costly so to game win streak ended thanks to the Vikings\nAnd the Vikings had just a huge lead in the fourth quarter and they couldn't come back in after that I just couldn't do it\nAnd the jets\nDid keep the the Vikings out of the end zone a couple of key time so they tried to really hang in it but I like I said when they started to pull away that was it so next up for the jets at Chicago that can be a tough one the Vikings are home against New Orleans next\nSunday yeah\nI said that a fight broke out when the Lakers decided um that it was more about fight than the game and\nThe the Lakers and the rocket wow it would've been wild to be at this game because they've had high drama\nAnd that high drama toward the end of it and there's going to be some suspensions although I haven't heard any yet we of course to have a hotline to what's going on there so we'll keep your breath of it\nBut it was the fourth quarter\nAnd it was late in the fourth quarter in all of a sudden you so that uh there were multiple was kind of a wild multiple player fight as it has been described and he had Chris Paul you never see C. P. three like this and Brandon Ingram that they were uh in the middle of the ...\nSo that I think that drama kind of over shadowed a lot of it you had also a Rondo mixed into this too and I think what we're probably going to the you know up tall said that Rondo cause the fight by spitting on him\n\n[noise]\n\n... three to six on third downfall the motion from right to left Andrew Luck to throw\nTo the right side job will be a lottery to the rose up [noise]\nYep thank the coast radio network and the Vikings radio network to promote your tone of\nHeart me in a couple of players to highlight I've already talked about this a little bit but we're diving into this again some standout performances that we're going to get you some points Murray was one of them a couple of touchdowns always look nice right\nWhen you're trying to get some production in that area and Marie did bring that with the two E. D's\nAnd the win for the bike is of course over the jets thirty seven to seven teen ads for the cold Andrew Luck has had no luck really overall the season\nBut this is the season we're finally he's back to the whole to them and they all lives around them in the bill we're just shattered by the coal thirty seven to five super luck for touchdown\nAnd then if you look overall and spreading out that often it looked pretty good the bill second straight laws for the cold snap the poor game losing streak and buying lay finally won and somebody told me and I realized that there are three hundred game\nSince moving to Indy from Baltimore in the middle of the night Nineteen eighty four\nAdam ... Terry with by point to move within five of actually cutting his own record Morton Anderson\nA career wise point two thousand five hundred and forty four well hard to believe\nIs so they're happy to pick up that game especially in front of their home crowd and that the losing\nAnd uh it wasn't it you know look there was a bounce back that's what it was and it was a lopsided win and they were happy to get it but now the Colts will have to build up that momentum and continue and Oakland\nBefore they had and to their by week [laughter]\nAnd so I don't know you look at Oakland you would think well you know match that up match up that often not defense and maybe I give them a chance to pull up another one probably probably do it\nAnd the pack 'em with fear when was interesting because when you talk about throwing the ball up ... up\nAnd the bears or try and fry and trying to do whatever they could come back Mitch trip is key\nHas over the last two games have thrown for six hundred and Seventy yards nine touchdowns only one pick the patriots coming off of that huge win over the chiefs they want a top seed in a conference and this is\nYou know where things really begin for them and of course they didn't have tightened Rob Gronkowski who was ruled out with a back injury\nAnd so you know look ... on the other side of things the big pass attack\nFor the bears he has an ankle injury which limited him and that was set up to this game\nI wanted to jump into college football because of course the feeder system you're watching what happens on Saturday I'm On the air thank goodness on Saturday I Love it to the time flawed as excellent because I get to take you to the games I'm sort of like the human\nA scoreboard are highly border wherever we want to call it put it for me it's thrilling because this is my favorite to watch college and to watch the pros\nAnd as many of you know I balling what's happening with the college guys then you're looking forward in the back of your mind to the draft eventually but there is a bit of a shake up in the college football playoff it's going to be interesting because you walk away from week eight and you realize that the Clemson is the number to spot in the coach's poll\nThey move there because Ohio State drop to nine following that terrible loss to Purdue [noise] [noise]\nI'm against the NC State they had to really take a bite out of them they did Clemson\nVaulted defensive line everybody was talking about heading into the season did have a kind of a dominant experience on the ... you know on the field that we expected them to have but we've been talking about a lot a lot a lot I mean\nTheir defense has four guys that could be featured in the NFL and starting line up and we know that we looked at that as we look at that and Trevor Lawrence looks a lot better as a quarterback for Clemson Alabama looked unbeatable\nAlabama is its Alabama and everybody else let's face it right and that's the question of\nThey get into the semi final game who's taking them on and then what happens in the national title game I just really don't see\nThere is no one there's no one that can take apart Alabama there they look like a pro team all the way around let's face it\nAnd then you look at 'em you know you look at what they did to Tennessee then you look at a Notre Dame LSU Michigan on the top five a Washington state we was up in the coach's poll they're Fifteen\nAnd I think that Ohio State law says is so interesting because in the coach's poll they go to nine what happens with the college football selection committee Alabama's one to his Clemson Notre Dame of three Ellis use for men Michigan\nAfter that and how about Texas hanging in there of course they're seven Oklahoma eight\nIt's incredible what's happened with these one losses and especially in the Big Ten is where a lot of that conversation is going to start to happen and now we're really in the thick of it it kind of makes sense to me why\nThe college football selection committee they don't start until late in October because that's when we get a better sense of what's happening when you look at the winners and losers as you're in week eight\nOh it makes sense why would you start at the beginning of the season when everybody else do that Purdue wiping out Ohio State and that smashing crazy when really really rock the boat without a doubt and sets up the Big Ten\nFor Ohio said having to win everything out and really rock that Big Ten championship if they get there and this is what everyone's going to be talking about for weeks on end\nBecause they know who knows if there will be there right who knows we don't know two losses and they weren't lifetime who knows what happens as we get closer to the tail end of the season\nAnd you know then you look at Michigan and their went over Michigan State Twenty one seven\nAnd Michigan hasn't played a so much as the some of the big tent\nBut Penn State Ohio State that is a big big measuring sick\nAnd Jim Harbaugh finally has the quarterback he wants to shape Patterson the transfer from old miss\nBy coming back on the flip side we're going to die back into it and have a little she conversation you ask where we're going to set you up nicely for that because we get ready for that Sunday night game out what is it looked like\nComing up next NBC Sports radio\n[noise] coverage

experience\nThat today that's not semi hung out that's hung out you hung out with Dr do that's a really cool that we take turns getting beers is great\nI have thirty percent of your celebrity a name droughts are from that one evening by right which is awesome uh but let's let's talk a little sports too because there's so much going on a great weekend would at a weekend\nWell OK okay now what ways if you had to rank them I won't give you three sports and give me a wreck you got college football you got NFL and you have baseball how are you seeing it you know you know obviously who knows what'll happen later tonight but how you rank and I'm so far be direct\nWell baseball you had a really nice week again I thought the the baseball got a lot of attention there's a lot different storylines of ales the U.S and then they'll see us you got Dodgers versus Red Sox which is a really nice World Series that play out nationally so I think baseball had a really good months of or half a month of October ... in the world series\nNFL it's been a fun day so far a lot to go um\nThe NBA couldn't have started out much hotter because obviously we have a problem with the Lakers and then you have the incident to happen there with Randall Chris Paul and that can be chopped up and uh just dissected the for the next five thirty six hours but this was a college football weekend and it started out with\nWith college game day but I'm going to say it started out with Michigan Michigan State if you were on social media or early in the day on on Saturday you saw that the Michigan State football team when they enter it was Michigan at Michigan State which is a true rivalry when they don't like each other and they would like to hurt each other\nThe Michigan said players do this thing where they lock arms and walked the length of the field as they enter the stadium and Michigan State these Lansing and when they did that there was about four or five Michigan players out a little bit early stretching now even the Michigan players knew that they did this and it came out early to call center incident\nOr they just happened to be in the Michigan State players walked the length of the field and got into it with the Michigan players some of the tougher Michigan players and then when the Michigan players with digging up dirt on the right in the ass at the Michigan State set up the yard line and it was on social media the game was hot and happening before kickoff\nYeah I ... it's funny you say that because I think of obviously Michigan Ohio State there I I I was remembering as this all happened the Michigan emissions have really grown to dislike each other and the Honda here is that true\nAbsolutely in Michigan State marked Antonio he's really owned horrible the past decade their past eight years there and Michigan State does not get enough pub nationally they've got a lot of bad ... for the department the past couple of years but the football team\nUsually really competitive over the past generation and it wasn't a great game it was I think it was seven zero at half time seven seven it was close Michigan to just enough to get by they won Twenty one seven but the it felt like a staring contest felt like a couple of dogs staring at each other and there was a lot of great hitting going on\nBefore I Know there's a a a ... really what happened to tell me real quick you you're just black at first the price of what I say Alabama Tennessee from yesterday like what ... what did you take away from that was a fifty eight Twenty one wind by Alabama\nYeah that's about what you expected a Tennessee is not good and they had a win last week over Auburn which was a shocker and then they got back to being Tennessee there just haven't had a good five you run\nAn Alabama just man it's just a cruise control right now a ... it's hard to picture them losing but they've lost in big games late in the season very late the season\nThe past few years and crucial game so well the only one loss and one last late\nWell to me is is strikes me more than any other year I remembered I Know you said it to me it's like Alabama\nAllowed over every other team because they look so good so far I Know LSU looking good too and they're coming up but it feels like this year Alabama is is such a powerhouse that everyone's playing for second place I Know that's not true but now I feel that I see those highlights\nNot a very fair statement and now Alabama also has a unbelievable quarterback they've never had that before you know they've always had defensive line off into line running backs for days even a lot of good rod receivers tight end OJ Howard I can go back defense all over the place defensive backs especially\nBut now they have a quarterback who's considered the best player in the country is going to win the Heisman that's that's next level for Alabama but the other games are a little juicy in order to get a lot of NFL talked the rest of the hour\nClemson smoking NC State that was really important for clumsy 'cause NC State usually plays them well it was at Clemson they had no problem forty one seven LSU after a slow start the season a lot of people did not like an ocean or on their head coach to he was no more known as a recruiter who'd failed in other places before he's got them flying\nThey're Nineteen in three and they play the tough schedule I Am sorry they won Nineteen three they're seven and one\nAnd they're going to weigh up the charts as I said Michigan Michigan State but the game of the weekend and it wasn't even really that close of a to me is one of the favorite sporting events of the past year Purdue forty nine Ohio State twenty I watched every second that game I barely flip to anything else I Know you're watching a lot of Oregon and I was keeping an eye on that but\nDoing Haskins got handled produced started out the season oh and three there are a non factor this season then they switch quarterbacks this guy David ... who started a couple of years ago last night he diverse three hundred Seventy three touchdowns he was flawless they have this young guy Ronald ... more hit a hundred and Seventy yards receiving and two touchdowns\nYou do nothing but did you\nDo something you're far more likely to get the most positive outcome making Home Affordable is a free government program called ... nine nine five to talk

wouldn't let me more than I could easily pay back boy was I wrong thankfully I got to help I needed to pay back my loan and full\nSound familiar the good news is\nLoan repayment options are available

to\n\n[noise]\n\nTaking these ones where you would you go into\nBack on the loser but an obesity sports radio ... through a whole lot of football to talk about coming out where you get to the all the early games but\nLet's talk about the incident of the week and would it be fair to say Pearl off the everyone was expecting you know the bronze home opener a it was you know ten thirty on a on a friday night or I'm Sorry I Saturday Night so a lot on the east coast may not have seen much of it especially if they're watching Purdue Ohio State but\nThere was a I guess you'd call it a brawl I I hate to use word brawl but that for an MBA that was a brawl Chris Paul and point guard for up to rockets and Russia around to the point guard issue for the LA Lakers were John each other giving each other elbows lots of stuff was going on\nAnd they were going face to face and ... each other and they're kind of putting their hands on each other's chess and\nJust about to get into it but you know these fights don't really happened like Rodney had his hands on his hips and Chris Paul is kind of like\nGiving a like a yet right in space but it didn't look like anything was going on and then all of a sudden Chris Paul loses it and yell something and throws his hands up towards Rondo Rondo responds with a left that hit Chris Paul pretty much right on the button for basketball fighters right on the button\nChaos ensued then a few players going to get suspended Brandon Ingram big band or wind player for the Lakers he threw a full punch he didn't really make a connection but the MBA doesn't care if you make a connection is if you make a fast and then brown guys like land Stevens and surprising just pulling people apart the bronze he's pulling people apart\nBut what everyone's talking about is what set Chris Paul off and did ... Rondo spit in his face what'd you say ...\nYeah I I Can't tell for sure there was spit like if I'm In a court of law and you asked me are you positive that it was a spit\nI Can't say for sure I lean towards yeah I think it was a spit\nNow they could suspend all these players for Fifteen games and\nThe NBA he did a show law will help her get about six months from now it doesn't make it does make the slightest different what actually happened here is nothing like the NFL you know I don't think and what does that we're not talking like twenty games suspensions year the punch was bad but I don't think it's that big a deal unless I'm ... I don't know what the president is proposing\nAny suspensions or short and doesn't take away from the entire season because that was a a brawls happened once in a while and no one got really hurt I watched the video\nClose up and a lot of people are saying Russia Iran could have spit on him because he had a mouthpiece and those people that are played sports before because once you're used to using a mouthpiece of become such a comfortable appendage I guess you'd call it or accessory\nThat you could spin underneath that you could split up guys have to spend with their mouth pieces and to get spit out of them when they're playing football playing other sports\nThey slowed down a bunch of different websites but I'm watching one on dot com now Enron do spits\nPiece bets on him now could have been saying F you could have been saying some type of other word and spit came out I don't know but I Know that spit from Ron do hit ... right in the face and that but I usually\nDo are you sure he was in screaming at your that's the key thing here\nAnd around and I read his mouth barely open he's like looking at him any kind of and you just seem kind of go like a ... am I making that motion 'cause I'm 'cause he's not his mouth was basically close his lips or you know like all these kind of sticking out so but you see this\nAnd Chris Paul demeanor changes spit in the face will do that too I'll ... I'll tell you a quick story back in about a\nCarolina Panthers Superbowl Steve Smith was a star receiver and he was on the damn Patrick show the next day and he and Trump Buckley got into a fight during that game\nAnd he told damned Patrick condemned pet her show why Dan goes by getting a photo Buckley just always spit in my face 'cause oh is that ... that's the worst he was you can call me this you can talk about my sister my mother\nBut you spent my face you're saying I'm not even a worthy of I'm not a man I'm you're spending on me like I'm garbage you're treating me like garbage all punch anybody who spits my face and that was Steve Smith who gets riled up from time to time\nBut you know Chris Paul I think had the right to take a shot\nAbsolutely a now by the way so it with two games in\nDefining about the Lakers is er Rondo and even Ingram suspends has no impact be day go they go like ... have no idea what they're doing for rotation do they actually play pretty well last night but I don't I don't even understand\nThis team I don't know like who are the Lakers key tell me that is are they a contender are they a playoff team are they what is happening there I I ... I watched both parts of both games now I what's your first impression of LeBron's Lakers\nThat they're gonna have to ... to get forty five when yeah you know throw into now and they're going to play you know some bad teams but they're just not that many bad teams in the west and just based off the odds of the number of teams play\nWith that line up it's going to take them a month to figure out what they're doing and by then will they be set will they be ten and Fifteen ... you know and that's a good point twenty five games and the one thing I Would say I can't make heads or tails this team because I think uh they don't even know what they're going to have\nThey do have some talent with I I really you you and I both love guys like your bail muggy and think that he held\nI like him yeah I Know I just don't know what the pieces are there are things that just not a three point shooting team and that just feels so weird to see that I'm finally quit a couple of other quick MBA things you know it's been pressing me you know one of my favorite sneaky players\nJak levine is the homeless women are Chinese on fire for the bulls ... thirty points to games that arose shooting fifty six shepherd appeal\nThe other is the Sixers this a great story Jay Jay radical game winner\nLast night to beat the magic which isn't that oppressive guess what I see this morning and Brooklyn\nJ.

I Can't believe Carolina put up that kind of goose egg eagles are not the toughest team to compete with are good I Know that the world champs but they they they don't they don't blow people out anymore and uh\nIt was just the weirdest thing it's like the brakes just stopped on the Philadelphia ... and if they got decent players you know but\nIt was just the weirdest game and then you know Kim Newton was running putting a shoulder down carrying them down to feels like it was a desperate game in Philadelphia a chance to to get it back they had a couple of chance to get it back so I don't make too much of this I thought this was the worst for Caroline if they lost\nThan the eagles eagles are three and four but in that division they if the eagles when three in a road any point in the season will be right back in first\nProbably as it's it's a couple of things are obvious they definitely had the classic Superbowl hanging over\nThere now last year a steam there's just no way no their thing is I think the announcers pointed Carson went really seems to make a lot of places where you hold on the ball is document last he is not changes Ronnie sell his is he seemed like a more safe quarter back then he did last year to you [noise]\nUm he he got in the last three times yeah yeah but he didn't tell me that when you forever\nIt's got to be tough because when you build like Ben Roethlisberger or\nOr candy and there's a point where I can have three guys on him and he stood up and they kind of slid often but they called in the grasp but he would honor roll out make a play and he had three guys hanging out of the guys kind of let him go the defensive players for Philadelphia\n'cause he's so damn big Carson ones isn't really small urban Cam Newton or Ben Roethlisberger he just more jacked like a little more tight but he's a big dude and I guess it's got you know you got to tell yourself hey don't use my strength to get out of this when I can and\nI don't think they fear injury in a moment not when they're under twenty seven twenty eight years old\n[noise] very true very true I don't think he's quite as big as ... and ... even big Ben he's a big he's listening to thirty seven which is huge cam was at actually block one play and there would be the defender was you might have seen that play that in fact I did or five of them get away from me\nI mean it was trucking down field blocking on like a reverse type play and the the defensive back tried to slide under camp instead of throwing chested chess with them and putting them into the the runner one of the game I Want to hit before break Texans twenty jaguar seven not that big of a deal now four weeks ago if I Would have said that the jaguars are going to be handled by the Texans\nTexans looked awful and the jaguars look great it's the opposite and the jaguars now or at the point where\nOne of the lead stories of the week is that ... stunk again in Cody castle came in and play it above average and kept them in the game and he didn't do greatly through a touchdown catch where it's kind of guy play the Cleveland it was a USC guy bounced around\nBut they have to say their season now and it's obvious their stats I could give you the ... is the worst starting quarterback in the past three years and you can't deny them the stats\nAnd if they make a trade or they just give up the season it's one of the other\nInto a trade for ... is that what you're talking about\nI don't know I I just got to be somebody I mean I I in all seriousness I think they'd be better off getting a a high end backup for the rest of this year\nAnd see and when you can do and trying to compete in trying to put a charge in this team and you just cut like Portland the off season 'cause you you you you know what you're going to get he's not going to get much better he's he doesn't have to get games in a row at any point his career\nYeah no I think you're you're in the majority and I can't disagree with you Paul the or you know cut it gets really looked OK but I felt like it was an easier situation by the way on the other side to show up and you know hit a punctured lung um couldn't fly to the game here to drive on a twelve hour bus\nAnd he actually look pretty good today that seems like the Texans out seemed like the team to beat in the south but that seems a bit tenuous to me that he is show beat up so I feel you know I feel great about the Texans\nExcept for that one caviar because the costs are going to do it the titans aren't going to do it and now the jagged falling apart it seems like they're division it's there to visit as well as Watson's healthy\nI I totally agree with you to Sean Watson's fantastic but he's getting hit so much and he just looks he doesn't look like a big strong guy he cared about seven times today with a bruise along and injured ribs hit a ride a bus hook uncover was at home and I says that bus\nThat's just probably nice [laughter] probably pretty
