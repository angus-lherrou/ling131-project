three minutes left in the third quarter takes over\n'cause there's no worries here it's not a trap it's another win for the very dominant Alabama I think there is no doubt when the college football

afraid the traffic was so thick in the Dallas Fort Worth area that I'd be safer just day\nIn ... in the studio at the long horn beating Oklahoma forty five to thirty one what's interesting is Texas with M. L. injure\nGotten down into the red zone four times and all four times they were able to score that's part of the reason they were able to jump up so much on the shooters but the game's not over yet there's still eight minutes plus left in the game\nAnd Oklahoma is threatening so we'll see if they just put up um a touchdown there so that ... that that's why they call them the red river shootout seems to me that no matter where they stand if it's a good year a bad year it's always super competitive the rivalry\nAnd the trash talking ratchet up\nAlmost like I've never ever seen so Texas at

that\nAs well we'll talk with Brad powers from pre games dot com always like to get my guys on to analyze the lines and get his take on some of what's happened already and of course was coming up because there's some big match ups one that I really like and I wouldn't miss the for the world is a Notre Dame\nYou look at Notre Dame undefeated\nPerfect five and I've taken on Virginia Tech and you want to talk about trap game now Virginia Tech can be tricky and in fact for Notre Dame is favored by less than a touchdown and in Blacksburg it's pretty loud if I'm looking at this thing and I'm looking at in book and the amount of often that e and book\nHas put up in a couple of games that he's been in as quarterback for the Irish\nJust phenomenal is what he's been in fact I was somewhere I Want to say was at an airport\nWhen I heard her ... her and I just didn't think about it how many points right Ninety four points\nSince he jumped in and those couple of games so as they get ready for Virginia Tech is going to be about trying to tread that defense I mean the the off then\nIs is actually really complimenting for once the defense for the Irish Frank Kelley knows it's a while he was sheepish about putting a or stepping around cheapest for the media stepping around putting in e and book what a brilliant move that turned out to be so far anyway\nFlood Virginia Tech like I said is tricky I mean look these clubs haven't played each other very much and you could say well different lineup et cetera but the hope keys\nI Would love to be the top ten team in front of a wild home crowd because they haven't done that in a while I looked at data it's I thought it would be sooner than that but it's been since Miami and you have to go back to two thousand and nine that for that [noise]\nSo uh they certainly Justin ... knows what to look for with Virginia Tech because all of the game is clicking for Notre Dame like I said all fence and defense they've been explosive offensively and of course part of the deal is to get to eat and book but it's been really hard\nTo to do if they've got this pro style\nQuarterback in book and he is nailing it no interceptions had his quarterback rating is like off the charts Seventy four point three percent so it's not going to be a easy and for the keys they're going to have rhyme Willis in there\nAnd he starts he started the season at the back of guy but then he jumped him because he's replacing a the starter Josh Jackson and he doesn't have quite the fire power that he and book has but he hasn't had any interceptions the either but that was again just coming in for him in that last one\nIt's really the ... defense against the Irish often\nAnd one thing Brian Kelly did his he tried he knows that lame stadium will be crazy and he tried to simulate that to make them think don't get cocky just because of where we are because people are talking about a lot and\nDare I say Notre Dame as one of the potential semi final\nTeams you know you got four teams could they be one of the season the answers could they could be one of those teams of course there's a handful of undefeated\nAnd the Irish and where they rank isn't quite there yet but that can change as we motor through more football and the next couple of weeks\nAgo the mountain years I like to talk about because there for another another one of those undefeated teams and if we dive into the scoreboard which I promised I Would do I mean we're almost over this game they got just less than two minutes to play West Virginia dominating Kansas\nThirty eight fourteen and they should have by All right if you analyze this and looked at it and you look at you know we'll career\nAnd he's on that hides been list that you know he tossed three interceptions so he ... he certainly is leading them survive in oh the interceptions or surprising but it doesn't matter because his line is still incredible twenty eight\nOf forty one for three hundred and thirty two yards for touchdowns but the interceptions like I said you did have that he's absolutely\nHe worked hard what are you getting steep twenty thirty seven\nI guess I was thinking

is huge Michigan\nFor and won the Big Ten they are wrapping up the turf they hope but there's still a lot of football to be played in this one because when you got fourteen minutes or so and the clock you never know twenty seven seven if I were looking at a crystal ball I Would say that yeah\nGo to the victors I think they do take this on and Jim horrible has speaking of a lot of noise behind you hit a lot of noise that he's been listening to\nUh since taking over a course of the coach and I think he's found his man in shape Patterson the transfer\nFrom old miss 'cause he's been looking pretty good two hundred and fifty yards passing so far and a couple of CDs for him just to underway a few minutes into the game Clemson has the ball they're trying to\nEnd up six and oh and be perfect

Alabama they a beep Kansas thirty eight to twenty two so we'll Greer look great for touchdowns for him a couple of interceptions three interceptions but still against an opponent that they should have

for them there's always a lot of pride on the line\nSo the Andre Francois\nFSU quarterback with the touchdown for Florida State and they're a handful emitted into the game it's been pretty interesting between Iowa State and Oklahoma State in the big twelve\nOklahoma State the cowboys that seem a lot of people are talking about their foreign one one and one of the big twelve they are trailing at this point though nine seven and that would let them five to go in the first\nQuarter of a ... party forty one path in the yard\nDown for I as you\nI think the game for sure that people are gonna be talking about especially with a rivalry and the big twelve is Texas and Oklahoma Sam only gr\nWas pretty incredible three hundred and fourteen passing yards he's been the hope for Tom Herman and a couple of the touchdowns for him ... Murray with a touch down on the ground\nFor Oklahoma and I'll tell you what Humphrey for Texas nine big catches a hundred and thirty three yards at a tea de forget the lines for a second though it's all blood blood and guts and glory and tears in the end this one plate at the Texas state fair at the ... bowl\nCrowd wild on both sides always in the red river shootout and Texas was really looking like they were going to put a Thumper on the sooner but the sooner is roared back and just to make it interesting they were tied at forty five with less than two minutes to go in the game nine seconds on the clock\nCameron dicker was a forty yard field goal that wins it for the long horn for them to be five in one three in the big twelve this is huge for Tom Herman longed warned fans love it\nAnd you would assume with the college football selection committee 'cause they're going to do their magic Tuesday we'll see who goes where we'll be any kind of big shuffling going on I think they'll shovel up a few spots for sure\nAnd this is big because now we're into the meat of it some of these\nMore than rivalry games are talking about some of these division games that have so much on the line especially when you get from undefeated teams that are sitting there trying to say undefeated so they get into the semifinal\nGames in the um and vie for the for the national title but only four teams can do that so that's what's so tricky about all of it will Texas a and M. pull up the upset over thirteenth rank Kentucky they're undefeated they're five and seven o'clock that one kicks\nAnd the Aggies have been so tough three into and they had the almost should've would've could win over Clemson in College Station which was huge and that really got them going\nSo there certainly is a chance they are the favorite team in fact that they're given a five and a half points in that game the other I think really intriguing game is Notre Dame all eyes on N. B. C. the peacock network watching Notre Dame\nBecause a Notre Dame and Virginia Tech\nAnd a Virginia Tech case at Blacksburg I should say that was on ABC or Virginia Tech\nAt home at Blacksburg can be wild and crazy in book has accounted for more than Ninety points to the office for Notre Dame since he was named quarterback over when Bush and Notre Dame has a has a great off and a great defense\nBut this is a game that could be tricky even though they're favored by six and a half points who cares about that line and it it is a place where they can pull up the the upset and when you look at the Irish\nAnd you go back in history even though they're favored there one and a sign on the road against ranked team\nIs that tells you anything one and nine and how 'bout lowly Nebraska Scott Frost former star for the Nebraska corn ... the coach of Nebraska\nAnd taken on sixteenth rank Wisconsin this one at camp Randall stadium in Madison I Know there were people listening to my show and Madison 'cause you send me to so many great no well you got to feel really confident if you're in Wisconsin if you're in a lump Jonathan Taylor he's on the short list for the highs men\nUm and he's a little lower on the list now is not such ... numbers as he's had before\nBut you look at Nebraska oh they're just a Patsy just waiting to be pounded it seems like there's no hope for the corn hookers with confidence favored by eight team in this they are looking for any kind of hope what so ever\nAnd then because they're struggling so bad people are dropping like flies meaning players\nGot transfers happening the latest one is after the first four games of the season running back Greg bell is going to transfer after getting his scholarship released from the courthouse curse I'm done with this team I'm not going to stay here anymore this is worrisome this is a story the story college football program\nBut this one force dark wow you know even um\n... you've got to walk on wide receiver Cade Warner who's the son of NFL hall of famer Kurt Warner\nThat way you don't need to show your soul to\n\nDo by the American Institute of CPAs and the ad council\nAt temple idea can be developed into something big that could change the world\nIn grade my music teacher helped me make a vision board it was a collage that represented in all my hopes an operation that you\nMy teacher didn't have the tide needed to make her\nWhat if I never got a chance\nUnfortunately that's the reality our teachers face every day they're forced to spend their own money sometimes just to keep the classroom running\nTeaming up again with people for students to donate one million dollar donors choose our\nCharity that help teachers get what they need to bring learning to live for students\nChoose or help for more than seven hundred thousand talking project benefiting more than ...

NBC Sports radio in talking about the pro football this week looking at the the eagles\nAnd where they're headed after winning of course the championship last would they take on the Vikings for the Vikings are so hapless aren't they just want that the link in Philly they love to be three and two after this one but there is some question marks I think\nFor a Philadelphia Philadelphia like so many other health wise I Would say Carson went though looks pretty good I'll tell you who was pretty good at the quarterback but of course Tom Brady here's Tom Brady\nAnd uh the cold than a magical moment for him five hundred for Tom Brady what do you say about that\nWell I think all these you know things are done most of U.S forces there somewhere to contribute to\nRestrict both people to\nReally work hard\nAll their quarterback and prone to show me super catch the ball can be very poison culture to coach [noise] these are all you know great choice [noise]\nPretty cool [noise] yeah you gotta love that he's so smart that's what you do immediately give credit to everyone else because they're the guys that especially up front that are protecting you but it is a huge moment for him so he's in the top five when you want to talk about all time touchdown passes patriots\nBeat the coal thirty eight twenty four that kept us off on Thursday so they pick up their third when it's like automatically Bill Belichick right he says oh the beginning of the season it's just like pre season you're just ironing out the kings and Josh Gordon shows up he scores the first first touchdown with patriots all the drug was problems ... and\nWhat's gonna happen and he goes back to Cleveland and then he's not with Cleveland and they just showed him and sure enough who take the chance to patriots and it worked out at least in that game anyway and he looks pretty psyched to be part of um what was happening with New England who wouldn't be any Andrew Luck luck for him again\nBecause he comes back first full season and the culture one and four we look at the rest of the week going to be intriguing to see what happens with the bangles and Andy Dalton or take it on the dolphins both three in one and they're at home uh Paul Brown stadium in Cincinnati but\nYou know Tyler I for it they got the injury they're so he's poof out but in the mix you got Tyler boy and Joe mix and a lot of people talking about Joe mix especially if you play fantasy I mean last year he had a hundred and Seventy nine yards and a touchdown\nAnd I look at a game is going to be interesting especially have the brown got ripped off with some bad call last week\nYou have bigger Mayfield making a difference now this game is in Cleveland Baltimore's only favored by three but it's the ravens and the browns\nCould just be one of those big games for Baker may field you know I'm part of this off and do we look at looking at I think Nick Chubb getting a bunch of work and it's certainly are seeing that Anthony Callaway getting a ton of work\nAnd you have the NFL admitting that they blew a huge call that the brown should have gotten the fumble they should've blowing the whistle the browns would have recovered a football against the raiders it would've been a huge difference maker in that gave it doesn't me for sure they would have wanted\nBut at the time and where we were in the game or were they were in the game would have made it made a difference [noise]\nUm you know it's crazy though if you look statistically because of the little sports nuggets and I was talking to someone the other day that said you know when you look at rookie quarterback and you look at the way John horrible coaches the ravens are Fifteen and five against\nAgainst rookie QB I dunno Mayfield might find the magic if I were betting person I don't know that I Would bet that necessarily but um\n[noise] that could be that could be close game and that's why you see the line at three and and it's a home game for Clinton came out or if they win that one and then you've got the the game I think that the shapes up to perhaps be the game of the week\nAnd the reason I think it could be the game of the week is because of um what's happening with the Redskins and because of what's happened with the theme Drew Brees finding a rhythm this one is in Louisiana their favor by less than a touchdown\nBut then you've got the red skins really looking for that footing\nAnd the red skins coming off of\nUm a regular season where they just beat the Packers last week they had a brutal law to the cold\nAnd they started off and just decimated the birds the cardinals variety by the way so what um\nWhat happened here when you look at the match up if you want to call it a match up when you when you look at uh the gunslinger Drew Brees and then Alex Smith on the other side of this that and I think Alex Smith really is trying to find footing and this is a very very um\nYou know big big big big game for the red skins huge game for them that's why I think and I think it comes down to the wire I think it's going to be close tight game between these two and I actually liked to Sunday night game or\nYou know I always say that but it's true that Sunday night game the cowboys and the Texans on NBC because the cowboys\nHoping to get some momentum after that last big last second wind and go to three and\nTwo in a tight and if the ease and they've had to move some some players around on that off sensitive line you know we'd go to the school board quickly in college football Michigan wrapping up Marilyn forty two to Twenty one Clemson fourteenth zip over Wake Forest and the second ... before\n[noise] what was going to have but they weren't sure\nYour NBC Sports radio what starts\nFor hordes show we right now it's clubs and on top of Wake Forest fourteen\nAnd they're Thirteen minutes from the halfway point of this river Lawrence did get to start for Clemson happening so far for forty one yard LSU and Florida is tied at seven well but it's still there at the halfway point\nFourteen minutes to go and they'll hit the locker room\nFlorida said seven ... over Miami twenty fifth rank Oklahoma State trailing Iowa State sixteen seven ten minutes to go there and a lot from Indiana and Ohio State in this one Indiana leaving the Ohio State three nothing\nHalfway through the first quarter of that one\nAlabama made it twelve straight against Arkansas they wrap them up at a sixty five to thirty one ... and it was the longhorns ever the sooner papal any NBC Sports radio\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home here dancing on a ... we covered it talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two\nOr\nDuring my ... not available in every state [noise]\nGeorge George with NFL game day more than the\nOld rejected Eugene\nMicheal urban more review every game from every angle every Sunday Morning you got to be able to hang out with a big horse with a lot of reporting from a relatively close to the law [noise] NFL game the more money only on it and as well network\nFrom a bitter mostly due to adhere to\nUm when you get a chance to watch Mason Rudolph the Pittsburgh whenever that happens he's going to be a player that's going to open your eyes as well because\nThey play a lot of games here in the big twelve and you know what we see the NFL right now is what the big twelve has been playing now for the last ten years\nYeah and how about some of these teams you know you look at some of the storied franchises in and got frost who was the star for under ... boy you got a feel for him ... Owens for and players bailing just transferring hey I'll take the transfer\nAnd this is what you can certainly do in college football and we've seen seen this before it makes sense when the players get better time or in a better team but while they're having a hard time keeping it together for Nebraska don't you think\nWell they are but it's his audience and fix I mean you know Nebraska has as much tradition as any program you know college football in the history of it is fantastic so it's ... it's going to take time\nYou follow men with great character in our good leaders in Scott fosters all of that so you got to get his kind of players and their players who have a chance with this you know you know red shirt rules they could play for games is still transfer not lose eligibility\nSo that's going on in college football right now what's going on in the NFL in some cases but you know right now\nAre you just have to give Nebraska's time I think they've got the right guy in there and there's going to be you know their share of growing pains as we've seen so far the seasons\nYeah I'd be remiss not to ask you this because last time we talk we were talking about um Philadelphia and what was going to happen with Carson went in Wayne coming back and went back in how the look and see you and you know now they got the Vikings at home\nAs well uh you know history to throw a ball since December attempt last year and so you know basically Thirteen Days ago um he played well but he was hit a lot of times by Tennessee last week he was sacked four time she was\nThe protection has
