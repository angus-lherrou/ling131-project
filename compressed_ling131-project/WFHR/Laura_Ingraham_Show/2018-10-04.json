D. S. Milwaukee Brewers they go by surprise as\nA Sunday and you're not on a ... not on\nPretty Peralta not on no Pearl Tucson I'm Freddie Peralta yes\nOkay yes he is I read glossed right over him okay I was gonna say 'cause I thought I have I have free Peralta on and I lost right over him I went right from way ... stories so yes pretty Peralta is there you go\n[noise] yeah I mean the I had on my list twelve pictures going in and I had to Daniel in Jennings both of which making the team and then I'm fine with additional players I had\nThirteen and the one guy I didn't have on there was camp rocks and um you can definitely make a strong argument for ... than because of his defense because of his pinch running um and that's why he's on the team so right now they're going to eleven pitchers and fourteen position of players\nBut we we really are confident with how to you know the travel days off in this area is the way we're coming into the series um that will be certainly able to do it and it's not\nYou know look it's not going to be these aren't going to be one out to parents is you know these are going to be longer appearances are going to be two or three inning and parents is that we think we can get through this with\nSo as he said going back to what David Stern said to us\nAt the beginning of the season it's twenty seven outs four thousand three hundred and Seventy four routes bats it twenty seven ounce of game one hundred and sixty two games all those although they had to add a game but get twenty seven outs\nBats it everybody's going to share it\nBack to the philosophy and you know what until it doesn't work\nAs many people that feel this is the non traditional scratch your head kind of way until it doesn't work what do you do you know your role would it\nBe there's a couple of things at work here I mean I look at a guy like Joe ... he's one of the highest paid I think he's the ... the highest paid manager in baseball\nAnd he's got philosophies old school philosophies and I'm listening to his press conference in the end of the season press conference between him and Theo Epstein yesterday and he used to ask about launching goals and everything and and the joke kind of ...\nAnd in the ... steps to the to the microphone he talks about a lot of different things and you know what they're going to focus on the off season and obviously the office was bad but then\nHe talks about no walk launch NGOs are not a fad they're here to stay basically saying well the old school that that hates this stuff and doesn't want to change you got to deal with it\nThis is what the brewers are doing between David Stern and Craig council they're managing numbers yes you put your best players out there you actually go with your guide and you have to understand that but they're managing numbers you know you just\n... in his mind boggling to those that are old school guard it takes a while I look at I don't think any well I was like change\nBut the the saber metrics began in that matriculate ... learned it turned into rates and spin rates in swing speeds and balls in play and wins after replacement and I mean it it it just kind of escalated and PIN number crunchers began to manage the game\nEight five five eight three zero eight six for eight\nSo the brewers have announced that Brennan Woodruff\nIs going to start things off for the brewers this afternoon\nWhat I find interesting is first of all Brandon wardrobe has pitched very well\nUh since coming back up from AAA he's been almost ... in his strategy and he's been able to fill a lot of ... for the spurs team so it makes sense he's someone that fits the mold what council wants that you've heard of there and the sound bite the problem is\nWoodruff face the Rockies earlier this year where he got shelled for seven runs that was in Colorado right yeah yeah\nHow do you not have not gotten a shell there he might have gotten more opportunities but that was a beating but to come back at Miller Park with him\nUm and again pitching at mile high up there in that era in Colorado course feels a little bit different they're pushing a Miller Park but uh I agree he's been very but this is like saying though\nNo pitching is different it's apples and oranges I really should qualify that but\nThis is like saying well you know our land or sea at the beginning of the season didn't play real well so therefore he shouldn't be here when what have you done for me lately has basically got and you hear so I like the fact that they're sticking with the hot hands\nBut my assumption is that ... going to be on a very short leash if he gets into trouble even if it's the first inning if he gets into trouble\nMen on the excuse me before the game gets away from my assumption is he's going to be on a very short leash\nBut see that's that's going to be the tricky thing when you do these both him by committees is if you're trying to plan or project their brain and what you're going to go to winnings and then you're thinking about who the next guy's going to be after that if you're kind of shortness out if something goes wrong in this plan then\nWhat's the backup plan do you go to the guy they were planning on have after Woodrow sooner do you call someone completely different to you know look strictly at the match up and what you have\nBecause again you heard what council said they're going to be using a lot of ... out of these guys it's going to be two three any things from a lot of them\nAnd it might even come from your starters too I mean shot scene is supposed to start tomorrow but it's on short rest so maybe shot seen only pitches three innings and they go right to the ...\nThis is this is going to be a really fascinating tonight I'm excited for it I'll say that and I do I have been a big brain and wardrobe supporter here uh he he is just an amazing job so hopefully\nThings kind of turn around the second time around I mean I Can't imagine he gets shelled again but if you're right bill if if he gets base runners on in the first thing\nIt is counsel rug and a half to go to the pen or is he just gonna have to\nWait it out and see what happens yeah very tricky today\nA five five eight three zero eight six for eight five five eighty three zero eight six for a let's go to Robert listening to us in West Alice robber walking to the program\nAnd Robert you there hey what's up yeah one of the guys thanks for taking my call your\nAh you know ever since I have heard about uh the the bullpen sessions this year really I haven't really given it much thought until I saw Tampa doing that go bad but it makes perfect sense\nAh to me and especially one of the guys earlier I don't know if with on your show or the guys before you talking about the uh yeah a guy going through a rotation only once\nAnd I obviously when a batter has faced a picture that he's seeing what he's got this particular day\nOr the second time around he's ... he's going to be ... more acclimated to it and there's a better chance of getting hit\nSo I I don't know why you wouldn't do that I mean tradition says of course you've got to start or\nA reliever and a closer but I don't know why it has to be that way if you've got pictures and to use pictures to get out his credit comfortable talking about\nJust twenty seven out I mean that's that's the way that it should be looked at that I Know during the regular season maybe it would mess with guys that you know are looking for wins and their evaluated that way but in the end it's all about the IRA and and how many guys get out\nSo I think it's a great plan I'm really looking forward to seeing how this plays out\nYep appreciate it I uh I\nLike I said into it doesn't work what do you do I mean we've seen this before where they they run in these guys out there in in in its words I mean it it it bothers people that it works\nI don't think bothers people in the sense that ah you know I Can't believe that they don't ... I think the people that really wanted this team to go out and get that big time eight number one starter they're kind of scratching their heads going how are they doing this\nThey shouldn't be doing this I Can't pick them to do this they don't have an a starter and if they face the Dodgers and Dodgers in ... show and you go on and on I just think that this this is a collective starter and considering how good their bullpen is this is their race\nOr you're not burning it up because you get off days in between when it comes to the playoff games which is which is the reason that you can use these guys have probably five eight three zero eight six for it's going to gauge it in West Alice how you doing man what's going on\nA Bill thanks for taking my call sure what\nI really I like the uh\nThe uh line up that they have a adding can products and and I put it in the other day I didn't think there is an analyst and we're going to make it\nUm I I like the fact that uh you got a Santana also in there he's going to come off the bench you'll be very valuable as a pinch hitter I don't love this uh idea today of this\nBullpen by committee I guess maybe I'm old school whatever I I just think that you're you're facing a veteran\nA ball club in the Rockies you got a lineup of black men\nOr you know you're talking about Aaron NATO dog story these guys are tough out\nAnd now you're going to put the pressure on a guy like brand and more drove to come in and get these guys out um I I just think that counseling is getting a little bit too cute with this whole idea is you know you've got a veteran\nOf very smart savvy manager and but black you know or you know ... you're not going to fall for you know the old uh\nIf you are right with this ah with this kind of deal with you know these guys coming out of the ban 'em they're going to have a you know something to say about it and so I don't like them in this game today I I think they will ultimately when the series but I'm a I'm I'm questioning what's going to happen today though bill\nAppreciate it as always um I Am looking at but black is being a black it by many accounts as one of the smarter managers in baseball very very good manager [noise] um\nI'm sure they're lucky I'm sure that they suspected is whether that was going to be weighed Miley or just seeing a game to or the bullpen and game three I'm I'm sure that they were anticipating is in some way shape\nOr form I Want to go back to bring in what you're outing against Colorado where he gave up seven runs bottom of the first inning he goes one two three on Lemahieu black men and our NATO\nSo that's the reason you go out and get a guy like Curtis Granderson yeah he's hitting what I think it's like two twenty something last I checked and it's not huge but he's a he's a guy who's been there done that paid five five eight three\nZero eight six for a cause it was a ... out on your thoughts on this roster you're ... more so maybe even your thoughts about going for the first game of the N O D s going where the bullpen by committee\nOr this one is from a ... I think it's ages and he says hey guys not used to this bullpen stuff\nIs it be as stuff I Can't say what you wrote obviously when you get the ... um what happens when his backfires and he's used up all the bullpen orange going into tomorrow's game and she has seen can only go two or three innings does met in essence hurt the team why are they doing this this doesn't seem right is it because they're too cheap to spend money on a big name free agent I you know\nFirst of all the answer is because it's worked okay secondly are they too cheap we'll find out\nThey've only had one real off season where they went out and try to get an acquisition and Darby she decided to go to Chicago instead of Milwaukee because he wanted to play in a bigger city and and it's turned out to be a blessing in disguise some of the best deals that are there may are the ones that are never met\nSo I don't have a problem with what they're doing what I Want to see going into next to this season and more so this off season is what do they do there's going to be a few names out there that can be few arms out there what do they do where do they spend their money how wisely do they spend their money we know they're going to continue to try to bolster the bullpen they've\nGot terrific arms there they've got a terrific nucleus do you go out you don't have to get a number one do you or do you go out and get it a couple of number twos or number two in a number three and you just mix them in and and stack yourself top to bottom with just quote solid pitching and stick with what you do is stick with what got you there you know I mean\nIt goes back to the old ... we're talking about this last night I'm Sherry and I are sitting there watching some of the Yankees game we're talking about post season and about what it takes to get there and I go back a she heard me do one of my pieces\nUm the other night it was talking about the cubs run\nAnd I remember a radio talk show host who is taking call after call after call after call in Chicago\nAnd they were manipulating statistics in talking perfectly and about how that Chicago Cubs team with all of their their talent and acquisitions and the mind of the ... job mad and that the killer and how this thing was set up to win not one but three or four five championships before suddenly those and I'm thinking to myself shut your mouth shut your\nFace you have it one one then they won one but you realize how hard it is to win another one\nHow hard it is to get back to that ... that series every year you would have to be an absolute moron to look ahead\nThat's why you take advantage of it now next year you certainly hope that they can get a few guys yeah but you have to be good you have to be healthy you have to be hot and you have to be lucky\nAnd the brewers for the most part when it comes to the nucleus of this team the strength the backbone of this team which has been the bullpen they've been pretty good in the sense of they haven't had any devastating injuries\nSo they'd been healthy they've been lucky they been damn good and going into the end of the season that one of the hottest teams if not the hottest team in baseball winning eight straight to get there\nSo things fell into place there's no guarantee that will fall into place next year so if you if if you're going to hedge your bets and you want to go out and spend money and make your team\nOr you know reliant upon one big eighth that's fine but if it fails you have handcuffed your team but if you go out and make your team deep and solid your team is much more capable of withstanding the controversy or the you know the the the the setbacks\nIf you lose one guy or two guys because you've got depth and solidity there\nSo I'm not looking for them to go out and spend a ton of money but if they do get into the fray I don't want to see money become the object is to the reason why they fail eight five five eighty three zero eight six for eight it's going to end the listening to us at Brookfield anti welcome to the program go Michael show what's going on man\nHey how you doing today what's up well\nThink that there and found one of the great market inefficiencies in baseball right now and it's a small the market you got to do that and that is for a team like the brewers starting pitching is just way over right\nSo there's nothing wrong with having a frontline start or if you're the cubs or the Yankees that the earth don't afford that so they could have gone and got got got nurture number one but then you're not picking up Granderson or most of those\nAnd that's the only way small market\nRight no I I Would agree I mean ... what they did appreciate the phone but look at it this way remember this off season Jake here yet I could not get a job\nThere was the man he ended up going to Philadelphia had a decent season goes ten and eleven uh three Ninety sixty R A I think a hundred and Seventy plus any sitting or even reach two hundred and he's not many pitchers do anymore but I ended up uh what was it a hundred and thirty eight strike outs fifty seven walks still pretty good still solid pitcher\nBut he wanted like astronomically stupid money and what happened this year and what's going to continue to happen for starting pitching except for the good the ... of the world\nIs going to be we don't need you\nWe don't need to spend two hundred and fifty million dollars on you know we have enough arms that we can spread the wealth out over four or five people to get us through a game\nWe don't need you to come in and go seven innings and be dominant and start thirty eight fifty times a year and go ahead and say you're going to eat up two hundred and fifty million dollars of our payroll that's not going to happen anymore\nWhich is why baseball this whole lawsuit there was going to take place would collusion and it it it's this is the example as to why it doesn't have to happen this is the example as to why you don't have to spend two hundred and fifty million dollars on one guy\nBecause you can find enough arms to go be great\nThat are not going to break the bank on you and and small market teams have to figure out a way to utilize the money best so rather than spending all your money and being ... being top heavy\nYou spread that money out and become solid and solidity seems to be the way to go look at the Astros look now granted they did make a deal for just a Berliner but look at the Astros\nLook at teams are trying to rebuild in that and that methodology Cincinnati wants to do that St Louis wants to do that this can be really tough division for years become the brewers have done it this year so far to perfection\nEight five five eight three zero eight six for eight states you're

doing our show from our ... up there\nAnd then after that I'm gonna be making an appearance at bunkers tomorrow from three to five in addition to that I've got to this is I'm not kidding during the year my phone blown up Joe so my dog poop guy is going through the New York he doesn't know the boundaries Sherry ... there's a stink bug on her on her on her Pepsi cans morning but dogs are barking [laughter]\nOh I've got friends that are coming into town that want to go to Denise and eat it's gonna be a wild one in the meantime\nWe've got to get to it when it comes to the NFL because we want to talk about some of the odds Chris Wray bond senior NFL analyst reaction network and co host of all take that bet on ESPN joining us on the Schneider orange outline it it may have Mitch cats and dogs living together I guess the best way to put across\n[laughter]\n[noise] so uh let's let's start out with some of these games obviously we'll get to the Green Bay game coming up here and just a little bit but\nWhen I'm going through this last night getting getting ready for this today I'm looking at a lot of these different games New England given up ten and a half to Indianapolis I Know Indianapolis hasn't necessarily been a judge or not in New England I mean they put it all over Miami which I thought was a little bit surprising because Miami I I don't know if they were just becoming the paper champion or what\nBut New England giving up that much at home\nMan oh man that's that's a big spread right there for Indian Andrew Luck\nYeah it is you know that caused injury on a short week um they're they're looking at at protecting me there ... starting cornerback air looking at the White House is going to be out regardless I'm Andrew Luck and not wait well without you buy into I up and so it's going to be tough\nFor them on the short we kind of go on the road to Fox borrow and and keep the game quote and I think that's why you're seeing that\nSpread it also a lot of shark might covered it on the under a net gain that can open the higher Toto I moved down I'm for that reason it's going to be a struggle for Indianapolis and move the ball and it was like robbery gonna play and the other factor the patriots well a lot of factors kind of in working in the patriots paper\nYou know one interesting game and I looked and I had to shake my head a Baltimore only given up one on the road in Cleveland has Cleveland garnered more and more and more respect\nI think so I think ... if people are really kind of trusting in hand in Cleveland put up a lot of points last week now granted came again ah you know the raiders event than their\nShape but I think you kinda need a change in Cleveland we're may feel that the hell that they can go and put up forty five where we retire at Taylor and they were they were kind of playing games a whole different kind of weight on off and they're all going to open up a lot more with make they're\nLearned more at ... dot com

services preparing best to make an impact within their next mission through education and find out more SCU W. dot edu slash veterans [noise]\nAdams County joining as soon as shatter orange hotline and Adam\nLooking at this roster that was released a little while ago for the ... twenty five men playoff roster I'm no Jay Sanders and he was not a pitching well down the stretch but knows that Davies they did keep pretty Peralta a Curtis Granderson key on Braxton both on that roster any surprises to you\nWell yeah number one twenty five men in the ass robbed soldiers\nPriority each round town a lot of people have asked that and they can replace injured players if somebody goes down but then whoever went out they're not eligible for the next round so that's sort of the uh the guidelines for this\nUm you know the surprises for me uh only Josh hater among the ah you know the relievers a lefty relievers Xavier ... each were left off\nThat came as a surprise um junior Guerra is in camp Roxanne is known as a defensive sub um and pinch runner I think a lot of people thought the Santana was going to be in killer Williams out of the bullpen has a little bit of surprise for me\nSo sorry to kind of bounce back and forth but I you know there were some surprises I think in the big picture I probably had them with twelve pictures instead of eleven\nOr the correct council has he said yesterday I think their idea here is that they are well rescue by virtue of winning that\nTie breaker game against the cubs and I think the ideas that are like today with brand and what ... um they're going to use a bunch of pictures but it's it's likely to be a lot of the inning type situation so they think with these eleven guys\nWell rested a lot of them having been starting pitchers throughout most of the season and relatively stretched out that they can cover the innings they need to cover it with the off they sort of helping along the way\nThe last time we drew faced this team uh it wasn't a great outing how short I think the leash is for him\nBut I was looking at that bell and it was a ... that you're talking about uh the game it was in may I think it was a it was the second or third name of that series where the birth came back from six down when they want in extra innings and eleven to Ken Coors Field classic\nAnd the damage against ... all except for one Ron done the second time through the order and I think that is notable because um you know this\nBeing a bullpen gained the idea probably as you get them through wants through the order 'em and you hope that three innings but we'll see how it unfold and then you go on to whoever they have up next in the Rockies or a team\nThat are are vulnerable to right handed pitching much more than ... so that's why I think you see a lot of writers on his postseason roster\nUm and uh yeah I mean look both parenting is the way up the game is what a lot of uh you know they did it in a a a wild card game last night the brewers did it a lot of it with that than Jennings game and in um St Louis although I think that\nWe will not see that we will not see a one batter type open or we're going to see an open or go\nA couple of innings and then move on to the next guy\nSo looking at this because I really I I was listening last night to a lot of people speculate about this particular series uh I really like by black I I think he's probably one of the better mines in baseball and now it's all about countering what the brewers are going to do so do you see them\nUm it it's in essence you the brewers are coming out of the aggressor we're gonna come out when to get out and we're we're ... we're not going to be screwing around with starters and stuff like this in game one we're gonna jump out to the to the early ones that lead in essence what what do you think by black counters with if any if anything\n[laughter] well I don't know I mean there there's the Iraqis strategies probably similar it's it's in the postseason\nUm and I think the idea of\nA meeting in English from your starting pitcher or that her major league baseball we watch it here in Milwaukee over the last two years\nUm that totally goes away to some extent during the house so you know I don't think the way the Rockies are going to approach this is very much different I just think there may be lined up\nWith more traditional ideas of starters in relievers and part of that is they have some very good starters I'm no germane Marquez strikes everybody out uh everybody as if you watch the wild card game you saw Kyle freelance very very good young pitcher\nYou know they've got some studs or the brewers got to where they're at without studs and and I don't mean to diminish the guys they do have because they were eleventh uh thirty major league teams starting\nStarters the IRA there were very good at starting pitching they did it in a different way though I think they were I looked it up I Believe they were like twenty first in innings per star\nSo there's a lot of these shorter outings they were aggressive with the guys are that they had in the pan they had that shuttle back and forth to triple a that was a huge part of the story of his gr season even though the when those guys pitched in games they're awful lopsided games they drew in the house or Jorge Lopez\nUm the guys in that group played a big part in what this team was able to do\nUm they just have their built a little bit differently um and I think that's reflected a in a way this in the U.S roster looks and then be in the idea that you're going to bullpen gained a lot of your first postseason series seven years\nAnd by the way they're basically both any game to even know jellyfish us Lewis starting because he is going on short rest and I think the idea is to is that that will be a a a shorter than usual out and I don't think we'll see and pitch\nDeep into the game like he did a in Chicago the other day\nAnd then if they get through that game with the bullpen and good shape I think we could see them bullpen game three in Denver um pretty Peralta has very good numbers against the Rockies\nIn to start small sample but look at it it's a factor um I think he's he has an opportunity to play a role in the series so they are going to\nKind of break what we consider the rules of postseason baseball where you know you there's no Madison Bumgarner here there's no Jon Lester they're gonna try to get through this a little different way and the ideas you know the cliche at this point from car council but the idea is\nPut the best guys the best combination of pictures to get twenty seven out\nIs this me we were sitting here talking earlier I was listening to\nNational talk yesterday and they were talking about Joe ... Joe man's job said and he's making\nSix or seven or eight million dollars a year whatever happened to be but they were saying well this is the way the future because these younger managers they just come in they can plug and play a lot of different guys and it doesn't mean as much and I'm thinking to myself wait a minute if you're going to use the bullpen by committee things started by committee started by both and\nYou now ... years even more incumbent upon the manager to polarize push the right buttons and pull the trigger the right particular time managing harder now than it once was\nWell yeah and you're also managing a lot more data than it was I think managers before they obviously had you know a sense of of the numbers and the history and the match up but\nIt it maybe it was a little more got 'em and now it's not just data for them it's data for all of us\nAnd you can even be sitting in the stands and he got the stadium walk by and you can call up bank wrap on your phone and look at the numbers and the second guess the manager right there from your seat in ... three so um there's just a lot more information available to these guys I think it does make managing I'm\nMore I'm more of a spotlight on on your decisions in as these teams make earlier and earlier and earlier calls to depend\nOn it just means more decisions it's more decisions to second guess and that's kind of a job you're signing up for if you if you you know take one of these thirty managerial jobs I'm pretty sure everybody's going to want the job though\nNo no I mean there was only thirty of them and they pay pretty good and you know if you enjoy baseball you're going to be probably hanging around for a while so absolutely I Would take one of those jobs here's my other question speaking of taking jobs or the Mets are looking to your boss to their organization and kind of rebuilding their talking to Doug Melvin right\nYou know I I still think there's upside in this office I think I think all kinds of lead terms of talent they're fine uh they got some Andrea Hsu TJ line has been in and out of the line up um you know\nThey run the ball better at times but they've also been behind the games and they have really been able to stick to that so I think often simply\nThey're better than what we've seen so far um you know the Dallas game that ten points going into the fourth quarter they're better than that um the patriots the forty niners than I think there were sitting on Thirteen and the fourth quarter or something like that uh they're better than that so I just think\nYou know with with a patient they have that they need to get more production I think that\nHopefully will come as the season goes on a but they they have to your point they've they've tried to add some things in the running game all fence of wind it put a lot of assets into it and that's not to take away from Matthew Stafford that's an ad for Matthew Stafford to just give the team another dimension and not be\n... to allow him to be able to turn around and hit the ball to somebody and have something good happens which has been very rare and his career so you know I I think that's a work in progress I think all offensively talent lies\nThere in a pretty good spot even if it has an added up to all the production of looking for yet so far I think on the other side of the ball is where I think they still need some basis\n[noise] um well that's the opposite side of things when it comes to the Green Bay Packers they're banged up often simply right now a rental car may not play drawn while listening concussion protocol\nAll of us in Montana so it turns up with a leg injury as well a Jimmy Graham although was maintenance does nursing somewhat of a knee injury they are pretty good in the running back situation but how do you look at facing the Green Bay Packers team in that and oh by the way you earn Rogers even though he looked a little mobile last week has been a little off and then he certainly is an issue\nYeah I mean it's still starts at twelve I mean look where he is tormented this franchise over the years with with what he's done a lot of people are is obviously one of the best to ever play that position to ever play the game um you know I I think\nThis the science has to show that it could stop because they didn't really nice job against Tom Brady that's the kind of effort they are going to need\nAgainst Aaron Rodgers to to win this game and and to find some way to try to hold them down to where he's not scoring it will and hang in thirty seven points out so I'm a look ... it's been that way for a long time you have to find some way to deal with him he's\nHe's so good back there in terms of feeling pressure subtle movements that doesn't take them a lot of effort to find an opening the throw from a lot of different angles and and he's very accurate from those different angles and that's\nThat's given the lions trouble over the years I mean he says his record speaks for itself against Detroit is number speak for itself against Detroit and that's where it starts and oftentimes ends I mean I'm sure the lines are gonna have to score points to to win this game but\nI Do look at the box or the end of it a lot of it's going to be chalked up to how they do against Aaron Rodgers and can they at least keep him\nAnd Shaq and then often simply you know you can't turn the ball over you can't give them short field you can't let their defense score a they've obviously made some changes defensively and and the lines of get a look at that that this is this is a different unit than we've seen in the past\nUh they've added some pieces and and you know it's still anytime you can throw\nThat out there Daniels out their guys like that that that sort of really good unity after\nThat I was just going to ask you about the defense because my pet and\nIt it's not like it is hugely wild dominant man demand defenses who's going to punch in the nose but they've been able to dial things up in disguise coverages disguise which is bringing from all different areas has that been something that I'm a I'm going to say vastly different from the dung paper way of doing things\nWell I I think when you look at it you can scheme but you still have to have talent and you still I mean\n... Alliance Defense but if if the talent isn't good enough ultimately\nThe team with better talent I think finds a way you know if you look at what green base working with Matthews can still get after the quarterback Nick Perry's tormented alliance you know oftentimes coming back home and and having good games against them Daniels as it is outstanding I'm so\nTo start with those pieces and be able to work your scheming to it it it is a very nice place to be and I think that's the\nGreen Bay has right now it's you know ... has talked about the different look then they have seen in the past but he he you know comment and all the way that they've executed and and you know been able to adapt to to some new things and um I I still think it comes down to\nWhen you walk into that job and you want to change things that's great but if you don't have the pieces\nThat doesn't mean as much they they've got while there may not be exactly where they want to be defensively you got some really terrific pieces to build around there\nBefore I let you go when you look at and you mentioned Aaron Rodgers as long AS number twelve there\nBut it seems like you know ... give me a little more play cousins there there are still plugging along even though they look ugly against buffalo Minnesota still plugging along still very good team and that was a shootout against a very good defense out in LA even though there were a little bit banged up\n... by any chance do you see any I don't want to say equivalency but there's not a changing of the guard by any stretch of the imagination but teams are starting to to realize how to win in the in the NFC North without having that dominant quarterback right\nYeah I I don't think there's any question I'd say you know I think you and I talk to you know factor in camp and I just said you know there's the first time where I looked at it and said it doesn't start man with Rogers in Green Bay is either that the Minnesota was the favorite coming in and\nYou know they've obviously got some issues going on there though the offensive line and and not being able to get some of those things go in and and ... and Griffin hopefully he's going to be able to figure out what's going on and most importantly is him and on the personal side of it but he's he's a dominant player that's a big part of the fence which missing right now so I'm look\nI think you and I talked about the bears last time there doing it right there I I didn't necessarily see them getting off\nBut they're drafting talented players are and they utilize the draft to build that roster and when you do that you're just not very expensive for a while until those guys start coming up for second contracts that allows you to trade for a guy like colonial Mack was a massive difference maker so I mean\nThey weren't going to be an easy out for anybody before ... showed up now that he's there and you've got one of the most dominant pass rush years in the NFL\nI mean look out that that changes everything and that that can take it from a good\nOr dangerous to a really good really dangerous real fast and take some of the pressure off or young quarterbacks\nTo have to you know we games and put things on his shoulders and and now he's got a running game that he can work with two there's there's a lot of good things happen in Chicago right now and I don't know where they'll go this year that they're going to be around for a while and if they continue to add the talent mix that they're going to be really dangerous in\nMinnesota I Would think we'll get things straightened out at some point look\nGreen based Green Bay he's still there I mean a rush to anywhere either so ah I I think this is we we went in thinking this was going to be a tough decision it may look a little bit different than we thought it was going to but it's still bottom line are really really tough division Dan\nAlways a pleasure enjoy yourself this weekend we'll talk to you in Sioux my

[laughter]\n[noise] ah he was also as you say you get visibly upset on the sidelines with some of the young guy he's a specifically after some drop passes mark was out at scaling you kind of have it out there on the field as well talk about that\nWhat are you supposed to tell them what they're trying to get some callers like they're trying to\nTrying to drop it does happen you know that's part of it there in the right spot where it's got to come up with those players you know to be more efficient off as we had a convert those third ... better [noise] um I got to play better and we had to make a make some more players outside\nI'm here's here's I I'm going to stop there for a second I don't care if Iran Rogers throws his helmet on the ground\nDoesn't matter to me yeah he can get visibly upset\nHe look if you're out there busting your own ass and you're doing everything you can do when you can't expect people to be at your level because you're a super athlete okay that was a lot of athletes turn to coaching or that try to acquire talent or try to up coach talent to beat them you can't\nMichael Jordan Walter Payton Joe Montana Steve Young Aaron Rodgers Brett Farr Tom Brady there ... there aren't any\nYou can't you can't ask somebody to be Aaron Rodgers he's not but what you can ask for the concentration to make plays\nAnd when when Tom Brady screams at his guys and I mean I have seen him scream at his office of Lyman as wide receivers out his coaches people's ... being competitive Aaron Rodgers does it he's ... he's a jerk Brett Farr never did that stop it\nWhy do we asked this question continuously\nYou know\nI mean if you let the guy she almost you'd look he's saying the same thing you were saying mark was out at scaling did not come back for that football\nDidn't come back for it we're in the press box going damn it I Can't believe you didn't come back for that football there's a rookie for ya\nMy Columbus and I are looking at each other saying the exact same thing the only difference is nobody cares what we do Aaron Rodgers on the field and you can see get a little fired up that's called being a leader yeah you're getting undressed in front of everybody but damage concentrate on the football do your job\nAnd that's what he's saying and I'll tell you this mark was valid scaling will probably never forget to come back for football\n'cause he just got lit up and find eighty thousand people\nIn the meantime\nAsk about that same situation after that blown route and an ear interception I'm Aaron Rodgers went back to it\nI Want to give them another chance you know um [noise]\nThe first round is the route that are joining I throw in our sleep so you can\nNecessarily expect a you're on the same page right away and situation like that so I came back to the medical radish ran by the guy and um [noise]\nYou know I was a nice a nice place for him any young receiver needs to kind of big players going up twenty five Nineteen nothing to that point you know good opportunity to go back to them and given a chance\nIn addition to that he's asked if he uh you know it was three rookie receivers that they've made progress as far as being in sync and adjustments in such\nWhere they're getting better when you're making place you know you guys don't see the practice you see the warm ups but um [noise]\nBut ... and making a lot of poison practice inappropriate and and same with the new\nUm [noise]\nMaybe three has been ahead of those guys for a while um and getting more opportunities as you saw last week with a copy being out and kind of being first out but [noise] you know I tell those guys before we want it said we're all going to get an opportunity some points [noise]\nAnd when you step in there's an expectation and make the place so we got to keep improving in practice you know to be able to get out there tomorrow as long as I don't have any setbacks\nIn the next to have you know twenty two hours I expect to be out there tomorrow and the good to get those guys from opportunities in practice to keep trying to grow together\nAlso Aaron Rogers says hey afraid of Cobb and Graham and everybody you are out or you know he should have devised a Adams in three Wilkie rookie\nHe's a guy that can go over the middle you could take a hit he's longer you got big orange she's caught every thing in pre season in training camp\nAnd he's kind of that but he's not a voter but he's kinda that possession guy and if you need somebody in the back corner of the end zone if you need somebody crossing over the middle to give Jay ten yards that could be your guy I really liked him and I think he's going to develop\nJay mine or is it Jim on the origin on J. mock jury mom or your mind I needed to Jamaica judging right on okay\nAlright okay I got a fairly these guys are\nLoaded were loaded hey by the way I heard at pall mall or staying at your house now right\n[noise] yeah he needs a place to place up day um [noise] yeah it's a it's sad 'cause you're here\nA group locally here and right places\nFor a little while you know he's a license\nAnd there and I'm sad to see them this way remember he was the manager of the year one year ago and they still they caught the court they have only they have\nThe twins and they just he just couldn't develop anybody they had you know if you roll back the clock like three or four years ago the twins had arguably the most promising subtle prospects coming through the major leagues and none of them developed and many request so that was at Dover\nWhich ashamed to say how many times we've seen hall of famers you would think would be terrific managers and then it just it doesn't happen and that's the way you remember the you know career so to speak so\nThat you know and and how many great managers were never materialized yet regularly level I mean it's just it's too told really different skill sets you want to believe that it would cost over but a lot of times it just\nDoesn't look good George reducing baby you Joel welcome to the program which I Would have been\nDoing um I got a question uh Aaron Jones or marketing room\nBar I work with me on this one I gather and Jones is gonna break out like this is going to be the game that we're going to look back and go well I was you know this was when he put himself on the map separated from the the rest of the crowd a\nGreat opportunity against a terrible wrong the fence and when you've got Aaron Rodgers out banging the drum for you I think that's an awfully good sign when he's doing that publicly and can you know what you want to touch with Aaron Jones or do you want to touch with a with their minds I mean I to me\nSeems got two cars and especially if we don't have any starting when she was going to get the ball in the their best player makers hand\nAll that said ... I'd still start barking from over Aaron Aaron jobs because he's parking Herman ... off last year and is a high powered off it but still I think I think Jones is sitting on the breakout game do you agree you see it this way\nI I I Would agree I Would agree with you at this point I I'm Still had little has been 'cause I got to see it on a consistent basis but I Would completely agree oh let's do this let's go to Shawn listening to some machines you got a question for both George you what's happening\nI got a flux question standard boring I have either Ridley Jeffrey or golladay and would you keep starting I'm BJ\nWell yeah I still will go back I mean this is still a good match for him I just remember fourteen wide receiver this week it goes up against Carolina and\nHe's the only a receiver with at least twenty catches and three hundred yards but no touchdowns and telling me something productive he just hasn't found the end zone yet so I wouldn't worry about too much but Calvin Ridley\nHis powering his way to work in the year he looks awesome and over the last three games he scored six touchdowns I mean it's it's amazing and it's no flu he's getting crazy separation with his route running in his speech he's great he's my number loving wife she was a Swiss\nWatch your back do good in Brookfield doing what's going on man\n\nAfternoon wondering or bending office burger Alex Smith\nBen Roethlisberger is my number two quarterback toys because up against the falcon spent decimated by injury knows starting phase east for the falcons\nThey're starting said these are something called the Mont take heart disease\nAnd they are all over there and they're getting all roasted over the past three games opposing quarterbacks we're averaging three hundred fifty six yards and three touchdowns against the falcons Broncos burgers at home or you has the vast majority of his big games fans are guy\nLet's go to Ken listening to us and received care and you got a question propose George junior was happening\nToday I got issue if I've got Kenyan grade and praying Gore I don't even know what's that going to start one of them this week or should I go with or just going to find someone else\nI mean you know you might be better off off the waiver wire the frustrating part is that Gore's getting as much more than ... dreadful for a couple of straight games of perceptions help you let's go to Drake and hopefully get you get\nTo find something to find some yard it that way but it's\nThe Miami running back situation is brutally bad right now unfortunately in ...
