E. D. S. Jed Jed Jed now there's Denver running in fact it's really kind of surprising cause of build Lindsey they've got to a two person rookie attack which they really didn't expect to have a but they've not been the greatest to throw the ball which is really her to marry as Thomas has value the fantasy football world\nBut the jets have been well they've been the jets right what do you think that's what I'm thinking I'm thinking the jets have been the shows lately they had their balloon built for a little bit but the the wedding I like the ... I like the Broncos I Am going to take the Broncos as well and what is almost to pick them actually the home field advantage is worth three points by jets are giving up a point you do the math [noise]\nPittsburgh has got to host the Atlanta Falcons rather large number anytime that number and the total that they're gambling goes over fifty that's a big number fifty seven point five currently

really do I like the Steelers ... again I just think as far as these to these guys always match up even with pretty much though a lot of scoring I think the struggles of Bull Run at home and I'm going to have to go with the Steelers at home because they're at\nHome and they seem to play a little bit better there and you know Libya and bell is coming back but I mean that is clearly hurt the team is made him a little bit dysfunctional\nOr this year Green Bay visit Detroit you know what a history they have and you know Matt Stafford kind of makes it a shootout that's why Vegas eve this total as the one\nWe like it is ... ... ... the\nDetroit Lions wow governors loves set over a Green Bay Im sorry I'm going to have to go there and Rogers until I see somebody beat him a Miami is going to visit

key word there is you can it's not going to happen [noise] mine was at home\nNiners at home I'm going to go with another upset he noticed there's no money on these pets [laughter]\nYeah I'm going to go with the Josh rows and somehow figure it out and near it out and not enough I don't know why pick it up [laughter] I don't think I really believe that when I get no money ah Philadelphia what is wrong with the Philadelphia Eagles holy smoke\nA Philadelphia host Minnesota a couple of teams that both need to try and figure some stuff out here which one you're going to lean on for this you know these are really as consistent as I like him to be this year I I think the eagles are going to do it at home\nWe lack of delving cook is going to push me in the direction of the Philadelphia Eagles data near at home and they need to take care of their business I think both teams are not desperate but really would like a winning this but the Alvin cook is a serious you know\nThe war and as we would call him in fantasy football and if he's questionable even if he does not going to be a hundred percent he's on one of my team he's not going to play until I see him healthy and putting a big numbers and the same thing goes I mean he's not able to contribute at that high level up or Minnesota either I'm going to go to Philadelphia [noise] um [noise]\nThe rams with Rob Bush still likes it or not the rams own the sea hawks and they have for a long time and now a this is going to be ugly they say the total is fifty point five and as soon as they think Seattle's going to be able to fight back a little bit rattled [laughter]\nRams minus seven in this one who do you like for maybe the rams were forty five channels score seven I don't know I've I wrapped [laughter] I'm going to take the

receiver you want to get out there are other sits Sammy Watkins versus the jags and a lot of that has to do with the jags and some of it has to do with Sammy Watkins\nA ... a Quincy ... is another one uh that is a thumbs down across the board and our friends over wrote a world of feel the same way about that again wrote a world is our partner and you can go to a a wrote a world dot com or for any kind of fantasy information I mean these guys are loaded you want to talk about details and get it right down to the up\nUh these guys will break it down for he's a matter of fact they're sort of stardom is probably one of the more\nIn depth that you're going to find a for any of the prep services I you know I've over ten years I've been playing fantasy football not a long time but but ten years I think the tenth year\nAnd I got a handful of places are that I like you know are a couple of maybe three or four places that I like and I have to say this not just because we're partnering with them but I mean do it yourself checkout wrote a world dot com and then go to send them start to look at their their coverage it's\nFour pages at least four or five pages Steve a whole page of quarterback whole page of running back oh page wide receivers tied in to get it [noise]\nUh all of that is a is available to you or let's go to some running backs hear Dionne Lewis who's headed to buffalo are their defense as not only allowed thirty points per game but they've given up the fourth most receptions to running back that's exactly what the Lewis says out of the backfield\nOr for the Tennessee Titans who're playing better football than people think honestly three and won first place just knocked off the eagles\nUh deion Lewis is somebody that is getting a thunder storms up this week so as Matt Brita I got to tell you this man I traded Matt Brita away for nothing in the beginning of the season well you know he's the next man up he'll get some volume touches and so I use that to trade him\nOr someplace else I wished I don't know the guy is that a really remarkable season and against the cardinals abridged currently I mean we were leading the NFL a week ago\nAh he's currently the running back sixteen or at a half point PBR ah\nNot regular scoring but a PBR scored another great start this week is Chris Thompson\nA at the states on Monday Night football this guy is somebody that was absolutely tearing up destroying it last year and like leading your fantasy team before he got hurt you come back now and you're thinking All right you I'm going to go for this guy than Adrian Peterson comes out\nLike a marketing ran over the NFL Network and I both said look if this guy's value just a huge hit with Adrian Peterson coming here because it's going to it's going to walk the number of uh\nUh the number of touches it he gets well now Adrian Peterson is dealing with an ankle injury Rob Kelly has been moved on the IRA so he's done so Chris Thompson is going to see the touches or this guy's a solid start another running back start the I like today is Aaron Jones at the lions look to the uh uh the Packers are dealing with a\nInjuries on the wide receiving corps that it's really unbelievable I mean you've got your ... and who's in concussion political hasn't practice all week long probably not going to play a ... uh [laughter]\nThey got their problems are that means it'd be who'd been to run the ball Aaron Jones has been on suspension bridge a couple of weeks who just came back last week and so he's got a little pressure the most clearly the guy that they want to give the ball to he should have a pretty good week this week\nUh guys that I'm sitting running backs them sitting down and cook\nA I've got this guy in my team in Iran him out there as soon as he came back a week ago and I I regretted it immediately putting out there on on a Thursday night game\nAgainst the rams but delving cook as the guy that until he's healthy until I see him run explosively and play the whole game and put some numbers up he's got to stay on my bed he may very well go out there to have a great game against eagles I don't think that's going to happen\nI it's possible anything goes in a silly game\nUh but I'm going to delve and cook it's just going to have to hang out on my bench\nI'm starting beyond Lewis over delving cook this week because I I just like the match up better and I haven't seen a healthy delving cook yet so gotta wait and see what happens there Kenyan Drake is another one that that we're sitting this week that a lot of us are believing in putting on the bench he ranks twenty third in the league with a twenty three rushing attempts per game\nNow that's not good but he's averaging does is worse eight point three are game what Frank Gore his teammate is averaging more than that\nYikes a Miami oh Lyme are really not doing that good this week uh they're gonna have to take on\nVolunteer is perfect he's back from suspension he's run stuff or works the middle\nA and you should also note that drink is projected for just about forty five yards and this game and like it was a twenty three or less carries\nFrank Gore has done better than that while Kenyan drink is not somebody that uh I'm going to put my faith in a fantasy why's this week\nOr I or anything you know unless John McCoy have to say that he's still on the list until I Know this guy's a hundred percent he said the ribs you know you're not going to hit the whole explosively when you've got that kind of\nA when you get that kind of major plus the titans are better on defense of people give them the credit for two so he's another one that's a that's a city this week by who've boy that's a mouthful coming up next\nWe're gonna we're gonna recap a little bit go a little bit backwards but also part of it as the jailer Ramsey watch just how it's jailing Ramsey doing after talking smack on oh I don't know every quarter back in the league will share that'd be the sports radio and he's portrayed it I got\n[noise]\nWhat you gotta [noise]\nOr if we look at new sports weather and other great information was or was it thirty twenty ws HR\nWhat say for ten is ready

here on a game day our quarterback mark Malone mark great have you on my friend is always great games on the schedule\n\nAnd we're getting ready for those games mark I appreciate that a standby we're having a little a technical issue with their own mark Malone hang in there we're going to be joined here by mark in just a second um but yes no doubt some big games on a schedule today and\nIncluding the jags and the chiefs right from arrowhead and it is wet and it is rainy and I'm gonna try to reconnect here with mark on him with me a kind of doing this on the fly but we've got Wi Fi Sunday in the NFL\nAnd we're looking for that game it's going to be pretty good and I think we're ready to go now yes we are with mark Malone and mark again the game today coming up you're getting underway arrowhead between\nThe jags and the chiefs\nWelcome to the program you hear him under center during the week here on NBC Sports radio kind enough to join us here on a game day our quarterback mark Malone is with us mark great to have you on my friend is always a what a start you know there's\nGreat games on the schedule every single weekend and this week is no exception how about I mean who would've thought here we are weak five and coming up to date Heinz Field the Steelers at one to one and the falcons one and three whoever loses that game it was going to be in big trouble\n[laughter] I don't think there's any question about that we were talking about that on the show every day Joe\nUh who needs to win most or is it at the Lana or is it Pittsburgh um\nI you know you can I guess you could argue that it Lana has been you know kind of hamstrung with some of their injuries are especially on the defensive side of the football it seems as though over the last couple of weeks they've gotten the red zone issues on off and scored away a little bit uh but it seems like they have to win in shootouts or when you look at Pittsburgh\nAre between the distractions that have been caused by well beyond bell and Antonio Brown who hasn't been as big a part of the confidence is I think everybody thought he might be\nOther been a lot of issues in that locker room but to me whether or not levy on bill comes back mid season and helps the off chance to get some balance because let's face it they're just not running the football they've got to find a way to do that against Atlanta a little bit and I think they'll have a little bit more success given the injuries on the falcons defense but\nTo me the biggest issue in Pittsburgh is on the defensive side of the football they've just been God awful you look at some of the metrics that helped define plays of or the play on the defensive squad\nAnd I was looking the other day or this defensive squad were the defense of Pittsburgh I should say I am more generally has not played this badly since Nineteen sixty eight and a couple of metrics or they'd never played this badly\nAh I I don't know what they're doing a chief butler has come under some pressure the defensive coordinator my comments kind of find a way to get this things straightened out a little bit\nAnd ah if they don't I don't think it matters a floppy on bill comes back because uh I I don't think that defense will be good enough to get them deep into the playoffs\nAnd as you know mark who would've thought that the two surprise teams at least early on in the AFC would both be in the AFC North the bangles and the ravens are are are you buying this three and one start with Cincinnati and what they're doing\nWell you know it's so funny because you know Cincinnati and more of them will as he gets a lot of it gets a lot of flak for not having one at a playoff game but for for a number of years there they were in the postseason almost on a yearly basis last year was a huge fall off I get it [noise]\nAh I I think I'm losing ... is going to hurt that off that's a great deal you know we talk about energy agreed to use a hell of a\nA football player the wide receiver position but either does so much for you in the center of the football field and the red zone that I think he's going to be a huge loss stomach advantages perfect that I don't know if that's a good thing for us for the he's a good football player but he does you know just knock let things that ended up costs and your games\nThe raids on the other hand are are really interesting football team um\nThey I think are the only team in the NFL that are cheap five and both are in rushing defense and passing the parts they play very very well on that side of the football which I don't know as a shock uh that that's kind of been part of their DNA but they get Jimmy ...\nThe Ford game suspension so you add to that a pro ball corner and you go wait a second\nIs pretty good football team so I I think that's one of the more interesting match ups of the of the weekend and uh and my buying into the\nBengals and the and the ravens um I think it's going to make the NFC North a lot more interesting especially given the way the the Pittsburgh Steelers have gotten off to such a rough start and let's not forget the brown speak see I mean there there are people out there that that are actually you know I'm remembering\nThe words of Cleveland Browns ... America's new team ... people for whatever reason had gravitated to Baker Mayfield and uh finally ending that losing streak and and that's a football team that I think has become certainly much better but a lot in it it's kind of taken on a national\nOn a national interest in a ... every every week I'm I'm interested in turn on the television watching to see what they do and how big are may feel play so that's a really interesting division\nYup Baker may feel in the browns back in Cleveland to take on the ravens the bangles back home to take on the three and one dog than to have that new show last week in New England and of course you know arguably one of the games of the week and maybe not getting the hype that it deserves but\nI mean how can you go wrong with the Ford oh chiefs in Kansas City hosting the jags and what could be a possible playoff\nPreview yeah it's it's so funny I've spent a lot of time talking about the Kansas City team and listen Patrick homes is a blast to watch\nThe kid has gotten out to a better start than anybody in the history of the game of deposition in my opinion is ability to break down defenses out of pocket is a an surpassed I forget a hundred and Ninety two yards out of the pocket against Denver on Monday Night\nNobody's done that in the NFL for a decade hasn't thrown an interception yet uh but the problem with that football team and it's the one reason I don't think they'll represent the AFC in the super bowl is their defense is just not very good\nAnd I don't see it getting gotten considerably better between now and the end of the football season that's not that doesn't mean that they're not going to win the AFC West and and and find themselves in the postseason and they'll face of Jacksonville football team\nBut let's face it you know without Leonard for net a and by the way if you look at the numbers of the Blake morals is put on a board went from that has not been on the football field because of injuries\nThat they're pretty damn impressive he has been able to pick up the slack and and really um you know kind of control that often through the passing game a little bit but but let's face it Patrick homes is going to face a defense that you could you could argue is the best in the league right now they're good against the run that get after the passer\nAnd they've got the two best cover corners I think as a tandem in the league and Ramzi ... so a bedroom homes is going to face something he hasn't seen yet in the NFL and my guess is you'll struggle a little bit this weekend\nThat mark below with us here on NBC Sports radio as we get ready for a week five Sunday any NFL\nMarket one of the quarterback question for you from the early games or one of the other I guess surprise teams or maybe not a surprise there were a playoff team a year ago but what do you make of the three one started for the Tennessee Titans there at buffalo today they haven't been flashy but markets Mario to seem to kind of get the up and schooling last week\nUh what do you see what the titans moving forward\nYou know it's so funny that you know the the ... everything coming out of Nashville and say listen you know we're not getting the law were not getting any prospect and you think about it I mean they beat the eagles the defending Super Bowl champions I go to go down to Jacksonville\n\nWashington DC the man\nDuty I Wonder if I told you the tornado was going to happen tomorrow right where you live [noise]\nDown and exactly three Seventy two PM and I told you the exact path\nYou would talk with your loved ones and you make a plan today\nIt's true I Can't tell you a tornado strike tomorrow we shouldn't even have a plan anyway ready dot Gov slash communicate and make your emergency plan today don't wait communicate raunchy by FEMA and the ad council\nImagine if I told you the earthquake was going to hit tomorrow right where you live [noise]\nOne time in magnitude aftershock current wife five minutes apart no doubt call when you make a plan\nToday it's true I Can't tell you an earthquake will happen tomorrow what does it does should you have a plan ... communicate and make your emergency plan today don't wait communicate raunchy by the mind he had chemical\n[noise] I made it to prime and get vaccinated I already got the flu vaccine their other diseases we can protect ourselves from either he's trying to get sick or take care of her husband he doesn't listen to his right I Do a lot to stay healthy so does\nThe skills that she knows me knows what can cost don't wait ... it's one more thing you can do to stay healthy to learn more talk to your health care professional ...

I mean it is Texas legit now do you think in in his own defense that bad\n[noise] I saw it on Texas yeah I'm just not\nTo see a little bit more in Oklahoma I ... I don't think the defenses that bad I think that they've had their struggles but I don't think they're as bad as they've looked but I gather not sold on Texas I have to say a little bit more\nI get I always get too excited Jeff you know that's my problem I get excited about team that you know I Want to kind of go on and on them and and right when I you know do that they're kinda you know the kind of come back to you know come come back down to earth and and and I look foolish or I'm going to hold off on given the longhorns or you know there there are\nMaybe to prop somebody to hold off on that and you know what the sooner is I think they can write to shift I got a good team there too\nAnd I both excellent stuff last one before I let you go you have chip Kelly and Scott Frost chipping ... frost in Nebraska both Owens five yeah hard to do\nYeah you know I was at the Michigan or the brass game and and ... I mean\nYou know I was excited when frost got there but man I mean it just looked like a lifeless licensed team and I saw another kid to just laugh\nI'm you know Greg ... left um you know transferred out you know what's a fresh them so\nAh yeah I mean you know ... and the same boat I mean just entering I mean a lot of pressure on both those guys I Hope they write the ships you know 'cause I like those programs but ah\nYou know seen it up close I thought just for the energy of a corn ... against Michigan was just very very just I mean just it just wasn't there man it was one of those strange things and you know you see a team like that\nAnd you know they just kind of don't show up but that's kind of been the you know the call so hopefully you can kind of rally that team it finished all but at this point you know major major headache both ended brass and UCLA\nEr into anything else on your radar before I let you go in and they going to bring up\nOh no you know you're the man uh yeah I just the you know you know me I'm always thinking about the draft though yeah em you know I'm just thinking of you know the\nBad teams of football most of those teams have quarterbacks right now so you know as much as we love quarterbacks up and I know this is the defense of heavy class coming in with defense sand and defensive tackle\nYou know or even some of these off at the lime and you'd think of like the New York giants and you've got to maybe think Jonah Williams even though you might not be the top ranked overall prospect you know we might have an office at the tap all maybe going number one next year just to get you know if the giants had the worst record we know they need off the line out so you know I'm always thinking draft but you know it always I and these guys think of why they might go\nTo the that the early feel it's going to be defensive heavy this draft\nLaw is going to be way have a yeah I mean you got all of our eyes used in ...\nOhio State you got the whole climate the line I mean that's just a fabulous crew altogether so law you know you got to have and white issue greedy Williams a deeply beef from al issue so you know it's going to be a while but I think before you know we're we're ... you know everybody I'm I'm included you're always loved the the skill position guys go early and often but this\nDraft you know I think you're going to kinda have to hold your breath a little bit and wait until the second and third round this or you see all those guys going because are going to be a lot a lot of defense in the first round that sure\nWho who's the top quarter back early on just out of curiosity\nWhere do you know I I think it's everybody's gas I mean you know some people like Justin her some people who likes to them and all burn you know ah you know you got the drew lock guys from Missouri I'm I like real ... from West Virginia I'm a you know he was one of the guys on my list that I Would say you know it's my top five at this point\nBut you know none of those guys I think I've really separated themselves you know as the the guy and none of those I think guys have kind of taken that level\nOf uh that next step to say hey you know where the top prospect in the draft and we're going to leap frog you know the the at all of ours and then they both ... and such because you know those guys are just kinda you know\nYou know going to be battling for those top five overall spots and you know next April when this thing go so uh\nYou know I you know you might you know I get a guy thing goes back to the teams that are bad you know I you know you know the jets got a quarterback you know Arizona have their quarterback San Francisco has her quarterback New York giants they need all kinds of line help you might want to say that they need a quarterback but\nThen they'd be reached a quarterback if they're that high and granted we have so much time left you know I mean the giants win the next you know nine game flat broke happen but you know under those circumstances you just kind of say hey you know it's going to be a defense of heavy drafted most of the bad teams right now have quarterback so that or even pushing down the

body is or when you're not explosive as explosive so I think we're more likely to see him be a up and down but the highs are a lot higher than I imagined that they would be\nA coming off of a hundred and twenty yards he touched our performance um that that in some ways looked like vantage eighty\nJerry brewer covers the red seems for the Washington Post with us here on NBC Sports radio\nHere you would know better than I Do but gee grew in strikes me as a guy that I mean if he likes you it's great [laughter] but if he doesn't it it's not great [laughter] uh with that said I I'm assuming that he was on board with acquiring Alex Smith up how how's that relationship going in and how is Alex Smith looked really on\nThe relationship has been really good I like the thing you get with Alex Smith as you get\nA true veteran you know someone who invested in a team that is a great leader\nAh and it's a great communicator are within the locker room and with the coaches and let the entire front office so there's a lot more synergy on this team with Alex Smith in command than it was with her cousin saying that that was the situation\nAs good as Kirk is great of a guy as he is\nA there was always just this\nDoes he want to be here long term and do they want him long term and\nThere was there was there was always that tension um that came up in difficult times now a when you've got Alex and and you play a terrible game against Indianapolis sat back the next week everybody's incredibly honest with each other every one is invested in each other\nUm you know he's sitting on a a four year extension that kicks in after next year is going to be after this season is kind of the quarterback\nAnd uh I think there's a little bit more calm there than what we've seen in the past five years really\nAnd that's a big deal for sure a jury brewer with us here on NBC Sports radio dream last well before I let you go are torn I could be a potentially historic night for Drew Brees she needs two hundred and one yards to pass Peyton Manning uh but you mentioned the Redskins deepens playing still are really really good out of the gate I'm looking forward to that tornado that could match up\n[laughter] I I Am as well uh I can almost guarantee unless something crazy happens in the game\n[laughter] I don't get his two hundred and one of your heart no doubt a because it for for the Redskins is is that going to be and the second quarter [laughter] are not going to be something more of the fourth quarter\nA if he gets to two hundred and ... and the fourth quarter they have a chance\nIf he's just slice and dice and I'm early well then you know it's a kind of been a train wreck at least for Washington on Monday Night football but um you know you could argue that Drew Brees\nA for a guy who's a sure fire hall of famer uh I think he's one of the more underrated great quarterbacks of all time or maybe it's just a size or\nOr or or maybe it's just that it that he came up in an era with with\nPeyton than a Tom Brady I'm Aaron Rodgers or even you know a little bit of the end of Brett Farr um but I think you know if you had to have one guy\nI win the game um and you really study and look at it you know one guy when you a game um\nAnd in a variety of systems ah I I think you put him fairly high on that list lot higher than than what you think you would do going in and that's just a testament to uh how good of a quarterback he is and and and um as long devotee has been tremendous\nYou know do very well so the jury great point great segment appreciate the time I managed to it again tomorrow night we'll talk to during the season thank you\n[noise] All right thank you\nEnjoy Jerry brewer covers the rent since for the Washington Post and we were talking about Drew Brees the other day and I think it's a little bit of both\nI think there's a little bit of the era if you will for for Drew Brees and I think also\nThat the fact that just his side I think that that size narrative has kind of stuck with him bright it because\nIt it's it's so easy to gush over\nA big quarterback Tom Brady Peyton Manning and I think maybe Drew Brees because of the size\nLike I said I think that narrative is kind of kind of followed him even though he used the results have been there on the field from day one uh and then it just that and the fact that he was traded early in his career didn't have the hype coming in uh like\nLike well I I Know Tom Brady didn't have a lot of hype coming out of Michigan but the Peyton certainly did so a little bit of both but without a doubt I mean he is without a doubt a first ballot hall of famer and he is I think the jury so that maybe\nUnder rated when we talked about\nJust where he lined up not only a in today's NFL but in in his career as well so\n... up there a Redskins saints tomorrow night on Monday Night football All right we've got one more secular love to go to the great keep the ladies coming over the top of the

thank goodness amazing Crosby miss green field goals\nAnd it was twenty four nothing heading into the locker room the halfway point we're halfway through the third quarter\nYeah and honestly Aaron Rodgers if I told you a especially he's like playing like the wounded warrior weeks before we saw all world all world\nEt cetera sixteen at twenty eight two hundred and twenty nine yards at a touchdown but oh my goodness it has been all about math Patricia and the lines that is a shocker at a shocker for me because I'm playing fantasy football\nAnd of course is with the NBC crew right I got three fantasy teams pat my home who is the world leader who's in rent a movie and the Kansas City chiefs are\nShellacking Jacksonville it's been unbelievable the game I I couldn't have hurt my eyes I was supposed to go to the gym I'm like I'm not going to the gym\nYeah you know because I already prepping them we're not going to the gym because I could not keep my eyes off ... homes was doing and honestly what a defense was doing to this crazy to see um the fumble at one point Blake portals and Chris Jones big name Chris Jones\nAt that defense of spreading have on them chest and billing and to the end zone when they were a kits away from it and that was just put another dagger in Jacksonville part but like I say\nI Know if you play fantasy football you understand what I'm saying I feel like I'm In an episode of the league like who let the chicken so when I first flipped to look at my staff and who they're going to be ugly and I was avoiding it because I was focusing on at the homes and ends with really which of course I have no Casey players whatsoever\nIt was like forty eight to eight or something like that forty eight to eight I'm playing somebody named the curly

wondering why my cousin and said we need to go to Dublin and give make things right or something I'm like what is he talking about 'cause I was so focused on what was going on with college football then I finally you know ding ding ding\nGot it let's go first to the scoreboard in the NFL throughout this show will weaving fantasy stats you'll hear a harp sound effects\nAnd you know because we well I thought it sounded like actually we hired a heartbeat I don't know if\nJak silver knows that or not but um we're paying for her purpose so in Culver City I've got my own heart but\nI've written the checkout so don't worry about it don't worry about okay good that's good because I think we were behind so now [noise] perfect right here I mean I think we got from your state among the cause for much like a deal you know nice a nice unfortunate that means the theme song but hey we got her right and that\nMeans fantasy stats which I heard none of the heart music in the beginning of 'em that first half the lions and the Packers and you got to give credit credit alliance for what they've been able to do the Packers and Mason Crosby\nMan the shorter fitted wander missing three foot feel go because they weren't even getting points that way which is so crazy I got to get off of that and go into the scoreboard outside even all of this by the way and also we um we we also have the mash units so there's been some injuries there always is and I'll get you up to date\nOn all of the injuries as you know we move along through the show but let's I'm going to rock through this so you're up to date\nI Am the human scoreboard the bills and the titans deals on top of the titans ten six this has been a little bit of a couple of field goals for the titans kind of surprising although think of the injury of markets marry oh to his plans and\nInjured warrior and it got picked off and it showed so this is with time taking away and the third quarter still plenty of time in that ballgame\nFor at least in the second half of it anyway a dolphins on top of the bangles is one kind of surprised me except for the Cincinnati is a little banged up right and Ryan tannahill and the dolphins officially been really good this year you gotta give Danielle from credit seven teams three\nAnd this is a two and change in the third quarter left in this game Frank or your fantasy players got Frank or eleven carries sixty one yours for Frank Gore\nBrown's I said this was so the game to watch right 'cause I Want to see what happened was Baker Mayfield bouncing back and the ravens thinking okay this is in Cleveland they got ripped off for some bad calls last week\nAnd the NFL admitted it so the browns on top of the ravens nine three Baker Mayfield as he watched it sooner is lose and the Texas Longhorn sue or in that Red River shoot out\nThe day before he takes the field and he threw him for almost two hundred yards and it touched down so far nine three though is a score so denied a few times\nBut the um cheese and the jags oh my gosh pat my home ... ... homes for anything just vote for him it's incredible because all the years that I attacked Andy Reid\nFor poor clock management when he was the uh the coach of the Philadelphia Eagles I'm seeing what's happening with the homes than it reminds me of the beginning of Donovan McNabb is the relationship dynamic mc nabb and Andy Reid when he first came to Philly and how that all worked out and homes I mean he's playing so\nHe's playing fearless and like he's having fun and that makes a big difference I had a conversation the other day with prime balding or and he covers the big twelve cover ... and the patch and college career has talked to people about ... homes and the ... because he's covering actually he's covering the game the seats and the jags\nAnd you know what he said was was that the ... homes is playing ... fearless Lee He's got all kinds of weapons they're using everybody they can\nAnd he knows how to read he just assesses what's in front of him and I've said this before\nThe quarter back to me is the hardest\nAnd we could have a you know the off season show and argue about this and get some great people on to talk about it but I think the toughest position to play in sports from my perspective covering it for two decades plus is really honestly the quarterback and he's got it he's got that something something\nAnd it's the way he can read it the way he moved out and of course he does have the weapons so the chief\nLeading Jacksonville uh twenty three to twenty now because they did have to settle for a field goal is thirty eight yard or it was good boom that's it\nAnd um otherwise you look at the usual suspects Travis County a hundred yards out for five catches and there's more to talk about their it's been misused and phone bills and interceptions are plaguing plugging Blake ... and the cheap taking advantage of it and they got a new damn spot away right before they have\nIt's

it came to lenient be the sports radio and I know some of you watching the feeder system that's what I call a college football is why all day in college football just a couple of quick note on that\nAnd one of them was how about this finished for the Texas Longhorn them wide significant and the red river shoot out against going into the game they were Nineteen Oklahoma seven listen to the finish\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] yeah because the kicker and with that smooth move the time was looked like you know hey tons of taken away from the thing to places going crazy at the cotton bowl Texas winds that have you heard me say they were Nineteen heading into this now today in the a P pull they pop up at number nine Oklahoma\nDrop down the other big one of the ... is\nHey fighting Irish and Booker this kid is incredible heading into the game against Virginia Tech he is Notre Dame at Ninety five pointed to games though what did Notre Dame do because there were a lot of people like oh you know this is what Virginia Tech does so well including me I'm sure I mentioned that at some point\nUm I've not Notre Dame is what Virginia Tech does so well they beat the ranked team yeah\nYeah ... to that uh because in in in in was just incredible and Notre Dame beats Virginia Tech\nForty five twenty three so they enter into this at number six they go up to five member college football selection committee that's why mentioning this\nIs a making their first pull of the editor a on Tuesday so this was very very let me say it again\nBig certainly this when and

F. A. he's great he's all over the Dallas Cowboys the Dallas Cowboys are taken on a the Houston Texans on Sunday night might thanks problem with that\nThan you guys for having me I Apologize I'm a couple of minutes later on\nOh no problem so we we look at this match up in the first thing that popped up in my mind that the cowboys have to worry about I'm going to take it from that perspective is they've got to contain Jay Jay ... don't you think that's a big aspect of the game\nIt is and I think it's a big ask for a while ... the cowboys right tackle that's going to be\nPotentially they're weak spot on this offerings of wind this week but not the while calling her players had good moments with his team but he is\nTo adapt to a new methodology that the cowboys new office of life coaching is implementing this team and he hasn't fully figured it out yet\nHe was I think comfortable in their choir system but they have a new office of wind coach this year and he just hasn't quite meshed yet with this system with this ideology um\nAnd he just is struggling a little bit the first four weeks of the year so\nCombine that with as you mentioned a very difficult ... with their Sarah Hughes detect the Houston Texans for for ah that that could be a spot where you see the pressures of the press got different pressures that I\nAbsolutely how jak Prescott feeling after last week's when that was a I call it that we won that one and the fans went crazy so it was good I think it was a momentum shift for them what do you think you've been covering them\nI Do think that was the momentum shift for him I think especially sport jak wasn't important game because she had been struggling\nFor such an extended period of time there were so many people that were referencing his inability to throw for two hundred plus yards nine out of the last eleven game she had done it yet this season so for him to just the feedback fresh rolled in another cell was a I think psychological boost for ... or something a little bit or\nAt least if he is not some were outright set up with them or a I think at the at least for the moment he's put that at they performed well he did\nFrankly what cowboys fan should expect that Prescott he's not going to be\nAn Aaron Rodgers Tom Brady even a mat staffer type that he's not going to be put off and on your shoulders on the lack of four hundred fast and you're always before touchdown that's not his style of play he's going to be a reduction type in in some ways shapes and forms they can do type\nUm but even to that extent not as much in terms of driving the football down the field is going to think and donkeys going to hit is tight and he's got ... chains\nWhen he's playing well when he doesn't play well that's that's where the frustration sets in full cowboys fans but at least for the moment he put cowboys fans who say with performance last week\nAnd we started off talking about how tough it's going to be for the cowboys because of a defensive weapon that they have but his IQ you'll Eliot look great last week that he feels like we're back to her old now and it showed because we wore the defense down and hit some big run\nI Would imagine you're still going to try to see the cat was you're still going to look for a week to run and move the ball a lot right\nFor short ... Kelly is lying one of the cowboys authentic frankly is like one two three four because that was ... he is\nHe is and he needs to be ... for this team they try to do that has been a lot of people have heard from over the course of the first four weeks she certainly fans y and Z getting more carries you only at Seventeen carries really at Nineteen carries and then after this most recent game hey that's more like the twenty ninth touches\nIt's not for lack of trying to avoid having them converting on third downs and they're often hasn't been able to stay on the field he looked percentage wise the number of touches IQ Eli got in this most recent game as compared to the first three games\nThings pretty similar the differences the cowboys office was able to convert first down and stay on the football field so they ran more places and often therefore he had or opportunities to get touches so we had twenty nine instead of Twenty one or whatever the case may be um\nSo the game plan has been very similar they were just more effective with it in this most recent ...\nWere you as Mike allegedly WMA ABC in Dallas and Mike uh we didn't talk about the cowboys defense boy the cowboys third ... fourteen and and gosh defensive ends and mark is largely been incredible\nHe's got over five stack the Shaun White and it's been vulnerable he's been hit a bunch of time\nThat obviously is pretty easy map right\nYou would think so yeah and tell you what the market is Lawrence is faking his show a\nLot of money right now the cowboys are going to a potentially regret not signing him\nThis past offseason your price for him at already gone through the roof with some of the other defensive and deals that we'd seen around the league will not get cetera um\nBy Ben factory and also the fact that the markets Lawrence is playing very well yeah the price for him has gone through the lungs and that they're either the cowboys or potentially somebody else at the cowboys don't want a foot that bill somebody's going to be spending an awful lot of money the markets Lawrence is often\nA yeah yes I Do expect people to to get home to to John Locke because I was seeing if you're just the first season lots of his band on his back quite a bit and I don't expect that to be much different and I\nI enjoy the game and thanks for stopping by my present it\nYes thanks for having me on\nComing up next we're going to go to the scoreboard get tips date on what's happening right now on the gridiron across the country in the NFL ...

[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nStory\nOf games that are winding down and some that are set to kick off it is a huge Sunday and there are some crazy things happening\nTo dive into all of that for you and ... injuries\nAnd heartbreaking loss is about to get that the stone for a couple of these teams not for the Kansas City chiefs worth mentioning here they have blown out Jacksonville the entire time that I think Jacksonville yeah jags were the number one defense so much for that\nThirty four team let them five to go in this game\nBlake board all fumble interceptions and it's been a rough game for for him but not so much on the other side of the ball if you look at my home pet my home a twenty to thirty eight three hundred Thirteen yard and did have a couple of interceptions we hadn't seen that from him\nBut again also spread that love around and a cream hunt with a touchdown the homes of course has one too and they got that all over the place and they even had a defensive touchdown yeah\nHow about that and unfortunately the the defensive\nTouchdown which counted and was great the the defensive um lineman who got that touchdown author was thrown out of the game a little bit later and what was the story on that that was about ... excuse me\nUm what happened in that unfortunately for him is you know you cannot push you cannot have a bad it\nWell you know it's like they've they're calling anything with the helmet to helmet especially then and then there's the question of ejection a suspension but in this case Chris Jones booted from the game but he does make the incredible play off the fumble\nFinds the end zone and that was one of the big moments in the first half as the chief just blew out\nI mean blew out Jacksonville defense that's really been the story heading into this I wouldn't have thought that a thought that would have thought the defense would have been so challenging we'll be talking about something different at this point the Pittsburgh Steelers the Pittsburgh Steelers recover a fumble in the end zone as well\nOr in their game day now lead the falcons forty one to seven teams just forty some seconds left on the clock though that's inevitable I pick up they're stuck in when how 'bout that\nThe giants the Panthers winding down this team has been interesting little it's a little rat and Panthers on top twenty seven twenty four that left\nPlay in the game less than two minutes Steelers I mentioned the jets thirty four six team beating the Broncos the Broncos trying to make something happen not enough time on the clock\nThey had the ball and they're trying to move that but um this one's got two minutes in its case keen him a couple of touched down but when he really needed um it wasn't happening and it was about the jets putting up a lot of points against the Broncos defense Twenty one points and\nThe second quarter wow lions and the Packers\nBoy the lions were blowing out the Packers twenty four and at the halfway point\nDid you hear me say twenty four nothing Aaron Rodgers not looking so good fumble miss cues you name it and alliance took advantage of it but the Packers come back you know it's tough to keep Aaron Rodgers outta things Packers had the ball now second in ten of Detroit\nThirty three yard line but uh there's four minutes in the game so in the end Aaron Rodgers three hundred and sixty eight yard than three touchdowns\nDon't know that they can convert that to W. though with where we are at this point browsing the ravens this has been an interesting game are we going to see over time it's tied at nine tied at nine the although the browns with sixteen seconds on the clock third and tennis balls\n\nThat came to win and this was in front of their own crowd\nThe uh earlier games like I said almost wrapped in a couple of them did build beat the titans Thirteen to twelve part of that was\nA little a mix of ... on the ground eighty five yards twenty four carry off twenty four carries and the bills were going back and forth with the titans in this low scoring game throughout the entire day also the bangles came back because the dolphins had the\nIf they were leading at the halfway point of the game and the bangles comeback twenty seven seven team they wrap up that wind so therefore and one Andy Dalton tuna forty eight yards passing and a touchdown\nAnd a touchdown Seattle they're dealing with some rain or getting the umbrella of the\n\nBuilding was like but it's just light rain right Seahawk fans or if they're hosting though the red hot rams at century link field and the rams are favored by to\n\nSee a phenomenal on the ground and brand and cooks too so with that\n\nWith um are gonna have to be\nOf some of that light rain see if it gets a little bit heavier and I'm like I said in Seattle the fans certainly\n\nThe Texans deserve it energy stadium in Houston the cowboys coming off of a wind hoping to capitalize on that momentum\n\nAnd start having problems are offensive leads us Sean walked in and spend way too much time on his back that's been part of the problem for the Texans\nThe the ... it has been porous for a Houston but that Sunday night game just set up to be a pretty uh pretty tight one Houston is favored by three and a half points three and a half points in the\n\nCompletely ignore because we're in the play offs there's a couple of teams that can wrap things up the brewers have a two zip edge on the Rockies member LDS it's um [noise] this is\nA five game and the division series is a five game deal so that the five and they have the ads they could do it in Colorado the Dodgers and the Braves Dodger same thing they have to go beat on his land out there in Atlanta\nFor their National League a division series too so they could come out of their winning and waiting for what's going to happen with their next one how about the red Sox the red Sox\nAnd the Yankees this is everything it promises to be the series is tied at one Nathan of all to get to start in game three for Boston\nAnd they are American League division series is that moved to New York on Monday This may go the distance on like the ones that I just mentioned were bought out of here we come back on the flip side ready to go into injuries also some fantasy step that a whole lot more ... NBC Sports radio NBC Sports radio dot com [noise]\nIn cases not that's a good way to get a more serious asked them to five I was going to just Jacobs the technical my throat for this show Josh we've all been pathetic on the Sunday night that\nI Know I mean we've got none of them ... when it came as a victory three in a row will be for all I certainly hope not but I'm going to go the same thing jump is saying I just don't think that down there twenty ...\nBut there are six to ... used to the seventh in office for twenty of in defense [noise] however I think you still with a more average points [noise] does have the advantage of is going to be used in twenty I'm Twenty one dollars Seventeen\nSo you like the Texans to I'm going to go against you guys I liked what both of you said and I think you're right their defense J. J. water you kidding me [noise]\nBut I'm gonna say Dallas they need to find their momentum on the road especially after that last game they won\nBut um they really have played poorly in the first couple of games and it is about their defense what about their off them so I think they're going to rise to the occasion and I think the score is going to be twenty seven twenty four the Dallas Cowboys\n[laughter] that's what we have to what was going to be right right right right and I'm the kiss of death [laughter] you know it's like I don't know what happened to my magical touch do I years ago I went to ESPN\nA whole thing and ESPN fantasy football deal now I'm On the air for NBC I envy NBC Sports radio fantasy football deal and I'm getting she'll act I'm like in last place [noise]\nBrutal stuff you don't go by my pick this year ... says I'm fifty fifty crazy Ari I Love it thanks we'll see if anybody's right this time around\nIt is so fun I Love football I Do I Love football [noise] it's this the best thing ever it's the best thing to do in this kid because behind the Mike and watching what's happening in college football and then of course you pick it up on Sunday and then we're into the pro stuff\nAnd it's crazy I mean what we've seen in these games I just described ... back them\nA touchdown pass to say Kwan Barclay and Jeff mentioned the fact that the giants took the lead there's thirty seconds on the clock is ticking away thirty one thirty they're leading the Panthers the Panthers were were cruising in the\nSomewhat against the giants and the giants came back that would be a big win for the giants at one and three they would pick up that that can win for them so huge and you also heard in our discussion Jeff mentioned at the brown kicker Mrs so Brown's and ravens tied at nine\nAnd the overtime he got a feel for a Baker Mayfield I mean he's trying to do everything you can but everyone around them straight everything\nThey can lose it or or make another tie possibility for eight I mean you are you kidding me oh the the the ravens have had their own was\nIn the game it's been it's been crazy wild to watch it so in in looking at the ... you know Joe Flaco uh some incomplete passes when it seemed like it was nothing but a jump off\nAnd then also connecting on some screened passes and making it work\nIt's been a very strange game very low scoring obviously so that can tell you that tells you pretty much what's happened here it's been more about missing and not converting than anything else and you know now you look at the ravens their fourth and twelve\nAt their own forty five so here we go another chance perhaps for the brown to end this and pick up the wind and that would be big and that would be big\nA big momentum shift for them to in front of their um fans so they would love to be able to walk away with it that's for sure I Want to get to some injuries because I Know as you are doing that thing of tracking injuries I'm going to get you up to date on 'em that\nAnd then also obviously for your fantasy players that matters when he started to look at the beginning of the week what's going to happen who's gonna MRIs and how severe as it keep an eye on Corey Grant the jags running back\nBecause he had to be carted off the field with a foot injury so he was ruled out in that ah at one point in that game when he wants he was pulled out against the chief author Josh well the left tackle had a groin injury and the second quarter and he was ruled out too as as well they had a bunch of injuries there\nAre jets corner buster screen had a head injury he didn't come back into the game Broncos corner Adam Jones had a leg injury sat out the second half against the jets making a difference a there and then Cleveland Browns white out resorted Higgins\nHad an injury and the second half against the ravens as we're watching what's happening there's in that game so keep an eye on him too as well we have these other games that clicked in later this afternoon a handful of them\nIncluding the Philadelphia Eagles there were some questions about Cory climate he is in the game he was ruled active slightly before the game\nAnd a Philadelphia Eagles getting ready to kick off momentarily at the link and home against the Vikings who have had nothing but problems at one two and one eagles and now what has become a much more tight\nDivision of the NFC eased but no one no one\nThey would love to pick up that third win and the eagles are favored by three and a half cardinals are ripped up all over the place I wouldn't for it's been a rough\nRough rough started the season for them and this game in Santa Clara a California Levi stadium the forty niners with their own woes and have a nothing but a ton of\nTea inactive of players that are on the injury report this week and key key players for a San Francisco\nAnd then remember for Jimmy ... took our breath away the doctors found a torn ACL and that that they didn't find any other damage when they operated on ... knee last week and the forty niners quarterback they're saying we'll be back in six to eight months wow that was a huge blow to the um\n[noise] to the hopes of the forty niners because it's so exciting to watch\nWhat was happening with him and then a new coach Kyle Shanahan who's had to deal with that injury and has had to deal with now um what he's got going on up than simply it's a whole different forty nine or\n... you know forecasts but I think as you look at the rest of the season for them and that's why people are wondering I was you know what was the deal on the surgery and the good news is like I said the surgery went well how 'bout that the surgery went well so that that ran the end of the hawk just kicking just underway\nRamp have the balls so\nJets literally that happens as I'm speaking and then I mentioned that uh you got these afternoon game that are set to start and they are\nThey just kicked off to the Vikings have the ball the eagles kicked charges already on the board in their earlier game because they started to twenty minutes ahead of those game three because if they lead the raiders raiders have the balls their own Eighteen first and hands\nKeep an eye on all those games and the others that become a final round to have the ball any of the with three and changed the left side with the

stop paying to the Panthers radio network for that Graham good over hero you hurt is fifty three or you go by the way Tom damned see\nThat the Nineteen Seventy one he kicked the sixty three yard field goal time was taken off the clock to think beat the lions Nineteen Seventeen back in November of Nineteen Seventy at Tulane University in New Orleans that shows you how long ago was that\nAnd here's the trivia not good for you Tom Dempsey\nWho was a really a really well liked guy and played for a lot of different teams\nWas the guy who kicked with ... forty at a special shoe on\nA video war and boy he rooted that one and the world went crazy for that I mean crazy but it is not the record though Matt Prater cop Dempsey is marked with the sixty four yard or in case you forget that one there's some others that came\nPretty close to it but uh but that was in two thousand Thirteen I Want to say\nHow about it the excitement there you could just feel that hanging in the air the rather crazy things that happen as well and other kicker and that for the browns beating the ravens in overtime twelve nine so it was certainly something about the kicker is in the air\nAnd for the cheese and the jags it's interesting there is that ... you know all the rage everybody's talking about the young quarterback\nAnd what he's been able to do for Kansas City and he did it all day long a different story for Blake ... a lot of misused here's one of them that lead to disaster\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] I liked that excitement there thanks for the Kansas City chiefs network for that so Chris Jones is the hero the animal then for the touchdown but he also got a jak did that happen on the extra point try after the jagged only score a kind of took a cheap shot\nAt a guard Andrew newer well they caught it and that was it he was booted board a lot of objections this time around in the NFL of the season by game's end to it we have games that are going on right now the handful of afternoon games we've got the Sunday night game\nThe battle for Texas I'm going to call it Houston and Dallas we'll preview that also major league baseball we're into the play off the brewers\nCould wrap it up and they could do that in their best to five 'cause of course when you're in the division theories will they do it though is the question and the Dodgers same thing though in rocky land or they're praying and they're doing the same thing in Atlanta\nHowever right now what we have is that the brewers on top of the Rockies one nothing in the bottom of the ... the Dodgers game isn't until the night first pitch eight oh seven\nAnd a Walker viewer will pitch for the Dodgers Sean nukem gets distorted or or ... and a brave [laughter] so this is big\nThe Braves held it together all season long jumped in front of the silly I mean Phillies and the the L E to to get to the spot\nAnd now the Dodgers are showing them how it's done Dodgers number game seven last year they lose to the actors would they love to get back to the world series but there are there's plenty\nTo be played in the playoffs right let's dive into those afternoon games happening right now the chargers and the raiders a couple of field goals they're tied at three and fix minutes there'll be at the halfway point of this game Derek car eight of eleven eighty yard so far at this point\nI Know a lot of people have Keenan Allen on their fantasy team I think our harp us went to uh take restaurant break but when you hear the sound of the ...\nYou know that we're talking about from fantasy stats three catches thirty five yard still a lot of football left to be played in the Vikings and the eagles same thing you got Mr Eli it but the thirty yard field goal that was just good for Philadelphia So now Philly and the Vikings tied at three\nTwelve minutes and change until they hit the half first quarter winding down cardinals on top of the forty niners in a tight game seven six the score they're rams in the sea hawk\nThey're tied at seven Jared golf with an interception in this one but also a hundred yards passing\nA Cooper cup that's like my favorite name for the Los Angeles ramp three catches fit these six yards and that's where we're at all these games tight early and you know looking at some of the superstar name in\nPlaying for all three of these teams in that line that you look at week after week you know will they live up to those lines I Know for Josh Rosen he wants to own a team that is his team he talked about playing for the cardinals he didn't like going further down in the draft\nAnd the cardinals have a lot of work to do and they have injuries are dealing with the cardinals though and for on the road trying to do something with the forty niners\nTo have a much different situation for the forty niners Jimmy ... had surgery this week they shoot back in six to eight\nWeeks so San Francisco has CJ bet third out\nAt the quarterback so much different situation for them so far for best third six to eight Seventy four yards and interception added touched down\nFor a CJ that third but keep an eye on what's happening with the forty niners also one of the things we'll talk about is that fight oh yeah macgregor what happened there\nAnd what about paycheck than holding paychecks for TBI but what went on in that are\nOut of the cage in the cage match up\nYou know it's funny because for a while I was really really into um\nWhat was happening in the octagon paid a really close attention to it in fact we had on the show\nA Dana White I feel like it but because we're in football season everything else I you only have so much time right I was paying attention to what was going on there but I didn't realize what was happening at the end of it when I was getting these frantic test text from a lot of people\nAnd um what was happening with the fights and the glove really came off so to speak\nSorry so that's what happened he leaps over a and and then it goes crazy the whole place goes crazy people are separated I mean it was definitely ugly and it's a T Mobile arena\nOf course in Los Angeles and you see the footage and I look back at the footage those two guys jumping over the fence and into the octagon they can front McGregor the second comes from behind launches a bunch of punches up macgregor had this is you know look this is just not good I don't know wrong and writes who ... who is right and who's wrong\nOr I think you just move on from that it should have happened that that nonsense of what happened in Brooklyn should have just been over and as soon as it's been about what was going on in the octagon here's what Dana White said afterwards about you know who's getting paid who's not getting paid and what happens\nAfter that so that's always told me I just didn't want you to leaving here tonight where we're withholding both trucks when it wasn't true so ... went and interviewed on her hair and are just looked at some tapes from yourself and they made the decision to just call them or graduate his shirt there still was holding her be\nAll right so how beads check 'em\n... is you know withheld it's up to them to decide whether they're going to give it to him or not um and of course McGregor he heard him a Dana White and it was just on Dana Whitey blame Dana White for the chaos and the\nAnd the circus atmosphere and you know McGregor before the match that he was looking forward to\nUm what was going to happen and then hours after uh the controversy that ensued he said hey good not looking forward to the ... he was saying all Sunday Morning and right after it too\nBecause he fell in four rounds to be in you know who isn't that a lightweight champion but Vegas was there's more to this with this chaos and whether\nThey get sanctioned again or not which I get that money makes the world go round and they will I don't know I I think it could be hard to push them together\nThe sanctions there's going to be some kind of significant sanctions as a result of of that what is the Nevada athletic commission going to say they're gonna have to figure it out and sort it all out or would you want to see a rematch with these two after that and of course that's what it is the controversy fuels all so we probably do the heavy than\nA McGregor knocking it out again [laughter]\nNotorious right [laughter] let's get back to the NFL and talk about what's happening now I'm with these early gay late afternoon games rather I should say the chargers taken a commanding lead Seventeen three over the raiders\nThere just about a minute and a block away from the halfway point of this game Philip Rivers\nNine of Thirteen a hundred and forty six years and it touched down in the in the game and you're man your fantasy dude is Melvin Gordon\nTwelve carries where's my heart because forty two yards and it touched down I Swear the check to knock down\nAnd then that's rushing on the ground receiving why the couple of catching for fifty three yards so uh Gordon is always the favorite and he pulls up big time and get the TV too as well\nThat's where we're at night game Vikings and the eagles the eagles have the ball and Minnesota thirty one yard line with a fresh set of downs\nAnd we'll see what they do just converting a short one they're so eagles trailing the Vikings ten\nThree ten three at this point Stefan dig the shorthand man you see it in the spots where his hand stuck to the mailbox what's going on there to carry twenty five yards for dig so far\nCardinals beating the forty niners they put some mustard on fourteenth six\nTen left until they're at the halfway point remember for the forty niners CJ Beth or does then Jimmy ... out with that ACL had the surgery on it he's gone for six to eight months they see he'll be back next season certainly not this season we know that\nAaron Rodgers had we'll wait one more score sea hawks and the rams\nHow can I forget the hawks are my defense in one of my fantasy teams fourteen ten leading the rams that's with a lot of football left nine minutes until they go into the locker for the halfway point of that came Aaron Rodgers after the game Green Bay with getting shoved lacked I mean so lacked\nAaron Rodgers to fumble stripped fact he said he had to play better in the first half second half they found a group they can't keep pulling it out or narrowly pulling it out because we've seen that happened with the Packers we saw that in that game against Chicago kicking things off\nThis time it didn't work for the lion's beat them that's a big win for math Patricia the coach of the lions thirty one twenty three coming off of that\nA stinging loss to the Dallas Cowboys on the road this time the home crowd gets to sharing it Aaron Rodgers still with four hundred and forty two passing yards\nAnd three touched down in the law in the last carry on Johnson's been interesting to watch on the ground for Detroit twelve carry seven in the yards Matt Stafford has to love that because there's frustrations are all over the place with lion fans\nBut now at least two and three\nAds for the cheap wow how 'bout Blake portrayals talking to pick six\nTo she's defensive end Chris Jones and the chief beat and that was one of many of the mistakes other cheese pizza jags thirty fourteen they are perfect for five and a lookout everybody else\nThe jets beat the Broncos thirty four to six team Sam Darnell really going deeper and a couple of some situations to Robbie Anderson\nOne of them Seventy six yard touchdown pass to a ... percent of the two that he nab\nSo a big win for the jets as they're two and three and that was at home the Steelers in front of their home crowd big then looked a pretty good when he had to be forty one Seventeen over the falcons James Connor has been quite\nThe touchdown machine for the Steelers hundred and ten yards on the ground to T. v.'s for him\nThe fear of fantasy person that you picked him up your love and that that's for sure right ah Antonio Brown too I mean they're they always seem to be on the same page and they were once again six catches a hundred yards and two touchdowns for Antonio Brown I think the end of uh\nThe Panthers game might have been the most thrilling of the day the Panthers beat the giants uh sixty three yard field goal ... you know nails that and there was room just spare by the way there\nAnd the Panthers surprise or the giants who just look like someone had stolen from them and they did thirty thirty thirty one who how wow big game for the Panthers because there are three and wants Reno\nI like the finish of the brown game\nIn overtime winning field goal Baker Mayfield all miles the place goes crazy to sue in one the browns are after and overtime twelve nine victory over Baltimore\nSunday night like I said it's a battle protect the cowboys and the Texans and guess what we're talking about it next with Mike Leslie do is they're getting ready for the game\nHe

I was going to a potentially regret not signing him through a long term deal this past offseason praise for him\nHad already gone through the room with some of the other defensive and deals but we've seen around the league will not get cetera um\nBy Ben factory and also the fact that the markers Lawrence who's playing very well\nYeah the price for him has gone through the lungs and other types of the cowboys\nOr potentially somebody else with the cowboys don't want a foot that bill somebody's going to be spending an awful lot of money at the markers Lawrence is often Ah yes I Do expect him to to get home to determine what we've seen much just the first season was with his band on his back quite a bit and I don't expect that to be much different and I\nI enjoy the game and facts are stopping by my pre she ate it\nYes ...\nThings wind down Philadelphia fans don't have a lot to cheer for they're already in line for cheese steaks Minnesota and what is really a rivalry between these two teams now because the Vikings\nWere stopped or in their dead in their tracks the end of the game last year when they were so lax case Keenan was the quarter back\nAnd remember in the road to the Superbowl so the Vikings are keyed up even though the different quarterback her cousin Vikings we'd find a defensive touchdown that's part of the story with thirty one seconds till they're at the half ten three over Philadelphia\nThe rams are in front of the sea hawks Seventeen sports team they're almost at the two minute warning there are until they're in the locker for their halfway a deal of this game already at the half\nOakland trailing the Los Angeles chargers in charge Seventeen three the score there I'll tell you what a there was some crazy things that happen in week five\n... sixty three yard or drilling it for the win for Carolina over the giants was one of those big moment no doubt about that but there were other crazy highlights uh\nBecause the it was about a lot of this was about kicking do a Nathan crossing Mrs for for for the uh Green Bay Packers who were limping so he didn't give them any help whatsoever\nAnd that was part of the story there it was a rough first half for Aaron Rodgers who dug deep and came back but there wasn't enough\nOr in the tank to make anything happen to to ah make a difference and I'll tell you what do you look at buffalo and the titans and again this Thirteen twelve\nThe Buffalo Bills when this one and it's all about a forty six yard field goal when time is expiring they gave them the when an orchard park so they put down their wings and they cheered loudly buffalo defense also forcing three turnovers list John\nMcCoy within a slump he had eighty five yards when it was all said and done including a Thirteen year old catch on third in three converting over made a big difference there rookie quarterback Josh Allen scores and a fourteen yard TD run\nAnd finishes ... you know underwhelming passing why ten of Nineteen for eighty two yards and an interception but they got the job done\nSo that the bottom line there is getting it done and they did and that the than [laughter] really really really celebrated their\nAnd then when we

Joseph the defensive lineman for the Vikings picked off and ran I think like sixty three yards\nHe's six he's three hundred and twenty five pounds easy he's never run sixty three yards in his life he was so tired of returning the touchdown he skipped the next defensive series and sat on the sidelines with sunglasses up for it I don't know what reason\nAnd just walking down the oxygen or whatever was coming through the pipes so Kirk Cousins and Minnesota are are just dominate the eagles so far Carson once not having a bad game but it's not just not getting in the end zone the other games going on right now this one I think is what's this does not surprise me\nThe rams are for no they're playing the sea hawks who commit to into a spotty team Russell Wilson does not have a lot of help on off in the defense of not there\nThey finally got Earl Thomas back after the hold out he breaks his legs so he's out of course at half time the score is tied ram Seventeen Seahawks Seventeen this'll be a classic Seahawks win or Russell Wilson leads on a light drive and the game they shouldn't win\nAnd then they're back in the playoff picture if three into but you know in that conference you can win nine or ten games and you'd be right in the thick of things for a wildcard spot ramps Jerry ... sixteen twenty three two hundred and sixteen yards in one touchdown and half\nHe's cruising Cooper ... the rams receiver he was a position to receive brought to eastern Washington he's on pace for about a Ninety five one hundred catches this year he's got six catches Ninety ... Ninety yards and touched on at again at the half\nAnother game that's again a month ago you said cardinals versus the forty niners the cardinals look bad I predicted doesn't to be one of the worst three teams in the sport they're still going to be a top three draft pick but now they have Josh Rosen the rookie quarterback of the UCLA who's in\nEight Fifteen one fifty five and a long touchdown Christian Kirk who is from Texas a and M. an unbelievable young wide receiver a return man the cardinals or fourteen six on the niners niners obviously don't have Jimmy ... done for the season I saw a report ... likely to be back for training camp how depressing is that if you're a forty niners fan\nBut his backup sees you about that it was a good quarterback in Iowa watched him a lot he's Thirteen to twenty to one Twenty one touched down in an interception meant Brita who I'm guessing you none of you know unless you're a niners fan 'cause most of us do not he's running back he's got fifty six yards at halftime so that's what's going around in the NFL in ... gets here we get up to date\nOn all the lake games all early games well baseball\nBrewers Rockies game three rivers up to zero a bottom of the fifth keep an eye on that one that's not you have Dodgers at Braves game three\nDodgers in control there a Walker viewer for the ... for the LA Dodgers loved his picture anyone name Walker I kind of like a then you've got the baseball coming up and then the night football night America cowboys at Texans\nThis is a big one I think this is a really huge game obviously ball team that's such a cliche thing for someone on air to say but if you look at this game\nCowboys are two and two Texans are one in three I thought the Texans would return to form to Sean Watson back they looked I thought much better in the past few weeks\nTo Sean Watson is healthy ... Hopkins is healthy Jay Z ... playing much better I mean compared to the past two seasons when he really wasn't playing he is in a conversation with ... as defensive player of the year and probably comeback player of the year as well that'd be a very windy and thing to do to get comeback player of the year and defensive player the year in the same season\nGoing back to Thursday night real quick patriots thirty eight colds twenty four weird game because Tom Brady I think fourteen of his first Fifteen passes\nAnd one of those with a drop by Julian Edelman who is just back from suspension and plus the injury that took them out all last season in a weird second half the Colts scored Twenty one straight points [noise] ... patriots hold 'em all thirty twenty four\nBut it's it's weird at work and the damned Patrick show we get a lot of people in the room talking about Andrew lucky such a hot topic because you feel bad for the guy the guy had this perfect career going he's on a team that doesn't really protect him over the past years shoulder injury it almost seemed to generate of he missed last year slow starts a training camp\nThen he's throwing more passes and the first month of the season that's when I talk about what I'm saying\nThe NFL never plays out like you think it's going to an August go back and look what the experts said and I use experts I just air quoted experts if you can see that in your car\nIt never plays out like you think if you would have said who will be the last player in the league to have the most attempts passing attempt in the league Andrew Luck with\nStarting quarterbacks you'd think they try to protect them run the ball not throw the ball ton he threw them all fifty nine times last week now none of those not many of those throws were over twelve yards but that was fine they got three hundred sixty five yards three touchdowns ... he has very little help around them it's a work in progress there but it's interesting team to keep an eye on\nCollege football I think this has been a really interesting weekend on paper was not a I'd say a month ago as you said Texas Oklahoma Texas with Tyler Murray\nAnd it was going to play all up to I'm Sorry to Oklahoma Kyla Murray the Heisman Trophy candidate guys going to be playing quarterback and it only in college because he's got a huge baseball career ahead of them\nI think everyone has said Oklahoma is going to no problem in Texas this year it was unbelievable game probably the game of the year so far Texas wins forty eight forty five neutral site they played at the cotton ball at the Texas state fair\nSemi earlier you probably don't know his name he threw to stretch out three and a fourteen yards ... ran for Ninety two could have gone either way Texas was in control most of the game the Oklahoma squirt Twenty one points in the third and fourth quarter to Texas is three to six escaped with a late feel go when it\nThat's monstrous Tom Herman the coach was Houston put them on the map went to Texas slow burn for him now he's entrenched\nI've been to Texas a few times for football games and I've been to the text Oklahoma game only once\nBut it really does live up to the rivalry that's one of those that you want to be you know Texas really is in a situation where\nBack in college I figured they wouldn't let me more than I could easily pay back boy\nWas I wrong thankfully I got the help I needed to pay back my loan and poll\nSound familiar the good news is student loan repayment are available where the NFC the national foundation for credit counseling a nonprofit organization member offices nationwide that provide comprehensive financial\nSaid was do alone account of these these certified consumer credit counselors provide born on one financial and can help me with value eight options were making the student loan payments reducing interests\nConsolidation even loan rehabilitation\nSeven seven for him to\n[noise]\n\n\nMother way to get your voice is three to four years\nWe've been twenty four seven Seuss NBC Sports radio\nNBC Sports radio dot com\nBack on the leadership and NBC Sports radio play taps and you're ... you're on a Sunday night coming from NBC us and in Stamford, Connecticut now\nRemember for all you out there we are ... and we're trying to advance to the the culture of leisure we always said we want to do less in life when I mean less and less work more fun as wherever that takes you you know whether it's eating drinking socializing traveling\nNapping I'm a great ...

O. R. H. I. M. S. dot com slash folk today and\nWell there's ... if you've watched the bangles closely for five years I'm the only person that you know or most people know that has\nWhen I first on the field they are a they're like the greatest show in turf behind incredible now he's never on the field so there are good often when he's not on the field and good often says enough to win in the NFL today with the defence the defence has been secretly terrible they came in there the worst that they're down defense in the league by ten percent\nBut today it looked like exactly what you said all I thought that was over I sort of half watching that one and I'm like a band the bangles coming back to earth\nThe ... the ... I came out of the question do the dolphins do how to use Ryan tannahill or do they have any kind of game play on whether I did it will be that sure didn't seem that way and the second half\nYeah I mean they're still leaning on Frank Gore which is you know it's kinda sad and depressing and [laughter] and there's not a lot of household names on his team that got Danny I'm an ... probably the only name you know if you're a national yeah I I just think that's more about the bangles because some people were jumping on Miami and I'm like All right I could see them getting a wins but that's not a threatening team\nI think the AFC North by the way and they've done this a lot in the last few years and they can do three playoff team so I think the Steelers to re earn and the bangles I mean it might be logistically heart I'd have to look at the standings but all three of those teams you might playoff seems to me\nI found myself actually cheering for the browns at the end of the game a huge accident told them to go for a fourth one is kind of a mid range of overtime they went for it they didn't get it or there was a play where the the receivers interfered with but they said the ... the pass wasn't comfortable\nBut wasn't casual because he got hit by five yards and it was route don't field and couldn't get down there to catch it\nAnd then ended up make good call at Cleveland and did interference like three plays later and they kept their flags in the pocket but either way Cleveland Browns twelve nine over the ravens\nNothing special nothing really to write home about this game but the ravens which a lot of people were saucy on early in the season\nTo jump off now there are three and two\nYeah I mean the browns defense is pretty good and this is you look at every game this week I think the home team on every single game right I'm looking now so that's a that's a game they went in Cleveland they would never win and Baltimore Baltimore it's\nNot super threatening on the road so not shocking you know when I was coming into the this week I didn't really hear anyone think that the ravens are going to blow out the browns everyone thought it would be close and ugly\nYeah the problem with all the games close\nYeah exactly I feel I feel like you're a browns fan you're pretty stoked about how how things are growing so far you probably should\nBe three and at least three and two there are two two and one now so they're they're really good I wouldn't worry about the ravens is classic ravens [laughter] that's a classic Joe Flaco they don't want to be too good at it in the last they want to be ten and six nobody's talking about them and that when they get really\nMean oh so you're going to go old ravens remember when the ravens didn't score off as a touchdown for five weeks and then won the super bowl you could always throw that stat around with the ravens which is a lot of fun to do\nYeah I think the Flaco ravens were ten and six today they weigh in on the road a lot so yeah the ravens you don't want to be Thirteen in three that ravens team scares\nNetwork odd Detroit thirty one Green Bay twenty three big surprise of the week in Detroit just all over I think the scores twenty four zero it half\nGreen Bay did a lot to get back into it I think one little tidbit on Green Bay is they're kicking game\nThey're kicking my garage that makes the craziest thing ever makes it Crosby there is a point in his career Green Bay where he was in the upper five of kicker is in the league for reliability he wants one for five of from the field\nAnd costs in the game they they had to you know not rely on him late in the game he got a little feel go late just to chip in a a three but he was basically over four on his first for temps or us they probably win that game\nYeah and you know this is a handicap on air Rogers ... receivers were hurt so echo named mia St brown and he got his first catch ever Columbus Day now yard mark has vowed to scaling another rookie had six yards receiving he is throwing to no one it's a very interesting names interesting because they're actually interesting names\nUsed but I Do think that the play by play announcer for the Green Bay Packers is quietly praying that many of St brown and mark ... don't become star receivers for that team so he doesn't have to put it that much work\nThat is a lot of work or the play by play guys that like is that where you live for is that like at any time you say brown gets wrapped in the fourth round your like yes this is my time to shine\nIt took me about four years to say Chris ... followed the running back or a that was on the Steelers and then he leaves a sport like was now I've got nothing acrimonious St brown was a really good player for Notre Dame and we saw him at the super bowl he's like\nYeah you just want to keep an eye on but that's\nNever again he was such an NBA player like you and I said I like who is a is that a backup three man for the box we said that like fifty times\nYeah he's lifted a like a six six I think he's taller we both think he's taller\nAnd he was on the same party circuit that we were which has showbiz are\nThey how do we how do we get on the equipment is St brown it\nWhere it was an ad in the park has about a scaling of one party not one poll\nThe hyphen as we like to call I've done one of the game July from earlier\nWell I we should take a break but I Want to talk about the jets Broncos game no one else really probably gonna be talking about it but I Need to talk about it and I need to talk about how you could lead to a run off lasted average eighty five yards the game run on you for three hundred and twenty five yards unbelievable game\nAre also I Want to know about cheese jaguars and what James is going to say on
