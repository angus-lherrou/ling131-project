game last night the brewers get the when it was it was we did the show last night it's Danny's in walkers point\nAnd it was packed with brewers fans are let me say this by the way let me back up for a moment here last night we did a showdown studies and there was probably a scattering of people that were in there that were either not in brewers gear or they were in Packers gear\nOr it doesn't make you any less of a fan if you're not wearing the colors of a team you're ... you're cheering for\nPeople who are given some of these people grieve because they're bandwagon fans and they only came on in the postseason and they were cheering and screaming and just as loud and just as just as up for their team as anybody stop giving people\nJust enjoy the ride for God's sake the brewers are back in the postseason for the first time since two thousand and eleven and people are just your finger pointing at who can and can't beyond their bandwagon whether we take such ownership of a bandwagon that you can't be a fan so just be glad you're there but the brewers get the win last night and excitement and\nAnd pandemonium when a when ... got to base it it just rains Supreme the roar from standings last night and I had already gotten on my way up to wars washed off but I was listening to\nTim and talents last night to the Milwaukee baseball post game show on the station out of Milwaukee and it

baseball field so there'll be an hour earlier start time today is they take on game two of the Colorado Rockies yet again it will lead shot seen going to the hill\nAnd Joe I said the chosen solar back in our studios I said last night I did a piece for the network and said\nThat game there was a microcosm of their season they got good pitching till they didn't they got good defense till they didn't they got good hitting till they didn't and then in the end they figured out a way to scrap it out and that's kind of been their season\n[noise] yeah I guess that's a good way of putting it um you know if you take out if you take out Jeremy Jeffress and the implosion in the ninth inning Johnny whole staff really paid off and some people had doubts about that going into the game some people said well look what happened to the old days they tried that and it didn't work for them\n[noise]\nBack to the program we're glad you were on board today Thanks so much for take a listen to is the bill Michael

brewers in general\nI have a plea to the Milwaukee Brewers a note that this was what I Want and I'm sure it's already planned today they already know they're going to try it out there I Want Niger Morgan throwing out the first pitch again today I Want to keep the Joe ... ju ju going\nYou talk about how bizarre it was last night\nThis mirrored game five of the anal D. S. thing about this okay\nIn game five it was three to to walk off in the ... last night three to to walk off tenants in twenty eleven clothes or China expert loses it in the ninth inning twenty Eighteen closer Jeremy Jeffress loses the ninth inning\nTwenty eleven Niger Morgan game winning hit last night Niger Morgan throws out the first pitch moose wax it off I Want Niger Morgan throwing up\nKeep going brewers get I don't want to lose my heart though every time they get an extra innings I'm losing my fingernails and put it in my neck if it leads to release but when you take it yet I was out there\nNiger morgue and it was you don't like the the old vacation for him did you hear that you were there obviously what innovation for Niger Morgan last\nNight oh he's he's a he's a cult favorite I I yeah I think it's the best way to put it that yeah Niger Morgan will never be forgotten by ... never\nYeah he was a he he got the rousing round hoopla\nAnd that's it got to go [laughter]\n\nMeasure Morgan he was good to see him last night really good hey five five eight three zero eight six for eight to got an email here from Steve who says although the philosophy the bullpen start\nCan be questioned at times but I think you have to give kudos to create council up until the night he managed that team a masterful week I Know it hurt not scoring and the eighth we runners at second and third and nobody out but let's say the wind and go out today and get number two that's even Richfield let me say this and this leads me into what I said before I went to a break\nSo last night I don't know if you happen to hear this but last night\nUh Alex Rodriguez or the big hurt they were talking and big by what was the was the bigger big Papi somebody with whoever was there I was gonna say hurry are okay but they were talking about they were yes they were talking about the a starter by committee the bullpen and they called it nothing more than a gimmick that will not get you there\nAnd I was kind of taken aback by that because if you followed this team you know they've done this in the past and oh by the way for those that want to pooh pooh it they've never lost to doing it\nI don't know if people realize that now they did it earlier this season obviously and they want they did it a couple of times last year and they want\nThey've never lost when they started the bullpen I don't know if anybody realizes that so to say you won't get their meaning you won't get to a World Series or when the world series by doing this you couldn't be more wrong at this point because the only starter that has been one hundred percent successful\nHas been ... by committee to start its not starter is what they call out getters\nAnd so for those guys to say that they obvious drew you're freaking homework if you're waking up this morning in the Fisher hotel ballroom or in the Fisher hotel and you're heading downstairs past the ballroom and you're overlooking the first are you gonna go downstairs going to have your bacon and eggs this morning drew you're damn homework they've never lost\nIn that it it blew me away to call it a gimmick you know it's different people started talking about launch angles that was a gimmick saver metrics that was a gimmick war winds against replacement on at the gimmick\nYou know it it look I'm I'm not the most eager for change and but I Do when things are I opening you do have to take a look at it those guys could've looked more foolish last night on the broadcast it broadcast had they tried to\nSo to call it a gimmick I thought was a it's almost like a slap in the face it's almost again like the brewers have to prove themselves to the world that they actually belong there\nYou know it's just another way to slap down a Milwaukee team and the upstart Milwaukee team oh by the way Alex Rodriguez you great big dumb ass they have the best record in the national league the upstart brewers no they played really well the last three years they've been progressing the last three years have you not watch baseball\nThey do it in many different facets and this is just another way of getting it done they stack wins then it it it drives me nuts that they just don't get ... the only way you're gonna get respect as go when the whole damn thing and I've ... I've I've preached that for a long time but don't don't knock them down along the way\nYou know what I mean at least give them their prompt say instead of saying this is a gimmick say hey they've done this before they've been successful oh by the way they have never lost when they've done the the the bullpen out get her starter launched\nSo if I'm if I instead of saying boy this is a gimmick they're never going to get there I Would say if I'm the Colorado Rockies I'm swimming upstream at this point I'm fighting history at this point this team is never lost when they've done this at this point\nBoy by black has got a got his work cut out for his hitters have to get all over these these these corporate guys right away you got to make them work for it you got to work to count you got to get I'm tired because tomorrow then he there are certain guys you can't use\nNo you know that that upstart brewers team that's a gimmick they're never going to get there well you know I guess it feels pretty sore this morning doesn't it for where the brewers stuck it\nPaid five five eight three zero eight six for eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight and if you want to chime in and\nGo ahead and feel free to do so many people are many people going ahead and a German and this morning I this was from Jim Jim says hey guys I Love watching the crew last night I was excited I was up on every pitch deal at the stadium was electric\nUm he goes on to say wouldn't have let Jeff presented as long but I don't know specifically what I Would have pulled him maybe after that long foul ball down the right field line I might have\nBecause we could all tell he just didn't have it your thoughts you're never gonna poor guy in the middle of it back I mean you can you can but it just\nIt very rarely happens very rarely happens um\nThis one from a judge has any idea what problems trying to do scoring from second on that while pitch could have been a beginning I was not in favor of that I I I agree look we we saw Ryan Braun the other day take off and get thrown out at second\nAnd you're thinking yourself why that particular moment you know there's just times were instinctual you think you can do something and you go you go for it and see what happens but in that particular case I think um\nYou know obviously it can be scores were talking about one of the rest of the play but in the grand scheme of things not the smartest place\nAnd and you go back to that uh that that when in game five or against the Diamondbacks we're recall uh the closer that year blue I Believe it was his first savor the year I think he blew that save in in that game to put 'em in the extras\nAnd they have the opportunity that's going to happen I Would have and and now that you take Enron story was it just Eighteen pitches so is he available in in the afternoons ball game you have to go to um you're right I mean he's he's the guy the gotcha there he's he's one of the heart and soul of that bullpen\nI really don't have a problem and him ... manning up and getting the ball again in in a safe situation you've got to go with them\n[noise] um so this this afternoon I mean obviously you lead shot scene goes how many innings do you think if he is throwing well do you think they let him go\n[noise] yeah I think they're going to be counted as always to get to that town with a lead through five so if they can get through five\nAnd and you know people were talking about the bullpen game and and and all that and it worked and it did work I'm now it's a little different dynamic with was shot seen\nComing in at Fifteen in a three and a half the IRA thirty five starts this season most in the ... by the way very durable guy\nAnd in a fight are out there and he will he will play some gamesmanship what these guys noticing in the last month of his starts that you know God's steps out on him All right man you want to go that route and I'll go that route a quick pitch it you know it's it's just that sort of thing with him but to answer your question\nVery tempting to get back into that bullpen after five with a lead it would be nice to just give that both kind of rest\nHave the day off tomorrow go back at it on Sunday if the ... can just break away and Thailand and the left today coming in the numbers aren't aren't real grade but the brewers at twenty four and\nAnd Nineteen I Believe against left these this year so they do get their their fair share of wins but that is a little bit of a liability but if the brewers off as a can bust out that will determine shot scene and then you look forward the forward thinking here\nIs that I'm seeing with four days rest could start in case there's a a game five\nHum we've run that we were talking with Tim Allen who's the baseball post game show I was talking earlier as well and I heard you guys mention it last night you hear\nUh the big hurt and Alex Rodriguez talk about this being a quote gimmick by the brewers with his bullpen start to al ... they call it to know they'll never get will never get them there and then I started thinking about it so I got into the hotel room last night and started looking at starters over the last couple of years for the brewers and the way they've done\nA bullpen by committee to get a quote start or out they've never lost\nSo I don't understand how they can call them up start when they have the best record in the national league into a gimmick that will never get you there\nFrom two guys that have been there but yet they are the brewers only get out and they've been successful in doing it I it's just again another example of people just don't respect what Milwaukee is doing and they're not looking far enough over the fence and if you actually did your damn homework you'd understand that they've never lost the game when they've done is\nNo and and they they're used to plan on teams that have studs to how we have to keep that keep that in mind and and as as frontline stars and the brewers can cause a scene that well\nMaybe maybe not but after that they don't have anything right there that you would consider a curse shot and I look at the Dodgers they they voted cursed Shaw\nOr in their series and he would be available then for a game five what does that mean for everybody well who's more used to playing without a starting pitcher because ... would not be available to start an ... game one if that's the case so if you're really thinking ahead\nIt it really benefits the brewers in that regard that if you've got to use your ... your front line guy your face to get to the next series you won't have them for for game one which is vitally important um that much I Do know in the playoffs or to to get that first when so you know all that being said\nWho's more used to playing playoff baseball and an all hands on deck everybody Hannibal off to the next guy that's a little old school thinking and that is is really is bill those national guys not keeping an eye and the brewers and and I feel you're right they're not getting respect\nYeah exactly I as speaking of that I still can't fathom and bud black is uh\nWhy the hell are you pitching to Christian yellow which\nI don't get me wrong I Want to see them continue to do so because he continues to make teams pay for it but we saw Joe mad and do it we've seen but lacked do it and then each particular case where you're thinking to yourself or that we should probably walk him in a circumstance they don't and he makes them pay when as a manager gonna wake up and go I probably shouldn't let this guy beat me and damned again last night\nYeah it's it's had scratch and I think what what they did last night was they tried to throw him and pitch him a little different they they try to think a little bit above the room there and he was seeing a lot of\n... what normally you know would be a careful at bat I think they were using a different approach in that while I never really throw change job so I'm going to throw change ups to yell at each year and a and he's not going to know it that you know he's not going to expect it\nAnd it came back to bite him I mean the end and again this is about the brewers office wrapped around\nA Christian yell at ... and sometimes there's no two ways about it but one of the bases are uh you know empty with with a couple of men out there is no reason to pitch that dude\n[noise] let me ask you when it comes to the match ups um you know we we so obviously a starting lineup last night we kind of expected\nBut they do have some good batch coming off the bench a we know Domingo Santana has been hitting the ball better as of late do you just stick right now straight with across the board would yell at each end cane in Braun and just let them go\nOr do you try to mix and match and you're starting to go with the different match ups in a different different lefty righty matchups\nNo I think that's a great question to the I I ... I hadn't thought about it but I Would think that that I'll I'll field is set in bronze numbers in the postseason are killer now see the same player he was some years ago ... probably not\nBut that off in a in the outfield you you got to go with those guys key I'm Brock says that a bat in his hand in a pretty crucial situation that game last night if if there was one mistake I thought that was made was going to go just to tick early that was that was way early in the game and he just kind of thought that\nWho boy that means ... may have a possibility here being a hero or a gold and their happened thankfully but um that often ... or the outfield just keep them there to keep those studs out there\nAlways go to Jim Jim oh I'm sure you're listening again tonight hang in there and we'll talk more this uh this next week okay\nNo doubt steady as was a blast last night\nIt was fun we ... we had a great time down there or recommend everybody make it to understand these at one point or another we'll talk about you you got it\nThere you go that is the host of the baseball post game show joining us for a couple of minutes on the Schneider orange hotline shatter Harry drivers right now you work hard they treat you fair that's what they've been doing for a long long time if you want a new team you want to change teams whatever happens to be or maybe just need a team\nCalled eight hundred and forty four prior to go to Schneider jobs dot com eight hundred and forty four pride or go to ...

now they're back out and we're breaking it down eight five five eight three zero eight six or eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight\nAnd let's get right to her phone lines are a wide open your reaction to the brewers getting away your reaction to the game coming up to date your reaction to the use of the bullpen your reaction to the to talking heads on Fox Sports ... said this is

couldn't couldn't put them away [noise]\n\nWater\nBut black explaining why he did pitch too much stock is and a while and also really cost them and that is going to be the question is you know hey look you just base a team that throughout\nTheir bullpen and you pitched to two guys you probably should the pitch to and you end up losing a game now you have to explain it rightfully show rightfully so but still but black or many consider to be one of the best managers in baseball on the smartest guys in baseball I got an email here you know I wanted to address this real quick a visit from Todd\nAnd he said hey you and I do love listening to your in the north woods why wasn't Bob euchre on the air for the end of the game last night several people\nUp north here was we're we're worried all the way it works is Bob calls wanting to ban now you've got three and four they bought cost five and six\nThen LeBron calls seven and then Bob calls the eighth and the nights and then ... would call the tense and then they would alternate after that so just happened to be an ending which was all\nUm and he was not on the call I mean if you listen to the broadcast over the years is the first and second inning or euchre fitness extending your euchre ate tonight pending or euchre he calls in essence six innings again\nUh I mean it goes all the way back when you know when I got here when Jim Powers year that's just the way it was and then then they alternate they they rotate innings\nSo it would be the tenth inning would go to a Jeff liberating I think like the eleventh and twelfth would go to euchre and then the thirteenth who go to liberating and it's just that kind of way it is it the way a lot of the broadcast books are set up it's not just the Milwaukee it's pretty much that way all over\n'em but and and now you know it does change a little bit I mean like the cubs a pat use a with Ron ... they're more as a color guy and then that\nThe game and I think the fifth inning as ... or like I Know during postseason a link Casper comes in and Atlanta is fantastic lend comes in and doesn't play by play and then but Ron ... is always the colored guy\nA type of deal so ah but a lot of broadcast booths are set up that way paid five five eight three zero eight six for sports or the program brought you buy a printed Neumayr medical treaty guys with E D all over the state of Wisconsin and well beyond the borders so if you've got that going on they have a Ninety eight percent success rate just make a phone call for\nOne for four or five five for four or five\nWhen I stopped in there yesterday as a matter of fact and I was just kind of BS and what the guy's a little bit every now and it'll swing by are great people over there [noise] businesses good obviously but they just said that more and more people come in and just say hey I heard this is this true and they get those those quite phone calls but the one thing\nMore women are calling hey my partner this is my partner that and they're calling in acquiring so ladies if you're out there cruising around and you're going husband just he he doesn't have the same possess he doesn't have the same Iran is hip hip if you know what I'm saying how we look it make a call\nFor one for four or five five for four or five one that's for one for four or five five four for five one\nTo get back to the phone call it a lot of people on hold oh let's go to Joel listening to it was a black river Joe how you doing today man what's happening\nRight now I ... with the you know I I don't think we I think we've got Alex Rodriguez altogether because he is a great player [noise] terrible animal if they're going to come broadcasts that he sounded like five years partner in major league I forget the guy's\nThere and [laughter] I'm for it you know [laughter] you know\nI felt that I feel bad for that factors in their faith you know the you know you think that we'll down and then he gets in the food that they're just totally irrelevant but no I just think that you know if they play the fundamental game and I think they got away for a little bit last night you know what they're feeling and stuff but [noise]\nI Do to appreciate the phone call look ah we we talked about it what makes this brewers team go\nOr if you look at the numbers we broken down numerous times the brewers when they score first heavy ... ridiculous number of wins I mean it's by far it it's it's it's so much ... it's it's easy I mean put it this way when they when they score first when the brewers scored first\nUh they're Seventy four and twenty eight one in zero so far in this postseason ah when they hit an opponent they're Seventy three and Seventeen when they commit an error there are thirty nine and forty\nAlthough they're one of them in the postseason but when they don't come in and they're it's fifty seven and twenty seven on the season when they're\nLeading after seven innings there eighty and three eighty three eighty and three when they're leading after seven innings think about that Haiti\nAnd three extra games there are nine and seven this season there want to know in the postseason\nBut ... you just got to play fundamental fundamental baseball you score first you let your pictures go to the hill with a confidence and you play fundamentally sound effects and you're going to win a lot of games and that's what the ... been doing all season long eight five five eight three zero eight six forty eight five five eight three zero\nEight six for a A R a tweeter wagon hunter says hindsight's twenty twenty jeopardy is the clothes or if he's arrested you use him period\nPaid five five eight three zero eight six for eight um this is from mark who says I think that the brewers are going to be just fine don't worry about Jeremy Jeffers he'll get the velocity backup if he doesn't in his first couple of pictures are low find out what the first hit or does against him and then create council has to then make a move\nA this was from Josephine who says big time brewers fan here listening in Elkhart lake gonna come down tonight for the game looking forward to it best place to eat prior to the game man we get this all the time there's I mean it depends on what you want\nShoot me back and look I we we were at standings last night we loved down each way to tell you who downtown there's no better place in ... Georgia when you talk about the color on club if you're gonna go some place close to the stadium there's all kinds of bars right there on blue man wrote\nYou go everywhere from Kelly's bleachers uh to uh to seize on bloom out there's Dallas Jerry's right up the street you can go there I mean there's all kinds of great places depends on where you want to go and once you're in the mood for\nIt just wasn't the right time um you know you're you're aggressive like that late in a ball game when you're trying to play Iran and and you believe that you know you're running out of options then you start to take a chance like that may be perfect throw a perfect political play whatever but I just that that\nThat to me was just not the right time right place to be able to do something like that and then there was a line drive\nRemember because uh um you know Braun has a line drive that ended up getting Christian yell edge a double up at second base when Christian you know she didn't realize it went off of his glove had the line drive that those two are communicating on it was a couple of instances yesterday and what you kind of looked at things you said OK communication might have been an issue\n[noise] yeah it was a that was ... you know we were talking about baseball all the time you know just when he was thought you've seen everything possible in this game then again something crazy happens and there were a couple of instances last night but that this one it clearly Christian yell edge thought the ball was caught\nAnd Carlos two barrel the first base coach\nAlso thought that it was caught as well as if you look at the replay there sue Barrow his head is down he's looking at a stop watch there is no hesitation\nTell Christian yell at each get a second base go go go he thought the same thing so Christian yelled he was asked about this first last night this is what he had to stay on the whole situation\nOf the current flare that myself and the first real we both thought he's caught it sounded like it caught it I saw the ball club and and didn't have a great job by holding the bag on me like you didn't catch it is able to have a free place is unfortunate but thankfully I didn't know this\nYeah yeah luckily so then Ryan Braun\nA looked a little upset with Chris genealogy afterwards because he was yelling and a little bit so we went and asked Ryan Braun\nAbout it yeah we've been working on that play usually when I had a line drive ... runs back to the dugout it's a weird play I don't know everything that we've been we've been practicing that much\nJust a crazy play one of those weird things I'd never seen before obviously I'm you know I had a really hard and when I'm being glove I can see why he thought he had caught it um and then he thought he attacked him so I see how the whole play unfolding but obviously I Would have been nice if we had first and third nobody out in that situation um but it all ended up working out who want to\nHear from you were pretty mad remarried I don't know if you're here it is\nYeah I mean the emotions run high and games like this right I think a ... anybody really frustrated in that situation obviously in the two nothing game every round is is of the most important so\nUm we would have had first and third nobody out really good chance that on in that situation um and obviously I saw the plant focuses right in front of me but for both you know Carlos and yell I think it was tough to see what was happening in the moment\nYou believe he\nWas yelling so I think so yeah yeah I think if if he heard me he would have ran but obviously I think it was really loud I'm In the stadium so I'm obviously he didn't want to say\n[noise] so there you go that was the if we look uh Ryan Braun was probably looking at an opportunity last because he saw the ball but nobody else did so it's one of those on his mistakes and\nIt is what it is but I don't I didn't really I wasn't paying attention Ryan Braun running out first base to see if he was yelling at yellow to go go go go go you know what I mean\nUh so I didn't happen to see that 'cause that's not where my focus ... was my focus was on the outfield and yellow coming back to the base\nAnd then heading back to second and obviously being thrown out but\nI you know it's it's just it's you know what the ball again we're talking about a game of inches Joe you get the ball that goes down the line foul\nA and it was ... it was called fair originally uh in the ninth inning had they've all been three inches to the left then all of a sudden we're talking about a different ball game had that hit by Ryan Braun goes three inches to the left that had never even touched by the glove yellow just probably standing on third we're talking about a different ball game I mean that's just kind of the way things were so\nHopefully tonight's a little bit better communication so you know I Would say a little bit better but I don't know what you could have done in that circumstance to make things better you know what I mean\nWell I expect more from the office tonight because there was no reason why you can only put up two runs in nine innings in that game I you know I thought sense of tele\nWas a little bit over the place I don't think he pitched all that well a command seemed a little bit off to me and there were some hard hit balls from this brewery team\nOr the problem was was just going right to defenders but they had opportunities to cash in with runners on base that needs to change this often\nFor for what it's worth there is no excuses here the often has to play a big part in getting this team beyond the LDS into the I don't see us and hopefully the world series you cannot go out there and put up two runs this off weighed when you have\nLaid the ball game in the seventh and eighth inning when you have runners and scoring position and nobody out you can't play to run this goes back to the aggravation at times that we've seen throughout the season where it just it it\nThe ability to either hid behind a runner or come up in a certain ... circumstance and give you the the sacrifice fly or whatever it is that you need\nThat has been something that drives fans crazy a and last night like I said I was sitting there with the amount that we were kind of watching the game together and to see this team in both to Seventy eight and you're thinking at least played a runner too then you're talking about breathing space\nAnd they were unable to do so both times that's where the frustration comes in and something like that because Tim it turned to me and said\nThose two weddings could end up costing them escape ultimately it cost him the extra inning because they scored in either one of those opportunities it's game over Jeffers only gives up two runs and the game is over they're closing it out instead\nOf going to extra innings and then have to kind of go ahead and win the game and actress but I'm Glad they did but it's that kind of circumstance that if you don't capitalized on those opportunities and you let more those go by the wayside\nUltimately they're gonna come back and bite you that we just know that\nSo wait so there are facing Tyler Anderson of the Rockies who's a lefty the line up just came out for the brewers want to hear ... All right here we go wean off Lorenzo Cain betting second Christian yellowish Ryan Braun is third have to say you are cleaning up my stock is back in the lineup ...\nAired on ... will be over at short and bad sex traffickers shots\nCrafts will catch annually shot seen bats night\nThat you line up today so you basically pull a RC a out parameters inserted ... seen on the hill travel ... Aguilar broad yell at you came pretty much\nThe same so I mean you're going to have a couple of ... in the lineup Christian yell at you as we all know can hit left these that's not an issue a new stock is I think deserves the right to be in this line up today or even though he's a lefty and trap Shaw is going to play second base and he is a lefty so we'll see how this fair is against our Anderson but\nThat the pitcher this off and should be able to get to [noise]\nEight five five eight three zero eight six forty phone lines all lit up state to we got a lot more to do Michael show this portion of programming brought you Barbara printed bud lite Bud Light they bring you the bill Michael ... we had a great time last night that thanks to standing for hosting us kind of at the last minute with a lot of fun down there we always get down there there's no doubt about that but coming up\nNext week on the huddle the huddle is going to be on the road we're going to be a Lowe's Irish pub in Wildwood tells you that some ... road cannot wait to get their love being on that stage love that atmosphere is going to be a great place hopefully we're still talking about a lot more baseball and a lot of exciting baseball who knows maybe we're watching baseball but come on out next Thursday night we're going to be most Irish pub\nFor the don't Michel subtle brought you by Bud Light the official beer sponsor of Michael sports talk network more about Michael show live and washed are coming up next\nWe're going to change so bill Michael sports talk at work [noise]\nWith the regular season winding down the Lincoln high school read raiders will travel to Steven's point on Fridays and say something to scratch Panthers will LA just be victorious or make it to in a row\nIf you can get to see the game W.

while ago that uh the the great people event or and they did something for me that nobody can do and they gave me the Ninety they test drive in what is that specifically you ask well here's what it is\nIt's basically what it sounds like you you get the vehicle for Ninety Days okay you you you look at you know buying a vehicle and you're finding what you like and I it took me a while to figure out what exactly does that I wanted so I ended up um you know going to be in when I heard about the horn is Ninety they test drive and I thought you know what I'm going to try this\nAnd I went there and I started driving different vehicles the new ram Fifteen hundred the Jeep Grand Cherokee and such and dodge charger of thought about getting a car and then we were moving and I like firewood and being able to haul things around and everything and I thought I Would try to pick up trucks so I did I picked up the two thousand to Nineteen ram Fifteen hundred from\nThe great people over there the trucks center in Plymouth I Love the thing I've talked about a numerous times\nYou can't do and you can find out all the information and all the vehicles that qualify for the Ninety they test drive by going to van horn auto dot com that's van horn auto dot com\nAnd you can see for yourself about the Ninety they test drive the best part about it is if you take it back after Ninety Days you not satisfied with it no additional commitment\nIf if you want to buy it say about the to grant that simple I mean it's a great program check it out for yourself tell him I said you're getting van horn auto dot com that's van horn auto dot ... let's get back to the phone calls we got a lot of people on a whole lot of people want to chime in about this brewers team\nSo let's get to it a let's uh let's see here Dominic is on the north side Dominic how you doing today what's happening\nWhat's going on there\nAre just kind of hanging out right now just enjoying life because this is a great time of year to be a sports fan of Wisconsin\nI Know right I I'm I was calling well first of all I'm a longtime listener but this is my first time caller so bear with me um [noise] I wanted to make a couple of comments about the birds and\nI wanted to know I didn't know if it was a executive already or GM here how they do it in baseball but I think David stars should get that a war\nOn a strength of a lot of people were saying you should go get ... get the Machado but what he did was at a lot of debt to line up a lot of up to the book and and the second point I wanted to make was\nAnd doing that he didn't give a is farm system you know what I mean and and if you look at yesterday's gangs who started the game\nIt was wardrobe and Corbin buyers guys that's coming up with a farm system so I think I don't want to say he's a hit of his time as far as like innovation 'cause I don't think I think it's been it's been done like somewhat before but\nAs far as like you know having a philosophy as they get into it I think he's done a really great job I really like I really like to pick us that we may fires but at the gang yesterday again or a story a story I guess the biggest park I don't know if that was yesterday or the day before\nAnd we'll start to get the walk off you know he picks up guys and at the same time he didn't have to deplete the farm system\nYou know that was what ... what a lot of people with way back and forth\nAround you when they sent me currently did plenty of time in\nKey but here but today Ramsey show weekday six to eight on AM Thirteen twenty W F a jar\n\nWater back to the Michael show we're on the air and we're broadcasting live here in Washington is a pizza kinda day\nIf you're going to be kicking back relaxing maybe sit at home hanging out or maybe even this weekend when you've got to the Packers on and then the brewers on it I Know it's a pizza friday but it can be a pizza weekend thanks to our friends over low wages frozen pizza\nVery different than most frozen pizzas out there ah they are it's not only a terrific sponsor of it as anybody knows that any product that I endorse I use it and there are pieces are handmade\nRight here in Belgium, Wisconsin great ingredients one hundred percent real Wisconsin cheese in my personal favorite is the big daddy to kids at the house Lovett a that's coming up this weekend we got some sleep over going on in the new house and so I went out in the stock up on these things I got to handle the wages frozen pizzas\n... and the boys and everybody's going to grow up in this weekend it's packed with several varieties of tasty meats\nAnd do all the different things that are gonna make it good sharing an eye of the kids just love these things you will to I've been highly recommend in these things for why look for them in your favorite grocery store look for Luigi ... remember that Luigi ... for over forty years it's been Louis the best frozen pizza it tastes fresh is guaranteed it's available equality groceries quality grocery stores\nAnd then don't forget there's taverns that carry it throughout the state of Wisconsin as well always a good ... that is our friends from Louis grand chicken ... bay press Gazette now joining us on the Schneider orange hotline Eric uh\nIt's interesting and we're going to talk with my Columbus coming up about this in the next hour but uh and I asked ... about this as well do you get the sense that Aaron Rodgers is either one feeling the pressure of the contracts to\nTrying to kind of crack the whip himself maybe for an area that the head coach is not a I don't know what to make of it but I Do know that are listening to Michael Clemens last night there was a level of animation out of him going come on are you kidding me towards the head coach that I have not heard in a while\nYou know that's tough um if I\nReally don't know how to answer that in fact because through the years and I think we've had conversations like this where it seems like he\nYou know making jail folks that the coach constantly you know last year oh there you know it wasn't at all because he was there but if you go back to you for um you know this whole run the table here you know he was poking at the coach constantly and before that it was a couple of times\nSo that might take guy is that I you know I'm not so sure if it's\nIf it's Aaron Rodgers just being\nKind of arrogant jerks or if it's um if he's really trying to some to cause some ... some ... I don't know I I don't know what what how to how to answer that really\nIt's a ... and and I don't either I look at things and I think to myself okay where is this team right now granted they've got a few injuries I've seen some things and heard some things and\nUh I Know that might McCarthy tries to be a player coach he tries to use all the analytic she tries to give their bodies rest he tried but on the other hand you've got a quarterback saying damn it we got to get everybody up are you this level of of could play is not acceptable they have to bring their standards up and if he's the one cracking the whip you wonder okay\nHere's the coach kind of saying go ahead and and and get these guys to play for you\nFor is Aaron Rodgers saying I got to bring these guys up because the head coach won't\nYou know that's kind of feeling that it's kind of where I'm at\nYeah or the other you know ... the throw a third one and there's that's his way of trying to be the leaders of anger there yep\nLeader that guy I don't know I don't know if it works for them you know I I I think everyone's got a a a high level of regard for him like a football player um\nSometimes sometimes their voice just gets old you know we're still I'm not sure\nI fear in Rogers he doesn't have random you\nKnow I was gonna say if ever Rodgers doesn't that Randall cop doesn't have a you know a divine the Adams I mean if you got to run a mile down I'm not to say that I'm expecting a lot of this out of him but he's going to have equity near St brown gym on more and more ... scaling and obviously Jimmy ground is going to go along with that with Mercedes Lewis and company\nUm the question then becomes ... is that enough to get it done is there enough talent there to get it done\nWell would it sounds like coming out of four sixty five that you can read the tea leaves a little bit it sounds like survive days probably going to play a ... as we know and probably a fifty fifty shot with Allison snow Allison in ...\nDuring there'd be a divine today and envy as I like him I I think you\nKnow this would be a chance for him to stress to feel either way he's going to get easier to get more point in time and I think he's got this the kind of rip the lid off the defense a little bit and you can kinda get up field so I really look forward to seeing him play and having to expand that role\nIs he going to have an expanded well no matter what I'm sick with Cobb so I really think it could be interesting to see him play and she works for him that I think he showed a little bit last week\nOr you showed it to to think he showed that he or young receiver doesn't you know point\nThat all the nuances down and it takes a couple of years and he also show that he's got some wielding can get get get past the back so you know that it's going to be that is probably the most interesting part of the for me to be watching a Sunday\nYou know you got come out and more out there or you know I Know you saw he's got talent but you know\nStruggles with the ball struggled running grouse a little bit uh saint ... in the gay target\nSo I think that would be interesting to see how he they're there and you know it it goes through guy you know could probably are going to get a fair amount of time and it's going to be you know the pharaohs guy to step up in the world or at I think the other thing we're going to see a heck of a lot more use of running back because\nThey just may have to um maybe maybe that's the week where you see a lot of ground but you know the one thing about you are going ... teams are trying to take care of a way they're they're not just let him run rampant out there so I'm\n... depends on what Detroit one wants to do on these types of what's going to be who's going to be the guy on fundraising\nI'm looking at moving forward and it'll be the last one before I let you go but moving forward you got Detroit but these are games when we went over their schedule you and I talked on Sunday the ... if I'm not saying it's a must win because the Packers are sitting at two wins one loss of a tie but with the gauntlet debts about upcoming\nThis almost becomes one of those games you cannot let slip away because what you've got on the horizon\nYou gotta figure ten wins might when there's division and that's about where I have this team in chalk this up as a when you've got to lay out in LA you got New England in New England you've got a lot of these teams you guys still Minnesota on the road the bears on the road you don't have much room for error right now do you\nKnow not at all and and here's the problem is worth it you can't play\nReally really good Hispanic gas young quarterbacks and they don't have a young quarterback this week you saw what happened in the Washington I'm In Minnesota they gave up a ton of charging a you know we all know what happened there but\nI really think that this is a really big big big game show early in the season they if they want to take control of their destiny this\nIs a game that has to be one or can't be it doesn't matter they win by one point who cares it's a W but it it's it's something that they have to do if they want to keep pace in that division\nAnd in there and I see as far as uh as twelve students go so this this I think you're right with you this is a big game and the other thing is this if they do this game there staring down the barrel of really you know stuff like you said a tough stretch\nBoy you know it's good to be tough sledding there this team doesn't make the playoffs I think that's not a good thing\n[noise] always good to chat buddy will chat again on Monday okay\nYeah so I was a great weekend\nAppreciate about talk to you soon ... branch of the Green Bay press Gazette joining us
