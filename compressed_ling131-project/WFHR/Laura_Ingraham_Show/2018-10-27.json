J. ... how do they prepare why are they there every single week\nAnd I'm up and down or do I need to do better and to to make sure that I don't have the big peaks and valleys that I can become more consistent and really that's just an internal thing that the players have to do with one another and then with themselves to to see what what they can do hum that moving forward I think for me a couple of things that really disappointed me today\nWas Jennifer Taylor scrambles because oh yeah this is where he was hurt I Know he's a sophomore but he has plenty of experience yeah and in and it looked like he has gotten past that that's been something that's been a bucket of parents\nAnd I know he's still young but you've got a raw quarterback out there you've got a raw quarterback out there and look he talked about it during the broadcast\nThis team desperately missed ... he's not coming back Ryan tremendous blocking tight and they've had to go to the jumbo look now because of his his his ability to do that and and the thing is is that when you go to the jumbo you need that extra block her up there\nThey're not running on catching passes you can't make many ... and stuff that and I thought the other thing interesting during the game today the loop talked about\nIn talking with wide receivers coach Gilmore\nThat this group a wide receivers does not block well down field and that really impacts of running game\nAnd the other thing you said too is that regardless of why they miss quintet seafood I'll watch because he was abused when it came to down a field blocking he was a deep threat he'd open up so many things for them what you're seeing right now\nIs you're seeing a lot of young guys under fire who you know don't have a lot of experience and you know you're in that position\nThat it takes time and you and you want them to go right now but the speed of the game it just takes time and that's why you're seeing so many mistakes being made right here in\nThe form of and the one that Taylor had in summer is learning to measure the new quarterback ride Cohn holds a ball but poses handle quicken Taylor may not have a war Hornet broke may stay with him a little bit longer\nStill has to secure the football running down to feel that he's going down to the ground a great job by the defense of\nI think it was an outside linebacker came and literally punch the ball and he did you notice he never tackled and he just came right off the ball there and wham you have to know what to expect contact to secure that either with another armor squeeze it super tight great play on his part but that's something that Jay ts better for sure\nI'm walking down the field those are young receivers yet right the ... freshmen summer term or maybe Richard sophomore maybe a true sophomore\nI'm a figure that out because in order for our own game to be solid they'll wind has to perform better our guys down field after perform better so when we get to the second level it's the one guy that you have to make missed that you have to account for is running back\nThere's too many guys for free that the plug the gaps in and we can never get to run game on track to the\nOther piece to them and still another line from Luke today I thought he was just not that he's not dialing but\nHe also sent in regards to the special teams will teams have got to be special when you have you they they failed in essence in all three phases today you can pull a game out if you have\nYou know maybe one you know there's not playing well one that's kind of hanging on and then you have one that's special\nSpecial teams were not special at all Gagliardi is struggling with field goals\nI mean the thing that was that was that was a shock to see the two where there's no cease to yard yeah that's right I mean you have to like to do it um I mean the three keys special teams penalties today it just has not been good and I I you know you can you can point fingers wherever you watch but\nGot to change now yeah and and and quick ... in in more by what you guys have to buy into that role writes a lot of times when you come into a program like this you recruited you're not on a lot of special teams in high school [noise]\nHere's an opportunity to have an impact but you got to embrace that you're going to want to get out there and play and you want to do your job of the best of the your ability you can't just go through the motions people are too good\nAnimal exposed things if you are well you talk about it too because you play the position with Evan ... it's a great story or an interception or the first possession for northwestern today but got beat a couple of times and he's inexperienced and perhaps there's a reason why he would just pulling special teams\nPlayers like that who are not quite there I'm physically they get exposed ... physically I think that he's got the tool that's one thing that artist to train is your eyes caught up picking\nOut a little mobile screen where he broke up and the receiver just rented go route and then he's an intro position same thing on the touched down at the back in the end zone he's looking at the ball coming in instead of first closing to the man to get there to try and make it that way where the antibodies to send to nurture the hero hurt them for sure and and that's one thing that if those kind of you can get healthy\nThen you see maybe a jump but the whole aspect of now playing as a team right right you have to trust which are being coached\nYou'd have to perform that way you have to execute the little fundamental things and when you do that now you're game starts to grow if you continue to peak cannot trust what you're saying\nAnd that's one mistake continue to happen well the thing too is that the guys that are playing now in some key spots is not seen a lot of things yeah there's a lot coming out on a lot of different play action they can they can disguise different things and you get caught up in high school it's a little bit more simple here\nReporter backs look off to come back on the fire because they trust the receivers going to be either running backs can jump cut him make movies that you're not you're not seen before\nIt all comes together in in defense of ... much more physical ... younger receivers you have to learn to fight off of that ball technique things that you have to trust again what you're being taught\nBut you're the one that has to go and execute and that that's where you have to look at yourself in the mirror and say I'm going to do all I can to get better at this and if ... if I don't I'm not helping my team in multiple guys on the team don't do that now you see an issue across the board which out on the field\nSeven eight six six eight nine to

make it that much tougher\nIt's a hard hard recipe or co\nSmaller how much a part in the west today when it's over the guy\nI think that every time we play something along the line and you know whatever happens at the end and leaders last year every year coached for that you know the conversation might be what's on the line right now but it's not until you're done playing the season that's when you are in\nThe right for whatever you get them so\nI think when you prepare all week and I get to play this game and you put yourself all out there on the Internet is gonna hurt but like any player doesn't matter of what's on the line you know we're into whatever\nThe player season and we got to make sure we do a good job of playing one game and time over here in front of the ... the first time you know certainly are\nSome good things and yet you know there's some value will go back and look at the film is going to be some some areas where you can learn from it and uh you know whether it's the same for any player on this team right I mean\nYou want them to play ... and then sell them happens with any player and so\nUm I was proud of the way he played in and handle that and I'm approached the week and what the uncertainty of whether he's going out and then as we progress kind of had an idea okay its own and that that's what he did a great job preparing that way and competitive then certainly there's going to be some place like back in ... as I Do some good things to\nDo you have to feel you have to scale back some things and not not use them for the first time so\nI think you know there's probably a balance there that you know felt like we got to make sure we got a good planning against this defense and an early weren't sure what kind of what the status will be um but didn't feel like you know and that was part of the\nNew Jack had worked with the ones all weekend and so it didn't have anything in there that you felt like it was an appropriate for the game plan and early you know you want to be smart and make sure that it just in calling it the get a little bit of a a rhythm and and um\nBut not significantly where he said what are we going to change it or didn't feel like you to dumb down or anything like that and and so on they insulted he's\nGot a ton of work throughout this year\nIn the first actions you know ... this year but um\nI think you know you adjusted a little bit for each player but not\nLike we had the skill dying you know what hurt us\nFor that was probably just not being as efficient on third down and you know you know you're a rhythm going off and split that affected are run game and his ... you know we talk to them is actually the fence and didn't think it would be easy by any means but I think those probably in taxes as much as it was a quarterback was\nAgainst some thoughts from Paul after the last today never stood um\nIt's interesting when he talked about never got a rhythm going off\nOutside of maybe maybe one gave the season that would apply to virtually every game this year for the badgers off and you\nCan maybe even go back and just to one drive with Iowa right what the right and drive at the end when it rains the fourth quarter um that's that's kind of a drive that I look at that I would've expected are often it's to be like again you can't do it every time\nAs much as you want to because there was a very good defense you want to get there was a really good players you face\nUm and they might not necessarily a great defense but there is individual players that can can make an impact right\nBut that's kind of what I expected our guys to look like to be able to when they had to put the hammer down to do it and that's the only time I've really seen that as a as a consistent drive from start to finish were able to score like they're supposed to win\nSome guys have to play better they gotta they gotta play smarter just like pasta and\nAgain that comes down to accepting the
