I\n\nYeah they\nThey have a very left handed a rotation [noise] you know it'll it'll it means you're going to seem to line up so I'm kinda regularly is what I Would tell you so you won't see one line up they'll be more guys just kind of in the starting line up and we think we have the players for it to death they seemed different in different names were starting line\n[noise] [noise]\nNo Michael ... council we're glad you were on board today [noise]\nThere's more to the program Roger ... new mail medical tell you more about that coming up here shortly today [noise] Jim\nJim ESPN senior writer for major league baseball and ESPN and he said all we can ask for lead championship series is that the two best teams are involved which is precisely the case with the ...\nThe ... one of the living in a row diamond Nineteen Seventy Seventy one Orioles for the most consecutive victories heading into a championship series [noise] they're playing the Dodgers who perhaps have more good players and are motivated when they're first world series in Nineteen Ninety or Nineteen eighty eight\nHe gives you three reasons why the Dodgers are gonna win the series he said one starting pitching the clearest advantage in the series the Dodgers have quit and courage Yahoo's performance in game two of the you know divisional series against the Atlanta eight square listening to his no walk just another reminder than any postseason doubts are behind him even though he's ready to be great\n[noise] um what is it real or wry who engine right\nThrough I Can't remember how they pronounce his last name anyway he was terrific in game one\nA Walker Mueller has the best stuff on the staff\nOr when Richfield doesn't have to start until the fourth game of the series a deep rotation in the meantime the brewers have no true ways nothing really even close\nBut um as we all ds against Iraqis Milwaukee started through a combined twelve and two thirds innings in three games not allowing a rod starters gave away a gateway to a brilliant brewers bullpen but the question is a bullpen can sustain that kind of work ... there were three games but it can't over a seat but Canada receipt a seven game series\nTo encourage and who I highly respect obviously doesn't pay attention to a lot of her as baseball they've been doing this all season long\nThe brewers can hit the ball out of the ballpark but no one in the you know those are better than the Dodgers they had more home runs than any Dodgers team in history when twenty three straight games with at least one home run tying a team record and had to seven players were twenty or more homeruns this I Believe because we talked about this because there are bats had been\nRelatively quiet right now the Dodgers are are relentless with that power they can lead off with a dang or they have a number eight hitter who can also go deeper at any time and they have great depth that allows them at times to match up with the moved ... an end quote the mix\nOr the Dodgers aren't interesting group of kids veterans holdovers newcomers which dog that's what the brewers are as well and then once you gave me the division series against the Braves all six Dodgers runs were driven by players not on the opening day rosters since then they have acquired among others many Machado and Brian ...\nWho have been a the world's been to the world series and they're free agents after the season they also acquired David Freese what we know who's to run single game for against Atlanta was another big postseason hitting his career\nThey also go a ... and discuss the you know numerous other players but basically because they added players who have experience which the brewers due to\nAh the one reason why courage and says you can be completely wrong has written about just hot they're really good book on a spectacular to eat or a sister started September as one point eight nine which is almost run lower than any other team in major league baseball\nManager Craig council energy every game knowing that if you can get your ... court can able Josh eight or ... percent of the game he likely is going to win the last four innings plus the brewers led by BP and waiting Christian\nScore run their infield defenses terrific especially with Johnson Johnson scope is gonna play second against the left these cruise shop or ruin hill\nAnd time to acknowledge the council or the council factories real he wanted to championship brings the player and has a great touch for in fuel for his players which is crucial today he's Milwaukee guy he's trying to take the brewers the world series for the first time since the to the players love them and they play from that wouldn't managing and collecting the were connecting with talent is all about\nSo in other words it comes down to his eyes starting pitching\nAnd the fact that the brewers have a little more small ball at on even though they can't hit home runs and the Dodgers getting hit home runs at any point in time but if pitching in the last as he puts it the last five innings a ballgame or any indication that means the Dodgers have to score all their runs in the first four innings because at that point in time that that bullpen can shut them down\nThe brewers over on the other hand can get to starting pitching continue to win throughout the day so I\nLike I said everybody was just starting pitching and they keep it it's almost like people are living in denial at this point while they don't have starting pitching they're not going to win well it's a gimmick they're not going to win well here they are in the in the house and everybody's been seen it all season long to go to art listening to us in Milwaukee are walking in the program and what's going on\nHere we have been saying it off a long and I think the bank to pay for this area is going on again Clayton courage crucial because as far as point was that ... has put his postseason and what was behind them\nWell that was on a game that you just throw but if we can set the tone and jump on Clayton Kurdish off now you've taken on four and seven which we\nCould potentially sake like her show and and you all of a sudden those policies and what was right to the forefront again with a big performance in game one or is being I'm at home the last time out I'm Joe I think you're right on it with your your ...\nComes in because of their left handed bats\nRight they've got a Ballenger months they they've got ground ours a switch hitter they've got Jack Peterson you got to have another left and there but that won't go Santana it'd be a part of the equation that guy's been nothing short us and say you know\nWhat all he has died I mean he's got to be on your author so it's yeah it's ... the one thing about scope\nAnd it's it's unfortunate straight guy we haven't seen them catch fire at all it's been\nIt's been as bad as does your by the way there was one eighty for a doctor since he got there but hey buddy or their Machado any hope that if he catches fire is going to be against the body that might give them some motivation so\nI think my gut tells me I Do is go but I Can't argue with the manager either way or whatever it is as you know makes yep\nNo doubt appreciated art judge you assume buddy eight five five eight three zero eight six forty five five eight three zero\nEight six for aid or this is from mark who says I read the same article this morning I Can't believe Tim ... basing it all up on starting pitching well he he didn't they should all upon starting pitching you basically said look they've got great starting pitching\nTheir bullpen really doesn't compare to what the ... so the starting pitching ... goes towards the LA the bullpen goes towards the brewers the power numbers go towards the LA for the number of home runs they can hit\nA the fact that the brewers have more hits in in baseball in the postseason you can give them a nod but with runners in scoring position throughout the season they haven't been good although in the postseason they'd been much much better\nAnd then when you get to the back into the game the brewers can continue score runs because for the most part between the naval between ... between Jeffers you know between hater they have been lights out you know the only person who's been scored upon as you hear me Jeffries everything else has been ... shutdown lock the door honey I Can't even find the keys you got to the Bush did to get in the house ain't happening\nSo if you can get through five innings with whomever it is you're going to use\nUh your your chances of winning a ball game are are serious eight five five eighty three zero eight six or eight of the cage and wants to hell's kitchen how're you doing man what's up\nI'm doing well Bill thanks for taking the call bill I think this series is going to be an enormous\nDisappointment for a major league baseball if the brewers when as well as the sponsors and the networks [noise] um they are totally planning to have the Dodgers are in the world series against either you're sitting in Boston I mean that this would be\nA a colossal things of a disappointment for for baseball right now especially the way that the other series of gone in terms of them being as news first and I mean close\nOr some of the games are gonna blow out um you know you've got to sweep probably the brewers so and so forth in terms of uh who I think might be on the roster if you look at a case and assumes\nA E. R. A. against the Dodgers are ... put it this way pro Sparky computer him pull up yesterday or the affiliate are one of five points on this and the big show\nI think he's going to be on a back there you know I think it probably will be so Danielle I think the odd man out could possibly be rock scene because they're going to mean for the gap possibly ah with stole a staying in the infield bill\nSimon first year that he dropped off you get on board I look at it this way going back to his point were major league baseball ... be disappointed the money markets in Boston in LA\nYeah when I think just I think I don't think the ratings are going to reflected but I think it's good for baseball if the brewers are there\nDoesn't matter if it's used in or if it's Boston I'm sure they won't want to yeah I mean I'm not one of the I'm sure they'd want Boston over the other because Boston as such a Big East coast baseball markets you got the Yankees fans hating on Boston wanting the brewers do when you're going to get every Yankees fan in the country to come out of the woodwork to watch the series to say okay let's see if Milwaukee can\nThe part of the reason why we made the traders because we thought Travis could do it um but we didn't have any game experience to go on Travis says you know basically through is play um proven to me and to us that he he can do it and that is that he can succeed and be good at it\nFrom our end it's it's made it easier to to instead of kind of moving those guys around and making them both\nBoth uncomfortable and switching back and forth positions [noise]\nYou know we asked Travis to do a lot when we asked them to move to second base and I think it's he's played a little third base but but probably you know pretty limited surveys uh since that time and and\nThat way you can devote says practice time and and as energy to to just thinking about all the plays at second base he's ... he's probably play more first base you know really since uh\nSince that that the trade so sometimes you you you know you make you make a move and you're not exactly sure how it's going to play out I'm In this case played out where we you know we just travels at second largely um and kept most of the third and worked out well I think\nAlso he says that ah you know his favorite to yell at each performance when you start to talk about things that have you know transpired over the season you start to look back at what is going on and he said hey obviously for six for six in the cycle against the reds\nThat still point to the the game and Cincinnati where he did it for the cycle undergo sex for sex but but it was because of just the nature just wherever you were at in the season to me I'm a we had lost the first game of that Syria's we\nWe were winning series at the time but we we were it didn't feel like we are getting momentum and and I feel I really feel like that was a you know you can always circle one game but I feel like that was a game that\nUm and that that was a series as much as anything located at the at the pet sitting home for the next day and that was a series that you know where with a team we toughened up\nYou know as a team um that was an improbable game that we want in Cincinnati to me it felt like kind of started that said it was happening uh we were we were winning series before but we didn't ... didn't feel like that um [noise] you know we didn't have the groove Ronan and didn't feel like we were wrong and I felt like that game was kind of the game that\nPut us really on a on a really nice role\nThere you go that's Craig council chatting with the media yesterday a kind of giving his two cents as they get ready for the you know see Ashton everything's now at the podium used to be you could do the ... in the dugout now everything's at the podium everything's\nIn the media auditorium inside Miller Park and it's it's the the attention is ratcheting up so getting ready for a postseason baseball deep into the postseason baseball in the house he has coming up tomorrow there's parts of the program brought to my new my medical treaty guys with ET all over the state of Wisconsin\nThey have a location in Green Bay have location Milwaukee's well if you are ah suffering you don't have to any longer they have a Ninety eight percent success rate all you got to do is call\nFor one for four or five five for four or five one\nAlso there's the all in one weight loss program which has been wildly successful and in addition to that they have the low T treatments go looking for more energy better mental clarity better mood better stamina that can help you out there to call\nFor one for four or five five four for five one that's for one for four or five five four for five\nThat's new medical center and all you gotta do is give them a shop\nI got some emails to get to a real quick this is from mighty mighty writes a hey guys I'm confident the Green Bay Packers are going to get a window on Monday Night and I'm confident the brewers are going to win the and I'll see as in six games I think the brewers pitching staff is going to be the difference it's going to show the rest of the world that you don't have to have dominance starting pitching\nTo win deep into the post season and I believe that is going to be Boston and Milwaukee and the brewers fall to Boston unfortunately in six games Boston Red Sox are just that good of a team I don't think anybody can beat the I I think using it'd be\nUsing it would be I really do\nI think he used to be the stronger team even though the better numbers came out of Boston I think you might be a stronger team but ah I just look\nTo get through this round I'm not worried about predicting the winner of the world series at this point as far as that goes on caring about right now is when the brewers can knock off the Dodgers and and get back to the post season for the second time in franchise history and not since Nineteen eighty two obviously would they have done that paid five five eight three zero eight six four eighty five\nSix forty Brian says I wouldn't be surprised if Granderson left off it's either ... for me how we talked about that a little while ago that uh as far as changing the rosters who may be the odd man out if indeed they decided to take an additional picture a for instance after winning a living in rural I said don't change much Canaan Aguilar have to start hitting though um\nThis one is from a Santos says it drops in town and it's a Daniel going in the Bronx into man LA's huge outfield late in ball games in LA uh this one is from a Steve's as exchanged ... for ...\nThis was from Chico who says I Would drop Braxton and bringing ... pretty much the same thing a lot of the same theme running through out\nI was curious to see what Curtis Granderson split surrogates Dodgers pictures of his career\nOr he is Seventeen of fifty eight to Ninety three average three fifty nine on base six Twenty one slugging for a grand total and nine eighty or PS for Curtis Granderson against Dodgers pictures to get five home runs six R B eyes\nI Would keep him in there and those are the numbers that he continually ah continually throws up that's that's that's what I Would keep it now I don't\nExpect Curtis Granderson to be starting against Clinton ... Shaw a and his numbers against Kurdish are not that good he is betting a buck Seventy six and again this is a ... type deal but there's no way Curtis Granderson but starting in ... but those numbers are not good\nYou know pay five five eight three zero eight six for a a switch from Chuck\nA church says I'm looking forward to the series I still think the Dodgers are the better team but the brewers are writing some kind of magic right now and I hope it consists\nOf many wins and Miller Park and the fans by in income out in full force\nMiller Park she'd be a place to people fear to play let's show the rest of the world how loud we can get the last time the world saw us yes we were cheering on our ... against the cubs but the cubs fans that infiltrated here and we somewhat get embarrassed lead full let's show up in full force and support\nThe brokers there you go eight five five eight three zero eight six four and a lot of breweries talk a lot of animals see I saw a lot of baseball talked for that matter more than ... more of the bill Michael show right after this\nBill Michael sports talk of the\nMatter you experience matters\nAnd wherever you are in Wisconsin his help for all sexual assault survivors and their families\nGo to buy your side W.

cannot understand where it is coming from other than wearing the green gold glasses I think James Jones is just trying to kiss up because Aaron Rogers was going to give him the story first\nOn the new contract but are a hundred and Seventy million dollar man is playing like just an average quarterback and should only be making maybe a million bucks a year now that now boom and that's just\nCome on come on\nNow you're getting crazy on me okay there's a lot of thing you you know I was kind of with you there for a minute and not just getting crazy on don't get crazy like Aaron Rodgers worth a lot more than\nA uh [noise] what is this a only if they fire McCarthy in the interim coaches then Aaron Rodgers\n[laughter] [noise] oh I should watch the rights and the way these email inbox ... see he\nSays at what point do they get rid of Mike mccarthy I think he has run its course in Green Bay if they make a change now they can salvage the seas and if they stick with him this is going to be a long slow found during like a ship slowly going to the\nBottom of the ocean here's my question does all of this change if all of a sudden they do turn it around let's just say they knock off San Francisco they get to by week they sell scout and then it all changes they come out and everything starts to click\nDo does then all the McCarthy firing taco al just asking I'm not saying it's right or wrong I'm just simply I'm just simply asking the question or do you only show up the fire McCarthy when there's a loss\nEight five five eighty three zero eight six for eight I'm Jeff says an average quarterback would have been out for weeks given the injury\nMe with a with Rogers\nI'm maybe I mean I don't I don't know I don't know what every quarterbacks threshold a pain threshold is it's to whatever they can withstand don't forget Aaron Rodgers has a lot of weight on the shoulders because\nYou know he's been banged up in his career obviously but he's also following a guy that was the Iron Man of football and Aaron Rodgers knows that\nHe knows that there's a lot of things he does better the quote anti far that's the reason Aaron Rodgers still hold press conferences as locker\nBecause far used to do it at the podium every Wednesday we always have to sit around and wait for bread and then you know you'd ask Brad one or two questions and then he asked himself like ten questions along the way and certainly the press conference was over and they didn't want to do that he wanted to be one of the guys he didn't want to seem like he was putting on airs so he does he got his locker\nYou know I mean there's some things about bread that he he does the opposite and but when it comes to playing he knows he knows there's always going to be that comparison and into he also knows that until he gets a second Super Bowl or at least gets back to a second super all he's always going to be considered a less of a quarterback\nAnd puts up a big number that that could really go a long way\nForty ... touchstones to boot she has room some ill advised parents whose but his quarterback renting has not been bad oh he's just under a thousand yards we're talking about who's play 'cause he's done a couple of all we wanted to go back to a game against BYU and you're going to scratch your head but he has not been\nThe total bad decision maker that we kind of saw last year he's been better\n[laughter] yeah I think he had you know then the BYU interception was was really bad it was a it was a really poor decision and that really kind of turn that game or out it was a you know why he was able to turn that into a touchdown that gave them to lead the third quarter and and kind of gave them a lot of momentum so I but I think outside of that\nHe's been really good like you said two interceptions in in five games days on pace for\nUm way less than that number than he had last year and a you know I I think he's been really efficient so far you know I think he's a he's complacent percentages up a little bit and uh you know used to I think you still want maybe it to him and and the badgers passing game and as a whole kind of find some more explosive\nThey really haven't had that since the first couple of games this season um they had another find those um those he passes down field and you know point as he is being not being there you know does doesn't help things obviously but but I think they're going to want to try to at some point\nOpen things have to try to try to at least use the ... game to to hit some shot down the aisle but I think outside of that take against BYU on your books at least been I'm really efficient this year and a guy that hasn't hasn't brought a lot of interceptions\nI'm Glad you mentioned seafood and I know it's not football related to this Michigan game but just give me your thoughts on what's going on out there with with seafood the investigation him now suing the school of for your rights violations or give me your thoughts on what's going on there\n[noise] yeah it's a you know it's it's kind of a strange situation he um within suing the university uh at this point that he's a you know the ... I guess the strange thing about it as you know he's with his suspension he's still kind of allowed to\nUh to use Wisconsin's facilities he just can't deal with the team and be partying activities though I've actually seen him\nYou know around the facilities and he was catching balls and an acclaimed center or the other day um and yet he's a he's a you know to any university for I'm kind of the uh the investigation into into what he did so it is kind of a strange situation heeded plead\nNot guilty to his criminal charges earlier today\nI'm so that looks like that's um it looks like that that to the trial is is going to be a long drawn out process and so we're not going to hit resolution on that for a long time um what happens with ... with him taking action against the university is going to be relation to see how that plays out\nI haven't really seen anything like that before I'm not sure if there's a precedent or not ah but I I guess it's just something that kind of wait and see on\nNo one's going to see is there something because I don't know specifically how does how this works I understand legally where they're coming from how can you conduct an investigation and participate in it with the university if you are right now\nKind of course from the legal proceeding in your attorney doesn't want you talking\nHow can they proceed with the investigation into you know what I mean it's it's yeah you can't going in any way shape or form incriminate yourself or give out details to the university because all pertains to a criminal case university can't complete their cage without knowing the details so they basically say silences deadly\nAnd therefore you know we're going to go ahead and continue this kind of interferes with the other doesn't it\nYeah I I I I think it does kind of makes sense what what saved his lawyers are are doing here a while when you really look at it that way and it's um like I said I haven't really heard of a situation like this happening before but it but but\nWhat they're arguing here does does make a lot of sense like you just laid out so I'm a they've got a mission to see how that plays out 'cause I I think they have they do have a real case for that and you know I'm\nAgain we'll just I mean I I yeah I like I said there's no precedent for this so I'm not really sure exactly um you know how this is how how this is going to play out but but it's it's really an interesting situation at\nThis point oh time which is you know where the Wisconsin state journal or this is a big game for for both teams in the sense that if they lose\nA specifically Michigan Michigan loses game at home\nOr another blemish on their record and for him you know any hopes of trying to climb through the ranks sitting at number twelve will be pretty much corn should just point and if the badgers would get a road road when like this\nThis could vote them maybe back up near the top ten America that maybe who knows but a huge game for both programs because the loser is doing as far as any ... any shot at all of ever getting back to the final four correct\nYeah that that's kind of the biggest thing I look at this game and you know a lot of people have already counted Wisconsin out of the play offs but until they lose that second game I mean they're not completely out of it I mean if they\nI talked to some of the players this this week about it actually and they they kinda still are under the weather is now you are not there under the belief that they they are capable of winning out and you know when he got Michigan wedding at Penn State and\nAnd the Big Ten championship game and get in getting back into contention for the playoffs so I'm In that and that terms it's it's a really big game for both teams is like you said that the loser is is is pretty much just out of all that conversation and especially for Michigan I think\nUh you know they're there and they have so much competition in the east already that they can't really afford to lose a crossover game like this before they go into their games against the\nYou know the Penn State's in Ohio state's the world so I'm the I I think for them and finishing you know the third and fourth in the last few years and and the Big Ten east they they really got to make sure they get this one at home and I think if you're Wisconsin it does give you the opportunity to\nHaving people are are not expecting it to win this game at this point it gives you the opportunity to to get back in the national conversation and and you know if if if you win this wind you're probably going to go into that Penn State game and the third last game of the year with only one last still and uh you know at that point you you you you're kind of in the picture all that so I ... again yeah like you said huge game for both\nUh for both teams here and and the winter the loser is going to be\nYou know feeling or feeling like they're really out of out of out of it at that

and they're just not kind of living up to expectations\nExpectation was at least hope at the end of the tunnel for San Francisco and like you mentioned it all kind of goes awry what other talent was around ... below besides grapple\n[noise] [noise] well and that's a question that I think everyone is looking at and reexamining right now because\nJarrett McKinnon was signed to do an awful lot and then he went down before you're even started on the final practice a before you know they they they really got underway\nAnd that was something we tried to to diminish we try to pretend it wasn't a big deal you can't really miss what you'd never had to begin with and um I think we were wrong about that I think right there when half the playbook and met breed has done a very good job filling in\nBut this team needs more weapons than it has marked east Goodwin who was a great story last year turned into a little bit more of a track athlete off injured this year he hasn't made an impact at all [noise]\nNPR song is he's got more cute little accents on his name played than he has touchdowns in a forty niner uniform bill he is not more to touch down since\nHe signed the deal is paid in twenty three million dollars over the last two seasons so um they just don't have really the horses in the barn and and you'll see right now and it might have even been reality with gr rap although there are two best\nTo best play makers or a tight end and a fall back and they still actually they've done a great job moving the ball Kyle Shanahan can draw 'em up but they don't have the horses to run the race and their jockey Jimmy ... below a key piece as soon as he went missing I mean that's enough to think just about any NFL\nTeam how good in your opinion was ... going to be ... when he comes back\n\nThe five games that he played last year it felt like the savior might have shown up in town and then of course he got paid like he had already won\nSuper Bowls on his own\nAnd honestly the beginning of this season was not impressed that he was also up against it ah in Minnesota open the season which is obviously a tough place to go play um he was not ultra impressive at home against the Detroit Lions and he was not alter impressive as they were getting their\nTeeth kicked in by the chains before he went down with that fourth quarter ACL\nI don't want to save it just a few small handful of game should change your mind about someone who I think a lot of smart football people feel has got the good to be a franchise quarterback and I do too I mean he he\nPasses the test and in so many ways but he goes down in a moment where he was not exactly it inspiring the masses and the real problem is here bill is\nThe the anticipation of eventually wears off and you want something like we had been waiting for the build up to ... below year one what was he looked like in sixteen games\nIs still going to be a question for him and that's a question everyone needed answered this year so it's very unfortunate\nThe uh did kind of spread out their draft choices they win both on the bench and defensive wasn't heavy to one side of the other they pick jumped on tape pet is gimme gimme your thoughts on his progression thus far\nAll Dante Pettis is officially I Believe well I don't know if he's been ruled out but he was last week and he flashed he flashed early normally the niners don't get anything for more\nRookie wide receivers and that is his first cast was a touchdown he's got beat on speed he set the NC double a punt kick return record I think they're missing him on special teams right now\nHe seemed like he was about to to be a contributor there but if you're hurt you know a availability is the best ability you know I'm not really interested in anyone's strength and weaknesses who can't get out there right now I Will say about the rookie class it looks like they got a real one in uh in in ...\nWhen she he is the real deal over there a tackle I think Fred Warner the working linebacker from BYU who had to fill in for the suspended Ruben foster and the first two weeks did good they're looked good and it's going to have a bright career but\nThat gives up an awful lot of yards I mean it's a tough time to be a defensive coordinator in football and Robert salad looks like a newbie under new rules and it's a little confused I expect Aaron Rodgers to give Neal what for this Sunday I really do or Monday Night excuse me but\nI you know Richard Sherman has been fantastic when he's been out there that's the best thing I can say about the forty niners defense the forest partner has flash do little\nThey're still holes everywhere though there really are and and solemn and Thomas might be a massive bus for a guy who was the third picking the draft\nHe's there um I I guess my question is because we didn't think that they were going to be a Super Bowl can turn to this year but how much light at the end of the total for the organization\n[noise] well it it it depends on if you want to look at it in a positive way or a negative way positively you could say look I think they got the right gee and the right coach an owner that's going to stay out of the way for the first time in a long time [noise]\nAh yeah I think they they got a good quarterback but he's coming off an ACL and their new running back to what he's going to be coming off an ACL\nAnd you know a wreck right there is a little nervous that your future is now based on two huge ACL repairs I Know the titles things together like shoelaces like\nBut it's it's a little concerning to put all your stock in that and and what's really scary and disappointing about this year is that there is no lever left to poll like you've made the hires no one's getting fired year or two six year deals everyone understands what happened\nAnd there is no player to add you've already done that the next thing the forty niners have to really look forward to\nIs the draft and that is not what anyone signed up for this year which was supposed to be at least the first interesting and competitive year for the first time in a long time and it looks like this team's going to be picking you know and the top\nTen top five in the NFL Draft\nAnd certainly not alone in San Francisco forty niners fans wanted how they are is there is there a reality to this or how they begin to abandon ship and wait until next year\nWell I I I mean team's never give up coaches\nNever stop scheming if you're asking about bans I think fans are pretty darned depressed I'll tell you it was a huge blow to see the NFL already\nI don't know if the the forty niners might have set a record for the earliest a team has ever been flexed off a primetime game weeks seven they have been moved out for ... homes against the Cincinnati Bengals you know she said the talk of the league and so the forty\nNiners who at Grand designed for their their game against the rams I mean didn't the\nMedia market wasn't at the end all\nBe all of the NFL's media needs and wants but they just flex the rams offer a Sunday Night Football game and what's really sad and you know you'll understand this covering the Packers how much history means to this team\nThat was going to be Dwight Clark day that was going to be a big prime time hug around the passing and memory of Dwight Clark a huge statue was to be unveiled in that game a big charity that was near and dear to Dwight Clark heart\nWas going to be given a huge amount of exposure and all of that just got flex two oh one twenty five afternoon check on\nCBS and that is just I think emblematic of what this season was supposed to be and what we really got\nYeah it's a I Would be a little bit to find new people here in the press and they haven't even gonna start they want and there's still a lot of optimism so I can only imagine what it's like right now in San Francisco I didn't want to touch base with ... and just say hey\nWhen it comes to the Golden State warriors I Know optimism reigned Supreme right now give me your thoughts LeBron's out in the west a lot of competition in the west right now give me your question ounces of what the the Golden State where he was going to have\nThey are still the team to be they might have a question that center into book cousins shows up for goodness sake that it's an embarrassment of riches\nUh the last time he saw the buccaneers secondary um last time we saw them Mr Burris had thrown just throwing per se touchdown passes as a reminder of how bad the Tampa Bay secondary as a Ryan's receivers uh Ridley Jones mom it's a new all have incredibly strong match up\nAgainst those buses quarterbacks remember they're they're they put two quarterbacks and I are earlier this jerk Brent Grimes rookies a column Davison empty Stewart or starting it it's just an opportunity to face for Matt Ryan my number one quarterback of the week [noise]\nGo to Nick listening to us in Milwaukee Nick welcome to the program you got a question for both George you\nNeed a to a climate time for a Miller [noise]\nYup Miller's out in any strong is not good for starters and just playing a little thing up and goes up against a decent ... going to throw him out of court comment gets a giant it's a lot easier to run on the giants than it is a path\nA giants adjust roasted two weeks ago by Alvin Camaro for almost two hundred all purpose yards from the kind of accent really hurt the giants are your dual threats run receiver types\nCome on and so we're going to try him to not even that match up\nThere you go let's go to Mike listening to some kind of more Mike you got a court Superbowl George ...\nCornerback [noise]\nUh I I I like both has been over five in my number eight quarterback this week but\nLet's go to number five and we all now talked about all all of my top five quarterback for the week with Andy Dalton I'm aside from the super ... Jones last week of posing number one receivers are destroying the Steelers that brings aged green into the fold here last\nYear when the bagels often a struggle throughout all of last year was still great in this choice match up with multiple touchdowns folk games in ... I Love it love Andy Dalton hearing what should be a very high scoring game of Pittsburgh\nGoing here for Twitter and this comes from ... says Aaron Jones or Lamar Smith\nLamar Smith who had Lamar Smith air ... well let's talk here in Georgia for a second I thought I thought last week was going to be our break out game ... what do you make of that\nI think they need to use the more I mean the bottom line is when they go to throwing the football they don't trust them even though they say is the three down back they don't trust them because they put in Montgomery Benjamin Williams time will tell me more often than not to pick up blitz is\nSo to me they just don't trust him and parenting situations yet but he's clearly the best running back they have\nIt's not close I mean you know sooner or later you do need to have your most productive back on the field and I understand passed protection tops you know I was for a lot and nobody wants to the hair Rogers get hurt but sooner or later you need to run back to your best running back on the field the guy's average it's literally double the yard or touch\nOf William So I I Know what I'm doing I'm dumb making that case and now I I Do like McCarthy show it so I I'm not sure who this middle aisle Lamar I forget the other but I just forget about\nLamar Smith but I'm I'm scratching my head like missing something here or what\nI don't know who the I don't know who the Martin Smith is but man I Will probably take somebody else over here and Joe McCarthy gives them to play he deserves\nA this one or let's do this let's go back to the phone call started to Cairo was reduced in terms of the car you doing [noise]\nI got a Heinz [noise]\nNice he Hines is the guy whose name is come up a couple of times here and he's turned in the path catching specialist for the call me turned into a ... a really good contributor and there should be opportunities for place against the jets is they've allowed a league high seven rounds of twenty or more yards and take a decent opportunity\nHere against the jets if you give up plenty of catches receiving back\nThe only thing that sort of stuff that works here as in Indianapolis presume starter Marlin Mac is going to come back and that should take some of the work away from him hives but I still think they still ... a as a as a half catching option for fantasy on you know what I Wonder if it means more Miller\nThere may be and we don't like Lamar Miller okay I'll were drawn Aaron Jones I go there and Jones a thirty five they got Lamar Miller thirty nine\nBecause I'm trying to think of running back name Omar and the only one I can think of all time I had more military to use to\nCut off my that's all I got to know other Mars of note racking my brain here where you go and buy the why why why do we want to start that guy he's a lawful\nYes go a lot [laughter]\nA camera in brain your Kyle Rudolph [noise]\nUh I like a camera break the angle on camera and great although my answer is going to be powered up but my camera angle camera and break is Winston boroughs go about why and OJ our still isn't healthy he scored fourteen touched down in his last twenty six games of famous Winston under center and so it's kind of guy\nTop but I like this matchup was coward awful lot he's kind of bypassed us imports straight games and the cardinals have given a big game to Jordan or even trade burden and and George Kendall so uh I like ... quite a bit this week and so I Would pick a pile golf\nGot one more year and a half point PBR mixing or genes white [noise]\nWell I like both but mixing gets does everything James what's your path catching specialist with the patriots and you're sitting on a very big damons my number nine running back but\nJoe makes it especially the geo Bernard out he's got to get all the work and the Steelers have allowed um dealers have allowed a ton of receptions two running backs and it's a good opportunity for him toms and their middle to pack their fifteenth and Russian yards allowed but you know mix in belle ... back\nAnd I I think it's a great opportunity for my number five running back this was\nAlways go to the judge I Know you're going to run but things were always charging and we will try it again next week my friend\nAnd you know what it is right now you guys should be talking brewers most of the time so we don't that's okay we'll catch up\nHere you know when I was thinking too I was talking a buddy of mine yesterday and we started talking about now I Know the Minnesota\nPaul modern everything and I just did you guys get
