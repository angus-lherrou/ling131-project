Lowery is played better where the hell is Monterey Bay is Adams\nThe guy that was supposed to be the next morning sap milk carton good God\nSo they got some issues to fix but\nThey're on the right track\nPaid five five eight three zero eight six forty but the bottom line with an odd things that is loaded\nAnd don't make excuses there loaded\nMore ... about a scandal and the real deal Toronto Alice in the real deal divides ... Adams the real deal ... St brown is a hell of a crossover guy he's the guy goes across he's a rich man's Donald Driver stacked right now I saw drought um all had the one catch yesterday for fourteen hours or whatever that was his only target of the day\nI mean they're that they're receiver right but that that's my point ... ... ... where the hell is Jimmy Graham\nThe only two or three times they look right out of yesterday he's wide open shore to having an antenna tower hanging off of his head saying can you please find me they don't even look at him one catch for targets so that seemed like Rogers is getting a little frustrated if you watch his body language with Jimmy\nThough he's running his routes I felt like I think that that that might play into it a little bit though I I agree with you mhm but I I just I look at all this and I'm like there's a lot of opportunity for the first time in a long time you really do have a decent one two punch in Iran game\nYou really do and you had your full complement of all kinds of lemon now\nByron Bell was a guy that wasn't even going to be a starter at the beginning of the season and all of a sudden he's worked himself into it whether he worked himself into it or a McCray ended up just kind of losing the job you you know take your pick but\nYou're talking about an area that was an area of weakness going into the season and seems to at least solidified itself but still seems to be ... is the real deal we know about your he's one of the best left love tackles and all the football\nYes ... is aging but he held his own yesterday but it it sometimes it comes up to God and usually on that side where Byron Bell is if you're going to talk about pressure\nBut for the first time you've got a full complement of uh of players offensively there's no reason for this thing to be stagnant which is my point people get well how can you say that easily\nTell me and area of weakness\nOkay you can talk about the right guard position\nBut otherwise they when when they get into a rhythm and what they do a quick outs and they do quick or a ... inside slants across the middle of quick hitters up the guy you know everybody talked about that was the other thing to play call for the safety vouchers you run the ball or are you kidding me every time we are talking about a third in short\nThey go deep everybody says why aren't you running the ball yeah they stack the box but isn't that where you're off its of wind supposed to play it's best\n[laughter] it just it they didn't\nYou know so in other words do you want Aaron Rodgers running for his life and the end zone and and people are gonna be saying what are you doing throwing a football how stupid is that you've been running at well all day and they did\nThere was no situation unless they got it out of there and either booted it away or scored that anybody was gonna give credit to Mike mccarthy your Aaron Rodgers or anybody in that particular situation now\nThis is an officer supposed to be that good and they gave up a safety and that's that's almost simple but calling the time out by Mike mccarthy on that third downplay late in the first half\nThem to go down and score saving time for them to score and then turning around you get to safety they get the ball back it changed the momentum and that game\nHe slowed that that was his fault that was a miscalculation by Mike mccarthy should have never done it\nShould have just let it go he was trying to get a little greedy that maybe we can get the ball back I can get in the hands of my quarterback will go ahead and get a score I'll get another school and he's trying to flip the table I understand the methodology but at that point in time you're on the road against the best team in the national football league sometimes it's a bird and the hand and you have to realize that\nPaid five five eight three zero eight six for eight oh let's go to Jay Jay in West Alice Katie how you doing man was going on\nWhat's going on thanks for taking the call sure what's happening\nIt's been a systemic problem uh with the Packers and I mean the special teams says twenty four king and even before then I'm it continues to be a problem you have to be strong at an all pages of the game and this goes to\nI'm an interesting article by Michael Silber in case you haven't read it yet on NFL dot com he goes on to say standing on the opposite sign language Aaron Rodgers quarterback or he wants to idolize talking about to Jared golf\nAnd not wanting to put the ball back in Aaron Rodgers Hans ... said it was scary as he celebrated with friends and family said all our work on the fence was done and the ball was going to be in his hands I put on my hat and so I'd have to show now and it wasn't a very good feeling and then obviously time ... brings the ball back\nAlmost it away and the rest is history the recovery provoke a loud cheers from about half of the Seventy five thousand eight hundred and twenty two fans\nAnd a gas groans from the other half which the Packers fan's travel extremely well as we all know which by the way Packers fans kudos to you because you you rock that place yesterday a quote Aaron was hot\nAnd he had a right to be here I'll take eight blanking me he was very very mad according to one Packers coach and the eyes of many Rogers teammates his eye or was justifiable according to more than a half a dozen Packers players and coaches who witnessed it Montgomery had thrown a tantrum\nOn the sideline after the previous offensive series becoming noticeably enraged on the sideline after being removed from the game at least one player believe that there was a carry over from that incident to Montgomery decision to disregard disregard his coaches instruction and return to kick off they took 'em out\nThere's a quote now for a play and he slammed his helmet and threw a fit one player said then before the kickoff they told him to take a knee and he rented out anyway you know what that was that was him saying I'm going to do me it's a blinking F word joke\nI mean what the ... are you doing when you've got Aaron Rodgers the best I've ever seen and you're going to take that risk I mean it's twelve all you got to do is give them the ball and you know what's gonna happen Rogers trademark magic\nHad bail out the Packers and their previous game at thirty three thirty victory over the forty niners don't forget what he did against Chicago Bears beating the rams would have been a different level of epic yet despite holding a ten nothing lead until the final three minutes of the first half\nAnd the spider Rogers led come back from a ten point deficit that put Green Bay up twenty seven twenty six on his forty yard touchdown pass the rookie wide receiver mark was about a scant link a they had opportunities\nA familiar story for those who believe that the franchise has squander it a shot at multiple championships during Rogers era as he actually did the tunnel outside the coliseum in the locker rooms and walk towards the team bus Sunday Rogers a didn't shy away from the notion that a lack of aggressiveness\nHad come back to burn the Packers are defense was playing really well in stopping them over and over again we've got to get more than ten points while that's happening and then to have it and the way it did obviously it's frustrating\nNow there's nothing there in that statement that would say Roger's pointing the finger at anybody other than the office needs to do its job by the way\nI'm then it goes on to say uh that hurt is the game was a bunch of little bull blank that built up and caught up to us in the end and Montgomery decision to return to kick I don't even know what the that was I'm Still in shock\nSo a lot there a lot there to chew on a five five\nEight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero\nEight six for eight if you want to chime in feel free to do so it was fortunate programmed by the way being brought to about good friends with cousin subs cousins jobs encouraging you that you could win a pair of tickets to go see new battle for Paul bunny and acts which may be

bridge today I don't blame 'em but I question um it wasn't my again veteran white that is the find out that much I'm a ...\nOh man if he launched a if a budget players were speaking out I Would say yes but you only hear\nOne guy only has a difference in philosophy with McCarthy now granted it's very important guy and Aaron Rodgers most of the time ah but you don't hear guys coming out and ripping McCarthy what you look at all a bunch of little things\nAnd you start to say okay one thing here or there and no big deal isolated when you start to stack up things then you kind of wonder but but see I'm not in that lock room and I don't you don't hear guys coming over and going man between you and me McCarthy socks are we just don't listen to a guy named nobody says that\nThat's a point but it and does time a government have to do at this time not as overreaction but as this time I'm In charge and we will not tolerate\nBorn including himself that's a great question and here's here's my answer this appreciate the phone call McCarthy had a chance to torches guy in public\nIf indeed everything laid out the way the Mike Silver article reads he had a chance to torture Mike has always\nAlways except for the ... a case of ... obviously getting heavy has always\nKind of taking the flack for his guys when Aaron Rodgers has questioned the play calling Mike mccarthy just basically says he's a competitor when he talks about time a government well you know the plan was never said we told him he said the plan was taking the turn of all over the air and\nYou know and then he goes on to say you know hey look ties you trying to make a play\n... even if he is mad at him Mike kept this cool and said ties trying to make a play trying to give his guy some credit to say look players want the ball in their hands they want to go out and make plays and try to do something great for their team\nSo even in that case you get a chance to torture many didn't that goes a long way in a locker room knowing the coach will always have your back\nI mean they stuck with Beijing Crosby one nation was bad only to turn around the next week and kick the game winner you know what I mean he's guys appreciate that\nNow he can say all this stuff about you know tackling and preparedness and you know we got to do this we got to do that you know and I know it's stuff that people don't want to hear people get aggravated with okay I understand all of that\nBut inside that lock room that kinda stuff goes a long way so to say he lost the team I think is erroneous to say that his message has grown stale because he's been there are so many years that might be a better statement to the veterans but I don't know if that's something that's completely true to the young guy\nEight five five

great great place eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight oh let's get back to the phone call to talk to Doug listening to us in Green Bay Doug welcome to the program and what's happening\nBill what's up or\nThe last caller you hit it pretty much right on the head but I just want to expand on it a little bit a\nBit backers have all in the Packers had Eddie lazy you know a decent power back they were still never able to pick up a puff yard when they needed it I don't know what they were all for eleven or something like that one year and forth and a lot in situations you know it's and it's because that are all black new scheme that song black [laughter]\nThey've they're running their runners successful it it's off the path basically they've never been able to be a power running team ever since he's been here it's based off of deception you know and if you want to blame somebody on that\nAre not being able to get out of the goal line down there why don't you look at number Seventy five he couldn't even get out of it and get over it they blocked that guy and then he got to move on\nFrom the right and I fell over like a bar in the winter storm and you know\nIt's time to replace him they should have been down here is our goal should add somebody here to replace him at least are underway grooming and you wasted and\nYeah I mean do they print it out to me they trade it out to get Jason ... to be the next tackle and it just it never panned out they've him ten times in ... was not great\nAnd finding that the backups I mean he founded by GRE he's the guy that brought in and Brian block and he's the guy that brought in ... so you give them credit but to find the backups in the next it has been it's been a rough go no doubt appreciate the phone call let's go to mark listening to us in on Alaska mark welcome to the program and how things in the western portion of the state\nOf great great great so I think you\nJust want to reiterate that I think the whole problem here starts a oh we've had the pop quarterback or or one of the top three in history as he likes to say\nWe've sort of all I'd say that states that when they start to lose the south because we've been talking about the same thing ever since they want to suffer for why or not they're right into the court is still there\nI'm all for it I Hope I have to pay the fair Cleveland or Pittsburgh oh what that was\nHigh bridges are there you go he wants McCarthy out\nPeople were upset it's not like they haven't had opportunities they've been to a ... in in mind McCarthy's tenure they've been to three and a C. championship games they won one obviously won the super bowl or the game in Seattle will home haunt them until they go back there will haunt them until they go back now\nThe other energy championship games with far everybody wants to say that we've only one to ... and went to two Super Bowls which I Love the term we 'cause nobody else was playing right so\nAnd talks to us\nA seat that actually happens so we'll we'll look forward to it should be an interesting night at seven in the sky for the for the logical or kick off oh let's get back to the phone calls kind of breaking his one down and go to Sam listening to us in West bend seeing how you doing man what's going on\nThere well Bill thanks you know I just wanted to take a couple of things about what car [laughter] you know I you know everything you said it's true bill but\nWhat when you add that play in the end zone I before it even started I said to my friend and he says he's not going to run death in the heat and could create a dislike because you know we're not talking about it you kind of line that second rate I mean this arguably may be the best in football\nI maybe I you know I think there'd be a lot of people could argue that with you\nI mean I I don't care if you had a bulldozer into back\nIn the backfield bill I don't think you're going to move that the country why they smell blood they they at exactly what they want it they were painting barriers back and they were coming at you I mean you know\nGot to take a step back for like ... out some get off that line and I know well that's what they were trying to do like never up the middle [laughter] well I don't care if you were brought back Jim Brown you wouldn't go in a mall that line\nAnd I know one of the caller said well the office of fine you know if a lot of that that the following day off after ... well yesterday against those guys and ...\nLike you're not gonna move them for an ... that that live in that situation so I put that clearly on the car you don't get it it's never going to work that it got to work and number two\nI I mean I Know what he said I appreciate what you said about what you just Play Doh with with my family man again and I think you've got to look at the coach waiting because it's got to pull that guy side maybe before it you know that you know he has any question that they got this thing coming out against all they heard the same thing bill is who doesn't that step off after five on the clock\nRight that's a that's a point before the two minute warning that the ... and then you still got a time out I mean I Would bet my I think they'll you know I Would have brought them down there to win that game I I I I don't know I just know that just stick by you\nKnow I I look I completely understand where you're coming from appreciate it was always Sam [noise] um are you very rarely run wide in the end zone\nUsually go up the get go behind your best blockers go beyond you know you you run to like right now you would probably run to the left side of your mind Hugo Corey loosely lane Taylor ... out to David about your ego left side of the line let your horses do the job\nUm and you get yourself a couple of yards to three yards just a little bit of breathing space that's what you're looking to do\nAnd they didn't do it they didn't get it done didn't get it done up front\nHave probably five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six for a if you want to give a shout please feel free to do so a lot of people chime in on Twitter as well and I I Do want to get a lot of the tweets because many of us some of you just angry some of you have a lot of great points um\n[noise] this one's from a Tim jumping or whatever it is that your defending Mike mccarthy like you do with capers do you do this to protect your relationship with contacts in the Packers organization thus allowing you inside or impose a no\nNo\nI I don't get my information from Mike mccarthy and never got my information from dumb papers it's I I'm not defending him I don't know what you're talking about she lives in the ... when you say something like that you want to tweet it that's fine but has some ... and call the program and asked me\nBecause I never I never defended him in the sense that we should keep his job I said there's decisions I don't agree with there's other ones that people just throwing the baby out with a bath water and you're wrong\nYou're flat out wrong and and I look I don't mind if you want to critique a guy overall wins and losses and all that kind of stuff but when you you talk about specific place who's responsible for what look at it I can ask you a specific question and you have to answer the question if you answer the question anything but Mike mccarthy than the questioning your point is moot\nBut to say that I'm protecting some I'm not defending him I'm saying there's been good decisions and bad decisions for people just a blatantly call up and say everything sucks you're overreacting\nYou reacting emotionally\nEight five five eight three zero eight six where you don't want to actually left out one of the honestly championship games by the way they've been for not three yeah so when did you forget the Atlanta yes yeah that's it you know going to forget these\nWatching who is the way home don't forget I mean granted it was Aaron Rodgers in that incredible throated yard cook\nBut it only is it only ... at that point in time when they were underdogs going to Dallas they were under dogs on the road they were under dogs at home they were supposed to lose those games too yeah you know so this is what drives me nuts is the head coach only sucks when you lose Aaron Rodgers is a God when they when\nYou brought up to Seattle game I mean he ... he changed the whole playbook and six days because Rogers couldn't get out of the ... everything out of the pistol\nRogers was about forty percent and I can't remember I had a clear shot to the end of muscle and even the Centers for like man here and our respect today 'cause he had a clear shot at the end zone you had to kind of pull back could barely move I thought that was one of McCarthy's better coaching jobs are in in the second half that game again man I mean they started running the ball\nAnd got too careful because Rogers couldn't really move so what else could you do you had you had a big power back you feed him the ball he tried to milk that clock anyone of us would have made the same mistakes and if you said keep your foot on the gas and get your foot on the federal blah blah blah I\nDon't know it it's tough to say that when you got to to score three score lead in Seattle on the road when you're a double digit underdog heading into that game\n[noise] I ... in in ... when they wanted to Seattle mhm [noise]\nSaid at the time that that for everyone who was mad that was probably his best coaching job yeah by far those ... that was probably best coaching job\nGo back to when they ended up bringing play to the middle after they sell Scott after getting drilled by New Orleans a few years back mhm and he walked the he walked into the dom and said we're putting the best eleven players on the field or done with the rest of this crap\nThat was a terrific move so to say he socks and he's a dummy and the army and all the means and so I I just\nIt it's it's cute you may laugh at it but it just shows your ignorance paid five five eight three zero eight six forty eight by five eight three zero eight six for it gives you shout want to hear from you I'm\nThis was from John who says should there be any concern over the rookie punting on Sunday it seems not as good as normal you damn straight there is\nDamn straight there is\nCompletely completely are concerned you're talking about eighty degrees sunshine and as far as I knew there wasn't really much of a breeze you get a twenty five yards shank apart um is come on JK Scott you're better than that and and they'll go find a new partner if that's the best you can do in those situations\n\nEight five five eight three zero eight six for a let's go to Tim listening to us in for it on your Tim how're you doing today man what's going on\nBilly happy Monday you know I mean I live in the Seattle nightmares here buddy I'm you know there's a number of different situations in\nMontgomery at Stanford education yeah graduate was they didn't use it around that\nSituation and number two bill in that situation there those negative stuff coming out of his own far up the negatives far outweigh the positive what we're sort of do you have to time outs two minute warning\nIn Athens and the you know so you get twenty five ... basically we need thirty five yards and you try and with the worst okay but what we forward bill I'm sitting here with with Philly to um what\nWhat do you deal with Montgomery going forward is famous for them 'cause right now\nIt sounds like the players in the locker room\nOn a case that him to salt water McCarthy in this situation what do you do to rectify this would you buy an order like Billy purposely fight in order from your special coats say hey don't run this out at the end zone what do you do oh I'll hang up and listen and I thought\nMan I'm the question is and we're going to find out\nAh at some point today do the Packers look it does is say in some ordination and they cut them loose\nOr do they have respect for time Montgomery in what he's done in the way he's played her to the way he's kind of changed in more his body over the years for them because of the the lack of the inability of Ted Thompson the consistently draft running backs me covering for Edie Lacey when\nHe ended up eating his way basically out of the league and out of the team and they didn't have anybody else I mean how much how much ... do you give a guy\nTo hang himself or did yesterday did yesterday do that paid five

short situation do you want her on the football but in your own end zone in a short situation to get yourself in your age you don't want her on the football I don't get it\nI think the problem is is just all the access everybody has the statistics now like you know pro football focus you look at that and you say well this could have happened forty three percent of the time but you're not the head coach man you don't get it I I just I it it [noise]\nI [laughter] ties are being what it is you can scream and yell about a lot of things but it just I always say well what would you do and the answer

... by fellow Packer fans and ah [noise]\nAh well the outcome but I I have to say I was impressed by the analogy of a different side\nUm there's some talent out there um I guess my biggest ... points out I read time a couple of hours of fitness bill I Know you're talking to him today he's not a running back never has been running back\nI don't understand why McCarthy forces are out there that rotation he's got trapped he might be a decent path to try to the back yard but\nWe don't really do that so I I don't know what his role was I think his frustration we were behind the bench I saw him showed that held up it was bad before he went up and write a transfer the tech so there there's there's obviously some just shut up very often or side of the ball\nThat has been there for some time but I wanted to say bill I keep hearing and I don't want to be a prisoner of the moment the Packers are three three and one this season\nAnd the way out of the stadium so and they were all you know there are five hundred in the last fifty regular season games and I miss that believe that if I went home and got home last night and\nLooked it up or twenty five twenty four and water over the last fifty regular season games of the news in New England which will be favored to do this Sunday\nFootball five hundred mhm is it a mediocre team right\nThey were you at the highest paid quarterback and no I I think the whole conversation with my partner she is ... whether it was an above average quarterback whether he was hurt our coach a Super Bowl winning coach eight years ago\nThat relevance anymore for mediocre team and you are what you're after you are in the ballpark self for maybe where this year\nWe've been mediocre over the last sixty I I was shocked by that I'm not a I I Know we we can play games with my hot in the playoffs then we'll have you on the road to New Orleans\nWell here's here's the question and you got to remember they also washed their quarterback now granted they shouldn't shouldn't do that but they they did I mean the reality was washed their quarterback\nThose games they did yeah my room was just fine because he told us\nAll that I Know that that was a big giant steaming Pamela do\nWell so bill at some point of the game is not a ... a small sample size anymore what three three in one this year with where it's just more foreign six a couple of years ago before ... started with ... women didn't wear a lot of the games\nIn five years right Bora wow we're supposedly the best quarterback in the game for just about maybe a video camera team\nFrankly nothing to do much better that I've\nSeen them in person in ... I was pleased by that but they often I mean Iran or Cobb wasn't getting any separation yesterday I Love seeing a saint brown Marquez 'cause they can actually does have pushed but\nThe bottom line is how do you argue I guess we watch it when we're doing we haven't been to a Super Bowl seven years once supposedly best quarterback in the day\nWe're what three train one this year we're going to if we lived in New England for five hundred over that time we got Aaron ... party last citizens true there are foreign one when he went out\nIt's I don't know I I think they do I think this is a global contending team no I\nI don't I don't think there are a couple of pieces away a ... I think there are consistent outside pass rush away then you know they're they need somebody else to counter now maybe that's Warren birds and he matures I don't know but they need somebody to counter Blake Martinez\nStill need to fortify the opposition line a little bit better but um you know beyond that I think there are pretty damn good football team I think they've got some talent maybe were fooling ourselves a little bit I don't know but ah I I think it for ... for them to be really really good they need to three pro bowlers on the defensive side of the football\nYeah I I Would say that we played well you shouldn't defensive side of the bar does a underestimate how much are not having Cooper cop out there yesterday played a role in that we always hear about how when the Packers or heard of hackers are hurt Packers we're almost at full strength yesterday they had a week off\nThat was it that was a big game they could have water right there's a lot of there's a lot of head scratching I if I won't go into the safety bill\nBut I don't I think if there are Williams has all of U.S team that what about that [laughter] or Jones or you know I I [noise]\nThere there there's a lot of stuff I mean a special to all of a cheating I don't know it's it's as plate of course we've got a job at the improvement were still three three and one yeah I I don't know\nWhat it is then that's the other thing I appreciate the phone call I mean that's the other thing I think of it this way people people talk so much about Well Don capers how much better as the defense without dumb papers\nHe's at the personnel and getting your Alexander Kevin king remaining healthy trauma Williams and the knowledge coming back or is it might have been\n\nThrown out there how much better than effect\nBecause it'd be the old adage it'd be careful what you wish for I look I I'm not saying that the um\nI'm not saying that this team is in better defensively without\nWithout dumb capers because I I Believe that there are better football team look good overall when you're talking about just sheer numbers yards per game there twelve and a National Football league wanted them to be in the top fifty and they are\nYou one of them to be in the top Fifteen and they are when you talk about points per game which is really where I really gauge more of the statistics are when you look at his team they're sixteenth they can't be there\nYou got to be in the top Thirteen top twelve you got to reduce it by a couple of points per game because you're giving up you're given a twenty four point seven points per game\nAnd that's that is going up by the way that's not going down and don't forget they pitched a shutout against opens buffalo\n\nSo that number would rise dramatically if it wasn't for buffalo you can't take it out because you did shut out a national ... you know the national football league team but you know so when you look at one of the others are just as you say okay so if you if you're pretty good defense how good are you getting off the field on third down well they're not bad there were twelve overall\nPulled over on the national football league is not bad\nThere's some things that are turning in the right direction\nBut are they there yet was it a miraculous turnaround no it wasn't like they went from twenty eight to to tense still work in progress they are getting better but it's still work in progress paid five five eight three zero eight six forty let's go to Lynn and listening to us and walk a shell Lynn how you doing today man what's going on\n[noise] Hi how are you guys doing doing what they're already feel like\nGot a lot of smart people call in and let me tell you that net fan from San Diego\nLet me tell you uh when they say if we but we're not on the field or the gentleman from San Diego proves that it is a we with these fans that was incredible mind blowing Alice Packer fans she'll the loyalty loving respect that drives these players\nAre to do great things and and go no further than a a little bit overtime Minneapolis washer those liking fans are doing with their team and how they're all dialed in his coach a team at the unit to\nAdversity no excuses Mike Zimmer and his crew everything from Emerson Griffith\nOr the injuries the staring off of their offensive line coach and those people that that team the fans are driven and they're driving towards the championship it's really incredible to watch very impressive and body would be proud that let me tell you about the Packers and make power in my opinion\nAnd interceptions are forcing the leading interceptions\nSo wanted to throw it out there for you\nForce in the league and interceptions and they are a a little league and sex\nSo\nYeah you want to you want to definitely past your own ends up\nBut it turns out that a Eric branch I get the Green Bay press Gazette now joining us on these Schneider orange hotline Eric how you doing that I mean I was going on\nTree gloomy little cloudy yeah Marshall exciting last yesterday it's kind of one of those days are just kind of\nYeah it is I I guess\nWhat you saw now there's been a lot of talk about obviously time a gum or a a about the safety which people are kind of hung up on a look I look at it as is often installed\nInside the opponents territory and can't seem to get the junk consistently done then we talk about well not getting a bowling Aaron Rodgers hands at the end of the game and I agree\nBut what happened in the first quarter after they went through that initial driving just cut through that defense so easily what happened in the second quarter when they couldn't do a damn thing why are we just focused on two specific place when offensively speaking they're still not playing or for four corners of football\nNo and there and they're not utilizing well some of the weapons that they have that same thought coming into the seasons we're going to be special just to orange and [noise] so they really got to kind of just\nLooking at the tight end positions and if it isn't there don't draw you know it it's almost appears like\nThis is going to come out wrong I Know it's going to come all but it almost appears like twelve is\nYou know drop the ball to eighty because he feels insured and you know what I you know they played with just a voluntary Adams and and a and B. S.\nYou're probably going to be okay so I you know I I don't think it's a it's a it's a matter of everything just panic goes silent it's just\nAt times the guys that need to make the place just aren't making [noise]\nMhm [noise] so we don't even know what the problem in the\nMiddle ground that that's a that's a catch that I've got six six tight and she'd be able to do and it's also his office has any complains looking for a for a flag you know buck up that's the ball go live another day\nI was going to ask you what is the what do you think is the disconnect between him and Aaron Rodgers because this was supposed to be the touchdown combination that was going to put this team over the top\nI don't think there's any disconnect I think it's just you know what when you hit thirty\nThat has been come quick and it's a steep drop and I don't think he got the wheels um you know the ones that they need to be the big guy do a lot of things in the league fantastic but you know the tank is pretty empty and just is what it is he just doesn't have the gas to get get it done anymore\nDoes this team have enough to to continuously when as I said I I I I Know it was gloom and doom from yesterday I walked away feeling better about the game that I think most too because they just went toe to toe with what's considered to be the best team and the national football league on the road\nAnd I don't think new England's is good now New England has a an aura about them when you go into Gillette Stadium\nBut I think the Packers can win there I I really do I call me crazy but I think the Packers going when they're\nWell that's funny I was just talking to us before it came on with you I was talking to a friend of mine from Atlanta was a huge dolphin fan so he's in his life has been miserable for the last ten years but he was like\nAll excited but man you know the fact there is a great you should you know\nYou play against the rams when it came up short by two points at the end of the game or just you know it's a dump foods that happened and you probably would have wanted and you've got to feel really good but I guess the take away from that to me is is that [noise] I don't know how good you should feel\nBecause I think what's gonna happen and there's only two roads that this can go on and it's either going to go really bad from here on out or maybe this is the galvanizing moment this was a time when the nights are the roundtable get together and you know All right\nJust as it has to do it and they've done that in the past um you know the run the table deal and all that stuff\nSo I I I guess I I look at it I Know you're confident I look at it as is the kind of a wait and see and that and if they go in there and beat him than they are on the right you know the nights around cable got together and around the right direction or if they go in there get spanked then I think you know what it's now two thousand and Eighteen is is going to be what it is\nIf they go in there and getting in a bank and then they end up coming home and get them when they go on the road again and get paid by Seattle and get beat by Minnesota\nUm they were not witnessing two thousand Eighteen is a turning point other than the fact that everybody got fired and they're starting over with amazing quarterback and I don't mean aging in the negative sense I mean ... and the literal sense he's just getting older and your window of opportunity is closing so they're making a decision to to make a change now before it's just simply to it\nYeah I mean and that could be the case but looking toward to Nineteen it got to feel really good I mean\nI think they got for legitimate players out of the draft they got you know the two the two rookies feedback so you've got MPs in St route I think I think to come out of there for good players\nTo Vermont office to on defense I think you've got to feel really good going in the Nineteen and you've got to first strong picks\nHey you know it could be okay you know they got me this is the problem is they had a minimum number of years the last two or three years four years I guess maybe where they address just didn't work out and you got you know you look at yesterday probably nobody saw it but my previous Adams was a third round pick and\nHe's just over taken it\nI'm drafted free agent of northwestern mhm you know Lancaster played were you know where Adam's normally what came in so\nYou know the ... the dearth of talent is just what it is and until you accept that yes they have some we have some phenomenal players I think the ... Adams was fantastic I mean in my mind he's the top ten in the ... no doubt he got the top two or three quarterback\nOr top quarter back and you got a couple of feet or a young quarterbacks that are playing really good challenge football right now I think you got to feel real good but\nThe problem is there isn't enough to be I mean there's no doubt that whole line there's no doubt that I'm really into secondary there's not a whole lot of deaths that linebacker position so [noise] you know how can you get I mean if they're not it's not like you said earlier throw the baby out with the vast order it's kind of\nOkay we just got to reload\nWell and and let me say this I agree with you I think that they're still in need of another pass Roger uh it's gonna be interesting to see what they do with clay Mathews I mean claiming that he's actually actually having a pretty good season when you look at it overall he's been impacting would times\nI'm now granted he had a couple of missteps but I I think one of them was at least a an egregious call at best um but\nIf you continue just load if you can find yourself some depth that often to plan if you can find yourself some an outside pass rush suddenly this this team looks different\nAnd I think it only gets better I don't think they're far away I think ... says a little bit of work to do in the off season but the question is and I know the question is going to is going to surround Mike mccarthy is how this season Coleman aids whether or not they feel he's losing a lot more and more so whether or not they feel just a new voice a new innovation is needed\n[noise] I agree and then ended up the hard part is going to be what happens you know if if the state and just falls apart and there are five or six when team I think than you know it's going to\nHold out and have it off yeah that was yesterday [noise] they win ... games I think it's tough to get rid of them I especially with what you got back and I know that\nThat to the conference guy and they're going to find\nThe right guys I think they're talented they have I count on that site and you got some young guys that are just a good thing about a rookie year after I'd be a second guy I mean that's\nThat's it you got defensive linemen and Kenny Carter coming all the guys twenty three years old and he's and he's got it looks like he's got to figure it out now he gets a vertical filed a pressure rather than just being a horizontal guy so that's really good and there are some things that are good the problem is is just\nYou know there's not enough fingers for the damn plug it up so much of a they're just they're just ... speaking there two steps away\nGood stuff as always we'll try to get in a week okay\nAll right John you assume they're you know that is a branch of the Green Bay press Gazette joining us for a couple of minutes on the Schneider on challenge nine or ... drivers right now you were ... eighty plus years ever going to get done calling me a hundred and forty four prior to go to Schneider jobs dot com we'll get back to the phone calls Tyler is listening to us in New York to start out hanging there are multiple Michael Jordan act\nWisconsin why bill Michael sports talk word [noise]\nIn twenty ten Scott Krueger was elected on a promise to serve only two terms\nFor internal and all that stuff right now for all the audience out there listening for years done\nNow he's running for a fifth term his campaign funded by an out of state group trying to privatize our public schools approves broken promises in his responsibilities due out of state lobbyist mean it's time for him to be done this year vote David ... to protect public education paid for by the committee to elect David ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Wisconsin Rapids", "day": "29"}
