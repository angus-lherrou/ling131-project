Lorenzo Cain come in and kind of handle that that transfer of power so to speak\nAre is you're catching gonna remain the same are you going to change things up back there for the most part I see them making a move regarding the infield whether it's bringing up catching hero or something else and for I I Know some people don't agree with it I still think they're going to try to find a frontline started now does that mean at two hundred million dollar man no they're not going to do that\nBut does that mean you know four years or three years it\nYou know Seventy five million bucks is that we are going to happen\nThat could very well happen paid five five eight three zero eight six for eight five five eight three zero eight six for a given to shout want to hear from you what do you think what do you think is going to be the the changes\nWhat do you think is going to be the difference as we sit here uh you know in in four or five months looking at this Milwaukee Brewers baseball team getting ready to head back into the regular season two thousand in Nineteen eighty five five eight three zero eight six for a day five five eight three zero eight six words going up on Twitter go ahead and do so\nAt bill underscore Michael's Advil underscore Michael's hit us up they're also you can track is down over in the Facebook fan page shoes and email there a bill Michaels at do Michael sports dot com you can find me there I mean there's plenty of ways to get on the program\nWhat do you think next year or two thousand and Nineteen version of the Milwaukee Brewers is going to look like\nTo go to Nick on the east side Nick welcome to the program the bill Michael sure what's going on man\nHey thank bill yeah well I have a crystal ball air uh so it felt like life McCarthy Era but you're still in my pounded here as far as what I\nThink's gonna happen it's okay if you're going to say I'm Crazy\nJust like I thought I Begin to here there's no way I Would have thought the girls got got this far so I Know that so here's what I think what should be done\nFirst of all got to get where you are I'm done with that I wouldn't trade him because why is at its peak right now there that you are ... they're ready to him and like most at all\nKnow what it sounds crazy so you've got three players there lot a lot of cap space out of room we can make some of the new over we can get some good hitting and because they know players for those three guys I wouldn't make a three person deal for the guy that was on crazy if I'm In the universe would get rid of\nAnd move forward what do you think um\nIf you're going to trade if you're going to make trades in that sense I guess my next question is what are you expecting in return in the sense that if you're giving up guys you really don't want what do you think as far as guys are teams are going to say about well we're going to give you they're not going to give you a frontline guys for guys that you really don't want you know what I mean\nRight yeah I and I know that's going to be an issue I think we're we're my\nI mean unless you're going for a prospect or a high end prospect in somebody's looking for a power hitting first baseman or something like that and they've already got average on their team the all they're looking for now is power I mean\nThat might come into play and maybe who knows I mean maybe they keep scope scope is a good hitter if you look at his numbers over as a history of his career and he started to really poor and on and July it's just for whatever reason wants to trade happened in August he just never found his niche in Milwaukee he was awful\nThey take on the Minnesota Vikings they have a gauntlet coming up and it has not been a functional systems so far\nFor this team to talk more about it and give us some inside knowledge or good friend Bryan building Super Bowl winning coaching NFL Network analyst joining us on the Schneider orange outline coach how ya doing\nDoing great today so give us show what it's like by week is Mike mccarthy talks about self scouting and what you need to go through and especially when you've got a team with a super star quarterback you're a little bit to you're not you're not firing on all cylinders right now watch this week like\nWell you do you have a little bit of a rest but to kind of look at each other while I say look at each other off ants and defense we actually included our staff we have the defense of guys look at the office and they often status or the the pets as though they were preparing for that\nTo look at it look at the film and and and give ... you know okay this is what we said this is what we do this what we have to account for it was always so much that you're going to get done\nIt does give you maybe a little insight little little knowledge to say okay if this is what the what we need to do then you go about to ask yourself about\nImproving those areas putting more focus on a specific area maybe changing a few things here and they're not dramatic but just a little uh one of the players come back yeah something tangible for them to hang our hat on say okay this is what we're going to do a little different that should make a difference\nSo it would do with what you've seen out of Green Bay this far I mean obviously they're quarterbacks been a little bit Nick up or the defense hasn't always been stellar but the office also put them in some short ... situations in which their backs were against the wall is when you come back from a bi also was the number one thing just getting healthy\nShort is a natural exactly what the buys about and and also then coming back and part of that self analysis is going back with your fires and very calculated away and teaching about going guys look where we've left for ourselves vulnerable in areas that you can that you can get better whether\nIt's a broken assignment or whether it's something that a technique that\nThat in practice that not use it or you can cancel a show them and say so so is this is our cat we know we can do X right you know we just got to do it consistently now and this was word flip this vulnerable\n[laughter] Aaron Rodgers at times his talked about personality talked about groupings talked about play making\n'em sometimes here we think is veiled shots to play color which is Mike mccarthy how you would listen you were on you talked about the tension and ideas and and going back and forth between coaching quarterback and such um what what is a healthy relationship with your quarterback\nOne where it's given taping and you're you're you have the ability to industry of wanting to\nSee if if you don't have the kind of relationship where Rogers can sit down and the private confines of the office say hey I I don't see this or I don't see that I'd like to do this or that you can ... you can disagree you're going to agree to disagree you know as long as you have that kind of relationship\nThat at the end it's okay because that that is a great deal of knowledge there then I Can't imagine like recording to not do that\nAre in recognizing that look there's there's just like one of my coaches\nAre there some input here that can be a value that the least of which obviously Rogers has got to sign off on it feels good about\nSo you know obviously if you can get to that point and and now plus you invest in the process\nIf he feels like you need to do this or that or do a little more no I Will do a little more ... percent whatever it is a and you see your way to do that then that he's kind of fake an ownership these vested in going yeah I got to make this thing right so that's that's a healthy thing there is nothing wrong with that\nUm I I was talking to me she Crosby last night we had him on the program and Mason said it was a big deal but the organization stuck with him not only six years ago when he struggled but this past week or two weeks ago when he came out of out of Detroit\nGoing over five on gigs um what is that do as a head coach when you stick with somebody I mean how what what level of confidence or what level of follow\nDo do you guys garner when you say you know what he's a veteran I'm sticking with this guy's opposed to just it's when now the results are all that matters and if you're not going to give us results were going to judge when you talk to you later\nWell it can be it can be a huge as long as the players and delivers 'cause there's two sides that point if you stick with a player\nAnd and and then he continued and comes back and producers that sends a powerful message to the team that saying we've got your back or with you you know we're not going to throw you out baby it with the bathwater an ad and a and work in a state court case and that gives them cop and it makes them feel good about thirteenth situation the problem is it's\nAnd and the player doesn't produce then the flip side is and the players are looking at going oh my God you're sticking with this guy it clearly isn't getting done a ... year leaving a short and long rubble here because you have some a Saturday or some affection for this guy you need to make a change so it works both ways\nAnd and it depends what the outcome is obviously Crosby comes back make some kicks\nYou Ron okay you're you're on the plus side of it um but in the same situation had it not been that way and to continue this kid then you're going to have certain players kind of going well gosh what what are you getting paid for you got to make some changes here how come you're not making the change\nTalking with our guy Brian building ... Super Bowl winning head coach I'm\nMike mccarthy said yesterday coming out of the the out of the ... and he said we need to run the ball more and more attempts and they got it's not like they have spectacular runners but thank God for the first time he pretty decent run game behind Aaron Rodgers and kind of the three hundred miles to the Montgomery and airing Jones and company\nSo how ... how difficult is it the balance is the head coach in a play called her\nThe ability to take the ball out of the hands\nThat many believe can be the MVP the league in Aaron Rodgers and say we're going to run the ball more\nHow how difficult it is a decree that balance\nYou what balance because it tends to be good but you can also look at it I mean look at the numbers vary Rogers is averaging eight eight half yards per tapped\nAnd let's say you're running the ball well toward you average for yards per raw\nYou could make a case that I'm losing four and a half yards protests\nBy not throwing the ball mhm that you can talk to yourself into thrown at fifty times\nUh which is not necessarily a good thing so you want a certain amount of dialysis residual effect to help the taxing gain by being able to run the ball\nBut you're right there is that balance in terms of you know ... you look at to adjust to the show in Philadelphia as our offset the last four Fifteen place of the Philadelphia Eagles the fourth quarter with elite fourteen of more passes well they're not around the Barbary well right now so quite frankly I'd rather have in the hands of course when she was actually playing pretty good\nSo you got to be careful about the generalization we just got to run the ball for running say well that's true to a degree but it's got to be within the balance of what the ultimate productivity as\nThey are we had you and also when uh they hired to my ... my ... right now total overall ranking number eight in the league [noise] little bit skewed there because some of the points they've given up and some of the short field that they've had to work with\nHow long does it take for guys to play free now they have a young secondary we know but how long does it take for guys to play free versus playing with your head and still learning a new system about about what point do use a head coach look and say okay it's about time these guys got it\nYou you start to see that now in terms of the players not so much they know the system and they know the verbiage and they know their assignments but\nFrom the players to have a sense of what Paul's we're coming getting a sense of why ... why let and why like that and is calling what he's calling particularly by your decision makers your key people that that the oh yeah I got that you hear it all the time\nWith a coordinator at play car and a quarter back on the off that's a side where you off there a quarterback saying well they'll start to call the play and he gets halfway through it I've already calling the play into town because I Know exactly what is calling and I didn't know what the Vita\nAh when you get that with the defense aside when they start to hear or see your call it's oh\nYeah yeah we got this and they were running this because of X Y and Z so that when you think back on things well ah that that's that's when you start to have that that intuition just like quarterback and receiver I have that six cents about one another that you know when you do this I'm going to do that\nI was listening to a couple of weeks ago al Michaels and cruise comments were doing the game and columns words in Michael's got talking about defenses in saying for deepest to be greater top ten you really need almost are pro bowler at every level somebody on the line somebody align backing whether it's inside or outside of good safety\nAnd almost ... caliber a corner you worked with some of the greatest defenses every walk of field I mean you you want to go Superbowl defensively more so than often simply so\nI Do with the with the Packers not being at that level how then\nDoes the owners fall on the on the defensive play color versus just what he has to work with on the field\nWell certainly when you have what you're alluding to when we had that presence in the interior of the defense of why what it was a Sam adams or whole loading up data twelve songs on the out yeah I mean for that you have your Ray Lewis in the middle you have an ed read on the back end or\nRob what's that yeah it's huge to have that's the ballot its ability by group\n'cause then you have that gatekeeper at each each position is going to leave that group to make sure that they understand exactly what needs to be done when you've ... plus they're good players you know yeah it helps to have good players\nAre that at every position particularly when you're talking about played on a date that's at every level if you live that then yes ... it really puts a premium on the collective of what you're doing\nPlease you know you're

board [noise]\nWorld Series starting tonight and unfortunately the brewers not there\nYou get ready for Wednesday nights contest between the bucks in Philadelphia Seventy Sixers the weekend series coming up\nOr I should say series but the weekend game coming up with the Packers on the west coast taking on the rams but uh it's a little bit of the post mortem so to speak because it's still kind of a fresher moon for those that are brewers fan ... human ... showing\nAdam how you doing man what's going on a good bill well watch\nYeah I Am I mean I'm a baseball fan anyway so I mean it's I'm I'm not going to be deterred from watching baseball I mean it's it's a shame that we're not sitting here in in Boston right now and talking about where we went and drink Sam adams last night but uh you know I I guess\nIt was something I I wrote this a couple of days ago and I said look there was a hell of a running it kinda hearkens back to the two thousand and fourteen royals when they went into the postseason they got swept in the or else the U.S by the Baltimore Orioles four games in the next year they came back and won at all after making a few moves\nAnd this is a team that still has a lot of people that are under contracted stores a lot of options are there may be a peace or to they're going to add the off season plus some of the young guys that may come up and really battled for spots it they're sitting in a really good position right now right\nThey are um and the point that I tried to make when I I wrote that the other day is there's no guarantees um you know they they felt\nLike they were um you know look I was four years old so maybe I'm speaking of turn here but but the earth felt like they were in a really good spot in Nineteen eighty two\nUm when they went to the world series in Laughlin seven games to the cardinals and I'm sure a lot of the people listening to us right now remember that and Nineteen eighty three was a total disaster and it was a child you're talking to me when they got back to the post season so that's the problem is\nUm and and Ryan Braun another player said this you never know when you're going to get back and that's why you have to seize opportunities when you get them and that's why I'm you know it hurt the other night when they lost because\nThat series when you look at it in aggregate was just as close as could possibly be statistically it came down to the Dodgers making some terrific defensive plays late in a couple of games and the Dodgers getting big hits late in a couple of games in a hinge on these you know\nThese moments I'm In the sixth inning and beyond that are just you know decided it and it's the reasons the Dodgers are going to the world series the margin was so razor thin\nSo to get to your point the answer is yes they are position very well to be competitive for the next number of years came and yell at you at the core of everything a this was a year number one of five for each of those players I'm\n... I'm going around the Travis Shaw around a dime and their their core players are either ... or arbitration eligible bottom line is they're brewers control at reasonable salaries\nWhat if there are ... you know they employ tandem is in the minor leagues what if they do some kind of tandem system with the number of guys that they've got\n'em where it's granted Woodrow for as long as he can go and then behind him ... Adrian Hauser for as long as he can go and you cover seven innings with that combination of guys and then you go to these dead relievers who are for the most part all back\nThat seemed doable um for a couple of the five spots over the course of this\nYou have optional guy that you can go up and down and bring a fresh armor you need\nSo I think that's on the table at least to try to do\nAnd save those dollars that you would invest in the old notion of what a starting pitcher is supposed to be\nAnd try to put those assets somewhere else to help you are there so maybe it's a bullpen guy multi any both guy maybe it's a ... like we are talking about throwing a hole in the in field um I think that they're at least something that they'll look at this off season just based on the number\nOf the numbers that they have in the starting rotation of of pitchers with a little bit of land that looked like really good young develop you\nAlways go I'm certainly appreciated and I know we're going to touch base again soon okay\nYeah anytime we can help me out and we'll talk about uh\nHopefully moves like an extra thing and it\nProbably yeah forty man roster ads are probably the next right the next thing that I'll get people fired up for the winter\nAlways good man will talk to you so are they going to go that's out of a ... minute will be joining us from ...

I have a question for you and appreciated thoughts I've been listening to some of the other shows as there's been some are the some of the brewers talk\nThere was about to the cubs in terms of being set up for the next handful of years you said when Chicago people are saying that it's not likely wants to different between ... and ...\nMy point was\nThe the cubs analyst and some of their sports talk shows and one specific headset all this team is set up to win a championship two and three and four years\n\nTwo and three and four years down the road and five and six and seven and and it's like\nWhoa wait a minute you have a one one yet not won\nSo my point was until you win a championship don't think it's that easy to go back to the world series or you can continue to win championships it's not\nThat was my point it's not that easy to go back and do what the brewers did this year it's difficult\nI mean the fact that you've seen teams like the Dodgers who are set up\nThey've they've got a lot of good pieces veteran pieces now in places have been there done that they went to a World Series last year didn't get their their back again this year it's hard to do they describe just to get in everybody thought they were just gonna run away with the west and they didn't they were fighting Colorado in Arizona tooth and nail down the stretch\nSame with the brewers it's not that easy to just go back\nI completely agree you got to be good you got to be healthy you got to get hot you got to be lucky those are the four things that go into this and all those things have to come together continuously continuously\nSo look I I'm I agree I there is no difference\nThe cubs had been a very good baseball team for years they drafted well they've got guys under control they've got good talent um but as we saw now in the postseason it comes down to pitching for the most part good pitching will get out good heading and if you've got enough good pitching you're going to win a lot of ball games\nThe brewers came up one game short they come they came up really by about four innings short they are played LA for the majority of the series they came up about four innings short\nPieces off I just look we'll get the contracts OK I'm for some of the pieces that\nYou have in place a catchy position you got any ... through twenty Twenty one so yeah you got a three year before he and becomes a a and unrestricted free agent [noise]\nUm Nottingham he's arbitration eligible and twenty Twenty one so he comes up and he becomes that player then you've got him at least through twenty twenty two twenty twenty three\nUm or non for as you've got for a while until twenty Twenty one year second base position needs to be filled you do need to work on that basis Aguilar he goes to al arbitration and twenty twenty to all the way from twenty twenty all the way through twenty twenty two so you've got him for the next four years\nUh Orlando Garcia is under teen control next year and then go to arbitration in twenty twenty going through all the way twenty twenty three Ryan Braun is yours with a team option in a mutual option actually in twenty Twenty one uh Lorenzo Kane is locked up\nAll the way through twenty twenty two and beyond\nGo Santana same thing twenty Twenty one twenty twenty two is when he becomes a free agent or you've got Christian yell edge all the way through twenty twenty two at an unbelievable team controlling club option\nSo he's around for a while for years uh Domingo Santana same thing he doesn't become an unrestricted free age until twenty twenty two [noise]\nUm [noise] you're pitching becomes a little bit different Zach Davies you have him through twenty Twenty one\nYou've got Souter through twenty twenty two and beyond Guerra the same house or the same Wilkerson the same I'm Jimmy Nelson's restricted free agent twenty Twenty one I'm\nYou've got a let's see here Corey can naval becomes an unrestricted free agent twenty twenty two Jeffers in twenty Twenty one I'm so Danielle is arbitration eligible this upcoming season\nThen after that Barnes hater Woodruff Taylor Williams Corbin burns all past twenty twenty two\nSo you've got a lot of core pieces that are going to be here for quite some time you're right with a four year window but that's a pretty large window\nI mean that's a pretty large window here you're set up for a time to come you need to fill in a couple of pieces and you're going to I mean that's what that's a good teams do you have the core and then you're always going to add a piece or two that may be a\nYou know kind of keeps you in the thick of things and maybe you get a chance to keep them for a year or two but for the most part that's what you do now you need to fill fill you need to figure out your second base position or third is out of a cab you alluded to you need some depth over at first you believe he's got some pretty good depth in your outfield\nYou got some good utility players now now it's just a matter of how you're going to implement you're starting pitching versus your bullpen if you pour bullpen her into a starting rotation then you've got to fill that hole in the bullpen and there's a couple of guys are probably not bringing back anyway\nSo you're going to have some uh you're gonna have some arms to go after this off season but now as far as being set up the when like I said got to be good got to be healthy injuries play into there's got to get hot at the right time and you got to be a little bit lucky baseball is a very tough [noise]\nTough sport to to replicate usually in football you know who the good teams are very very few times as a team sneak up on you and it never happens in the NBA it never you know who the who you can pick right now the top five teams in the NBA we're all going to be vying for for a championship you can go right to\nAnd you can say this is it and you can pretty much not your head and go okay maybe one team that you think is on the come gets in there or team that's on the cusp gets in there but beyond that they're right there you know what it is OK\nOkay now bill put your skipper head on your manager had yeah now you got Jimmy Nelson coming back from surgery and say the brewers get off to a hot start and it looks like things are continuing and the success is going to continue the way that it was this year\nTo you baby Jimmy Nelson or do you just sit there and throw 'em you know falls to the wall and get as many innings as you can and just try to ride the wave because you only have him after next year one or two more years\nWell I think they know what he's doing\nHe was supposed to be in June didn't come back who's supposed to be in July didn't come back he was supposed to be August he was just tossing couldn't go to a mound couldn't throw over fifty you know we had to say quote set back there was always a setback\nGot we didn't really hear much about him in September we just knew that he wasn't going to be available he was officially done for the year stop talking about it here you go so I Want to count on him but what am I counting on am I counting on Jimmy Nelson from two years ago\nOr am I counting on a legitimately injured guy coming off the surgery who we don't know what he has we don't know if he has ... breaking stuff we're on the shoulders going to hold up we don't know any of that stuff [noise] so yes I baby him coming back you're building up an innings and if he can't\nYou know and and every time he goes to the mound you're wondering does he have pain it's gonna take probably a full season for you to really trust with Jimmy Nelson's bringing at the table\nYou know what I mean would you trust Jimmy Nelson going through spring training and coming out and really lighting up his first doubting whether it's opening week or whatever happens to be going well Jimmy back you know and they just kind of extending I'm Out I don't think I Would\nSee I Would put a heavy workload on 'em 'cause you have three guys from the bullpen that could move into the starting rotation so I Want to throw Jimmy Nelson out there to find out what I have right away whether I have to send some guys down to maybe extended a spring training to stretch themselves out to eventually move into the road\nI I think with Jimmy Nelson um [noise] I Want to find out if he's just capable of getting consistent philosophy that I mean that's the first day as he can get a capable of throwing where he was as his breaking\nXie setting his pitches up his nasty busy that guy and if he's not been busy an average guy because he was your age when he went down he was a bona fide examining incredible season and he was getting on the part of many he was ... he was not to the Clinton Kurdish I aspect but he was just that good and what he was throwing up there\nAnd then he goes down with injury so easy that guy or is he the guy that we saw that would struggle at times and\nHe's a good picture you know he wasn't great but he was you know he's okay serviceable and are you still looking for a number one after that are you still looking for a third guy or a second rotation you know what I mean yeah I don't know what you may know well Jimmy can do I don't know what you mean can do\nSo if they don't go out and get anybody and they don't get another started to fill in and you're probably thinking to yourself you know what they feel pretty good about Jimmy Nelson\nBut if they're still looking at there still shopping if there is still involved and rumors in trade rumors and\nInfrared you rumors and such but you know that they're not so that they're not solidified and what they have and some of the guys coming out of the men were so good remember Josh later was going to go to Penn for a year and come back and be a starter now he's turned into one of the most dominant bullpen Mitt orange and all the baseball he's going to make a living at it if I'm shade or do I want to come out of that\nWhen I go out and throw gas now for two and three innings and just shut teams down I got millions coming to me if I become a starter and I can still only drove three innings with gas you get lit up after two or three innings and all of a sudden I'm looking at an array of three fifty four and I'm just another average arm do I want to do that\nSo that they may keep burns or somebody I mean they make you one of these guys in the pan and just to the you know they're not going to be a starter we're going to keep we're going to bolster the pen and and make a living doing that 'cause it's a lot less money and for five arms for a total price of a hundred million\nRather than spending a hundred or two hundred million on one particular are and we figured kind of the

chance of getting a\nPlay maker not only on defense but in the special teams to return game as well we've got and if we had gotten college back then no no need for Patrick Peterson no Mac and ... comment it's time to go all in\nUm Tyler says I'd rather see the Packers Gretchen living on bell and Patrick Peterson let me ask you the living on bill question\nFirst of all it is a short shelf life in the NFL for running back very short I'm not given up much for a living on though I don't care how good he is right here right now I'm\nRunning backs in the national football league in case you haven't noticed have maybe three years\nBefore all of a sudden the leak I mean how long does he go see Kelly it had the benefit of running behind horses he had a bunch of earth movers in front of him\nAnd he was the benefactor of that still good running back but he was ripping off big runs in the twenty thirty forty fifty yard Ron's\nIt's not that he's a bad running back it's just that the life of a running back in the NFL is very short lived which is why levy on bell wants to get paid right here right now 'cause he knows into here she's not going to have left in him he's not going to get that money so he wants his money right now\nSo\nI don't think I'm giving up a lot of assets to pick up a running back in the NFL even as dynamic is let me on bell and and let's be honest\nIt does levy are you taking it was probably a building centrally let's just say he averages for yards of Kerry and Aaron Rodgers every time he drops back is averaging eight years of past play when you're giving up for yards play do the math\nThey don't commit to the run so why would you spend big assets on something you don't even commit to\n\nAnd I'm I'm not taking for granted in any way shape or form that the productivity of of guys like Toronto Alison who's really come out to be a really good receiver devised a Adams\nYou've got mark ... mark ... who who looks to be a pretty sound like they went bigger and faster this year and it has proven to be be very solid I don't know how good is receiving corps is going to be down the stretch or even going in the next season what I Do know is I think they are at least for deep at this point\nAnd that's taking rental cop out of the mix I think mark ... scaling is good equity mia St browse a terrific slot receiver you have drawn and ... and and you have to find a Adams\nSo I\nI think you're really stacked right now that the wide receiver position\nAnd the running game is serviceable you don't need a great running game in Green Bay because you have a great quarterback Aaron Rodgers the only reason he would need a great running games if you have an average quarterback to play any NFL then you need something as a quote diversion you don't need that with Aaron Rodgers\nPaid five five eight three zero eight six Freud I right now if you're really serious about winning championships you are doing everything you can to bolster the defense\nDoesn't matter where it is I remember going back to the the the tweet before that says enough with stacking you know picks and and for to find the secondary look you can have enough good players at one position you just can't\nAny NFL you get as much talent you just take the talent the talent will work itself out you just take the talent we know that Kevin kings\nWhen he meets or ah I'm John you're Alexander's injury way okay Patrick Peterson fortified adapt you can move drawn to the inside\nYou can change things that would we would just show I mean there's a lot of things you can do secondary watch where you can bring it without just having to say I got to go get one big pass Roger\nEight five five eight three zero eight six foray should the Green Bay Packers beat thinking
