what happened and I know Craig council talked about\nYou know the way to pitch and what they wanted as you look at the bottom line is you weren't doing anything on offensive early\nAnd this team it may may come back and hit the hell out of the baseball tonight I don't know I Know that right now Chris ... pesos or they're having a terrible terrible series in the sense of officers who've output okay I understand that\nBut this goes back to and I know people don't like to talk about this but this goes back to win this team of just could not could not driving a run\nThe inability or the option

for redemption against the brewers and you know I understand all of that and he's put you know he's pretty much better at home but\nI I still believe they're going to win the series I just do okay I certainly hope they come back three games to two and that way they only need to win one at Miller Park and they get it and they move on but this would end up being the microcosm of the season it's where they they hit the hell out of the baseball and they get great pitching and we saw that for a majority\nAnd then the batch go cold and then they refused almost as if they fold their arms and go

cannot manufacture a run or you can not\nFundamentally do something and the game of baseball and you have an aspect of your game that is flawed and knowing that you have to have every weapon in your

what happens you know what else do I want to see what happens when he's standing at first base and it'd be standing at first base me has to talk to Aguilar\nWhile I was a big man could considering Aguilar looks like a building yes I Know\nHere is applicable oh he's a very nice man\n[noise] um yeah but I if I'd have somebody step on my leg I don't think I'd be too happy about I'm standing next to me at that point in\nTime I think of it happens again you're going to say oh yeah but I think he's just a very nice I just want to win this get that kind of guy\nYeah I got\nI'm interested to see 'cause we've got some fiery or\nI don't think we're going to put up a bunch of those no Calif either\nI Would hope not appreciate the phone call I Would hope not what you don't want his reputation of being walked on\nYou know you can only take your guys can only take it for so long and you know what you have to in and I don't ever fear this but what happens is when managers allow their team to be walked on\nGuys in the clubhouse begin to lose respect for him sometimes they'll go to the pitcher specifically and they'll say hey you know we got you or you got us let's do this you know and pictures just take it upon themselves to say I'm not going to put up with that\nCrap and then there's then then there's you know you kind of ...\nTake care of it ourselves mentality type of players group\nThey probably five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six for a Jarrett says Joe ... was behind the plate last night was not just so you know he was not as every window stopped by five eight three zero eight six forty let's go to Greg listening to us and walk shirt gray how you doing today man what's going on\nNow I I agree I'm not going to attack but bell Machado thing because I either now and left it happens again that you know it's over with but um but\nWhat I Do want to comment on and then I just have a quick question for you um it's almost like certain remember thing you talked about this the beginning of the program today\nCertain members of the bird flu or something like I say hey I'm going to take the light off you know you guys do that to their head they know the good thing is that we're seeing a lot of pain participation on on behalf the bird every night it seems to be\nYeah the only problem there is you don't Kenya or if you know you probably could run fact backward with a backwards faster than he could run for ... he's not very fast as you know uh and if you put them on second base\nOrlando is going to drop down the perfect time to get him to third base because ah Pina it's going to take him out because they have a ... year to get to a third he's just not very fast and that's a problem or if there's somebody else you might moving third although I don't don't count would do that I Would do it\nBut the opinion third ah is is is unlikely possibility unless RC it drops down to ...\nAh also you're looking at the top of the line up right now Braun has three for six and he's he's smoking a baseball but between Kaine and yell at each one for eleven last night neither of which is hitting really foreign above two hundred as a matter of fact they're big gains any two hundred and yell at you hitting one eighty eight in the postseason so far\nUm I Know you keep going with them but it's almost to the point where you're looking at these guys came doesn't look like he's having any funny looks like he's frustrated and yell at you almost looks like he's afraid of making out at this point\nYeah reminiscent of two thousand and eleven withdrawn and feel they're all struggled a ... that for the kind of reminds me of two guys who carry the team the entire season it get to the post season and you know really where where they\nAnd and these two yellow is going through a you know he's picked the wrong time to go through a little bit of a slide you know he's getting at base with the walk but a cane than the other hand\nUh over six and ... you know he's talked with a couple of opportunities Bennett's ... position and has not delivered and many games of the series so far but uh\nYou know I thought in the Bronx but who has been good on his ticket the ball to left field the bad is moving quickly through disown he's not driving aren't being the opposite field he has been good but Cain and yell at each have not been good but you know they they got you hear so you still damn so we have learned that Roger\nMudd would you look at Cain EL edge Aguilar ... in scope they were to for twenty seven last night\nYeah all I mean\nThat I only one wants to be ... I I think it was I take that back yeah with only a to walk between them because yell at you in a walking Aguilar had to walk\nI mean look how many guys to put on base there in the late innings and couldn't get that brought Iran\nYou get one base hit there are an extra base hit or whatever I get hurt and you're a you're likely you know within a heartbeat of go into the world series\nYou just get one run there on the seventh inning ... comes up on single steal second base\n... at the plate shore up his swing and strikes out ads like man you know he just lays a base it in their little blue for a little fire and uh they go to to walk up and then you do you take it home with hater and cable and Europe three wanted the series [noise]\nSo now that they used quite a bit of their bullpen and you used a lot of guys last night as a matter of fact in guys that went ah\nForwarding or better as well I mean Garret was burned up now a connection with an ending hater only within ... only within ending you didn't pitch I'm Jeremy Jeffers so that's good news if you need to use him a ... only going any before the ankle injury really really hurts as well so\nSue now now what if your credit counseling they somewhat depleted and then again last night you know what the Dodgers used to be I think two or three more pitchers in the long run as a matter of they voted\nFor getting one guy out of the bullpen who they didn't use ... ... yeah so we saw start\nYou know a couple of games ago he's you know he can suck up two or three innings\nYou last pitch last friday of course it was against ... Shaw and he went yard on her shop don't be surprised we see brand ... get a few innings and maybe two three innings and suck up and eat up some of those innings and uh and and gets them out for these guys so I think Brandon ... certainly could come into play today and who knows who\nTo activate when they put you on the disabled is today and maybe Zach Davies maybe chase Anderson and you might say oh no not chase Anderson because he gives a homerun balls like they're going out of style but in Dodger Stadium not many people come even close to ending a home run so far in the ballpark so they're guaranteed their building and it was when ... ...\nGee they're guaranteed putting you on the deal I\nCan pretty much a council and you\nCan just tell that he was going to put a ... that was likely possibility and they're going to activate somebody okay any of it and the possibilities are you know Matt elders no does act Davies possibly chase Edison possibly ah those would be you know my three choices I Would think\nBoy who you're going\n... good he was great last year but he's given up too many long balls this year but\nI mean in Dodger Stadium ballpark pictures ballpark he might the auction today like\nYou you you lose geo\nFor the rest of the postseason right that's what I'm saying well here's you know and the activities I mean ... you're going to get Bill you got to get the goods that Davies or eat at the bad who struggled through an English labor ... and you can just tell\nYou just see it in his body language so\nYeah there's there's good and bad and both of those guys they\nDesperately need a big outing today I weighed minor you know there\nAre other or or county ... I mean a guy who barely made the team in spring training\nHe drank heavily returning when they were happy with him until he got hurt\nOh they were they were but you look at a vet at sea off last year ... and and but he's turned it around I mean he's been right he pitched a terrific in it and the ... and his outing so far in the postseason so yeah I have no problem and he was terrific I'm last Saturday he allowed to lift before the ... the losing so\nYeah I mean ... has been really good but you know how much more to the laugh have left in him you know I mean there's a reason why he's been both around have struggling and\nBut he's he's pays for the last couple of outings\nAnd yeah I just wonder how much he's got left in one one of the bad outing coming I have a feeling you have some weren't this somewhere like a nine to three\nDodger when somewhere I just got a feeling it's going to happen somewhere and the ... the bigger problem is what can you get off her shirt today right ironically bill that's ... that's the one picture that the brewers have hit in the series so far as Clinton Herschel one of the ...\nHit him earlier this year or two they robbed a ... year\nYeah yeah yeah and but they couldn't touch where she'll list I felt so\nFigure other left that are so damn I'm Herschel he's lost a few miles off as fast ball he's getting it done in other ways and he's still great\nUm that let me ask you this guy I said I still think they're going to win the division I heard when the series I I just I just do there's something in him I just like last night was a heartbreaking loss is if this team is what I think it is\nIt's one of those things were there already shook it off and they're just back at it again today they have a whole lot of losses during the last three weeks we've suffered down no losses in the last three three four days but I ... to me they'd been winning series the entire time this to me it was nothing more than a series going and when two hundred three and bring it back home and I still think they're going to do that\nThey're pretty resistant or resilient team a and resistant to while losing skills so that we do we know of a poorly they were in July and they had a lot of good where they were a dog tired and they just couldn't they couldn't the runway but they've they've they've moved past that and\nI think yeah I ... they come to the ballpark today\nAnd how they got the ... but even I interviewed Trevor shock to the game and play the sound bite this morning we play the sound bites warning shots at man this was a big swing game for us tonight because we went from three one is that here we are sitting too too and it's a brand new day\nI look at it this way courage Shaw had a terrific ER and then he got to September ... September you could clearly see he was three in September when the three eighty Ninety or eighty but that's his highest DRA throughout the entire season through thirty seven innings but he started giving up giving up long balls his biggest total\nSeason long came was six in the month of September so look I I think Kurt shows ghetto bowl at this point I think you're seeing some of that that long usage fatigues starting just said and I think they can get them\nI think they can too but he's also got the capability of going out they're throwing three had baseball like we did a a two weeks ago last Friday after he\nWas just terrific on a friday night against the Braves and uh at at right here at Chavez ... so you know he's there are those more chance of him being great that there is bad with the guy claim he's so smart\nI agree I agree but I just I look at what he's done he threw a lot of an easy through seven six six seven six five\nWas this shortage doubting that was against San Francisco because they got him out of there because he ended up giving fiber and runs in some long balls in that game I I just think he's got to try to get as good game against Atlanta and he's back to being the tired that you were using throughout the season Clinton ... we're going to see in the in the postseason like we've seen for a long time\nBut I think what they didn't get one last friday bill when they faced ... is the brewers worked a lot of counts they got him into a high pitched ... if you're like twenty four pitches and the first did it yeah and in that pitch Capitol building\nYep so or to count 'em get that pitch count up and get him out of there and get to the Dodgers open which was also quest that\nGood stuff as always for your infant go ahead and go to use chance of winning they're closer so we'll see if the ... today yeah\nI was thinking the same thing last night as a bruise you've never scored up himself your clothes are not available today that's also beg for as much as ...\nYou're listening to a um Thirteen twenty W.

eight three zero eight six forty five five eight three zero eight six for eight if you want to chime in feel free we would love to a love to hear from you know let's get back to the phone call started some brewers baseball there's a lot of stuff on the docket if you want to chime in and you're you're talking [noise]\nUm [noise] you know by the way Justin James right you guys with bullies in two thousand nine eleven T plush and is nonsense cost you plus your poor management I mean mark them and game six come on uh the brewers are the bullies\n\nTea Party was a bully ... he ... he looks he's more of a size of a tea bag then he has a ... what are you talking about oh by the way uh Justin as a Cardinal's fan\nSo I live with that\nYou've got championships you got to you got a right to be on a podium standing on your soapbox no doubt but uh but right now no\n[noise] eight five five eight three zero eight six boy there's plenty of things to talk about you can talk about what's next because apparently a ... where they high ankle spraying which means he's not coming back anytime soon\nOr if that's the case uh then you've got to go and figure out who your next joggers going to be here you're going to bring into the situation where they're going to go chase Anderson jak Davies are gonna try to figure something else out\nAnd addition to that all the talking I'm going to pose this on Twitter I'm going to pose to a poll just to see what the percentage is I I\nI Can't argue either I mean I can argue either side but there are so many people that want blood from Machado they want Craig council to just stand up not take crap and go knock them down\nI'm right there with your emotionally my head is telling me when the game don't take the focus off of the game just play the game\nAnd see what happens so we'll see what happens if he indeed which I don't think it's a great council way even though he was a scrappy player I don't think it's\nHis ways to go after somebody unless somebody within that pitching staff weighed Miley or somebody else for that matter takes it upon themselves to go after him and you only go after him by the way somebody say go after one of their top players no\nThey didn't do it and this wasn't something directed by day Robert this is not a team as you this is a mainly Machado if you're going to go after him make it worth it and go after him but if not leave it alone\nLeave it alone just when the damn game when the series and move on and you've already caught him out of the dirty player you already have major league baseball now looking over his shoulder hopefully they do something and speaking of the pond hopefully as the balls to do it so\nWe'll give you got Christian yellowish coming out last night and saying that his dirty plays unacceptable you got to feel like that the consensus in the clubhouse I\nHonestly bill I'd be shocked today if they try to hit them [noise] I Would yeah I really want to\nWork in an era right now where saber metrics runs a lot of this you do not want to put a base for Iran\nIn that situation you don't mhm you just don't don't do it don't waste your time be above that I mean unless you're up seven runs no you know a a late in a ball game you stick it to zero in that I'm not I'm not worried about that right no no no no no so\nIf they get up by a wide or let's say that the Dodgers are putting one out of reach I wouldn't be surprised they stuck in his ear but\nOnly because the numbers are going to look just as bad because you're you're kicking them and the ... and now you're going to take a shot at one of their star players the brewers elite\nIt would be understandable it wouldn't be\nNo the national media will have a field day with the birds the\nEverybody on shop paws they're voting praise Joe mad and when he said we're not taking the cardinals crap anymore everybody praise it as a brilliant movie turning point in the organization as\nThey thought it was terrific\nYou know when you've got a guy that not once not twice put three times now his specifically gone after players [noise] um you know I mean look at it who's going to take a shot at the brewers Alex Rodriguez big Papi\nMy guys that are commenting on this thing Joe Buck John small John smokes already talked about ... about retaliation\nI'm sure all those guys just melt loving it last night when that game had to go five hours and they had to sit there and watch more of the brewer of LA\nBecause the Dodgers one and they can say well see we told you so yeah but you you know darn well behind her all the world and they were like oh God oh I'm sure they end but all of them were players that went after players\nAll of them were guys that went after other guys but it it's a different that this is a different era now though it it really just retired two years ago I yeah but ...\nBut this game is evolving bill it really is slick Okrent council is winning baseball games I Know how he was in his\nPill or I'm not saying there's a right or wrong I'm saying that there could be I'm Talking strictly mentality in the clubhouse if guys take it upon themselves and that's what they want to do then I supported if the manager wants to do it and he's got his guys around him than I support it if they do it just to do it\nAnd it takes the focus away from the game it's not worth it and I think that's the direction ... will go\nI I don't think they're going to do anything no I don't think so either eight five five eight three zero eight six for eight if you want to chime in feel free to do it coming up here in a few minutes we're gonna talk with Kevin Holden from CBS fifty eight he's also in LA I saw him standing on the field and Chavez Ravine and Dodgers stadium yesterday\nI'm sure he's packed away more than a few Dodger dogs along the way as well so we'll talk with him coming up Tony listening to us the new Berlin Tony how are you doing to them and what's going on are you good what's up\n[laughter] I'm feeling good especially since you're you're ... made me think happy Gilmore Barker call but I used to be working at the snack bar yes so [laughter]\nBut no I really want to say is I actually was impressed with smoke coming around because he highlighted the earth ER I\nHave two great pools are tied to two I'm feeling great but we don't have relievers in our past your hyper starters guys that are in our rotation next year the following\nSo Michael show is on the air don't forget coming up this Thursday night the huddle back out on the road as we are in between games yet again [noise] Thursday night show mama's cold which just above ... [noise]\nOne sixty four looking forward to what our first venture there [noise]\nGoing out to be a base in the crowd six to eight this Thursday night out there's a whole bunch of our friendship bud lite Bud Light the official beer sponsor the dough Michael's sports talk networks [noise]\nWhat a board to Michael Sallah back on the road again a Thursday night should have a good to have a lot of fun now Packers by week I'm sure will drop and a little baseball on you as we did last week but uh [noise]\nAnd the Packers need to go away and figure things out I I was kind of going over some of the uh the pressures from the post game on Sunday night or a Monday Night excuse me and I'm listening to Aaron Rodgers I'm listening to some of the guys chat and you're talking about\nYou know people are gonna be talking about process prognosticators the rest of the schedule and what people are thinking and talking about I'm thinking to myself man wait a minute\nYou know you you get a lot going on right now we'll talk more about that coming up and do this this team's not flawless by any stretch of imagination joining us now Schneider orange hotline Kevin ... from CBS fifty a Kevin so last night late one uh of course but uh I I still have a lot of confidence in his team I really believe they're gonna get a windy day and come back here and when it in front of them don't fans\nYeah you've got you've got a lot of reasons to really be happy about uh where this team is despite that that marathon last last night one of the things that's going to work really well for the brewers is the Dodgers used last night\nEvery single picture on the roster who was not a starter in a previous game so they emptied the bullpen last night crank council still had Jeremy Jeffress ah he had ... and he had um\nThere's one more rain and Woodrow so he had three left\nSo he's going to have pressure arms today\nAnd a quake Kirsch out isn't scare me the way he used to the way the brewers hit him at the beginning of this series makes me think that they could do something similar here I'd\nNormally in this situation you face Kirsch up to two scares me to death I don't know if I'm scared this time I think the ... actually have a pretty good shot to to win this game and come back with a lead\n[noise] um they actually got the courage ... earlier this year as well so I'm I'm not yeah I'm with you I'm not overly concerned they're ... Shaw\nIs is going to be a this is dominating guy that we've kind of become accustomed to knowing plus his numbers if you look September his ... went up his home runs given up went up\nA show on I'm not overwhelming overwhelmed by ... at all ah there's a lot of talk about obviously pain you leading off and getting the double and not moving them over and there's a ton of talk about many Machado so let's let's start with Machado first\nI Know the temptation for ... manages to scream you got to put one zero but I don't want that to become the focus of the concentration to me it's go out when the damn game\nYeah you got that right and and it's a tough thing to do given that you have a these emotions attached\nTo the play last night Christian yeah let's afterwards speaking to your name was talking to the medieval speaking in a language that we don't normally hear from those were really direct words when he says it's a dirty play from a dirty player there's no place for it in the game I don't know what his problem is I mean those are those are a\n... you know things that that you do not here and a baseball locker room usually from anyone let alone you're a star player so clearly the emotions are running high with that team but you're absolutely right that the last thing you want to do\nIs you know you put 'em on base if you walk in and that's where the big problem comes in if he gets on the situation in a game and be a lot of these situations in this game today or you don't want him to be able to just for around like he did with the winning run last night so this is\nSwallow that emotion a little bit you know play hard and you know obviously keep an eye on the data because he's been good for a dirty played pretty much in every game and the serious so you got to watch for him but I think the focus here is just got to be on on winning this game just like you said don't worry about the\nYeah the emotions of the things that happen before don't get sidetracked by this go in that series that still the number one\n[noise] hey ah let me ask you to Zach Davies gets the nod date had to put ... on the deal with the high ankle spring to tell me what you think is that Davis joining the rotation\nIs what it does is it Craig council another option in terms of length I don't know of Davies is the guy that I Would\nCount on to just run in and start one of these games remaining in this series and the possibility I guess if you go to seven and a and it's an all hands on deck that he might be or what to do what they call their initial out get her I liked the fact that he's getting a chance because there were so many arms on this team\nThat I didn't think he was going to get this chance in this and now he has he can throw you a couple of quality innings and\nThat after you have thrown a you know so much of a guy's like Woodrow for early in the series guys like credit ... last night or yesterday than a guy like that gave you can give you those qualities things in the middle of the game two or three innings\nOne time to the lineup so instead you know what it's a nice replacement in my mind and that you know no matter where the years and I\nHaven't\nYou hear me now they are we last year for a while there I use all I heard was in my mind and after that we didn't catch the rest of what you said\nThat your guest because those but I usually when I say in my mind most people just turned me off at that [laughter]\nIn my mind he's going to be a multi and the guy I think Craig downs with can use them in multi ending situations whether it's today or later in the series he's going to be a good at this\nWhat's the thought right now with Cain yellow judge you'll are with those guys are struggling so bad at the plate you\nHave to have you have to get the top of that ordered going came and yell at you have to be the beginning of what if this team's resurgence\nThat you weren't definitely in trouble in this year and I still bet on pain and yell at you to do that\nBut to yell at just you know found a little bit of a funky pain is the name when I'm at punk right now and that is\nSomething that has to change right away and it's not easy against Clinton herself but you notice how Christian yell at specifically battle her Sean at first game of the series all those foul balls that he was hitting against purse also sometimes\nFacing a guy who is at the you know who's the ace of the other team and get your guys to be better and I think that might be the thing that that steps them out of it the adrenalin of facing a guy like her shop and get to him today and came and yell at their ... going to look out the trains back on track\n'em now give me your thoughts last night and you get a pie and you get to lead off double they don't move to run a rover it's been something that we've seen and it's driven is nuts all season long\nAh I get it we'll check on a little earlier drug treatment and he said hey you know there's no guarantee opinions even going to get there because you have to finish this guy on the team but when you're struggling and your top of your orders not manufacturing runs in your bottom of your orders what you're relying upon and you've got guys if they can maybe drop down a bone or even turn it into a single\nI I'm a I'm Sorry I think you when you can't win you can't just hit guys in you're going to manufacture run you gotta you gotta do those fundamental pretty well\nYou know and then do a good example of what you're talking about something to look at as a really good example is Cody Ballenger the ah the Dodgers are a outfielder who in the eighth inning of the game last night he's a power hitter he's a guy that hits home runs the hits fly balls long for it just you know home runs the hitter\nAnd he hit a ball to the opposite field to get a runner from first a third and that was\nThe Dodgers best chance for a while to sport in the Syrian in that game last night Ryan Braun has done this too with Chris and yell at John base a lot of first a third go under the opposite field you know the the term manufacturing or run income a lot of different ways you don't necessarily have to bond sometimes that's good\nBut you know there are other things that you can do other than thinking just in terms of fly balls and home runs and I think now in in this particular match up you'll see more of it the ... that they can scratch early and get a runner too early in this game I think I'm manufacture early they're both ends ready to go for a while\nThe last time a during the regular season they got the courage show the guy to them of the problem was they gave a Twenty one runs out of Chavez Ravine along the way so you hope history doesn't repeat itself but it's not like they haven't been able to hit ... they've gotten to him before in the past so I'm not overly concerned about him is starting this game\nYeah it's it's just a little bit of a different guy right it's if that is that five percent role you lose a couple of miles an hour five percent off your fast ball and instead of being Ninety five Ninety six in up in this own it's Ninety Ninety One and up in the zone and\nThe batter can just get enough of a piece of it to follow it often make you throw another pitch to make you throw that her\nHer ... but he's just a little shy of what he was a couple of years ago and that yeah that's why he doesn't scare us because he can't necessarily strike you out with three different pitches anymore\nOr you can battles them differently that's that's the big difference in a in this early in the series of earth did it really well they follow that game plan again they can get a similar results\nThey real quick before I let you go give me the mood last night and give me what you expect today\nThey you know other than in the shadow thing I thought the brewers were not very angry last night and that's a tough thing when you're exhausted the fact that they are able to flush kissing get it behind him short breast might actually be a good thing you don't have to think about the written the\nYou know the the top of this or the loss when you have just a few hours and I think maybe they can flush the way it might be better that it's begun today\nTwenty WMA Wisconsin Rapids\n\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by Quicken Loans I'm\nJim shown to be met a

quick turnaround get back in and hopefully the brewers get a win today going up against Clinton ... my only taken the hill tonight for the crew so we'll see what happens is bringing our national baseball insiders cents every now joining us on the Schneider orange hotlines said how you doing pal\nSo Phil or been looking forward to this ever so class right\nIn this segment but\nLet me let me ask you this just a ... because out where do you want to start\n[laughter] well you know to think that this\nThis is not a missed opportunity because uh I didn't think there was a debilitating law that was a great game to strike out or you know for my taste\nThirty to strike out the third thing mhm I'm a great job by the pictures and it just shows to show you why all the second guessing a council in game three was dumb\nAh you never know where baseball's going to take you and he had to read it for everything and he seemed ready he didn't run out of pitchers this wasn't lost because of that it was an RV I single\nAllowed right give up and are we are single in life that show that part of it um if you if you combine that with the bullpen faltering in game two\nThis could have easily been a sweep for the brewers they have been in every game they have been in charge of every game and I have no reason why they why why anyone should think they cannot win two or three especially with two of those at home\n[noise] by first of all let me say this I agree with you I I'm I'm completely fine with what happened last night in the sense of\nJust move on you know you know there are a good team you're a good team\nYou have for the most part out played them you've committed less errors you played better defense you've got it done with pitching\nThe top of your lineup still has yet to hit and you're tied two games apiece count your blessings just to me it's just get on with it move on leave many Machado stuff for another day and and just try to get yourself with a better tasting your mouth and you come back to Miller Park\nWell meaning that China does a coke but I mean I I feel queasy punk too so I Hope people know that\nOh we I don't buy put that out last night both guys are very selfish players\nThere could have both of them I mean first of all praying that cloud um you know the guy I learned a darn thing since he came into the league um you know a lot of people compare them to Vladimir Guerrero he could not carry Vladimir Guerrero back um but then you have to have a shot of first of all the ... the non hustle\nJust shows you how players can't relate to anything like the fact that he even said it\nRight or get the fact that he does it the fact that it just the sheer arrogance of this call and then that was a cheap play that wasn't dirty play or you know the the the play first base and you know I I I saw a lot on Twitter like the dust them dating back I'm off like I'd let them know you there\nI I have no problem letting them know you there um I I don't want to plug the guy or I Would throw high and tight though I Would make I back him off the plane um I don't like that kind of attitude and those are the kinds of people I like being\nNo no I completely gather just great stuff I Can't wait for next week it was either were wrapping things up are moving towards a World Series for the Milwaukee Brewers should be a lot of phone bill\nYeah no it's been

five eight three zero eight six for eight eight five five eight three zero eight six way coming up here at the bottom of the hour we are going to get into some bucks shock and awe the Milwaukee Bucks for those to didn't know or may not be paying attention right now because of what's going on with the Milwaukee Brewers in I understand that\nBy Eric now is going to be joining us the bus reporter for the athletic he's the author of one hundred things bucks fans should know or do before they die he's going to be joining us on a weekly basis and we're going to talk with him today about the the Milwaukee Bucks that's coming up here in about ten minutes so stay tuned for that bugs getting on the\nOn the road tonight and kicking their season off a pardon the pun but uh you know what I'm looking forward to it I've got some tickets to some bucks games this year\nAnd uh it it's the bucks had been scoring by the way and the pre season at the pre season means of time\nBut they are putting it up from everywhere they're lining up from all over the joint if you haven't been paying attention so scoring for the Milwaukee Bucks his not a\nHas not been difficult so we'll see if that translate now we'll see what coach ... brings to the table and the sense of\nScoring defense camaraderie and all that kinda stuff at the box have but uh the Milwaukee Bucks get it under way a little bit later on this evening and I'm excited I'm I'm now I'm going to be watching the brewers through and through\nRight now but you've got to know think of this now for a minute because you have the bucks opening up\nThe bugs are opening up at home at home on friday night you're going to have the Milwaukee Brewers playing on friday night\nI Know when they said the schedule they did not plan the box will be opening up a their Pfizer forum on the same night the Milwaukee Brewers fan is going to be back into the Miller\nPark my question is if you had a ticket to go to the bucks game\nTo see the home opener the opening of the Pfizer form the official opening in a regular season home game for the Milwaukee Bucks\nOr you had a chance to go to games six of the sea as Miller Park are you giving up your bucks ticket to then head over to then head over and check out the Milwaukee Brewers\nPersonally and this is nothing at all against the box but if it's game six in the brewers have a chance to clinch and go to the world series I Am heading over to Miller Park seven times a week twice on Sunday\nJust me [noise] uh I don't\nKnow what the rest of you would do but that's just me in the meantime the bucks getting ready to open things up and get on the road they're taking on the Charlotte Hornets before they come back to the Pfizer forum on friday night to take on the Indiana Pacers ah then they've got a few games they've got to be the game against the Knicks\nOr they've got a game coming up on that's on Monday they don't want to say Seventy Sixers and it goes on from there so\nWe'll see what happens eight five five eight three zero eight six for a day five five eight three zero eight six foray if you want to give us a shell please feel free to do so he five five eight three zero eight six for it let's go to Mike listening to us in sock steady Mike welcome to the program go Michael show\nEight game again that\nThree is a game and lash out at number down at twenty five ... ... more per game that they're shooting and you're just going to be aboard modern offered\nA you're going to see more through to get in with that you're going to see more space\nFor ... and I think the last thing any team any friends want to give him his more space so I think you're you're really looking at a A R e a new office every day or look better out that there will be a lot more space there had to put up a bunch of point\nAnd that certainly you hope you're during and after thing where Jason Kidd he has given up a lot of\nYou give up a lot of shopper rare you're going to either bucks in trying to do that ... thing that they're doing all kinds of like where ostensibly there trying to get to the room all the time that there is\nNow the phone for free they want to keep teams or wherever they want to keep teams are frequently and hope or read that ... I think all those things are going to be there maybe some\nIt's a little bit hard to tell because the boxers or a hundred Fifteen points per game in the pre season bought a defensively you hope there's some improvement there and then you know you hope with a much better off for a defense that's improved but looking at a at a team that can win close to fifty gate\nYour sorority five mental tend to ... Lopez brogden bloodshed for sure\nYes a hundred percent a year older than that throughout the pre season and Pittsburgh that to us on a Monday we had a chance to talk to him and Milwaukee so yeah it's better that will be starters tonight uh before when they get tipped off in Charlotte\nShow when you talk about me players you know coming off the bench in what you get from each guy who are your most importantly players that people should be watching the season\nI think it's really interesting because I I Would love to answer that question I think ... 'cause I I've gotten so you know having him be a guy that come up a bench but obviously he started one of the here so\nI think that kind of major things up a little bit oddly enough I think it's going to be as an old things that people are going to\nBe used to seeing a guy that they can really rely on in the fall he's back\nAt the bucks this year and he is a part of that you know space in the floor screen threes\nKind of thing that Mike Brune holders trying to do so at the honestly summertime or Islam left he hasn't changed much or you're going to see 'em scored about I don't know tend to ... points per game here to see him\nI don't know they said rebounds for him and just kind of the exact\nSame guy that was all those years ago with what they're going to get a couple of more substance of the ... got a little bit gray hair but at the exact same time that you pretty much the exact same players though he will go on a I think Tony now is it's going to be interesting to see you started at a time last year he's now they're starting lineup this year but\nAgain if you're trying to get three that's helpful and then I think the whole their name to keep an eye on it before but I wasn't really expecting now I don't think even though the guy that they drafted in the first round this year my poodles are really likes to even though I still have some questions on his shot I'm ... I'm Still trying to figure out\nWhat exactly he can be at the NBA level because I think at the ...\nHave you can score teams will figure out that all you will do passes around\nUh and that's what that's what they've been hosed down in the book good\nDoing those things and uh the the big thing with ... is everyone needs to pass a little bit of everyone needs to be able to handle the ball a little bit and everyone needs to be able to share a little bit down did even though a dug a little bit of all three of those I'm not sure he doesn't know any of those quite yet\nUh but my son was a really simple like of and and I would guess that would be one of the first stopped off the bus or\nThe or the expectations as far as realistic expectations for this team what would they would you say they are\nI think realistically fifty when this is is a fair\nOf this team and it it was really interesting I got to talk of the team that did you days got to talk of this who are here in the pre season the their the adventure carried away from expectation and uh I I kind of asked a couple of them like why why are you trying to weigh from expectations because it's ... last year\nThat's all they talked about me today was fifty wins top five ... it's going to the eastern conference ... with all of those things and and I think they think they're better this year so why not turn all those things and and Chris mental pain Saturday as I thought his point is you can set\nThat we look like fools to reset that\nWe look like fools in the last couple of years when we sat marijuana to all these things\nAnd then we didn't do it so for us we do we need to take it day by day and make sure that we're doing the right thing than what's on ourselves in that position but we don't think of ourselves any differently like we think we are still\nGoing to win a bunch of games and we're still going to go out there so um I I think that's the part that gets really interesting is that you know if you fire Jason Kidd if you don't bring back a protein and you didn't do that because they one forty four games last year that means forty\nFour wins or the disappointment means you have you got into that and that if you add on top of believed that Mike ... is a better costs and Jason Kidd got out even more wins on top of that so to me it's it's fifty wins\nAnd it's the first playoff series victory since two thousand one like I I think those are the expectations for the season and I think internally they might even think they can go further than just winning one playoff season pass what they can eastern conference finals round\nTheir main bus reporter for the athletic joining us weekly here in the bill Michael show talking about basketball show I guess my next question becomes when you're talking about ... an adding him and adding pieces and adding wins or bringing in Durban ham another guy very familiar with the organization\nWe what have you seen impacts really from the new regime shave versus what was their prior\n[noise] I think it was it was really interesting the odd media day I'm no one main set the name that won't be sad in Jason Kidd\nBut throughout the day you heard things and drove the crew season you hurt things that are very crude references to housing used to be done or you know what I ... I was expected to do this and now\nDo know there's give me the freedom and the confidence to do this like hearing all these things about\nUm you know I think just the coaching staff that is going to give ... Canada in power players to give them the counters give them the freedom or maybe not play some of the mind games that Jason Kidd played and the biggest stand up for her beanie today was\nUp on the day if you have what you said\nThe nice thing about going to even journalists that their Oscar workouts seem that there was a system in place\nSo if there if you could see the system when they're doing off he didn't work out\nThat meant you didn't see a system in place under Jason Kidd so to me I think a lot of it is going to be empowering players and then you know having systems and believing in those systems and you know dot deviating from what those plans will be\nGreat if we look forward to each week talking to your boss basketball tipping off tonight they'll they'll be back at the Pfizer foreign coming up on friday and we'll check it again next week is the season gets underway okay\nI look forward to it they get\nAbout ... ... may bus reporter for the athletic author of a one hundred things bucks fans should know and do before they die you're going to be joining us weekly\nHearing Michael shall we joined assumption that are on chat lines that are hiring drivers right now you were called the ... eighty plus years they begin to get done call them a hundred and forty four pride or go to Schneider jobs died cabbage parts of the program brought you buy new mail medical\nSay boy so I went I went there I have a highly recommended a shop and there just to say Hi to the guys every now and then but if you got the ... going on in the right down his function they have a Ninety eight percent success rate if you're like me\nI started talking to him about energy and they said wait a minute can below tier over the age of thirty one got tested it's easy no problem they said sure enough here you go down on the program fantastic the wall and weight loss program even better just call it ... nothing works unless you call\nFor one for four or five five four for five one for one for four or five five four for five\nOne that is the new mail medical center going to give you a few predictions when it comes in Milwaukee Bucks get back into it here and just a little bit as well as Paul ... are going to go to jail is going to be joining us coming up and do you can hear from Mike McCarthy's well get a whole lot more to do more do Michael show next\nEverywhere in Wisconsin bill Michael sports talk [noise]\nIn week one of the high school football playoff the assumption royals will travel on friday to pits we'll take on the Panthers for the right to advance in the two thousand Eighteen tournament if you can't make it to the game W.
