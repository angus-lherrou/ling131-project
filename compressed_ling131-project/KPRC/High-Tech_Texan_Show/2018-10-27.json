mature as you're going to get with people shooting at\nYou right but uh you know they're cut down in the primary alive you just can't him and we're talking\nTens of thousands of people I mean it's it's it's a it's really amazing the size or in the magnitude of problems with this has created a overall this period of time\nSo there's a depending on which website you look out there's about one point one million of these in our country while one point one million that need\nSome type of work done in their homes um to enable them to live life more independently and this is a problem simply shouldn't be happening\nYou know yes we're the greatest country on earth we've got the greatest military in the world\nIf we can spend if we can spend billions of dollars sending these guys off to war\nWe can darn sure spend spend a few billion dollars taking care of them when they come home and uh right now I got to tell you might uh we're working on some stuff to do with the legislature and bills are for veterans and helping them to streamline\nThe process of getting the money more directly um and of course this is a whole separate other discussion but I Will tell you there's some very exciting things going on behind the scenes\nAnd I'm really proud to be a part of the um the process um I just send a long letter to a senator last week explaining\nThe the the issues that we have a with out there in the field and on the front lines as I call it and and be\nThe bureaucracy and the red tape it takes for these guys to actually get the money\nAnd the ones that actually do qualify or getting rejected it's almost like a protocol for them first time get rejected boom second time boom or three times we've got people are getting rejected for legitimate injuries for whatever reason\nUm they the the VA and this is great as they can be and the believe me they help a ton of veterans\nThere just needs to be a much more of a streamlined process for these veterans to get the money that they need to do this type of work\nRight now it's just like a big huge log jam and the ... the VA doesn't handle these cases with a sense of urgency if they're missing a piece of paper work or they're missing something set of like doing what I Would consider free enterprise would do pick up the phone\nYou know and say okay this is what we need email it to us now let's get this done instead they send them a rejection letter again another three we turn around and get the letter out to process over again and process and it's just it's painfully slow\nPeople need to understand that these houses are not built to accommodate these situations I mean it's it's\nIt's when you understand you know I I I was sharing the story with you that um my wife's mother\nA was a heavy said lady and uh she had diabetes and stuff in and she's passed on now but uh she had a lot of problems with mobility and she had one of those chairs with the little uh you know direct the electric chairs and it was big\nAnd let me tell you you wouldn't believe how much damage one of those things can do to our house so ah the she was in a like a Fifteen hundred square foot house she'd been there for her whole life\nAnd the bathroom was small and we had to a demo that bathroom and set it up for handicapped you know\nThe five foot radius around the toilet to grab bars\nRole in you know zero entry showers and they had special handicap stuff you have to do in the shower well I I never done that before I hadn't been I haven't taken any classes on it and Mandela learn a whole bunch of you know nasty lessons yeah you got to tear it apart and put it back together 'cause that wasn't working right and it's too low too high I mean\nYou can't get into I mean this is a small house right she could only access less than one third of the house\nRight and that there are other issues as well as for example he's rolling showers um we have a zero curb\nI'm so you're thinking okay well cheesy breakout concrete right what if it's post tension slap so we have pro [laughter] yeah so we have protocols that a problem yeah we have protocols in place which is a much more of a complex a ... a you know\nIf it's a process that we have to use with post tension but at the end of the day is um the these these guys and gals thing need this it's something that really should they shouldn't we shouldn't honestly on the\nPrivate sector [noise] have to do this for these people to get the help they need [noise]\nNumber out there I mean if you guys have trade based services or anything like that or you have products you want to donate to these projects [noise]\nGo to guns to cameras dot ... dot com guns to hammers dot com or call them into a one\nFor seven seven thirty four hundred to eight one for seven seven thirty four hundred and one thing you can be assured of with this organization is a hundred percent of the money goes to these projects to help these veterans out\nAnd I'm telling you they need to help people

your seat ... gallery furniture made America studios this country or\nWere there weren't in Salt they started here obviously I Know in Austin and many other cities are now picking up some of the slack but there is it's it's they're driving the price and cost of real estate up to were driving around yesterday\nAnd this great beautiful city Pacifica and we're looking at these quaint little homes and are in Darlene who you hear from hearing about him and she goes on that's about a million and a half\nAnd [laughter] and obviously being from Texas was like well\nHow does this this this this cannot happen this cannot be\nBut such is the the way of of the Silicon Valley all these smart young millennials I'm surprised not retired yet at the age of twenty six year twenty seven years old\nBut this is the area that we are and in you know are you going back I have not had the opportunity to go down to the brand new apple facility I Know apple spent on and how many hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars building their new spaceship headquarters which again is about forty five minutes or so from here\nBut I don't know I I I I'm hoping listen I'm not a hate I\nI Know it's what it's the first company to reach ... ... ... hours of of of of value for a company or whatever it is\nBut when they're I'm reading about their new phones coming out I don't know if they're selling nearly as much I don't know how they're going to pay all their bills but ... the lines are out there so many of those apple fan boys apple than girls out there did you are are you going to get this new iPhone access the iPhone excess max the iPhone ...\nI was reading in a few ... and I I personally have not had any hands on with these things yet because of course if you listen to me you know woman Android guy and everywhere I go I've got my latest that not only do I have the galaxy\nS nine but I've also got to have the Galaxy Note nine and a little bit bigger of a phone to like carrying I'm telling you what it is the most gorgeous screen and I said is every time a new phone comes up\nBut the way that you can use the style is not only to write drop things on the on the screen it actually worked as a remote control has a shutter click or a so if you want to take these selfies you can set the camera not too far away and just take the uh the the style is out of their hit a button in your set to go\nThe other cheaper IPhone X are a from a lot of a kind of my brother and sister in the industry they're saying the ex are is much smarter option over that price your ex ass\nAnd my my first things is I'm a marketing you raped me round in different ways but marketing I'm not I'm getting really sick of these naming things the ex are the excess the ... you know if you look at the letters excess but also says the word access at some point we're a thousand dollars it is excessive\nFor these things but uh they're ... they have come leaps and bounds if you think about a year ago apple unveiled three new iPhones which was the APA plus and then you've got that iPhone ten\nAnd then you fast forward to this year or they introduce three new phones again you've got your access your ethics max and your ex are and people were forced to wait again until this Friday yesterday when it finally reached the stores\nBut you look at these thousand dollar phones\nAnd their ... extremely pricey I get asked all the time I said it's ... they they want to know if I Know when the prices of phones are going down I don't know I don't think they are but then again let's go back to the computer area I'm a computer era they know the first home desktop computer though I have let's go back to I don't know what the mid Nineteen nineties\nEvery time a desktop computer was launched they were right about two thousand dollars twenty five hundred dollars that's what they were that was the price point and it took a long time\nBefore desktop computers started coming down now you can get a pretty powerful desktop computer not apple\nFor anywhere around to watch it because the black friday sales are getting ready to start you're gonna find these things for three hundred four hundred dollars same thing with high definition TV ... you know the story my first high definition TV eight fifty inch TV back in two thousand and three was Fifteen thousand dollars you can get a fifty inch high definition TV right now\nProbably for something under four five hundred dollars [noise]\nI I don't know when these phones don't just so ubiquitous\nBut the thing is in in before we get to the break over here the difference between the phones the Dutch TV screens and the those desktops\nWe didn't have to replace our desktops every year every time a new desktop version came out we didn't go out and rush to buy one every time in a new a high definition TV screen comes out we don't buy one I mean the current TVs I have right now in my water probably four or five six years old\nBut why is it every time a phone Israelis we have to go out and get that new next version and so I think it's something that God rest his soul Steve Jobs you just put inside our brains right now it's the new to the next version what do we do with the old song and actually it's one of the things that we'll talk about\nEvery time a new phone comes out what do you do with your phone that's less than a year old you give it to your kids do you give it to your spouse you sell it back\nOr you can get some credit so I'll give you three or four or five different ways that you can do that with some of your phone so we've got a full
