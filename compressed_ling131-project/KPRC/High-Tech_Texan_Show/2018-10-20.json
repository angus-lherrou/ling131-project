L.\nAnd there are two phones and just like they're automatically working in Android um they they have a single rear camera which is still okay they started seven Ninety nine they have bigger screens and they're really big into selfies right now they have a wide angle selfie camera apparently people\nAre more concerned about taking shots of them versus looking out outward wise Noel anyway but you know ... they had been leaked and we actually got to see them over here but are they showed him off last Tuesday or at a big on boxing and a big event\nAnd uh they're going to challenge I think the pixel three is going to challenge the best phones in the market with really Google's greatest weapon\nAI artificial intelligence 'cause the features and build up the event it really gave Google something new to crow about it many of the phones hardware specs say they have a five and a half an inch and a six point three inch coming out of the pixel three and the pixel three acts up the good storage\nBut this is really comes at the intersection of AI artificial intelligence the software hardware working together and they talked up the pixel for his ability to improve the phone's camera by using artificial intelligence that relies on data gathered from millions of Google's image search is\nSo they're saying the pixels camera completely rethink some images are captured and this is just that we were ... it's the tone of the water we're going to start realizing understanding how am I is here and how that's going to help us assistance to number thanks uh the camera individual threes got as a feature it's called pop shot\nAnd it uses a to pick the best moments to take a picture they've got another feature called night site [noise]\nAh that's used in ... without a flash a super ... zoom than improves zooming without losing image quality\nI like it we use our phone our camera so much if you think about it I bet you may use your camera more than any other app on your phone in in listen don't think otherwise a camera is an app on a phone\nBecause we called the single phone do we walk around with that in our pockets in and our purses saying hey here's my smart camera this is my camera oh by the way it has a phone well no we actually save the smartphone\nA lot of people they don't even use the phone I text more than I talk\nAnd I use my camera several times a day for something\nI don't know what it is maybe it's I'm not a big food dye like I'm taking a ton of food when I'm eating but if I'm an event certainly if I'm at football games or or whatever I use that camera sure I Want and improve camera yes that's why I like the same songs [noise]\nI've always much better than the iPhones with their cameras now Google and their pixel they're really competing in the camera category but they're making it smart they're making his moderate the pixel free actually has two front facing cameras to\nIf it's more details and the frame and that's particularly good if
