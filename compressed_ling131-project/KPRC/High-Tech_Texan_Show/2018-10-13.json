I don't care if it's a trade service uh you know they're building up back porch for you there building the kitchen for you the remodeling your entire house you know I'm ... there's no difference\nAnd building a million dollar house ground up doing a hundred thousand dollar kitchen or fifty thousand dollar kitchen\nDoing a little add on to the back side of the house\n\nYou know there's no difference all of those all of this project should be dealt with exactly the same way one what\nAre we dealing with what the existing what are the problems to solve the problems you know I've got deterioration here about water intrusion here I'm just flat roof is not work and you've got to figure out the the addicts poorly ventilated you got to assess the house\nAs it is right now identify\nThe problems that need to be addressed didn't talk about the improvements that you're going to make then spec everything out okay plan everything in the front that's the only way you can define cost it's the only way that you can control\nThe predictability in the outcome on the end if you don't know where you're going you're never going to get there and it's going to be the most experienced ... expensive experience you'll ever have in your lifetime and you hate the process which is sad you don't need to you know\nYou need to know exactly what you're getting and under what circumstances in anybody to do\nIn any builder that doesn't offer you design build services where they wanted to find they want to work with you to define things up front so you can see the cost and we can define the details\nAre is crazy it's crazy I I'd give me a bunch of money and let's start throwing some sticks up I mean everything that you're building structurally is to accommodate an end result that hasn't even been to find you\nAnd what doesn't stretch people you don't get to make up an extra you know if you want everything to look like a an accident and fillers and things that don't fit right try building that way\nTry building that way now the fact that the builders aren't set up to do that they need to change their business because that doesn't serve your interest it costs you more money you don't you're constantly told we can't do that which is insane it's accustomed process you should be able to get whatever your wallet can afford\nBut when you start building things without specificity then you are limited we can't do that we could have done this but we can't do it now and that will tell you you picked the wrong resource and\nI'm telling you you ... you you pick your builder upfront you pick your interior designer you spend all your stuff out you worked a plan to build her security is going to get the project he's happy you're ... you're going to enjoy the experience and you're going to spend less money or you're going to get more for your money\nI don't know anybody doing remodel or new construction project trying to save money but you will definitely get a lot more bang for your book and it will come out as a planned\nAn application it will look great you will know what to expect you will you will be excited about the end result because you know where you're going\n\nYou won't have a you everybody in projects are going to have a little bit of change orders they're going to have a little bit of an additional things that'll happen okay you just don't want them to be monster\nAdditions crazy additions and that's what happens because they weren't planned up front everything becomes a huge ... do you realize that they sell chandeliers that costs twenty thousand bucks\nNow we sat down to rationalize your your your lighting budget for a you know a small remodel for maybe a kitchen in the dining room in the living room and I said that your your lighting budget you know we ought to make this a you know ten grand you'd probably have a heart attack\nBut when you go into a light store with Fifteen hundred suppliers are and you see the first thing you see the chandelier you gotta have and it's twenty grand\nWe're way over budget\nOn the first light fixture so wouldn't you like to know that upfront that's my point you're walking into massive massive stores\nWith lots of stuff that go from zero to ten thousand really quick\nAnd until you see it and you see what your options are you're not going to know how to budget for that it's complete BS I mean it's just complete BS\nOn paper is all it is and and it never works out there is nobody the gases that well oh I Know your personality I Know what you like no you don't you're not going to know until you walk in one of those stores and you see\nFeel in touch the things that you want and what makes that heart\nPump 'cause that's when you're going to start rationalizing well we gotta we gotta we gotta buy this twenty thousand dollar light fixture I mean I got a habit I Can't sleep but [noise] the builders blame because we didn't know that about your personality [noise]\nOkay you went at the transaction wrong find a great builder and enjoy the process [noise]\nOur guest ma wrap it up for their projects listening have a great weekend and don't forget next weekend wings over

wanted to do experiments in zero gravity where they can research and develop many many years from now we're gonna be colonizing the moon and whatever\nAnd we want to do this experiment to see what zero gravity world is really really tough to emulate zero gravity without going to zero gravity and so\nWhat they did is they put these college kids yep up in the training program the training jet it was that was a Casey one thirty five called the vomit comet it was it was a ... it was airplane\nA that was two engines are they took the insides out the modified it they put padding and everything and they would go and they would put these get and they would do ...\nOver the Gulf of Mexico and as you come over the top and go down like a roller coasters problem\nYou experienced like thirty seconds of honest to God zero gravity and you're floating in space\nI got to go on one of those I got to actually us with the uh what one of these uh colleges um with your training and it was nice to be able to float space and now that so and I think they retired that program and so I don't think they use Casey one thirty five [noise]\nAh no we need in by the way to answer to the little trivia
