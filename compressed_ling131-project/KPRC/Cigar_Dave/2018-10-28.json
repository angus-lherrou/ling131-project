started out as a hobby that spiraled out of control into a career\nOr like many people they they love your whole brewery than we have beer and then next thing you know you're a professional\nYet brewed beer at home for many years of working kitchen since I was Fifteen um decided it was something that I wanted to do full time went to the Siebel Institute of Chicago and their sister school dumb and dumber Nick and I worked for Thirteen Years for a company called the iron he'll brewery in the Philadelphia area okay\nI'm open for their locations before I a jump ship and came to live in this place\nAnd how did you uh uh hook up with a ...\nUm I was introduced to Jay Paul through a close friend of mine Casey cues the head brewery at ... right down the street\nGotcha so uh you made the trek from the great white north down to the sunshine state mhm there you go and I should say the aromas here this is interesting because it's not just like a a brewery you've got incredible food here ah and so you've you've really married\nThe food aspect with the beer aspect are very popular place in the short eight months that ... works has been open yeah so far so good we have a ... son or you go it's all about uh enjoying the good life and certainly beer cigar October fest part of the good life let's talk about first of all a beer\nThe ingredients that we talked about basically there is a barley there is a wheat there is water there is used to talk about making beer the basic ingredients and the process\nOkay um so those are the four main ingredients as you said um we start with what you call the mashed say you crack open the has the barley in the wheat you still getting water for a certain amount of time and what you're doing is you're converting converting all starches into sugars reason you want to do that as the east which is a life force the beer can each ... each other [noise]\nOkay um which creates alcohol so after you converted you strain of the liquid from the grain into cattle you boil it you had the hops which are basically the spaces of beer that give you some bitterness and bounce all the sweetness\nAnd also flavor aroma I'm cool it down and put into the tank you that the east east hates the sugars and produces alcohol and see a tip\nThey made it sound very simple but it's really not that simple because it does take time a stock there are two primary types of beer there's loggers and ... what are the differences are the\nType of east used okay yeah so there's two families he used his life forces the beard is you know it's a living thing it was used for baking for making spirits and especially when it's for making bread but the two main families or loggers nails a logger he likes to\nTo work very a cold and slow and it affects the flavor of the finish beer very balanced and cleaning Chris I'm Ellie east a little faster and warmer and produced a little bit more than ... and a free characters and ... and ... and such\nIll takes longer to brew than it does lawyer correct I'm ill ill ferment quicker than loggers lottery all the all the other way around it takes a long time that's why we see many people that are home brewers the ales they don't do like soccer's are much more delicate okay loggers what a top fermenting or bottom fermenting or that his bottom from it\nA lot of preventing the was the top fermenting she'll give us a time difference between ale and logging\nUm for the same here same alcohol content to average it'll be about two weeks on same loggers about for\nNow many people think logger is a milder a beer than an ale is that correct I'm\nIn a way it's it's more different it's more cleaning ... you have less of a fruity spicy character actors and the Romans you get with typical ales\nAnd so when we look at most of the big selling beer we talk about Budweiser and ... and ... those are primarily loggers such and then the ales which we've seen really a renaissance on the craft brew side\nOf those have just exploded and we talked about ales there's some there's a pale ale then we see like a what a red tail and then there's an eye PA India pale ale to talk about those differences um\nYou know there there are other there all the same base in a way they're being seen you face red tail you're having a lot more of a ... sweetness that's going to be your primary flavor and what how people associate with that there are ... are really characterized by the use of hops so happy for bitterness flavoring aroma\nNow I ... back before there was a refrigeration ... weren't the hops the PDAs created to preserve the beer correct in transport back with the British are merchants way back\nYeah that's true it was basically a beer born out in that city and they use the hops as preservative it for the long voyage um you know from England to India and um you know when all the\nWhen when all the soldiers got back to England they wanted their India bailout and they wanted a stronger happier beer 'cause that's what they had been drinking and it kind of birth that style\nWhat are the most popular bears around the world is getting us which is what a shout out yeah so we've got stout and porters and everybody looks at those are dark thinking it's going to be super super a strong and that's not necessarily the case now\nThere's less alcohol and Guinness and there's an Budweiser\nI did not realize that so what's the difference between a talking about a ... and a quarter\nDownton porters are both ales they're very similar um I think especially the one thing that makes him to the port Ernest doubt is this out has a rose to ... Porter doesn't but they both had the dark mall and the roast the Neddy coffee chocolate character to them\nAnd we've got a couple of those supporters in ... in the beers that will be sampling I'll go with that list in just a moment also another beer that's become very popular we fear tends to be a little bit softer ... on the power yet we're seeing more of that\nEspecially in this climate down here um you know more refreshing um softer and you know suited for warm weather drinking\nWe have seen an explosion in the last guy to be ten Fifteen Years in terms of craft ruin people\nJust like cigars they want the boutique cigars and they want new varieties and new tastes and uh and styles and for many years it was\nBudweiser it was ... was Miller was perhaps some regional beers you didn't see people drank their beer they were they stayed towards one brand\nIt was really more of a commodity and then about Fifteen Years ago we started to seek ... come in a different crowd where people said I Want to try things that are different that are unique I Want something more flavorful a little bit more complex\nAnd all of a sudden this craft industry has just exploded and it's changed the face of the beer industry permanently\nAgreed um I think you know a lot of industries craft in general not just here I mean you know Twenty years ago how many different kinds of coffee could you get\nRight now you see all types of Iran or you know everything and speaking of Brett I'm Glad you brought that up and I should say that uh we're conducting cigar October fest Megan tasting maneuvers from these radical works in the heart of the border city the cigar city of Tampa but rather for master brewer\nIs our guest this entire cigar October fest mega tasting show talking about a bread than and some interesting case\nFound this which I thought was really interesting there is a couple of things number one is planters peanuts has unveiled a new beer called Mr I. P. A. nuts and they've teamed up with a new one whistle brewery to create their first beer brewing with\nWalk up to an ... hops delivers a citrus aroma any hint of honey roasted peanuts I Would think they probably want to drop the honey roasted is right in the beer so that's kind of interesting yeah ah and another thing that I saw\nThat there was actually a company that if I can find it here that is actually starting to brew beer from used bred mhm so you can really make beer from any rain correct um or is that kind of an experimental really way out kind of beer\nUm I think it stems from a old Russia America ... boss\nWell here it is it's called a ... Canada yet a and it is a shuttle recalled second harvest they route five hundred cases to raise funds and call attention to Its Food rescue efforts throughout Canada the beer is called been a slice B. E. and so being a slice\nSold a select stores around Toronto uh and basically it says the concept of making beer for bread dates back to the origin of beer\nAnd in Europe which is significantly ahead of North America in their management of food waste beer brewing from Brett is starting to emerge so interesting they supplied Toronto's prairie boy bakery supply two hundred pounds of bread or two a week old for the project\nCommon good beer company handle brewing charge bringing a chores butterfly she's only five ingredients water barley multi bread hops and ...\nIt needs the latter because the two hundred degree baking process would have killed all used in the bread so simple science is what they say apparently from what critics are saying is pretty good so interesting so again people are using they're just being very creative and you didn't have that creativity\nThen we've got a let's see the Ridgway Santa's bought [noise]\nA quarter the winter Porter just the name alone sent this but I said I got a ...
