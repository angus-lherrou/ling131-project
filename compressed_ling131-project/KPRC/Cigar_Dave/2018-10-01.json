American oak barrels that is gone scotch ... industry in Scotland\nAnother thing is even though it's been a number of fifty one percent all these whiskey is that I have that I'm looking here at now majority of them are going to be around Seventy may be a higher on Seventy six percent corn and gives it that you know unique just hit that flavor profile data\nRoma and then you have whether it's dry or some malted barley blended in that you're going to get a good batch of corn as we train these\nAre the first American Spirit was actually rye whiskey and then bourbon came on the scene a little bit later and we have included a number of rise and when you talk about rise as opposed to a urban tends to be a bit sweeter rye is a sharper spicy or taste on the power sure\nPlus why we'll give you that bites mc ... if you'd like as spicy whiskey go for a ride spicy\nAnd a lot of ... on the way down now bourbon whiskey when we look at where the name is derived from originally comes from the French a house of bomb although the precise inspiration for the whiskey his name is still unsettled are those that say\nBourbon county in Kentucky and then there's those those that say well it's the house of bourbon Bourbon Street in New Orleans which is also a name for the dynasty but we do and don't know which one is true but we do know that bourbon has been distilled since the Eighteenth\nCentury and the term bourbon for whiskey has been traced to the Eighteenth twenties and began to be used consistently in Kentucky in the Eighteen or Nineteen twenties and then used in Kentucky and Eighteen Seventy seven when we look at the\nBourbon industry in Kentucky\nIs incredible how large it is\nBourbon is a nine billion dollar signature industry and Kentucky over Eighteen thousand jobs payroll nearly a billion dollars when we look at a bourbon production it has increased over two hundred and fifty per cent\nSince Nineteen Ninety nine and Ninety nine there were four hundred and fifty five thousand burble of bourbon barrels\nThat were filled\nIn two thousand sixteen almost one point six million so it's really incredible and bourbon inventory in Kentucky has now topped over seven million barrels highest\nSince the early Nineteen seventies there are now over one point five barrels of bourbon aging in Kentucky for every person living in Kentucky so there's more bourbon barrels\nThat people in Kentucky which really is a an amazing amazing thing and Kentucky bourbon Tennessee whiskey export surged more than ten percent the last number of years it's the largest export category among all us distilled spirits with over a billion dollars in recipe and the Kentucky bourbon trail\nWhich I Know you visited some audio Dave one of the hottest tourist attractions in the country almost a

there are members of the hair because we have thirty two at any one given time in the Arab and I think I counted about Ninety seven bottles and I think I brought about Fifteen or Eighteen she did a day so just like Kentucky there are actually more barrels aging than there are people\nAt the pleasure ... bottles of bourbon in American whiskey and there are members of the Arab which tops out at thirty two so little side no they're not American\nWhiskey or which we're also going to be sampling today can also include\nRye whiskey rye bolt whiskey wheat whiskey Tennessee whiskey corn whiskey and we've seen an increase in the number of whiskey is that are using wheat and uh and that really teams things up a little bit my smoothness and we've even seen I think Jack Daniels uses a little bit

system so have you can find it by it\nAll right well some new spirits that uh you will be able to find and buy a come from or will be coming from the state of Alabama\nNow what's interesting is Alabama not exactly known to be distilling mecca but we have got Peter Corey\nA comic go rich distillery in Alabama they are the distillers or will be the distillers of Clyde Mays bourbon Peter you're from Syracuse my work where I met a lot of Syracuse University so we have a lot in common\nThat's correct and uh we were talking earlier about the change in weather that's occurring up there now and talking to some of my old friends or they're kind of putting away their uh pools in boats and they're getting ready and fire up there ah snow blowers for the oncoming onslaught and we know that all

okay so Clyde\n... a real person I was born in Nineteen twenty two\nAt the age of Thirteen he discovers when Chinese from southeastern Alabama around Troy, Alabama and a goes officers at the age of Twenty one the army comes home decorated veteran a Purple Heart bronze stars starts a big family he's a farmer a logger hand\nAmong shine or discovers one shining and as a means of helping his family are sustain themselves and so he really has from Nineteen forty six until Nineteen Seventy one at twenty five year run\nAnd um he's not just your average moonshine are what he's doing which is much different is he's actually taking some of his moonshine and he's putting it in ready American white oak chard barrels at the time that's revolutionary but he's doing and then he's using it as as Christmas Offerings for his friends\nAt the end of the process through discovery of trial and error he finds it by taking a green apple slices baking them and putting them in at the end that that are in parts a little bit of smoothness to the whiskey hence the Alabama style is born\nAnd so that's where the Alabama style comes from and we pay homage to Clyde ... who by the way never sold all legal bottle of whiskey in his life\nUh we pay homage to him by putting you know his pictures and his family on every label so proud heritage\nFantastic now you're building a distillery there were here

a hundred and fifty two years of Jack Daniels of distilling and I asked the question does anybody know\nOr how many years Alabama's been celebrating legal to spelling and and and you know the answer is that they legalized distilling in November two thousand Thirteen they got a little bit of catching on way to go yeah\nWhat what slides son Kenny did in two thousand one to take the brand illegal since they didn't like being pursued by the law is he took it up to Kentucky\nAnd he was getting his recipe made up there and then he was bringing it back and distributing it and they did that for about a dozen years\nAre really as a regional brand and it wasn't until the group that I'm with stepped in and two thousand fourteen and purchased it and ah he took it to the next level\nDistribution
