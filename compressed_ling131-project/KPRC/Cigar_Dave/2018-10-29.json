hops and ... and it's still in existence today and it's a master brewer first of all tell us how did you get involved and becoming a master brewer how do or how does one say you know what I Love beer not want to ...\nI don't know from the master brewer but I Do brew beer for a living and loving very much um my career kind of started out as a hobby that spiraled out of control into a career or like\nMany people they they ... they have beer and then next thing you know you're a professional\nYet brewed beer at home for many years I worked in kitchens and so Fifteen um decided it was something that I wanted to do full time went to the Siebel Institute of Chicago and their sister school ... and Nick\nAnd I worked for Thirteen Years for a company called the iron he'll brewery in the Philadelphia area okay I'm open for their locations before I a jump ship and came to live in this place\nAnd how did you uh uh hook up with a ...\nUm I was introduced to Jay Paul through a close friend of mine Casey cues the head brewery at ... right down the street\nGotcha so uh you made the trek from the great white north down to the sunshine state and there you go and I should say the aromas here this is interesting because it's not just like a a brewery you've got incredible food here uh and so you've you've really married\nThe food aspect with the beer aspect are very popular place in the short eight months that ... works has been open yeah so far so good we have a lot to ... or you go it's all about uh enjoying the good life and certainly beer cigar October fest part of the good life let's talk about first of all a beer\nThe ingredients that we talked about basically there is a barley there is a we there's water there is used to talk about making beer the basic ingredients and the process\nOkay um so those are the four main ingredients as you said um we start with what you call them ... say you crack open the has the barley in the wheat you still getting water for a certain amount of time and what you're doing is you're converting converting all starches into sugar\nReason you want to do that as the east which is a life for the beer can eat starches bay Kenny sugars\nOkay I'm which creates alcohol so after you converted you strain of the liquid from the grain into cattle you boil it you had the hops which are basically the spices of beer that give you some bitterness and bounce all the sweetness\nAnd also flavor aroma I'm cool it down you put into a tank you add the east east hates the sugars and produces alcohol and see a tip\nThey made it sound very simple but it's really not that simple because it does take time a soccer two primary types of beer there's loggers and ... what are the differences are the\nType of east use say yeah so there's two families ... forces the beard is you know it's a living thing it was used for baking for making spirits and specialist for making bread but the two main families or loggers nails a logger eat likes to\nTo work very a cold and slow and it affects the flavor of the finish beer very balanced and cleaning Chris I'm Ellie east a little faster and warmer and produced a little bit more of the spices and a free characters and ... and ... and such\nNow ill takes longer to brood than it does lawyer correct\nUm L L for men's quicker than loggers lottery all the all the other way around it takes a long time that's why we see many people that are home brewers they do ales they don't do like loggers are much more delicate okay loggers what a top fermenting or bottom fermenting or that is the bottom from bottom from running in the air was the top fermenting she'll give us a time difference between ale and lock\n'em for the same here same alcohol content to average it'll be about two weeks or the same loggers about for\nNow many people think logger is a milder a beer than an ale is that correct I'm\nIn a way it is more different it's more cleaning Chris you have less of a fruity spicy character as ... as you get with typical ales\nAnd so when we look at most of the big selling beer we talk about Budweiser and ... and ... those are primarily loggers touch it and then the ales which we've seen really a renaissance on the craft brew side\nOf those have just exploded no we talk about ALS there's some there's a pale ale then we see like a what a red tail and then there's an eye PA India pale else talking about those differences\nUm you know there there are other there are always saying based in a way they're being seen you face red tail you're having a lot more of a ... that's going to be your primary flavor and what how people associate with that beer\nOr the pale ale and ... are really characterized by the use of hops so happy for bitterness flavor and aroma\nNow I ... back before there was a refrigeration weren't the hops the PDAs created to preserve the beer correct or in transport back with the the British merchants way back\nYep that's true it was basically a beer born out in that city they they use the hops preservative is for the long voyage um you know from England to India and um you know when all the\nWhen when all the soldiers got back to England they wanted their India bailout and they wanted a stronger happier beer 'cause that's what they have been drinking and it kind of birth that style\nWhat are the most popular beers around the world is getting us which is what a shout out yeah so we've got stout and porters and everybody looks at those are dark thinking it's going to be super super a strong and that's not necessarily the case you know\nThere's less alcohol and ... and Budweiser\nI did not realize that so what's the difference between a talking about a ... an importer\nDownton porters are both ales they're very similar um I think especially the one thing that makes a difference to me the Porter in doubt as his dad has ... Porter doesn't but they both had the dark mall and the roasting Neddy coffee chocolate character to them\nAnd we've got a couple of those supporters in St out in the beers that will be sampling I'll go with that list in just a moment also another beer that's become very popular we fear tends to be a little bit softer ... on the Palin yet we're seeing more of that\nEspecially in this climate down here um you know more refreshing um softer and you know suited for warm weather drinking\nWe have seen an explosion the last guy to be ten Fifteen Years in terms of craft ruin people\nJust like cigars they want the boutique cigars and they want new varieties and new tastes and uh and styles and for many years it was\nBudweiser it was ... was Miller was perhaps some regional beers\nYou didn't see people drank beer they were they stayed towards one brand\nIt was really more of a commodity and they're not Fifteen Years ago we started to seek ... come in a different crowd where people said I Want to try things that are different that are unique I Want something more flavorful a little bit more complex and all of a sudden this craft industry has just exploded and it's changed\nThe face of the beer industry permanently\nAgreed um I think you know a lot of industries craft in general not just here I mean you know Twenty years ago how many different kinds of coffee could you get right now you see the types of Iran or you know everything\nAnd speaking of Brett I'm Glad you brought that up and I should say that uh we're conducting cigar October fest mega tasting maneuvers from these radical works in the heart of the border city cigar city of Tampa ball Rutherford master brewer\nIs our guest this entire cigar October fest mega tasting show talking about a a bread than and some interesting case\nFound this which I thought was really interesting there is a couple of things number one is planters peanuts has unveiled a new beer called Mr I.

[noise]\n\nPretty good delicious pretty spooked yeah yeah they say medium to big body but I don't think so at all goes down so easy it really does get that honey ... yeah interesting almost a softness to it and if you will I didn't see what is the ...\nOr ... percent alcohol by volume and the idea was Twenty one\nAnd uh they followed district\nLines you got to say to get for rain Hoon skipping by don't scribble water barley mall top gee that's it that's it that's it take another ship on this very nice All right now we're going to do something a little bit on the phone side here one of the tasting\nMethods that I use selection methods of what beer that I should get what strikes you grab if I see a cool label or a funny name or something that grabs my attention I buy it well\nI found this one called sent this\nWinter quarter from Ridgway brewing and they said it couldn't be done but they did it centers but I'll tell you what I'm going to hold this I'm going to teach you all because I just enjoy seeing centers ...\nAnd it says ah let's see water\nA barley actually got different languages in here so it says one of our range of very special Christmas careers ruined in England for the usa we all know of course that Santa's really from lap land\nOkay whatever they say now this again is a Porter so let's talk about what a Porter is\nA poor is definitely a dark Rosedale usually has some chocolate ...\nThis is I mean pitch black cheers on this and this looks like a gossip espresso yep\n\nThis is very very tame pretty good I mean I'd be used as like a four there is no bitterness do it is very very smooth and it's six percent alcohol by volume\nBut you never know it just doesn't just very smooth it's almost I hate to say this is almost a little pedestrian\nLittle mundane I think it's a it's a it's more of a classic south Porter I think yeah they also make some other beers called up bad health they've got the blackout with a very bad al seriously battle criminally bad health insanely bad health a lump of coal centers but\nWhich are again just made for when it says Richard warming I'll tell you what would probably be interesting on this if you warm this beer up\nServe that are maybe put a little bit of dollop of this and some warm coffee that could work you know or if you've got a little sore throat or a little sniffles your ... take another ... taste here [noise]\n\nYeah it's just nothing uh you know nothing nothing overly crazy I mean it's just not as crazy as a name yeah exactly so overall relatively pleasant or would I go and buy this and consume this on a regular basis no what is it worth it to say hey we tried Santa's what why not winter Porter\nThe answer is absolutely\nFantastic All right so we've got that now next up we're going to go to\nA beer that is from Belgium Stella up wa premium logger beer it is a name that is\nPretty well known I mean I was a very popular beer been going for a long time so tell us about what you do about ... ...\nVisited the brewery many years ago this one and I was in school in Europe I Know it's a classic um you know European logger you know well loved by many people across the world I haven't had one for a while truthfully\nAren't what let's open it up let's give it a try you can never go wrong let's hear will open that bad boy up\nI think they're marketing Everytime they the one of their posters I Want to drink on the job but they're marketing\nVery smart man on the nose nothing special say cheers on that or we go we'll hit that and we'll take a sip\n\nYeah it's a it's a regular longer I mean again this is for the craft beer enthusiasts they will be disappointed in this fear for the average beer drinker\nAnd the United states that maybe want something a little bit more flavorful than a butter or course or Miller\nA and an imported beer this would be it a but again this is not going to be something where you're going to say man\nA lot of happiness a lot of bitterness lot of flavor comply you're just not going to say that but these are these are the most popular beers in the world they still sell more than anyone else and again when it's hot in the summer this is the kind of thing I Want a nice cool refreshing beer yeah this is kind of it so very nice I'll take another separate this [noise]\n\nYou know it's funny Paul because as we have some of these other beers that have a variety of hops that have a higher alcohol content some complexity the higher a international bitterness units when you go to a regular lawyer it almost is a relatively flat in terms of taste\nYeah your taste buds are kind of shocked to get all this flavored right intention you go back to that you're\nLike well what happened I mean that's it like I Need
