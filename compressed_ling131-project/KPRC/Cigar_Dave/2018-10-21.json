you know guess I just wanted I guess so and no one could I texted Nathan as you're cooking dinner was Monica said we don't have to do it right just let me know so eventually\nI feel sell ...\nAlas Andrew in bend to your number seven or eight might ask for cats various [noise]\nShe's [noise] she's participating [noise] gosh he may you\nKnow okay she's bringing the cat to the microphone again here that this is bad radio right now say here's what I wanted to ask you about actual some not that we haven't been talking about the topics but um I Know that we have a wedding coming up that\nSenses small and since this is both a Mulligan for both of us [noise]\nWe're not spending a lot of money on but we are spending it ourselves so here's my question to you\nInstead of uh yeah yeah I'm asking you for your permission instead of can the wedding be even smaller but I get a jet back and I promise of where the jet pack when I say my vows now 'cause you can get a jet pack for just under five grand a\nHundred and fifty miles an hour Eighteen thousand feet altitude\nWould it be awesome but his blasted into my mom's backyard and a jet pack\nJust blew all the tables over and everything and yeah and then burn your dress up and fight and more people\nSit and they would be able to witness\nIn charge or ... fifty bucks to to come to help pay for the jet back\nYeah now the wedding the idea of the wedding and consequential\nEnemy a good good wedding yeah okay\nSo here's what the house of weddings and go to just come wearing like swim trunks and your T shirts because Alice spent there is not going to be nice food is going to be hot dogs and\nBut it's not like good hotdogs with bonds were eating hot dogs straight up like poor style like we all did growing up with just the hotdog and ... and the bread buns or in the red the red slices did you ever do that\nI'm desperately\nYou know what let me tell you that here's a little story about about our past uh as\nAnd earlier my dad is\nWas wherever you want to look at it rest his soul Allen hamburger and when he by the time he came to Houston yes he was at a good point in his career but there was a time in my family where my mom had to crack open my brother's piggy banks to have enough money to go\nAnd get ice for the freezer or whatever she used to scrounge up money from the couch cushions where she could on hot days so that 'cause they couldn't afford to run the air conditioner to take the voice to the mall to be an air conditioning and get some ice cream cones for boys is a lot that's the law\nSo and so even though like my dad was on TV at that time\nWe he used to bring home a camera he brought home a camera couple of times from the from the TV station and the camera was worth like three times as washed the house as he put it in the living room and block it off with cushions and things you're not allowed in the living room because that camera\nIs worse like this whole neighborhood\nI don't know why would they give it to him and say well maybe he was doing a story on the road or whatever I just heard a few times and bringing\n... a camera home and just making us deathly afraid of it 'cause I\nAbsolutely one hundred percent believe that it was worth more than ...\nSo I Know about\nHotdogs and bread slices I Am not saying that\nAny great deal of my life was ever suffering we were not suffering especially by the time we came to king would my dad was ball or status channel Thirteen he did a really really good job like almost too good of a job of of being candid about money all he said about money with that money was a tool\nThat you that you use to\nTo live with or whatever but we never\nI never knew how much she may she never showed us how much she may we were mow the lawn front and back half acre for a\nDollar for our allowance a dollar a dollar ...\nAnd he we liked how can we have five bucks you want to ride our bikes to rentals washing my car five dollars you know we only when we started asking her friends like when we moved to a king would wish for those if you don't always kind of an affluent kind of community the first few Christmases we are friends would call what did you\nGet like a super Nintendo in the south in dollars into all these ... like\nWhat how light surely we're in the same town all my life we were I was mad at my mom and dad but I was like what are you oh I thought that everyone who lives in a community like made the same amount of money but all that was different was\nThat my parents had raised us all shoe straps at the beginning and was not excessive my dad was the only rolling through king ... or ... or ... and a half million dollar houses rolling a in a Volkswagen our neighbors had allergies and Mercedes and\nReally nice cars and my dad I say I don't like to ask them what I said why don't you ever get like a\nFerrari Europe or uh\nI I don't even know a badly your big Mercedes or something like that he left his ass off he goes I have five Ferrari is\nMeeting five children yeah that's what I was going to ask him and then and then he added to that yet and then he added to it why it just his words why the hell what I Need a Ferrari ... you don't need a Ferrari that was like yeah\nThe point that I felt really do he's alive and by Ferraris or\nKiss or expensive so my dad was very practical even though he was doing well at the end you know when we came to king would [noise] we we work hours to get a thousand dollars a Christmases that's ridiculous sort of like you for being on either radio anytime by the way I Love

he not defend men he sat hunch didn't hurt and he listened right 'cause this angry clearly mentally unstable to whack a doodle\nMade this guy this her husband feel like a like nothing basically made him feel like the beta he probably is I continue for a moment it occurred to me to be grateful that I'm married to a man who will listen to a woman\nThe winds calmed ever so slightly in that moment

unfortunately and and kind of saw the or riding on the wall and wanted to\nUm make a career change in this uh this opportunity popped up and\nOne thing led to another and I was uh on my way to Boston a shipping up to Boston as they say right um so\nI've been out here for almost eight years now and just a building redound and um you know trying to ah trying to grow this thing into the into the leading publication in the state\nSo you're California guy living in Boston so you're not a patriots fan but I'd be thrilled assuming it oh\nIn ... you'd be incorrect because I Want to be hurt your patriots fan while I went to high school the same high school as Tom Brady so I've actually been following the patriots or for quite some time since since he took over the starting gig\nWorld bills fans here at the ... well surgeon Steve is is the Bengals fan but but uh uh myself and some of our other crew were diehard builds spreads so I've been out in California what what part of California did you grow up\nSo grew up in northern California I grew up in San Mateo just outside of the city um and spent my whole life there went to college at Santa Clara university I'm stuck around Silicon Valley for a few years and that's kinda right\nAh in that area when I was living in that area is when I really started developed a passion for craft beer\nChris for an hour the editor of ... dot com joins us as we celebrate cigar October fest talking about the state of the beer industry and just kind of looking at trends and taste and what's going on so Chris ... tell us about ... how did you uh how long has that been around in a ... I'll tell you the website is fantastic ... tons and tons of information\nWhich I enjoy it so I'm One of my book mark pages that I a scholar every week stuff's about ...\nYeah so a brood on his part of a large organization called ... ah we're a business to business trade company we posed a business conferences around the country we have three different websites\nOne for a non alcoholic beverage professionals one for um a food professionals and one for beer professionals and we publish daily a brew bound I think was launched um you know right around two thousand ten thousand eleven at the time it was just sort of a a pet project internally\nFor a couple of guys here um who are who are super into beer and they didn't really um you know how much\nDirection or you know what they wanted to do with it at the time um and our our owner John ah you know kind of took the project on and said let's expand and into the beer space and\nUm yeah it it sort of transition from more of a a blog site into a full fledged a daily news publication um so I came on board I think my uh my first day was a gosh uh January\nTenth two thousand eleven [noise] um and I think that week we had I don't know maybe a hundred or a hundred and fifty people visit the site and now we're going to have over five million page views this year\nIncredible it is a great site tons of information and when we look at the explosion of the beer industry specifically it's really been the craft beer movement\nThat has really provided all the growth and I think it's a testament to that is the fact that the big boys if you can't beat them join them and you've seen in ... Bush we should all the the big guys come in and start to acquiring\nA number of these craft brewers or or boutique brewers and uh they're there and and so it's kind of an interesting\nWave of what is going on right now and there seems to be a little backlash from some of the a diehard craft brewing aficionados [noise]\nYeah so over the last few years I'd say I mean you you can sort of trace back much of the merger acquisition activity to [noise] um I'd say two thousand I think it was two thousand eleven when\nGoose island or was purchased by an ... or Bush um and that was really sort of their first their first acquisition and I don't think they even really new kind of what they were going to be doing I'm In the craft space when when they bought the silent out of Chicago I'm In their strategy\nDidn't really develop until a few years after that I'm so they sort of a plot at a course for a regional strategy buying breeze in different areas of the country I'm In fact in in Tampa where you are they a game really really close to a purchasing cigar city\nUm ... yeah and and that deal fell through 'em and suggested he ended up selling to a different um craft brewery collective uh called can already um which was formed a by the founder of of Oscar booth out to Colorado\nAs well as a private equity firm here in the Boston area firemen capital partners so\nUm you know ... we've seen a lot of deals as obviously Anheuser Busch has gotten into the states pretty heavily spent a lot of money and inquired about ten different breweries or Miller corps has a few breweries that they've purchased over the last couple of years a constellation has three breweries a funky Buddha and your neck of the woods um that I purchased\nUm Heineken purchase logging need it so\nI'm everyone sort of has a their their craft a brewery horse if you will and the race um and then we've also seen a lot of transactions on the private equity side so\nI'm you know really since I got into the space or it's been sort of a flurry of a ... a activity it it really picked up um you know twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen slowed a little bit last year and it's been\nA relatively quiet this year as well as everybody plates are pretty\nMuch full Chris wrote Ari editor ... dot com is our guest Chris it's interesting you mentioned the some of the company cigar city brew enjoy reading or we do very well we've done numerous shows from there we've kind of watched as she's gone from a very small operation into\nA large state wide now certainly more of a regional type of distribution I'm southern tier brewing\nWho you mentioned talking about some private equity getting involved southern tier now purchased I think ah another ... and I want to see Charlotte if I'm not mistaken or somewhere or Philadelphia or maybe and uh so they've now kind of gotten together a you mentioned funky Bhutto we've done we've had them on and in fact they were involved in our ... flight line\nLast year there beers are phenomenal and it's very interesting so what we're seeing is these really creative\nA entrepreneur brew master types and and and just entrepreneur is that come up with these just totally different unique tastes and packaging ideas the big guys come in and the concern is always\nOkay are they gonna do to those companies what they normally do whereas they buy successful company they buy it because it's successful ... because it's got a great marketing dish and then all of a sudden they say well we're smarter we've got more MBAs we're going to tweak it and then they kinda destroy the company\nThere's always that uh the balance the seas starting to happen [noise]\nI'm not so much I think uh we've actually seen sort of the opposite I'm you\nKnow I think it would be kinda foolish to spend as much money as they they've spent on these companies and then you know want to run into the ground or um you know jettisoned them somehow I don't think that they're\nThey're buying these uh these properties to somehow kill the category of ... which is\nI guess um you know a a misnomer um they're buying grows they're buying brands that are\nUh that that consumers are gravitating towards ... and they want to participate in the segment so we we haven't seen that quite as much um now that being said I think that\nThey may be misunderstood a kind of where the market was going in some cases so if you look at constellation for instance\nThey spent a billion dollars buying Dallas point out of San Diego thinking that they'd be able to have this national a craft beer brand and you know kind of scale it and that consumers would um you know continue to love the ... brand at a national level and\nReally what we've seen since that transaction is uh the hyper local as a nation of craft and um\nYou know the the ... that are the the larger companies that purchase breeze in different pockets of the country and focus more on regional strategy you're actually faring a bit better\n[noise] [noise] yeah you know your interesting mentioning talking about the local type of craft brewers are very close to the ah John sheet resource senior or junior of Hamburg brewing up in the buffalo area\nAnd there you know mark and really primarily as western New York and\nAnd you know Rochester buffalo going down almost eerie Pennsylvania and they've created some great beers and they've got a great a great niche and and really what they do in that area is so unique that they get people coming all the way from across the country to visit their tap room and that's another phenomenon that we're seeing\nYeah a lot of these these craft brewers create these tap rooms and there was a large contingent of ah of beer connoisseurs that on weekends travel all over the country to check out their tap rooms and go to these breweries and end and sample beers from all over the country\nYeah absolutely I think um you know an interesting that that that I'd like to point out is that\nYou look at some of the from last year the the fifty fastest growing breweries in twenty Seventeen um were significantly smaller than you know some of the the brands that we've already talked about today and um you know many of the brands that anybody would recognize so\nUm the uh I I Believe the average uh annual production for the fifty fastest growing breeze last year was under a thousand barrels was nine hundred and sixty three barrels of beer\nGuard officers club selection this one is geared towards the end is unclear including the artist tour bus risk beauty is bigger

B. E. M. to soften the Buffalo News here's the headline from a two days ago new craft breweries have opened in western New York with lots more planned in coming months\nThey're looking at a one two three four five six seven eight about eight to ten new cap rooms and some micro breweries are and in fact what's interesting is there's ... house that they've been working on trying to open for the last\nI think I don't know three four years and getting investors and a ... brewing actually which is based in Buffalo they're opening their own ... brew house so it's kind of interesting to see how in in pockets of the country\nThe enthusiasm for beer and brewing houses and tap rooms is a is still still growing\n[laughter] yeah you know I think um it to me it's looking more and more kind of like a restaurant business uh right you know if you think about\nUh just the way that ah these breweries are financed and you know the way that lenders operate to um you know they're they're lending a significant amount of money\nTo actually build out so they're spending on construction to build out the ability to build out the tap rooms and then you know make them look beautiful and and that's not money that a bank that we're getting back um so it is very similar to the restaurant business right there's not a whole lot of\nAssets that they're that they're actually financing other than the equipment I'm so ... in in my opinion or any of these operations that started up I think that they should be trying to do it as lean it possible take on as little as possible and open as quickly as possible and start selling\nBeer directly to consumers at the highest margin possible so that they can service that debt and get you know quickly get to profitability\nRight and and you know what's interesting is when you look at some of them look at pictures of some of these places a picture of community beer works up in Buffalo that open this past summer\nAnd again nice or interior not overly crazy uh but that seems to be now the place where people you know want to congregate and hang out not necessarily a a a you know club where there's banging music and it's just loud and didn't you know crazy life\nIt seems there's been a shift it's almost like the ... of yesteryear and this is what you see now it's more of a socialized social atmosphere\nAnd I think you are right on the head that if you can open up\nNot go crazy you don't have to be the biggest you don't have to be the best you don't have to have a three million dollar build out in fact a lot of the successful ones are the ones that are very cozy and quaint they they just make good beer and and people will go regardless of you know whether it's a three hundred thousand dollar build out or a a ... three million dollar bill that\nYeah exactly I think the bigger question though for me at least is you know how sustainable that model is um you know\nIf you have a two breweries on on a on a city block and then two more open you know you haven't created any new customers now there's just for companies competing for the same customers that were walking down the street right so I'm\n... ... on one hand yeah they're bringing a lot of excitement and enthusiasm the category but on the other hand\nYou know that the industry risk kind of turning it back on traditional bars and restaurants and if so you know what the ramifications of that you know five ten Fifteen Years down the road\nWhat we've seen a number of restaurants that have actually gone and within the restaurant creating a small you know almost micro micro brewery just to create some of their own beer and a kind of as an attraction and we've seen that a number of restaurants here in the\nIn these cigar city of Tampa but I'm seeing that more and more where restaurants are looking saying you know what we want to get in on this action we don't want to go crazy\nBut they're still kind of unique market to do that\nYeah absolutely I mean I think you know we we talked about the opening and closing more breweries are going to continue to open for sure I mean\nSeeing you know I think what like two two and a half breweries opening per day is is the is the clip 'em and and that will probably continue in ... into next year I don't know when exactly it'll slow down many people think that\nUh there could be as many ten thousand breweries and brew pub throughout the United states here very ...\nCertainly um and most of those again are going to be pretty small tapper and focused or like the ones that that are mentioned in that\nArticle from from New York so it'll be interesting to kind of see how it all shakes out in long term you know how many of these businesses survive I think you know the big the big looming question over all this is like can we get more consumers to drink beer at a time when beer sales are you know overall relatively flat because\nYou know if you think about it just like a bar you can stick more cats in the wall but that doesn't mean you're going to sell more beer you still have to get more consumers and your door right so the same kind of rule or theory applies to the to the broader industry yeah you can have ten thousand breeze but if you're not creating new consumers than you know who's drinking all the beer\n[noise] Chris ... dot com joins us today as we celebrate cigar October fest Chris let's take a look at some of the breweries that are really starting to expand that have been successful in their own markets that maybe\nYou are are are a ton of shores are ... that are listening should be on the lookout for I Know for example Brooklyn Brewery started in Brooklyn they've now grown to do I think we're twenty nine or ... states across the country but give us some names of breweries that are really starting to grow\nThat we may be able to find their products that we haven't been able to the last number of years yeah for sure\nUm there are a few that comes to mind a you know if you think about\nUh now that the the trend is obviously more local right so a lot of these companies that are growing um tend to have tighter distribution footprint so access to their beers or for a lot of your listeners might be a bit of a challenge um but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Cigar Dave", "city": "Houston", "day": "21"}
