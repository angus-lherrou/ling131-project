most believer and we must we this is a tragedy we must believe her why do we have to believe someone let us look at the evidence and the evidence that has been presented and my feeling was that I stayed at this I think last week or the week before let's hear what Christine Blasey Ford has to say\nShe's making this accusation great she also stated that she had witnesses let's hear what they had

I was at a light pale ale yeah\nAnd then but then just yards ... got\nYou know but um you know in the in the late eighties we were making different stuff\nSo actually um you know we start making some scouts Kalamazoo style pork or\nUh in Nineteen eighty eight we made our first cherry stout a Great Lakes cherry stout and I actually had a bottle of that original bachelor last week at the rear beer tasting uh the pines for press states where you're casing in Denver we auction that often I share that\nWith the winter so it was thirty year old bottle of beer it was pretty interesting\nLarry bell the founder of bills brewing in Kalamazoo, Michigan our guest that Larry when things really start to because of it at that time your beer is primarily distributed just wanting to Kalamazoo or area or in Michigan [noise]\nMichigan I think we started selling I'm In uh Madison, Wisconsin about eighty nine Ninety a Chicago about Ninety and in ... Indiana but you know I was driving you know a lot of that was being driven by the brewery by me or somebody else\nInto Chicago I mean even in Michigan you know we started I used to drive all over the place delivering beer to get it out there and be sold so I'm rooted\nAnd yet you delivered it you kind of did everything [noise] yup absolutely\n... and and at that point when things start really expanding going from just kind of Michigan did than Wisconsin when things really start to kind of blossom and really start to explode\nOh you know probably a Ninety to Ninety four things really start to go\nI'm and I'm\nYou know ... started having a wholesalers that wanted to pick up the beer so um and in fact some of the things that you've seen recently happened to us way back when like we were shipping beer to Virginia and all of a sudden Michigan finally\nFigures out what's going on and we had to we had to step ship and Virginia in the nineties so we could take care of Michigan\nI'm no you know eventually we got back to Virginia but um\nYou know yeah things really start going there and ah [noise]\nIn uh Nineteen Ninety three we become the first brewery in Michigan to sell beer by the class to the public I got the law changed to allow basically brew pub legislation and if you go to that legislation that's what really explodes things in the state of Michigan for new ... opening\nWere and all of a sudden you can sell the beer right at the brewery instead of having to ship it to a distributor where people really you know couldn't sampled right debris because there is I think there is a\nA a romance with being able to go where the brewery is see the brewery and an inexperienced of beers and maybe some special bears that you can just by where you can do all sorts of sampling and really get into that debris environment I think there's something very a romantic about it\nOh absolutely people of being able to touch it so you know our first you're eight years of existence we couldn't sell beer by the glass at the brewery we could sell to go we could give it away for free which is what we did but\nKnow people don't remember that that that's the past of course everybody thinks you have a ... you have a tap room that wasn't the case back when I started\n[noise] [noise] yeah and what's interesting is a lot of these states now have all figured it out same thing in Florida\nA and many other states so like hey wait a minute this is actually good for tourism this is good for business good for tax revenue\nWe need to kind of you know get into the twenty first century and uh\nI Do the same thing here with a cigar city brewing joy ride nerves the same deal or they were able to finally open a a pub tap room right at their brewery and people come from all over the place just like people come from across the country when they're in Kalamazoo to check out or you're ...\nYeah the the one place I think that we did maybe we've got an issue not only in Michigan but across the country is you have people that are set setting up now fake breweries\nSo they've got a license Mike rubbery and now they set some other place up with a five gallon home brew get where they never brew and they just ship it there so they become the kind of\nThey're fake brewery I'm ...
