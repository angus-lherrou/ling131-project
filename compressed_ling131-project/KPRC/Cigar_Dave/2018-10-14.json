uh we extend wishes to him and his entire family as well sergeant Steve thank you for reminding me but there was an attack on Mitt there's no question about it and\nYou can say that the Christine\nBlasey Ford lousy forward however you pronounce it that coming out after capital but that was the start this goes way way before that there has been an attack on men and on masculinity going back forty fifty years but it is intensified the last number of years with this contrived statement called toxic\nMasculinity that all of a sudden if\nYou are born a male than you are born with a toxic masculinity gene in your body\nThat when you are born a mail from the time you come out of the womb than you are a future sexual predator your future criminal that's how some of the ultra ultra left\nWing feminists the nut cases the whack a doodles that we're seeing on the ultra left the socialist lives that's exactly what we are seeing now\nAnd so we are seeing not only that but we have seen the intersection of political correctness with now the war and attack on men\nCan be a perfect example of Winston Churchill one of the great leaders political leaders in history one of the great statesmen of all time went in the face of the German Nazi invasion he stood tall inspired\nInstilled confidence of course it helped with the United states of America\nAnd other allied nations including Canada and the other allies but really the United states let's face it United States and secondarily Canada we came to save European ally that says there's no ifs ands or buts but he instilled confidence shame we shall never ever ever surrender\nWinston Churchill always with a cigar and the the whiskey in hand and what is amazing is that\nWas very popular during the war after the war's popularity waned when he was out of office number of years later popularity sky rocketed there's no question that his popularity probably higher today than ever accept\nWhen it comes to the whack a doodle ultra lives that now seem to\nHijack the political correctness conversational maneuvers let me give you a perfect case in point\nX astronaut Scott Kelly\nHe and his brother astronaut Scott Kelly alpha male no ifs ands or buts you're an astronaut you go to space in my estimation you're an alpha male when I was growing up in the sixties late sixties early seventies I mean in Nineteen sixty nine I'm\nYou know it was five six years old and I remember when man landed on the moon I remembered Neil Armstrong Buzz Aldrin Michael collins Apollo eleven\nI remember vividly at my grandmother's house watching on their big zenith black and white TV with the space age remote can everything was space age back then everything was space age if you had tang was space age remember the the drink tank\nAnd I remember everybody said that every product that came out a new microwave radios\nTransistors it's because of the space program and a lot of it was a lot of it was but\nI remember everything was space age it's a new amount of space age men are radar range microwave a new space age refrigerator space age from everything was space age but I revered those asked what they were gods and today I still think those guys that are exploring the new frontier exploring space\nThere alpha males you going to pull seven ten geez you're an alpha male no question about it so Scott Kelly\nWas making a derogatory derogatory but making a negative in a polite way I Will say negative tweet negative comment about President Trump taking a victory lap at the swearing in the public swearing in ceremony of justice\nOr Kavanaugh at the White House earlier this week last Monday\nAnd Trump took a victory lap any kind of went after some of the critics and I thought Trump did a fine job I had no ifs no problems with it whatsoever there was an attack on Capitol\nBasically labeling him a rapist they sexual molester or sexual ... without any evidence\nAnd when people say well wait Christine Blasey Ford we she gets the presumption that that she's right and he's wrong no it's not how it works I'm Sorry and don't give me this be as well it's a job interview therefore the presumption that he is innocent until proven guilty does not exist no that's wrong too\nAnd the witnesses that she named every one of them including her very lifelong best friend a Democrat by the way came out and said I don't know I don't ever recall meeting Brett Kavanaugh we weren't at that party never happened\nAnd admitted that lazy Ford's people pressured her into changing her story and she said I'm not going to perjure myself pull the FBI everything got to give her credit\nPull the truth told the truth tell the truth you know get in trouble very simple\nSo Trump took a victory lap no problem okay in of course you've got the the lame stream media going after him and saying oh he was not magnanimous he was he was spiking the football oh please spare me well Scott Kelly excess route Scott Kelly for each\nOne of the greatest leaders of modern time sir Winston Churchill said in victory magnanimity I guess those days are over\nNow you look at that tweet okay he disagrees with Trump\nI thought it was actually a good treat I I thought hey look he made his point it didn't ... just basically said look quoting the great Winston Churchill and victory magnanimity and uh you know I always felt that when you're when you don't like the ball you win gracefully you lose gracefully\nMean Martin levy a a great hall of fame football coach of the Buffalo Bills had him on the show many times used to always say when you're when act like it when when you lose you lose gracefully\nThere is the right decorum so maybe Trump did spike the ball a little bit but it was not over the top it was not a noxious\nAnd I thought that Scott Kelly's tweet was appropriate well not so fast my friends all of a sudden he starts getting a lambasted and bombarded with negative tweets and replies critics saying that Churchill\nThe great leader who rallied Great Britain and the darkest days of World War two against the third Reich against the Nazis\nHelped lead the allies the allied victory over Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany\nWell all of a sudden\nScott Kelly gets bombarded with people associating Winston Churchill with Adolf Hitler why because they say that's Churchill was an imperialist and a columnist and they quite at him to Hitler and the next thing you know relatively quickly thereafter\nHe tweets a reply saying and I quote did not mean to offend by quoting Churchill my apologies I Will go and educate myself further on his atrocities racist views which I Do not support\nAre you kidding me this smacks you know when you take a stand and you you make a quote if people don't like it too bad\nA problem in this country as we apologize to quickly if you have an opinion and you believe in that opinion and you believe that Churchill was a great leader others may disagree\nI don't care if there's ten thousand people who disagree to your one who agree with with a statement you don't apologize if you have conviction in your statement if you believe in your statement do not apologize\nBe an alpha stand by your opinion I have many people that say I get emails saying well I disagree with your opinion you should apologize and my reply is I Believe in what I said I'm not going to apologize if you don't like it you can respectfully disagree with me I have no problem with it and I'm happy to debate you\nKnow most people will debate me because I have the facts on my side and what I usually make a comment is fact based but you may have your own opinion but the opinion of equating Winston Churchill\nThe leader of Great Britain during World War two equating him with a Nazi being a Nazi because he was an imperialist than a colonialist sorry that doesn't cut it and when Scott Kelly\nAlpha astronaut rolls over like a defeated dog that is to me unacceptable have the nets to say to all those people who disagree with me and our equating Churchill with being a Nazi I vehemently disagree with you you may disagree with me but\nMust be civil to each other we should not have you traveled and then that

Richmond, Kentucky to campaign for congressman Andy bars reelection as he has done in other rallies he went after the Democratic challenger in this case military veteran Amy McGrath\nUm but you're going to need some basic uh you know high drama there's you're going to need a bottle cap or a big spoon um and then patients\nUh you get a rush the hands of you know so once you start making your beer the whole process takes about thirty days so you'll have your official ... day which is usually three to four maybe five hours um\nAfter that you let your beer do his thing and just ferment I'm a you know to a certain temperature for a couple of weeks and then usually the bottle age or bottle condition after that you could also go to a keg which takes another week or two\nWell the nice thing about home brewing as opposed to well first of all it home brewing is one hundred percent legal as opposed to distilling your own distilled spirits meaning vodka or whiskey moonshine and there was a reserve a couple of reasons for that but first I think probably the most important is\nHealth and safety right right yeah and ... and distilling you could you could really mess some people up like you know poisoning um what were you could let yourself up as well you make it right and a bomb because I think there's two types of alcohol\nIt was what ether alcohol and evil and one is deadly\nIf I'm not mistaken correct that one is deadly in one you can drink one right okay right right and the key is you want to get the one that that you can drink it's okay but there's there's much more a regulation and that's why you see these moonshine are is it's technically illegal but home brewing is legal and Jeff ... or correction counter Meyer the master brewer a\n... a hundred percent legal\nVery different than distillation as we're talking about that that might nice and close I absolutely\nEven closer are absolutely much better much better than I thought it was a jarring so a very big difference and uh what type of people are you seeing coming in is there any specific age range or is it is more men than women using give us an idea of who's coming in here to actually learn how to home brew\nUm for the most part it's\nTwenty five to thirty five year old man and a little bit older I'm mostly people that have found that they either want to make it cheaper or they want to make something that they can't get it the breweries and they they want to have something seasonal for themselves so they can make\nFor each season for each day for each month or for an event or for a party they want to make there's they want to have their own thing going\nWell I think there's also something very cool and I think maybe a little bit a romantic about saying I'm a home brewer I brew my own fears where you have people at a party and you can sample some of their beers and people can actually be very proud of the offerings that they're serving absolutely\nIt is you know I think there's something there's a there's a wow factor to that oh yeah you\nCould address flavors you can do anything you want so you can make it a stronger as light dark heavy or you know barrel aged or whatever you like\nNow one of the people that we know mutually Phyllis ... who is uh he's noticed fill our blend on these cigar Dave show my producer for many years now helps us with creative services\nHe is a ... and here comes in here purchases home brewing supply and he is he's told me he said I I finished very high I didn't win of course I resident resident about it all the time\nBut the one thing he always tells me is that he loves to be able to experiment and try different things and I think that's probably the one commonality with home brewers is they want to try they want to have fun it's a hobby\nIs making some great here five years is is that one of those ... are pretty they're they're off the charts what so what makes a beer off the charts how does a home brewer able to be able to Bruce something to say that's off the charts\nWhat is it is it the audience is it how they all\nIn perspective and personal taste you know I I like uh I like I ... some people hate him you know I'm not a big stout guy uh but that's awesome people ever drank so to make a chart you know that\nFluctuates right either of you know is relevant to someone's taste I don't know how you can do that it's\nIt's all personal taste but overall what about the beer did you enjoy I'm probably the Roma the ... the clearing is to Chris Chris ... um\nThe overall flavor and you know his last I did I think it was a a a mango or something like that in there and it was\nJust full of flavor and again there is no right or wrong so you could have five home brewers coming up with an eye PA everyone's going to

perfect excuse for us to light up a fine cigar do some beer bearings and I'm looking at for magnificent beers here at average brew company downtown St Petersburg we're talking about home brewing one on one of the science\nOf brewing it is becoming increasingly popular hobby\nSo this week we're talking about everything you need to know about a home brewing the equipment you need to process so we welcome you back to avid route company downtown St Petersburg with Jeff Keller the owner and master brewer counter Myron I should say gentleman met\nThat downtown St Petersburg always experienced day renaissance in terms of restaurants and and housing and and activities but it's really become a beer epicenter a cool little micro center of beer activity\nTotally it is it's it's grown over the past few years um we've been here about four years um you know green bench kind of started the whole revolution around here and bringing in some different unique beers and and uh uh you know cycles following cage and they'll sale work saint Pete brewing\nUm instill going\nAnd you know what ... put up a map a cigar day dot com where we will put little pins on all the different breweries that are in the downtown St Petersburg area actually we're looking at one right now it's called the brewery bay I didn't realize just looking at the entire cigar city area Tampa Bay area the number of breweries\nBut ah there's a ton of 'em in downtown St Petersburg so if you're considering a visit\nDown especially between the months of like December and march perfect time if you're a beer enthusiasts some great places great restaurants the great Bruce pubs right here in downtown St Petersburg so we'll outlined that now\nOne of the things that you gentleman mentioned that brewing is all about time and temperature and as we learned in step to matching of the grains you\nBasically steep the grains whether it's a week or whether it's cracked barley in hot water between a hundred and forty two degrees and a hundred and fifty nine degrees and you both said time and temperature that's all brewing is about crucial\nAbsolutely I mean if you if you don't go long enough to not going to convert all the starches and then you're just going to have less alcoholic beer and if you go to long which isn't too much of a problem but you can start extracting slaves you don't actually want so\nNow or hour and a half at the temperature you one for the body are trying to find is really important to kind of nailed down and taking notes being sure you're you're repeating so if you make the same here again you can either not make the bad beer again or make the good beer again remember those composition\nBooks we used to have back in grade school where you write everything down they were kind of bound I Would say if you're going to be a home brewer that's a good investment to make because Everytime you make a batch I\nWould assume the exact amount the time the temperature so you could look back and take notes and say you know I liked that particular beer but let me try one degree more for maybe another few more minutes see what that does and then you hit that a ha moment\nWhere you get exactly the formulation you're looking to fulfilling I'm sure it is you're at [laughter] so when you brought your everything the exact same way absolutely have you know that I have an entire rest of your book full of just notation\nThroughout the whole process and that is guarded I noticed a very large fault as you walk into your medicine garden nobody's getting near there in fact there there's patrol dogs right right around the secret service [laughter]\nAll right so time and temperature key elements in brewing now after you match the grains and you said roughly what an hour mhm okay what's the next step\nSpar judging which ... is basically a fancy word for renting the grains out there who needs to rinse that sugar out of the grains that you've converted the starches you'd be brought into sugars now you're trying to rent although sugar's out into another pot or\nTake the grains outta that pot and runs the sugar side of the grains you just want to separate the grains from the show so you want the sugars out do you want the sugars in so that you can use that to boil oh so you want the shore trying to remove the grain\nOh so once the grain is done you don't need it anymore you know my understanding is that many breweries when I was up at ship your brewing they told me that uh they sell the remnants of the grains to various farm so they had continuous reviews in the area\nYeah you can make dog biscuits out of it too and I'm sure as\nMy chickens love it they'll go crazy after a while and then they'll they'll gorge on them\nSo it's like a dry just becomes like when you try it out it's just\nDry up it's pretty empty of any nutrition but it's just just grant is chickens like it into the compost compost is another alternative okay so here have a many major we give our brains to for his goats really mhm\nBasically there's no waste whatsoever constant recycling that's it All right fantastic so ... you are reducing the sugar out of the grains you're getting rid of the grains your retaining the sugar and the water ... which is called war ... W ... now we I've actually sampled the war and when it's warm\nHe's pretty good like a ... it's like a sweet tea rain T where we're at a uh did even brewing and and Mike Brian said try this I said boy the smell was incredible you could actually make a tea or a soup out who it was actually I thought it was just drink it in of itself we we bottled\nA couple of bottles of a I'm a black guy PA and it tasted just like a stout a non alcoholic stop because it doesn't have any alcohol in it um so it's it's pretty good stuff\nSo the word is basically the ... the sugars with the water\nOr after you have matched the grains so the ... of the sugar out and then you create the war and that's going to be the base of your beer absolutely okay so that's you're basically that's your stock that's your your ingredients right there that's the that that starts the process so now that you've got the war\nWhich usually is tastes sweet got these sugars in there you next go to the boiling component was boiling do\nWell boiling does a couple of things that sanitize it it evaporates things that you don't actually wants to know jazz\nJust useful things just things you're not actually going to need or just evaporate and also that rates water so condensed as it so you have a stronger sugar solution got stronger war yes gotcha also what it does is as you add hops throughout the boil the heat and the temperature actually\nChanged the hops into more bettering so long that you have the hops in the ... the more better they become the last time you have more flavor you have retained because as you boil the longer you're going to basically going to cook away all the flavors and aromas so you put in hops out the entire process to get different flavors romas veterans", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Cigar Dave", "city": "Houston", "day": "14"}
