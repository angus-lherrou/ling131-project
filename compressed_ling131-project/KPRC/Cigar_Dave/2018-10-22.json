right um so\nI've been out here for almost eight years now and just a building redound and um you know trying to trying to grow this thing into the into the leading publication\nIn the states so you're California guy living in Boston so you're not a patriot but I'd be thrilled assuming oh it'd be an ... you'd be incorrect because I have you heard your patriots fan\nI well I went to high

Steve is is the Bengals fan but but uh uh myself and some of our other crew were diehard builds spreads so ... in California what what part of California did you grow up\nSo now we're up in northern California grew up in San Mateo just outside of the city um and spent my whole life there went to college at Santa Clara university I'm stuck around Silicon Valley for a few years and that's kinda right ah in that area when I was living in that area is when I really started developed a passion for craft beer\nChris when are the editor Abreu bounded dot com joins us as we celebrate cigar October fest talking about the state of the beer industry and just kind of looking at trends and taste and what's going on so Chris ... tell us about ... how did you uh uh how long has that been around in a ... I'll tell you the website is fantastic ... tons and tons of information\nWhich I enjoy it it's on one of my book mark pages that I a scholar every week stuff's about ...\nYeah so a brief around as part of a large organization called ... or or a business to business trade company we host a business conferences around the country we have three different websites one\nFor a non alcoholic beverage professionals one for um a food professionals in one for beer professionals and we publish daily or ... I think was launched um you know right around two thousand ten thousand eleven at the time it was just sort of a a pet project internally\nFor a couple of guys here um who are who are super into beer and they didn't really um you know how much\nDirection or you know what they wanted to do with it at the time um and our our owner John ah you know kind of took the project on and said let's expand and into the beer space and\nUm yeah it it sort of transition from more of a a blog site into a full fledged a daily news publication um so I came on board I think my uh my first day was a gosh uh January tenth\nTwo thousand eleven um and I think that week we had I don't know maybe a hundred or a hundred and fifty people visit the site and now we're going to have over five million page views this year\nIncredible it is a great site tons of information and when we look at the explosion of the beer industry specifically it's really been the craft beer movement\nThat has really provided all the growth and I think it's a testament to that is the fact that the big boys if you can't beat them join them and he's seen in ... Bush we should all the the big guys come in and start to acquiring\nA number of these craft brewers or or boutique brewers and uh they're there and and so it's kind of an interesting\nWave of what is going on right now and there seems to be a little backlash from some of the a diehard craft brewing aficionados [noise]\nYeah so over the last few years I'd say I mean you you can sort of trace back much of the merger acquisition activity to [noise] um I'd say two thousand I think it was two thousand eleven when\nGoose island or was purchased by Anheuser Busch um and that was really sort of their first\nTheir first acquisition and I don't think they even really\nNew kind of what they were going to be doing I'm In the crafts face when when they bought the silent out of Chicago I'm\nIn their strategy didn't really develop until a few years after that I'm so they sort of a plot at a course for a regional strategy buying breeze in different areas of the country I'm In fact in in Tampa where you are they a came really really close to a purchasing cigar city\nUm ... yeah and and that deal fell through 'em and suggested he ended up selling to a different um craft brewery collective uh called can already um which was formed a by the founder of of Oscar booze out of Colorado\nA as well as a private equity firm here in the Boston area firemen capital partners so\nUm you know we've seen a lot of deals as obviously Anheuser Busch has gotten into the space pretty heavily spent a lot of money and inquired about ten different breweries or Miller corps has a few breweries that they've purchased over the last couple of years a constellation has three breweries funky Buddha and your neck of the woods\nUm that I purchased um Heineken purchased logging need it so\nI'm everyone sort of has a their their craft a brewery horse if you will and the race um and then we've also seen a lot of transactions on the private equity side so\nI'm you know really since I got into the space uh it's been sort of a flurry of a ... a activity it it really picked up um you know twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen slowed a little bit last year and it's been\nA relatively quiet this year as well as everybody plates are pretty\nFull Chris wrote Ari editor rebound dot com is our guest Chris it's interesting you mentioned the some of the company cigar city brew enjoy reading or we do very well we've done numerous shows from there we've kind of watched as she's gone from a very small operation into\nA large state wide now certainly more of a regional type of distribution I'm southern tier brewing\nWho you mentioned talking about some private equity getting involved southern tier now purchased I think ah another ... and I want to see Charlotte if I'm not mistaken or somewhere or Philadelphia maybe and uh so they've now kind of gotten together a you mentioned funky Buddha we've done we've had them on and in fact they were involved in our ... pleasure festival flight line\nLast year there beers are phenomenal and it's very interesting so what we're seeing is these really creative\nA entrepreneur brew master type ... and and and just entrepreneur is that come up with these just totally different unique tastes and packaging ideas the big guys come in and the concern is always\nOkay are they gonna do to those companies what they normally do whereas they buy successful company they buy it because it's successful ... because it's got a great marketing dish and then all of a sudden they say well we're smarter we've got more MBAs we're going to tweak it and then they kinda destroy the company\nThere's always that does that balance you see some of that starting to happen\n[noise] I'm not so much I think uh we've actually seen sort of the opposite I'm you\nKnow I think it would be kinda foolish to spend as much money as they they they spent on these companies and then you know want to run them into the ground or um you know jettisoned them somehow I don't think that they're\nThey're buying these uh these properties that somehow kill the category uh which is\nI guess um you know a a misnomer um they're buying grow they're buying brands that are\nUh that that consumers are gravitating towards ... and they want to participate in the segment so we haven't seen that quite as much um now that being said I think that\nThey may be misunderstood a kind of where the market was going in some cases so if you look at constellation for instance\nThey spent a billion dollars buying Dallas point out of San Diego thinking that they'd be able to have this national a craft beer brand and you know kind of scale it and that consumers would um you know continue to love the ballot brand at a national level and\nReally what we've seen in that transaction is ah the hyper local as a nation of craft and\nUm you know the the ... that are the the larger companies that purchase breeze indifferent pockets of the country and focus more on a regional strategy you're actually faring a bit better\nYeah you know you stink mentioning talking about the local type of craft brewers are very close to the ah John ... resort senior or junior of Hamburg brewing up in the buffalo area\nAnd there you know market really primarily as western New York and\nAnd you know Rochester buffalo going down almost eerie Pennsylvania and they've created some great beers and they've got a great a great niche and and really what they do in that area is so unique that they get people coming all the way from across the country to visit their tap room and\nThat's another phenomenon that we're seeing a lot of these these craft brewers create these tap rooms and there was a large contingent of uh of beer connoisseurs that on weekends travel all over the country to check out their tap rooms and go to these breweries and end and sample beers from all over the country\nYeah absolutely I think um you know an interesting that that that I'd like to point out is that\nYou look at some of the from last year the the fifty fastest growing breweries in twenty Seventeen\nUm were significantly smaller than you know some of the the brands that we've already talked about today and um you know many of the brands that anybody would recognize so um the uh\nGardening officers club selection this one is geared toward the end is simpler including the bill is our family was just doing some flavor and the room\nAnd ... you're not with with no creamy white clippers over in one piece of going ships directly do you each month long ago the guard David

B. E. M. just show up in the Buffalo News here's the headline from a two days ago new craft breweries have opened in western New York with lots more planned in coming months\nThey're looking at a one two three four five six seven eight\nAbout eight to ten new cap rooms and some micro breweries are and in fact what's interesting is there's ... house that they've been working on trying to open for the last\nI think I don't know three four years and getting investors and a ... brewing actually which is based in Buffalo they're opening their own ... brew house so it's kind of interesting to see how in in pockets of the country\nThe enthusiasm for beer and brewing houses and tap rooms is a is still slow growing [laughter] yeah\nYou know I think um it to me it's looking more and more kind of like a restaurant business uh right you know if you think about\nUh just the way that ah these breweries are financed and you know the way that lenders operate to um you know they're they're lending a significant amount of money\nTo actually build out so they're spending on construction to build out the abilities and to build out these tap rooms and then you know make them look beautiful and and that's not money that a bank has ever getting back um so it is very similar to the restaurant business right there's not a whole lot of assets that they're that they're actually financing other than\nThe equipment I'm so ... in in my opinion or any of these operations that started up I think that they should be trying to do it as lean as possible take on as little as possible and open as quickly as possible and start selling\nBeer directly to consumers at the highest margin possible so that they can service that debt and get you know quickly get to profitability\nRight and and you know it's interesting it's when you look at some of them look at pictures of some of these places a picture of community beer works up in Buffalo that open this past summer\nAnd again nice or interior not overly crazy uh but that seems to be now the place where people you want to congregate and hang out not necessarily a a a you know club where there's banging music and it's just loud and didn't you know crazy life\nIt seems there's been a shift it's almost like the ... of yesteryear and this is what you're seeing more of a socialized social atmosphere\nAnd I think you hit it right on the head that if you could open up\nNot go crazy you don't have to be the biggest you don't have to be the best you don't have to have a three million dollar build out in fact a lot of the successful ones are the ones that are very cozy and quaint they they just make good beer and and people will go regardless of you know whether it's a three hundred thousand dollar build out or a a ... three million dollar bill that\nYeah exactly I think the bigger question though for me at least is you know how sustainable that model is um you know if you have a two breweries on on a on a city block and then two more open you\nKnow you haven't created any new customers now there's just for companies competing for the same customers that were walking down the street right so um ... it on one hand yeah they're bringing a lot of excitement and enthusiasm to the category but on the other hand\nYou know does the industry risk kind of turning it back on traditional bars and restaurants and if so you know what's the ramification of that you know five ten Fifteen Years down the road\nWhile we've seen a number of restaurants that have actually gone and within the restaurant creating a small you know almost micro micro brewery just to create some of their own beer and a kind of as an attraction and we've seen that a number of restaurants here in the\nIn these cigar city of Tampa but I'm seeing that more and more where restaurants are looking saying you know what we want to get in on this action we don't want to go crazy but they're still kind of unique market to do that\nYeah absolutely I mean I think\nYou know we we talked about the opening and closing more breweries are going to continue to open for sure I mean we're seeing you know I think what like two two and a half breweries opening per day is is the is the clip 'em and and that will probably continue in ... into next year I don't know when exactly it'll slow down many people think that\nUh there could be as many ten thousand breweries and brew pub throughout the United states here very shortly um\nAnd most of those again are going to be pretty small tapper and focused or like the ones that that are mentioned in that article from from New York so it'll be interesting to kind of see how it all shakes out in long term you know how many of these businesses survive I think you know the big\nThe big looming question over all this is like can we get more consumers to drink beer at a time when beer sales are you know overall relatively flat because\nYou know if you think about it just like a bar you can stick more cats in the wall but that doesn't mean you're going to sell more beer you still have to get more consumers and your door right so the same kind of rule or theory applies to the to the broader industry yeah you can have ten thousand breeze but if you're not creating new consumers than you know who's drinking all the beer [noise]\nChris ... dot com joins us today as we celebrate cigar October fest Chris let's take a look at some of the breweries that are really starting to expand that have been successful in their own markets that maybe\nYou are are are a ton of stores are ... that are listening should be on the lookout for I Know for example Brooklyn Brewery started in Brooklyn they've now grown to do I think we're twenty nine or ... states across the country but give us some names of breweries that are really starting to grow\nThat we may be able to find their products that we haven't been able to the last number of years yeah for sure\nUm there are a few that comes to mind a you know if you think about\nUh now that the the trend is obviously more local right so a lot of these companies that are growing um tend to have tighter distribution footprint so access to their beers or for a lot of your listeners might be a bit of a challenge um but", "show_name": "Cigar Dave", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "22"}
