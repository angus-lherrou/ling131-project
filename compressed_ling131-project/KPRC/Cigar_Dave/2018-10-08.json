Kirk name and Carl I'm Ari [noise] the producers of the twilight zone wish to thank CBS Enterprises Carol Serling Dennis at your son\nIn the last few weeks and we have seen the attacks on judge Brett Kavanaugh we have seen the feminist send the Democrats and uh women all over the country\nWe believe her never mind if they even get the facts of the story we believe her that's like saying Ted Bundy mass murder\nAh that's like saying uh Charles Manson another mass murder we believe we believe he's innocent we believe him or we believe these before even know the facts\nI mean this is like women saying are men would be saying I Believe Ted Bundy is innocent he is innocent never mind\nAbout looking at the facts never mind about looking at the case in this country we have a justice system that you are presumed innocent until proven guilty that's what makes us different than other countries around the world especially dictatorships four former Soviet Union look at China\nOh they have to do is say yep you you're guilty you're going in the ... or in the former Soviet Union\nYou're guilty you're going to Siberia for forty years of hard labor doesn't work that way we're all of a sudden if you don't like someone or like something you said you have these guilty throw 'em and throw them put them in Leavenworth and move they throw away the key what has happened\nThis hashtags me too movement has gone and transcended into hash tag every man is now guilty to movement and what we saw over the last a week ten days going on with the Senate Judiciary committee\nEspecially the Democrats going after capital and I don't want to make this political but the fact of the matter is it has become political it has transcended now the feminist movement into politics and do unabated attacks on men\nInto this nonsensical term toxic masculinity every way we look as alpha males as men as a as boys\nWe're all under attack\nBy a relatively small percentage of women in this country feminists and what we've witnessed this week where people stopping up and down and crying and marching and and and and and walking into restaurants in elevators\nLook at me when I'm Talking look at me I suffered I was sexually abused\nWell my answer is I feel badly that your work but this has no your case has no bearing on what we're discussing just because you are sexually abused or you were in some way shape or form\nAttacked that doesn't mean that every man is guilty we must look at it at a case by case basis that was you know\nI'm the foremost authority an alpha male pleasure maneuvers and of course says the alpha male and chief I make sure that our voices are collective alpha male voices are heard I stand up for men I stand up for males\nAnd what I've seen the last couple of weeks is just ludicrous people women have lost their minds even men I'm seeing the results of the feminist movement on these was defied Nablus boys and men boys that\nStart off his was the five boys and become ... adult men and we're seeing them jumping up and\nDown and rallying and we must believer and we must we this is a tragedy we must believer\nWhy do we have to believe someone let us look at the evidence and the evidence that has been presented and my feeling was that I stayed at this I think last week of the week before let's hear what Christine Blasey Ford has to say she's making this accusation great she also stated that she had witnesses let's hear what they had to say\nBy the same token Brett Kavanaugh has the right to defend themselves to stand up for himself to refute the chargers are the allegations being made against them\nAnd it's very simple fact is that the for people that Christine Blasey Ford bossy Ford however you want to\nTalk let me talk like Fifteen ... who am I have for this his but I mean maybe maybe they forgot they were there\nWitnesses all said no we don't remember Brett Kavanaugh we weren't at this party did not happen but that's not good enough for the feminine is not good enough for the Democrats because this isn't just about toxic masculinity that nonsensical statement this isn't just about the fact that\nThey want to go after cabin all this is about they disagree with the fact that President Trump has the right to nominate the Supreme Court selection of his choice and they the Senate Republican controlled Senate can go ahead and approve there could provide their consent and vote on allowing\nKavanaugh to become a Supreme Court justice they don't want the court tilt to shift period that's what it boils down to what we're seeing now is an automated outrageous attack on men when the feminist movement began fifty years ago\nWhat did they say the first thing they said is we don't need a man we don't need a man we want equal rights now granted here we are fifty years later can anyone really say that women are being discriminated against let's look at the empirical evidence\nThe majority of college graduates are women\nThe majority of graduates in post a a post undergraduate degrees master's degrees PHD's doctoral degrees attorneys lawyers\nAre women women today you know companies become CEOs there's no limit on what they can achieve nobody's keeping them down nobody saying you have to stay around them in the white picket fence in the house you can't leave the house nobody saying that\nThere are more opportunities for women today in the broadcasting industry in\nWhich I'm involved I Will tell you there are more women today that are running radio and television stations and in major executive positions than ever before probably more than men\nI mean there are two major broadcast companies that I can think of too of what struck a broadcast companies measly broadcasting and cumulus media\nWe have affiliates on both of those both those groups both run by women CEOs are women will problem\nNobody saying oh we have to put a limit on how many women can that can service she goes nobody says that nobody said I'm not going to vote for a woman because ah she's a woman nobody says I'm not going to go see that position or go to that it already because she's a woman it's nonsense\nAnd it's complete utter ridiculous nonsense women today are the best position they've ever been in\nThere are no limits there is no glass ceiling that is nothing more than they fabricated term that the feminist need to continue their their crusade which is exactly what it is against men\nSo they've gone from we don't need a man\nTo now we must ... men we must do a ... men they've gone from\nWe won equal rights do we want superior rights and that's really what it boils down to today I always get a kick out of out of a ... ... especially feminist they all are ... we want equal rights we want to be treated the same\nYou take a woman out I've never I don't take off a nut case feminist\nThat I don't do but I've got friends of mine that said oh yeah I took this woman out you proclaim for the whole dinner she was a radical feminist blah blah blah blah blah and I'm like well why don't you just end the date right there\nHe said well but when the check came all of a sudden they weren't feminist anymore they wanted me to pick up the check no more equal rights no no no no I had to pick up the check meaning they had to pick up the check so what the feminist movement has gone from we don't need a man to\nBasically we must cash great man\nWe won equal rights too we want superior rights and what they want to do is essentially now they want to ... and ... every American male that has borne period and every male ... adult male\nThis transcendent it has gone from an equal rights moving down with the politics of the justice system and now all of a sudden when you see these people that are jumping up and down these protesters there was a protester earlier this week in the capital and she was wearing a shirt T shirt with the slogan men are trash\nNow think about that for men are trash\nThat's a blanket statement all men are track this is how radical how ludicrous how nuts they are\nIt is absurd can you imagine if men said all women are trashy horse what would happen if this is outrageous how can you do that but when this woman wears a shirt that says men are ... I'm Sorry that's nonsense\nMet our trash I think it'd be further from the truth\nIt is ridiculous but this is how radical they become\nAnd the person that was wearing it was a twenty two year old Georgetown Law school students and of course all these other women are telling this first oh that's great I Love it work and I get it\nWe believe Christine Ford never mind if you're a law student what is the first thing you ought to be ... hey listen everyone's are innocent until proven guilty you know why do we look at the facts first\nBut they are not interested in that in any way shape or form that when we come back and by the way Bette Midler also had a she came out with a tweet that I saw a couple of days ago that just floored me\nHusband could get accused of this my brother my son my nephew friends this is nonsense\nAnd all of a sudden when you've got rational women now the majority of women saying hey this is now gone too far\nAnd all of a sudden you're saying you're going to believe somebody without looking at the evidence not gonna sit very well\nDemocrats overplay their hand alpha male Lindsey Graham who would have thought\nIn general is always on Twitter delivering breaking news giving you the latest into um cigars and battling the enemies of pleasure chat with the general now\nAs a guard daytime show\n\n... has just launched three new cigars episode ... on the water in Buffalo the ... chateau probate their guard up Marquez and ... ghost gold all three unique flavor profiles\nThe Turkish chateau ... more traditional mild and creamy cigar typically found in many of the high end Dominican cigars ex where's the flavor very velvety I'm a pilot ...

Kalamazoo\nA with eastern greens and one day one of my fellow bakers invite me over to his house for some home brew and he opened up the bottle in the sink and phone golfer and it really wasn't very good\nAnd but then I thought you know he's not that great of a Baker and then I could do better\nAnd I wound up moving into a house in uh January of Nineteen eighty three other guys who like beer and ah it become legal and I went out and bought a kit and started brewing beer in the basement and um\nAnd you know it's kind of watching what was happening out on the west coast a sheer opened that you're in Nineteen eighty\nI think ... to the real deal company ... opened in Chelsea, Michigan I spied on them and kind of figured that trend would move east and which of course it did and uh\nSo you know I was positioned to open up early and and uh try and get in on on what was happening that\n[noise] so you never really had any experience in brewing you're right I mean you're just figured okay I think I could do this better and you kind of gave\nThat [laughter] well I took a class a bill Newman in uh Albany New York you had the William s Newman Brewing Company and bill offered a class in a small commercial brewery operations\nAnd we're about I think about forty people overall the took a class only two that I Know that actually started a brewery they took a class or myself and mark stuck rude a summit brewery in\nThe twin cities but um you know go and eat you get to work in the Bering Sea I visited other small breweries talk my way into grew houses um [noise]\nYou know went and consulted down at Siebel joined the United states brewers association and kind of you know try to get a little a little bit more about the industry\nAnd so tell us your first beers that you're Bruce how do they turn to\nYou know I'm ruining his soup pot and fermenting and plastic garbage pills so we had one that was simply called bells here and then the next ... was Great Lakes hamper ill and our ember ill is still that's our number three seller in the company that's been there for a long time\nUm you know quality uh back in the day was not the greatest um and I copy Newman because I didn't have money ah really to to be buying lots of bottles or anything in fact I couldn't buy bottles\nUm so so beer in what's called a to Pitino that's what Newman was doing so it's a\nMedium dense the collapsible ... ethylene bag with speak it on at that you put in a cardboard box a you know the locals lunatic Larry down by the railroad tracks selling beer in a bag in a box\nAnd then bottles I had a license to sell other people's here so we would sell like ... beer out of Wisconsin really cheap and with the Michigan bottled deposit I'd sell for just over costs but then people would return the bottles\nAnd we would wash that we'd soak labels off and we wash sterilize rinse feel tap label everything by hand to sell bottled beer\nSo really a kind of did everything on the cheap I mean it wasn't a you know big operation and so tell us how long did you really have to go in were you in that stage until things really starting to started to grow and people started to really accept your barrier where you could really you know kind of take it to the next level\nWell we had um we had this Fifteen gallon soup pot for a couple of months and then I made a deal on one some old ah industrial\nSoup cattle so we had a one barrel system for five years the last year that we had that we made a thousand barrels of beer before we get a Fifteen barrel system\nSo it was in the early nineties than we probably start to turn the corner and actually a become a profitable company in things were starting just starting to catch on a little bit uh in the mid west as far as craft beer ... is concerned\nAnd that was about what year was was that like around Nineteen eighty eight no I'm not in Ninety One Ninety two or Ninety One I wanted to do okay got ya\nNow just so Ninety One Ninety two so you start growing and what was a ... and you said what your first year was was ...\nIt was just called bells here it was really just me away I was at a light pale ale yeah\nAnd then what ... got you know but um you know in the in the late eighties we were making different stuff\nSo actually um you know we start making some stout Kalamazoo style pork or\nUh in Nineteen eighty eight we made our first cheery stout a Great Lakes cherries stout and I actually had a bottle of that original bachelor last week at the beer beer tasting uh the ... states where you're casing in Denver we auction that often I share that\nWith the winter so it was thirty year old bottle of beer it was pretty interesting\nLarry bell the founder of bills brewing in Kalamazoo, Michigan our guest that Larry when did things really start to because of it at that time you're ... primarily distributed just wanting to Kalamazoo area or in Michigan [noise]\nMichigan I think we started selling I'm In uh Madison, Wisconsin about eighty nine Ninety a Chicago about Ninety and in ... Indiana but you know I was driving you know a lot of that was being driven\nA ... by the ... by me or somebody else into Chicago I mean even in Michigan you know we started I used to drive all over the place delivering beer to get it out there and be sold so I'm rooted\nAnd yet you delivered it you kind of did everything [noise] yup absolutely\n... and and at that\nPoint when did things start really expanding going from just kind of Michigan did than Wisconsin when things really start to kind of blossom and really start to explode\nOh you know probably a Ninety to Ninety four things really start to go\nI'm and I'm\nYou know a ... started having a wholesalers that wanted to pick up the beer so um and in fact some of the things that you've seen recently happened to us way back when like we were shipping beer to Virginia and all of a sudden Michigan finally\nFigures out what's going on and we had to we had to step ship and Virginia in the nineties so we can take care of Michigan\nI'm no you know eventually we got back to Virginia but um\nYou know yeah things really start going there and ah [noise] in\nUh Nineteen Ninety three we become the first brewery in Michigan to sell beer by

opening\nWeren't all of a sudden you can sell the beer right at the brewery instead of having to ship it to a distributor where people really you know couldn't sampled right debris because there is I think there is a\nA a romance with being able to go where the brewery is see the brewery and an inexperienced of beers and maybe some special bears that you can just by where you can do all sorts of sampling and really get into that debris environment I think there's something very a romantic about it\nOh absolutely people of being able to touch it so you know our first you're eight years of existence we couldn't sell beer\nBy the glass at the brewery we could sell to go we could give it away for free which is what we did but you know people don't remember that that that's the path of

in Michigan but across the country is you have people that are set setting up now fake breweries\nSo they've got a license Mike rubbery and now they set some other place up with a five gallon home brew get where they never brew and they just ship it there so they become the kind of\nTheir fake brewery I'm wrong I don't think that that's not what the intent of our whole industry was and it
