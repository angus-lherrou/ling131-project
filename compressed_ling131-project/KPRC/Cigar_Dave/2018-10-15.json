parties at the pleasure palace and I have done many times have Brady his backyard barbecue and safety harbor right across the cigar city uh input Alice county and uh we extend wishes to him and his entire family as well sergeant Steve thank you for reminding me but there was an attack on men there is no\nQuestion about it and you can say that the Christine\nBlasey Ford lousy forward however you pronounce it that coming out after Kavanaugh that that was the start this goes way way before that there has been an attack on men and on masculinity going back forty fifty years but it is intensified\nThe last number of years with this contrived statement called toxic masculinity\nThat all of a sudden if you are born a male\nThen you are born with a toxic masculinity gene in your body\nThat when you are born a mail from the time you come out of the womb\nThan you are a future sexual predator your future criminal that's how some of the ultra ultra left wing feminists the nut cases the whack a doodles that we're seeing on the ultra left these socialist lives that's exactly what we are seeing now\nAnd so we are seeing not only that but we have seen the intersection of political correctness with now the war and attack on men\nLet me give you a perfect example of Winston Churchill one of the great leaders political leaders in history one of the great statesmen of all time went in the face of the German Nazi invasion\nHe stood tall inspired instilled confidence of course it helped with the United states of America\nAnd other allied nations including Canada and the other allies but really the United states let's face it United States and secondarily Canada we came to save the European ally that says there's no ifs ands or buts but he instilled confidence saying we shall never ever ever surrender\nWinston Churchill always with a cigar and the the whiskey in hand\nAnd what is amazing is that\nHe was very popular during the war after the war's popularity waned when he was out of office number of years later popularity sky rocketed there's no question that his popularity probably higher today than ever except when it comes to the whack a doodle ultra lives\nThat now seem to\nHijack the political correctness conversational maneuvers let me give you a perfect case in point\nX astronaut Scott Kelly\nHe and his brother astronaut Scott Kelly alpha male no ifs ands or buts you're an astronaut you go to space in my estimation you're an alpha male when I was growing up in the sixties late sixties early seventies I mean in Nineteen sixty nine I'm you know it was five six years old\nAnd I remember when man landed on the moon I remembered Neil Armstrong Buzz Aldrin Michael collins Apollo eleven I remember\nVividly at my grandmother's house washing on their ... black and white TV with the space age remote can everything was space age back then everything was space age if you had tang was space age remember the the drink tank\nAnd I remember everybody said that every product that came out a new microwave radios transistors it's because of the space program and a lot of it was\nA lot of it was but I remember everything was space age it's a new amount of space age men are radar range microwave a new space age refrigerator space age from everything was space age\nBut I revered those aspartame were gods and today I still think those guys that are exploring the new frontier exploring space\nThere alpha males you going to pull seven ten geez you're an alpha male no question about it so Scott Kelly was\nMaking a derogatory derogatory but making a negative in a polite way I Will say negative\nTweet negative comment about President Trump taking a victory lap at the swearing in the public swearing in ceremony of justice a Kavanaugh at the White House earlier this week last Monday\nAnd Trump took a victory lap any kind of went after some of the critics and I thought Trump did a fine job I had no ifs no problems with it whatsoever there was an attack on Capitol\nBasically labeling him a rapist they sexual molester or sexual without any evidence\nAnd when people say well wait Christine Blasey Ford we she gets the presumption that that she's right and he's wrong no it's not how it works I'm Sorry and don't give me this be as well it's a job interview therefore the presumption that he is innocent until proven guilty does not exist no that's wrong too and the witnesses that she named\nEvery one of them including her very lifelong best friend a Democrat by the way came out and said I don't know I don't ever recall meeting Brett Kavanaugh we weren't at that party never happened and admitted that\nFord's people pressured her into changing her story and she said I'm not going to perjure myself pull the FBI everything got to give her credit pull the truth told the truth tell the truth you don't get in trouble very simple\nSo Trump took a victory lap no problem okay in of course you've got the the lame stream media going after him and saying\nOh he was not magnanimous he was he was spiking the football oh please spare me well Scott Kelly excess route Scott Kelly to each\nOne of the greatest leaders of modern time sir Winston Churchill said in victory magnanimity I guess those days are over\nNow you look at that tweet okay he disagrees with Trump I thought it was actually a good treat I I thought hey look he made his point it didn't ... just basically said look quoting the great Winston Churchill and victory magnanimity\nAnd ah you know I always felt that when you're when you don't spike the ball you win gracefully you lose gracefully\nMean Martin levy a a great hall of fame football coach the Buffalo Bills had him on the show many times used to always say when you're when act like it when when you lose you lose gracefully\nThere is the right decorum so maybe Trump did spike the ball a little bit but it was not over the top it was not a noxious\nAnd I thought that Scott Kelly's tweet was appropriate\nWell not so fast my friends all of a sudden he starts getting a lambasted and bombarded with negative tweets and replies critics saying that Churchill\nThe great leader who rallied Great Britain and the darkest days of World War two against the third Reich against the Nazis\nHelped lead the allied the allied victory over Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany\nWell all of a sudden Scott Kelly\nGets bombarded with people associating Winston Churchill with Adolf Hitler why because they say that's Churchill was an imperialist and a columnist and they quite at him to Hitler and the next thing you know relatively quickly thereafter\nHe tweets a reply saying and I quote did not mean to offend by quoting Churchill my apologies I Will go and educate myself further on his atrocities racist views which I Do not support\nAre you kidding me this max you know when you take a stand and you you make a quote if people don't like it too bad\nA problem in this country is we apologize to quickly if you have an opinion and you believe in that opinion and you believe that Churchill was a great leader others may disagree\nI don't care if there's ten thousand people who disagree to your one who agree with with a statement you don't apologize if you have conviction in your statement if you believe in your statement do not apologize\nBeing alpha stand by your opinion I have many people that say I get emails saying well I disagree with your opinion you should apologize and my reply is I Believe in what I said I'm not going to apologize if you don't like it you can respectfully disagree with me I have no problem with it and I'm happy to debate you\nKnow most people will debate me because I have the facts on my side and what I usually make a comment it is fact based but you may have your own opinion but the opinion of equating Winston Churchill\nThe leader of Great Britain during World War two equating him with a Nazi being a Nazi because he was an imperialist than a colonialist sorry that doesn't cut it and when Scott Kelly\nAlpha astronaut rolls over\nLike a defeated dog that is to me unacceptable have the nets to say to all those people who disagree with me and our equating Churchill\nShe could not\nCorroborate her story in any way shape or form and you had incredible civil discourse and finally the Republicans woke up so much great just say theoretically\nYes we must be civil to each other we should not hit each other than that we should not call each other girly man we should all she just likes to get a hold hands in and pass

overseeing the U.S forces\nTo think about this the Nazis were the ones that put them in the concentration camp as a child the Nazis brutally murdered his family he comes back to Berlin to protect the people of Germany from the Russians\nWho had liberated him but Russia's liberated him in World War two I think about that and they always told that story great American great human passed away

both sides of the aisle concerned about the disappearance of a journalist\nProblem with you have lots of it um\nBut you're going to need some basic uh you know high drama there's you're going to need a a bottle cap or a big spoon um and then patients uh you can't rush the hands of time you cannot no so what did you start making your beer the whole process takes about thirty days so\nYou'll have your official ... day which is usually three to four maybe five hours um\nAfter that you let your beer do his thing and just ferment I'm a you know to a certain temperature for a couple of weeks and then usually the bottle age or bottled condition after that you could also go into a keg which takes another week or two [noise] well\nThe nice thing about home brewing as opposed to well first of all it home brewing is one hundred percent legal as opposed to distilling your own distilled\nSpirits meaning vodka or whiskey moonshine and there's a reason there's a couple of reasons for that but first I think probably the most important is\nHealth and safety right right yeah and ... and distilling you could you could really mess some people up like you know poisoning on where you could let yourself up as well you make it right they could bomb because I think there's two types of alcohol there's ... ether alcohol and evil and one is deadly\nIf I'm not mistaken correct one is deadly in one you can drink one right okay right right and the key is you want to get the woman that you can drink it's okay but there's there's much more a regulation and that's why you see these ... it's technically illegal but home brewing is legal and Jeff ... or correction counter Meyer the master brewer a\nHome brewing hundred percent legal\nVery different than distillation as we're talking about absolutely that might nice and close I absolutely\nEven closer absolutely much better much better than I thought it was a jarring so a very big difference and uh what type of people are you seeing coming in is there any specific age range or is it is more men than women using give us an idea of who's coming in here to actually learn how to home brew\nUm for the most part it's\nTwenty five to thirty five year old men a little bit older I'm mostly people that have found that they either want to make it cheaper where they want to make something that they can't get at the breweries and they they want to have something seasonal for themselves so they can make\nFor each season for each day for each month or for an event or for a party they want to make there's they want to have their own thing going\nWell I think there's also something very cool and I think maybe a little bit a romantic about saying I'm a home brewer I brew my own fears where you have people at a party and you can sample some of their beers and people can actually be very proud of the offerings that they're serving absolutely it is you know I think there's something there's a there's a wow factor to that\nOh yeah you could address flavors you can do anything you want so you can make it a stronger as light dark heavy or you know barrel aged or whatever you like\nNow one of the people that we know mutually Phyllis ... who is a is known as fill our blend on these cigar Dave show my producer for many years now helps us with greater services\nHe is ... and it comes in here purchases home brewing supply and he is he's told me he said I I finished very high I didn't win the award yet and of course I resident resident about it all the time\nBut the one thing he always tells me is that he loves to be able to experiment and try different things and I think that's probably the one commonality with home brewers is they want to try they want to have fun it's a hobby\nIs making some great beer five years is that one of those ... are pretty they're they're off the charts at what so what makes a beer off the charts how does a home brewer able to be able to Bruce something to say that's off the charts\nWhat is it is it the radiance is it how they all\nIn perspective and personal taste you know I I like uh I like I'd be a some people ate them you know I'm not a big stout guy uh but that's awesome people ever drank so to make a chart that\nFluctuates right either you know is relevant to someone's taste I don't know how you could do that it's it's all personal taste\nBut overall what about the beer did you enjoy\nI'm probably the Roma the\nThat that the clear in his to Chris Chris ... um\nThe overall flavor and you know ... is the last I did I think it was a a a mango or something like that in there and it was just full of flavor\nAnd again there's no right or wrong so you could have five home brewers coming up with an eye PA everyone's going to be slightly different depending on what they put in and and and I guess the hops they use and the other ingredients so really it is it is a custom creation\nAlso their equipment in there Bruce style and\nHow they did it specifically I mean the temperatures can change everything temperatures of fermentation temperatures of your mash everything can change in each brewer has different preferences based on what they want out of it\nSo you can make a dry or you can make it a little more bodies and give it more Roma by adding hops late you can give it a little bit more bitterness batting house really early so I mean each brewer knows what they like to know what they want and\nI mean there's there's great beer in every style every little bit is a little different but it's wonderful and its own way\nSo we have learned so far that before we even get into the science of brewing in home brewing before we go through the different\nSteps you need some key equipment and Jeff as you mentioned Bruce ... fermentation vessel a fermentation lock a spoon is that the sample the beer while you're while you're making\nSure you got a taste of what ... like great it gets too I got I got to\nTry it out of high drama or bottles that auto siphon bottle cap or his bottle caps dark at you said it's of drugs and also sanitizer which is important which we will talk about where\nWe're at ... company in downtown St Petersburg Florida with Jeff

but\nCertainly October fest in cigar October fest is the perfect way to do so perfect excuse for us to light up a find cigar do some beer bearings and I'm looking for a magnificent beers here at avid route company downtown St Petersburg we're talking about home brewing one on one of the science\nOf brewing it is becoming increasingly popular hobby\nSo this week we're talking about everything you need to know about a home brewing the equipment you need to process so we welcome you back to avid route company downtown St Petersburg with Jeff Keller the owner and master brewer counter Myron I should say gentleman that\nThat downtown St Petersburg always experienced day renaissance in terms of restaurants and and housing and and activities but it's really become a beer epicenter a cool little micro center of beer activity\nTotally it is it's it's grown over the past few years um we've been here about four years um you know green bench kind of started the whole revolution around here and bring in some different unique beers and and uh uh you know cycles following cage and they'll sell work saint Pete brewing\nUm they instill going\nAnd you know what sergeant Steve will put up a map a cigar Dave dot com where we will put little pins on all the different breweries that are in the downtown St Petersburg area actually we're looking at one right now it's called the brewery bay I didn't realize just looking at the entire cigar city area Tampa Bay area the number of breweries\nBut uh there's a ton of 'em in downtown St Petersburg so if you're considering a visit\nDown especially between the months of like December and march perfect time if you're a beer enthusiasts some great places great restaurants and great group hubs right here in downtown St Petersburg so we'll outlined now\nOne of the things that you gentleman mentioned that brewing is all about time and temperature and as we learned in step to matching of the grains you basically steep the grains whether it's a week or whether it's cracked barley in hot water between a hundred and forty two degrees and a hundred and fifty nine degrees and you both said\nTime and temperature that's all brewing is about crucial\nAbsolutely I mean if you if you don't go long enough it's not going to convert all the starches and then you're just going to have less alcoholic beer and if you go to long which isn't too much of a problem but you can start extracting flavors you don't actually want so\nNow or hour and a half and the temperature your one for the body are trying to find is really important to kinda nail down and taking notes being sure you're you're repeating so if you make the same here again you can either not make the badly again or make the good beer again remember those composition\nBooks we used to have back in grade school where you'd write everything down they were kind of bound I Would say if you're going to be a home brewer that's a good investment to make because Everytime you make a batch I Would assume the exact amount the time the temperature so you could look back and take notes and say you know I liked that particular beer but\nLet me try one degree more for maybe another few more minutes see what that does and then you hit that a ha moment\nWhere you get exactly the formulation you're looking to fulfilling I'm sure it is you're at [laughter] so when you were all your everything the exact same way absolutely have you know that I have an entire rest of you know book full of just notation\nThroughout the whole process and that is guarded I noticed a very large fault as you walk in he met his garden nobody's getting near there in fact there there's patrol dogs right right around the secret service [laughter]\nAll right so time and temperature key elements in brewing now after you match the grains and you said roughly what an hour mhm okay what's the next\n... which is basically a fancy word for renting the grains out where you need to rent sat sugar out of the grains that you've converted the searches you convert into sugars now you're trying to rent salvo sugar's out into another pot or\nTake the grains outta that pot and rent the sugar side of the greens you just want to separate the grains from the show so you want the sugars up you know you want the sugars in so that you can use that to boil oh so you want to show trying to remove the grain\nOh so once the grain is done you don't need it anymore no no my understanding is that many breweries when I was up at ship your brewing they told me that uh they sell the remnants of the grains to various farm so they had continuous reviews in the area\nYeah you can make dog biscuits out of it too and I'm sure as\nMy chickens love it they'll go crazy after a while and then they'll they'll gorge on them\nSo it's like a dry just becomes like when you try it out it's just dry up it's\nPretty empty of any nutrition but it's just ... there's chickens like it and thought that our compost compost is another alternative okay so here have a I met him angel we give our brains do for his goats really mhm\nSo basically there's no waste whatsoever constant recycling that's it alright fantastic so ... you are reducing the sugar out of the grains you're getting rid of the grains your retaining the sugar and the water which is called war ... W or team now\nWe I've actually sampled the war\nAnd when it's warm ... tastes pretty good it's like a ... it's like a sweep the rain T where we're at a did even brewing and end up Mike Brian said try this I said boy the smell was incredible you could actually make a tea or a soup out who it was actually I thought it was just drinking in of itself we we\nBottled a couple of bottles of a I'm a\nBlack guy PA and it tasted just like a stout a non alcoholic style because it doesn't have any alcohol in it um so it's it's a pretty good stuff\nSo the word is basically the ... the sugars with the water\nOr after you have matched the grains so the ... the sugar out and then you create the war and that's going to be the base of your beer absolutely okay so that's you're basically that's your stock that's your your ingredients right there that's the\nThat that starts the process so now that you've got the war\nWhich usually is tastes sweet got these sugars in there you next go to the boiling component was boiling do\nWell boiling does a couple of things that sanitize it it evaporates things that you don't actually want to know just\nJust useful things just things you're not actually gonna need or just evaporate and also that rates water so condense is it so you have a stronger sugar solution got stronger war yes gotcha also what it does is as you add hops throughout the boil the heat and the temperature actually\nChange the hops into more bettering so long or you have the hops in the boil the more better they become the last time you have more flavor you have retained because as you boil the longer you're going to basically gonna took away all the flavors and aromas so you put in hops out the entire process to get different flavors romas ... says so that boiling", "show_name": "Cigar Dave", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "15"}
