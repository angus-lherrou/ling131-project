front one in a back when we go to the ... what\nDo you do the whole airplane now [noise]\nOff to work right now\nWorld and then just\nI'm Pam who south Fox News a billion dollar deal over happens next week\nBecause it's full of women are not all of them are a gymnast by the way but they are all women and they are at each other like the\nCat fight story alley raise them on and Simone Biles the gymnast made very clear they did not care for the hiring just as an interim they did not care for the hiring of Mary Bono\nTo kind of run things until they could get it all settled Sonny's old widow she has resigned that office now after four days\nWow the minute she took office what you do wrong or in four days when she had some opinions and they did not line up with the opinions of these little girls the gymnast who have been given some spotlight some limelight and told how special\nThey are the kind of remind you of those kids from a high school in Miami where the gun\nPlay took place they have opinions and they like to express their very strong opinion certain things and they don't like the fact that Mary Bono also has a pit ends and expresses hers and they aren't the same isn't that something that\nUsed to be in America if you were in some organization or some company or some group\nI say the women's gymnastics or the New York giants or whatever you worked for that group you didn't get the ... pass\nJudgment on who the leadership was the mosque was down in charge\nOf kids in high school who can stomp their feet and carry assigned a there are very unhappy they watch it now I\nShould do we should teach them a lesson we should form a gymnastics team at the prison because\nThose prisoners always make good like rodeos or anything like that because they just want to get out of prison time so they'll work out do whatever they have to\nDo you do become good gymnasts or whatever\nI had a couple of people do just when I last weekend I Believe it was a ... vote at over to to the prison rodeo would preserve rodeo the bath and they said oh it's a hell of a time and they said you could just tell a lot of these prisoners is hoping to get injured\nOh yeah goals if they get hurt but don't die\nThan they get to go spend time in your ... to hospital whatever gets them out of their usual day to day get 'em all but I worked detail get them away from that big bold us you know Jason I'm all around player I Know what you're doing it isn't just a it's a it's a great way to spend some time\nIn prison is hoping to be in ... and at least\nAt the very least they may not be hoping it'd be injured or whatever and both the very least they're kind of reckless because they live in a dangerous world anyway the world they go back to a union dangerous to\nPrison rodeos great oh yeah that's one of the best if you haven't ever been to a prison rodeo got on a dime bucket list last and it doesn't cost a lot so you should be fine to Larry King Abdullah under a prisoner oh they'll go to one I recommend it\nBut some of the Connors program it has no heart at all and has no no soul to it any more it has a group of actors\nWho had been given role to play and they've been given lines to read and you can watch them as they obviously deliver their ally deliver their their one liners and\nA couple of you know they've got good writers Nashville a couple of the one liners made me chuckle I think they were from the crowd Becky the blonde a daughter and Roseanne sister the actress Laurie Metcalf\nThe only two that are actually putting in a decent performance and can deliver on line that you know was written by somebody else in in ... and they can still make you go right okay scenario\nRight a series of them were were their play different characters in as a whole different deal\nBut it's real obvious the show lost all of its soul its its heart the depths of well why it was a show in the first thing like corporate after ... that's why on top of that they uh were a little more than just a little preachy quite PG about\nThe fact that uh Roseanne died because she was a drug addict she was addicted to opioids and the reason she was addicted to opioids is because corporate America wouldn't get good health care that you know they didn't name him\nBanks the Don throw him but you know ... what\nThe complaint was that the people like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz well they just vote every\nDay to take people's health care away and they were not a health care is their God given right\nNow that's not and if not truth total damn caught I wouldn't be standing on the porch complaining about the fact that he can't find enough work to make enough money to pay the bills\nBecause this economy is surging I Know people who are in the construction business professional they can't find enough people have more work than they can possibly get to and Dan is standing there on the porch make\nThese big said grounding my legs no sense as a country that doesn't exist because this one\nToday contractors can't find enough subcontractors fill their gig\nSo somebody actually ate a crack by well this is a in Florida near a Tampa cops notice a a a glass cracked by the New Orleans first or any other investigation friday so they'd already seen it oh yeah and then\nWhen they figure it's no hurry were arresting you well we'll get that later or because it's glass\nCrack by she popped the glass crash cracked by that her mouth and then chewed it up and swallow that weight shoot at first yeah glass that does not smart well I'm Sorry [laughter] it's like crack person know\nPeople don't do very smart things she was arrested for ... evidence no word whether she died or bled out from the inside from eating glass but it seems like a bad idea\n\n\n... I'll show you [laughter]\nOh oh\nThat's gotta be bad for you I guess the cops were just got a watching me enjoying the show cops cops see stuff every day and you figure how can these cops\nAnd tend to be so mean to me ... when when they pull you over and there's some kind of infraction and you give them some crap\nOn all the ... the idea that any one of you might try to kill him but it it just without warning is the ... part of their day that's how they wake up and start their ship kid\nAlways remember or a cops not operating in a vacuum and whenever you're pulled over or there's a problem with you you're not the first thing he encountered today you don't know what\nThat dude or sometimes to do that uh that dude has reading today and faced scene experienced\nIt might be a bad day I say don't tempted to always be polite take care of business never tried to adjudicate your situation with the police officer of ... do not not don't be no due to know where oh I'm innocent fine that will show up later going to affect your ticket\nOr whatever the hell is going on and and move on\nTo discuss the issue with you specifically or maybe just best if we just do to solve the are you going to take a break anytime soon or because those are some I got to get off my chair Laurie\nIs is like an internal complaint about work conditions of some\nKind of you know this is just a a complaint about the racism and prejudice ... uh that take place on the show daily oh you\nMust have the wrong show lately\nDevoid of those kinds of things yesterday they will the story in the news about a man that rubbed up a couple of Houston police officers and then stole their called rat in downtown Houston it borrowed daylight and everything first thing in the morning yesterday a dude\nBasically I tried to hijack the channel to lose ... or ... that was the guys that were stealing the uh the the news crews were they just won't do it wasn't like a gang engineering\nAnd ah when the police came to see why he was trying to take the news and apparently the dude drew one cop to the ground drug bill the one out of the call and it took the call and I had a holiday\nAnd we were trying to wonder how that something like that what happened\nAt some point you said uh they didn't give us a description of the mayor we could help find them but you knew what he looked like did he looked like just white boy right here in your mind did you look like just white boy right you go this is a white board right here that did\nNot say what you heard was all you heard us trying to make that a black guy well all we were saying was tell us who it is and we can limit ate half the suspect's right up to\nBe an handy later said he looked like fish\nOkay they said it is is a skinny\nCrack head looking white guy that did it we do care we're looking for a skinny crack at the white\nGuy do this one in a new role Alex ... who to use them believe so visually did take into custody\nOr because they found him a walking around active suspicious so that took him into custody and then they re trays the steps will do while ... you'd wanna stole they ... I was gonna say\nWhoever the cop the guy this car jak should be able to identify the part of\nWhy you think they would have liked to have not even told that story I think I Would have kept that to myself\nThis white boy ... bass who just both will be looking for from now on already just finished one crying on average ... noticed look for people that look just like him are right these are the kinds of distortion you looked like he ... he looked like he worked right down the hall really old yeah I've seen that look before that that kind of slow\nWide mouth breather morale kind of\nHave it looked like he just woke up ... all messed up everything that that that's slow so you have any\nUh doing wishing tattoos or a ... you mean like ... tattoos of like a face tattoo them by\nIt or somebody got one of the little wrap around the mouth beards you go out for them\nCats yeah wait a second\nBut apparently strong of is able to throw a cop out of a cop cartel without a car and we'll be ought to read but I think he caught about the ... the white syntax\nKevin White that\nRadio network oh this is the trim down version of an inch also\nHappy greasy fingers live version back Monday morning at five thirty freak of nature and keep your sci\nFifty a\n\nNow\nJust turn a life changing\nMusic right there and you know I'm throwing my\nLong braids of hair around ya ...

wondered\nAbout that when you just kind of risky dimension yeah something\nI I don't like to show you know favoritism towards one comedian or over another I mean should we liked all equally no matter what do they do but I did kind of go out on a limb there and said something positive about Ron like you know I kind of ...\nJason just lost his mind Jason emailed in some kind of a rabbit\nRabies fury wow you should do radio God's green beans I went to the singer theater in New Orleans last year to see Ron White\nI even bought I kinda like you put little slant on that when he says you know the name I why hill the way you did she even bought a T shirt before the show because I was a fan I'm here it's a major resentment coming on the show was doing up until the last forty seconds and then he ruined it\nOn his way out he decided to tell us that his wife's family is over Latino heritage and that we didn't need a border wall\n[noise]\nI went back to the vendor and I got my money back for that T shirt and I told him to make sure intel round to go back in ... was a space as Ron his wife an illegal\nThey say just a Latina 'cause there's plenty of Latino want a border wall to yeah he said that a lot of them rom doesn't think we need a border wall\nI doubt the vendor told him you know what I said but ah anyway that chat when I guess maybe Jason still listening he should thanks for the info\nOr aircraft so he will not taking it all the personal but you know a limitation dish he robbed white right\nHe is white and he is right we don't need ... some of you want a border wall and we do need a wall and some places but we don't need like the great wall of China all the way from the Gulf of Mexico to the\nPacific Ocean S. like that guy that tells you you don't need an AKA for he said or do you want it though I don't need them why did a little bit telling me what kind of God I Need is what I don't need areas around around you know what\nWe need is to stop offering the illegals a reason to come here\nWe need to start in forcing you with border agents like we used to do a enforce the border would need to stop giving game show prizes out to everybody that gets over here and it

really tasty Chicago now they managed to get ... as close as you could ever imagine to Chicago ALS originals\nAnd James Coney Island they heighten down the street Jay Z are they ah they sell them go

can\nProbably tell by looking at a aside fans that were food testers from way back [laughter] meanwhile the Cherokee Nation oh is there an uprising has a a message out of stirred\nUp a little bit of war and who claims her ancestors might have been on the trail of tears he was one of their own and she's on the trail of tears right now people are not buying your craft miss Warren\nDown a message from the president of the Cherokee\nNation which is chief Peter Baker proud leader of the Cherokee Nation like many of\nYou we are disgusted by the news that Senator Elizabeth Warren\nSeemed to be Native American which is in fact not [noise] once again white women speak\nWith for telling me the spirits of our ancestors\n... for one hundred years [noise] shame on you a little bit worried [noise]\nAlso why'd you look like the female version of Jeb Bush\n\n\nWhite guy\nSinging all Cherokees that I Know what happened to our uh our our better ... Beatles song that when you are somewhere to stop the other one I thought you immediately went to supply us with the one you know speaking and I just wanted to get the bad one off because I Know that we had a a better one didn't ...\nIt wasn't like go right to the other guy and it was just decided I take the offending tone addicts year math you you you know it's like you want to get that hand off your leg right now the other place it with another had a good head\nAs a free service to the water Johnson listening public we read you the next email from mark Marxist guys just want to let you know\nI've just lost a friend who fell out of a deer stand recently would you please remind all ten percent or who are hunters to be careful out there this season now and yeah and a cold wind blowing through and the leaves are falling and the\nDeer heads down grazing what's a perfect time to be out there slay them to be careful out there [laughter] great may miss today a deer\nER or what is that he said its effort to return ratio\nI was like oh this is going to be brilliant he's like look if I if I have to do is moving investment from one side of the desks or the other and signs of paperwork\nIt's pretty low return right pretty low investment effort wise but\nIf I got to go out look at something and then I got to talk to this guy I talked to this guy had these people come and look out he's like that that that return battery pretty decent 'cause my efforts going up substantially ride so\nI I'm I'm kinda the way he said that the whole room is all that makes sense and I'm like it's perfect because you can calculate returns that gives zillion different ways but what's my effort how much cash them out of pocket how much of my personal time all I'm going to have to deploy ended this strategy\nOr you know I I think the crypto currency guys are learned this lesson right now right it's not that low effort to return ratio so what are the lord of the metrics that we should be following instead of our ally because our life doesn't include overhead expenses and your time writing all that other stuff so\nUm I'll tell you right now we're going through this with our air being business ... at least we absolutely which we didn't just do and are being set up a hosting company and they'll all see and\nWe have members of that ... scene we all have responsibilities and one person of the three ... is doing a lot more time he was giving a lot more tie obviously all goes and picks up the supplies and make sure he gets the house and\nSo there's a lot of time that he's he's putting in\n'em and so for me I I I found the house I I structured the deal and uh I got the investor to come in and we were able to put this deal together and move forward on on on the on the several we have now and that's my responsibility right most wants to lose make sure that we're solvent and room tracking a good way and\nAnd uh so if we if we put our our ally out there on the air being be well looks phenomenal I have like a ... or ... thousand dollar investment and we know that you know seven thousand dollars a quarter right yeah it's all of a sudden wow look at that but that's not the real number ...\nRight and so um was it Mark Twain who said on the street types allies there's damned lies white\nLies and statistics right yeah that's right yeah\nI think every every deal you can always highlight this great number about the deal even bad deal right and which is why we that's marketing that's right right yeah\nUm so for us it is it's a straight piano and what we all said was he the first year we have no intention making any money mhm where in a business this isn't one project we're trying to do a little cash words in a business we're not gonna make any money this first year in reverse committed to that to build a reserve\nUnfortunately one of the three of us whose job is to do a lot more time than the other right other too and so you know if ... if I was him might be looking at the same thing my effort in return for my effort my E. R. R. is fantastic on those ... versus my partner ... who's not so much because you will do it now\nIt's the same time I can say that he's sending up systems and we'll be able to handle multiples across different states and then at that point you know that that job will have a massive return\nTo yeah 'cause pretty soon he's got to be managing a zillion of these things right he's going to have all the people in place and all that and that's really where when you think about it when when you really start talking about equity that's where his equity is of a partnership right\nAnd so the the real metric to use is because we run a business is march mhm right and that's that's that's what we use or running a business what is our gross margin buyouts are net profit and as long as it falls down and there's something left over at the end of the day you know we're happy\nUm but for the first year but moving forward why would we do this or anything less than like a twenty five percent march\nRight well I Want to explain this is really good guys and I want to explain a couple of things 'cause this is\nA flying with math is really what what's going on here for this so I Will hear somebody say well Jason I've got an infinite ready to return on that deal and I'm like okay well technically here's how you could do an infinite ready to return deal you have no money in the deal it takes all of your time and you make a dollar a year\nYear return rate of return is technically infant\nNow that doesn't mean when you show me that deal like\nOh Jason let me show you where you can store eighty hours a week meaning you can work eighty hours a week and make a dollar a year it's an infinite ready to return right actually you know it's kind of funny in that same vein nobody calculates their job is your job an infinite ready to return\nNo it's they pay you to work right so part of this actually one of the homework assignments that we've done in the past some of these training seminars is what is your time or how much is your time worth and then take that into what youre doing to make sure you're earning 'cause you could just pick up more hours of work right I mean it's that have invested\nA lot of times we tell people is absolutely do that yet in our little group we run for buying all ... you got worked for our summer yeah yeah exactly you're yeah you're you're you're overtime is like fifty bucks an hour might not go to try and get as much as possible as we can we can get a little seed money to go ahead and put somebody down owns\nYeah but again you were were were building seed money to go buy more deals right we're we're funding the business right\nSo I like to take off the our ally ... and I like to put on the margin ... because margin starts to tell me everything right\nIf I've got a business that has an infinite right of return that makes me a dollar I mean that's not really all that attractive to me now I've got a business where a a business or real estate deal where I'm In let's say I've got twenty thousand dollars in\nAnd my margin is twenty five thirty percent then I started looking around and go okay that's that's pretty decent what's my margin on cash what's my margin on equity what's from our return on debt what's my IRR and all that other stuff and so I really like to look at that hey I bought this asset for\nA hundred thousand bucks let's say cash and ah I've ... I'm getting a I've got a Fifteen Percent net Marge you know I I make in Fifteen thousand dollars a year on a hundred thousand dollar investment that's a pretty decent deal then you had leverage to it gets even better right\nSo I'm gonna you know we're we're this is mark and real estate meet up you know you guys you can check out an American R. E. M. U. dot com\nUm what's I think is finally over there so you know check out there in one of the things you're going to see is a category that says um [noise] our speakers are more educators and out one of the criteria we use for the court educators if they're going to come out to any one of the groups associated with American real estate meet up\nIs they can throw out numbers all they want you can shows all the numbers you on buddy we want to know grocer net yeah that's right we just want to know gross or to help 'em too many times it's a real estate education world we see people on stage saying I make a million dollars a year\nAnd a great great is that net or what a million dollars in your pocket to find it hard to believe because you're in Wichita on Saturday mornings [laughter]\nOn January why are we doing this he writes at a hotel right yeah yeah you made a million dollars is is this is how you did it and you know is this the live right here red roof in on Saturday [laughter]\nUm or did you grow some million right and did you really run a five or six or seven percent margin rare still ... a thousand or if it's a one man show good for them right but we want to know grocer net always um and we don't think it's\nWe don't think it's too um [noise] forward to ask if you're a room and someone's on stage and says I can show you how to make a million dollars you need asked grocer net\nYeah well they said we're not at a dinner party here I did write like a couple of guys hey what do you do in real estate investor well how much money as you make last year this is it's not like you know that's very presents us rights little Ford could be considered rude most circles but this is at a investing seminar right and I think it's more than\nAppropriate to say hey I made a million dollars a year great how much you keep\n[laughter] that's the\nKey I'd even love for them to say nothing I reinvest it everything into my business great for us smart that's that's great yeah read\nWe are we have the same philosophy there the first two three years usually doubling down overload on your business we agree on that but to just to get on stage and say him in a million dollars give me two laughs and then\nThen we're up to the next topic right yeah and that type of thing so well I'll tell you what\nBeen doing it the events that I'm speaking at you know I've I've talked a lot about publicly I'm doing updates on my Facebook page daily uh with uh what I'm buying in what's going on with the deals I've got and I've started the last couple of events with um with hey guys here's the ...\nAnd then after that we do it typical real estate group says you know seven and nine thirty sort of scenario we go ahead and bring folks in to provide education um they will from time to time sell stuff\nMhm right we sell stuff at our on our meetings were not embarrassed by that we are a for profit organization which means\nWe're capitalists there you'd want to learn from capital a I'm not a nonprofit you know it's it's a little conflict\nOf that's kind of weird a nonprofit teaching profitable activities right\nSo um what we do is we'll just leave right great education for great networking um and then the opportunities to learn locally and as well as nationally and so we think it's a really good mix it's growing we're bringing more value every single month and um we're really happy with the results I think all the members are as well\nYeah I you know it's funny when you talk about some of the things we do in the club I always get a ... billion questions over what website do you use who named singer direct mail out with who are the real estate agents you work with one of the title companies are and all those folks we enjoy the uh the revenue associate with these activities right I mean it just makes sense so\nUh so that's why we got you know quote stuffer for sale that are a lot it's literally like\nWho do you use for insurance who use these guys who used for this it's this guy has yeah here's the website guy go to I mean it's it's that easy for us and we get those questions all the time which is why we partnered with all those people are meanings right then that's the uh the American real estate meet up and got clubs all over the place uh obviously heavier in Texas because we're here in Texas\nFor will be in California and we have a couple of cubs going out there and then up in the northeast as well ... looks like Seattle I'm his are going to be pretty easy as it gets going on up there so and then we're going head up the Midwest yep\nAnd just start to start building these things I mean really the you know it's fascinating I had a really great a breakfast with a couple of guys who are a\nReal estate investors and they own a company here in town and you know one of the discussions we had a discussion we have a lot of people is where do I go where I can network with people who are actually doing the right there are if if you if your brand new this is the first time you're hearing this\nUh this will be a little bit of a shock but those you been in the business for a while you know that you go to all these meet ups you got all these networking meetings even go to these weekend events and all that and you look around its budget new investors right it's like\nWell how long you been doing this while I'm just getting started well how long have you with us here and I bought one house it'll psychology a bit of that [laughter] oh so you get that you think I'm building a power team my power to build a power team yeah you know in my power team is built by a bunch of rental that's my power team you know and then I have all these vendors that help us out so\nWhen you're out and about and you're trying to figure out where should I spend my time and my money really where should I spent the time is more important than money sure where do I spend my time on a Saturday where do I spend my time on a Thursday night where do I spend my time on a Tuesday\nAnd it's at the American real estate meta because it is a group of action takers if your brand new that's great\nLove brand new folks\nYeah as long as you have a propensity to action writer hey I'm here because I knew and I want to do it ... right and not another\nFried chicken fried beer yeah ... which those rooms they are not ours yeah right ours are very specific to action takers and it's funny to see the vendors actually sitting in on the mastermind because they're all trying to grow their rental that's a bike rode yeah yeah so\nUm it's good to be in that room with with the ... of folks that are actually moving forward so\nUm that's American R. E. M. U. dot com\nYeah you know it's kind of funny you mention the you mentioned the bar tab and whenever I hosted by that we never hit the minimum on the bar tab and I always have to pay more out of pocket and it used to drive me nuts until I figured out I'm like\nOh everybody's taking this really serious they're not getting drunk there [laughter] that's right they're taking notes that they're taking notes they don't have time to order another beer they're like they're just sitting there you know hammered it out or with their no padding their networking and I'm like well I I mean it's it's an open book right and then I was like oh that everybody's taking it really seriously\nAnd I'll tell you we're we're sort of shifting from that you know like some food there will be some some drinks and stuff but we're all here to\nDo yeah we're here to do don't ask me over the chicken wings are yeah I don't know what what are we having for dinner and I I really don't know it's it's a chi actually my room is a cheese in a fruit tree right and here's a bottle of water to sit outside our listeners [laughter] that's ... that's right well get we get our age it out and we tell her I open that laptop up for him and say\nAll right let's put deals up on the amount of power point on the on the screen there and then we start going through that that's actually a lot of how our meetings end up at it in a semi contract out yesterday from ah the sugar land oh did ya oh that's awesome so good so I Will tell little story about our marketing clower right sorry about ...\nWe have one other classroom so we we have a sort of basic real estate mhm I'm a sort of begin or or a refresher if you if you will for ... kinda understand\nAnd focus and uh that's in January and then in January all our clubs will be focused on mindset and goals for the new year so that'll be um make sure we're getting into the holidays we in busy but right after that that that first of the year we're going to get into\nGetting your mindset ready getting stuff figuring out what your number is for you know what your your hourly cost is and what your goals are how to achieve those goals understand the sacrifices and have to make him\nAnd all that so that's a that's always a fun\nA fund set of meetings for us\nFor for me it's always it's the goal setting is easy it's the gold tracking it's the end so we're to talk a lot about that goal setting called tracking but I Will tell you guys is for those who are in this business right now and your taking some action now but you know you're having some challenges you try to get it you know really get going consistently\nThe fourth quarter for whatever reason I don't care what year it is okay and what's going on in that in that year in your market\nThe fourth quarter has always been absolutely phenomenal for us and everything I mean it's I don't know what it is between a little bit in September but it's really that October to the first or second week of January\nSeems like we buy a ton of houses we look at a lot of deals\nAnd I'm convinced that there's two things at play one is it's\nThe it's the holidays right you're getting close to the holidays\nFamilies are spending more time with each other they realize hey we're getting close to the end of the year in the new year let's get rid of some houses maybe\nMaybe you're spend a little more time with with mom and you start to realize maybe mom doesn't need to be living by herself anymore so we need to get rid of moms home that happens all the time says a lot of family stuff going on and it's new year that sort of thing but the other thing I'm I've become more convinced with every single\nDay is that real estate investor take off too much time way too much time way too much time so they start checking out this time of year especially when we get into\nNovember and I'm just convince there's all these people they're marketing is out there the market is like oh yeah we need to sell moms home and they start calling people and nobody's there to\nThe talking about this in great detail\nA member but December is the best one thought a nominal because ... who's the only people putting their houses on the market in December people who really move really need to have\nYeah they really need to move and who are the ones by them the people who are acting like professional right who are consistently bind deals right that's the difference between an amateur and professional is the professionals much more consistent so that's um I Love this\nTime of year it's absolutely fine it's not a thousand degrees outside it's finally gotten blown I ...
