they say wing\nThose things lag on our own like elephant trucks and they don't hit each other with a swinging back and forth that's always\nBeen fascinated by it be the ban leader\nEspecially the guy from the Ohio State but I Know that a lot of um your mother drum major yeah\nThey took their head so far back there looking straight up and then they were on as they're not watching where they're going to go high when you get that got the cat and the thing and they're raising it in\nAnd that the I I don't think I don't advise\nYou to run any Korean soldiers happy to march like that the high

to be accepted the position to help people try out for everybody to\nHave friends that have been these the drum thing the measures the that's kind of a big deal you're getting beat the drum major that's\nLike some kind of is that the fact of the leader of the band so to speak\nYup oh and then to get together climbs on the ladder\nThat's the conductor ... he's the one that uh has orchestrated these various spelling out of things and then of course there's the famous they Ohio band when they\nDot the I's it's a big deal when they when they got the I\nThink it's going to die and everybody

be a good have been some we maybe coupon I could have been some coupons seriously don't think there was anything in it at all\nAnd then he said I Hope Jeff Flake was paying attention to all that's what we saw back that was that he could have made you and him personally\nGuys you\nGot stuck in a drought\nBruce was either resigning peep emotionally imbalanced or a passionate response to a sobering [noise]\nWorld and enjoy in the morning\nYou are listening to the store and I'm ... I'm Monday\nYou'll be listening to lie falsify them jump some rights five thirty your seat [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAh yeah you know what I got home last night I saw all these ridiculous political shines in my socialist liberal neighbor's front yard signs bloom Democrat sheet on voting for cares about putting a shining there you are going to change my mind on who I'm voting for\nWell get a fair but you're voting for eco friendly destroyed I better change political view on the line well thank you put in your yard I'm going to start putting in my yard to sway people things like\nVegetables and grow to be stronger marketers stopped calling me at dinner time oh what is your money you're more than twice that summer rank\nRich in foreign Rick\nA poll taken says Seventy five percent of women do not believe ... forge allegations well you know and women you know have that that special ah what I call it just six\nCents yeah six cents not sick oh oh\nOh well let's go with that the uh uh they know stuff especially when it comes to other women didn't have her body was well she was very credible witness and she was very believable and very wonderful crab had to call her brave and courageous Republican tall and they're all very nice I\n... mentally unstable I mean we've all seen psycho 's before she does seem um less than one hundred percent mentally competent\nPsycho lives there and and the thing of it is believable yeah I think she actually believes the story because remember he was dug out of our mind by a psychiatrist\nAfter what six straight days of sitting with Diane Feinstein I Would say anything to get out of that\nThis uh they found this memory that she had repressed back in her mind the drug it out of her and then of course they showed it to her and she said yeah yeah that's like trip something probably happened to her and they just in the bed at it in her brain that it was this guy she believes it brought up yesterday at one of these\nPanels on these shows at this repressed memory nonsense it's about Ninety percent Maloney there are no repressed memories that a psychiatrist can gauge\nAs we have these recovered memory and that was a big deal back a couple of many years ago not real\nIt's not a real thing it's not it may have they're probably some rare instances that has happened but it's not a common thing that\nSomebody can well if you were to sit down and I can probably dig repressed memory in your brain that you've got back there somewhere I don't think so\nI got every damn memory high overhead [laughter] you don't remember them all all the time you know no you're not suddenly right here sitting here remembering everything that ever happened to you all through your life but if somebody brings\nUp a specific instance I can go now now that never happened I I yeah I remember that I'll go dig dug\nYou all have to be hypnotized or a you know mentally a minute manipulated\nBut it's it's kind of like a Google Search if you throw the word and they're all Google Search and it'll come up or\nYou just smell something you could smell the smells like oh I remember this one day when I was ... you know wondering what do you\nHear a song songs will bring it back yeah some song players ... or ... or memory will come back to based on that song\nCouple of the questions are still linger and America is mind one of them are courses who was keeping Lindsey Graham's testicles and it did they want 'em right back or are they going to let him where um for a while we speculate\nIt's the John McCain death you got them all on a in a wheel and John McCain will them here's ...\nOr for John McCain has inhabited his spirit from beyond the grave and suddenly at the threw him like a skin puppet some of the other questions\nAre of course we've gone over before and after yesterday we still aren't any closer to find them out but who what when when did it happen where did it happen who else was there\nHow did she get to the party and how did she get home and let's focus on that last question for a minute according to her she rushed out of the house after just being assaulted by two boys at a party\nAnd she was afraid she was going to die she was terrified she was traumatized probably crying and the ... rolling down her face\nShe didn't have a driver's license it wasn't close to her house who drove her home she should be able to testify to who it was she didn't and who ever it was should be able to testify about her emotional state\nMoments after the incident happened when they got her in the car is what killed her credibility him not till you who was and like I said\nI think she really believes her story she she and only she believes her story she knew she fully believes it but here's the problem whoever Doug that out just kinda like dug up a part\nOf it and left the root system all and they didn't give her the background information that she needs to a job for the rest of us she named three people\nShe named Kavanaugh's buddy he says neck\nIn ... new one the other for the bad day the really the one that really makes your bags or a best friend in high school\nThat Leland from under the best friend goes I don't know the Kavanaugh guy and I never met him that I already was ah I don't remember that incident I don't remember that party I don't remember that\nSituations salary going to get the feeling from just from the statements that they said she made that she was kind of like backing off going ah\nI don't want to be anywhere near this ms forward woman anymore you know she's not right I think she likes her because their friend lifelong friends\nAnd she's she ... she said\nI Believe her in other words she's letting everybody know grain mhm\nThat's what I'm saying you don't do don't I don't want to get too involved with her anymore\nAnd also don't want to get drug in our private hell on television over the world are going after this guy that I don't know it never heard of\nSo sorry I don't know how much money what would you know she got six hundred thousand dollars from go fund me I don't know how much George Soros gave her but she's\nProbably for a college professor there wasn't really that well places probably sit and fat in sassy now for the first time and a long time money wise I'd love to talk to somebody left me question somebody that has been in her class\nBecause she did not look intelligent enough to pass on intelligence to another human being I\nDid hear from one kid that was in a class or she was one of the worst ever\nGot to be she was in sorry but she was just outright stupid about some of the things they asked her do you know what exculpatory do\nYou know the basics of psychology\n\nYou got that Dr ... on your name one thousand dollar an hour drive around a lot what station is this I just had it on\nFloor I'm Pam who sounds Fox News\nToday a painful day for millions of women all across the country Senate\nUm and then we'll have a you know some sort of education whether it's an external speaker or one of the hosts just basically saying hey this is what I'm really good at and I'm going to share this with the Tonight Show and that's a good format\nAnd that's a good you know six to nine thirty once a month or or ten o'clock in the morning to you know twelve thirty one thirty on a Saturday afternoon so we're really really excited about this\nSo that first hour is really the\nFor the members right in the members only there they are coaching each other if you will they're answering each other's questions hey what do you see in this market we've had some that'll do accountability groups and that sort of thing inside that inside that group and their coaching each other and what's going on in the market challenges they're having that sort of\nThing and I'll say at the end of the meeting was one of the things we may or may not do is sell something Mm right and we're for profit and we think that if you're in real estate and you want to gain wealth near being up in northern new should understand that\nThings are going to be for profit who is the first hand for profit organizations in the non profit organizations\nI've I've never thought that a ... a nonprofit organization can teach individual how to be profitable shore it's hard to yeah wealth building when your course nonprofit yeah when I was I mean when you're a non profit right in ... so so that's that's a big thing and you know [noise]\nWithout sounding too to a crash or a you know\nOur stuff works that was not junk yeah right so if we say hey we've used this title person you need to go see the thought of person he or she is fantastic you know that's we're promoting someone we believe in and that's the other thing is we vet are sponsors we vet the products coming in\nAnd uh we also have court educators you can talk a little bit about yeah let's talk about the core educators so right now we're about uh twelve core educators ... and one of the keys is and we have one of the court cases are next to us ah one of the key is is you actually have to be doing deal so if Thomas standing up their teaching vying hold or flipping\nWe want to make sure that Tom has actually buying and holding and flipping right that's that's probably\nA good indicator if you're going to be someone you're going to rely on me that strict you're going to lemonade a lotta a lotta people we are going to eliminate a lot of people we we understand that right from the right from the top when you're doing that because not very many organizations do right and and you know\nWe understand how that room works right through those other guys we understand that the speaker comes in he's really really or she is really really good from speaking from this from front of the room\nUm and you know most of the very very good at what they do some are not rent some haven't done it in ten Fifteen Years but the person who runs that other room not us but their room gets half of what's ever sold on stage is\nPretty standard business it's a promotion business how it works and so\nWe don't need to worry about that\nSo we're not going to have the speaker that comes in and speaks at one of our groups that hasn't done deal since Nineteen eighty\nNo we actually met him and ask for the last five\nAnd a ... but then you know I think the person is doing a lot of real estate deals you know we we've run in ... give an example we were set to close last friday on a deal and the title company and we've been working on clear and title for about six months there were some really unique situations and\nUh uh the Wednesday before closing so just two days in advance title company gets an updated commitment and lo and behold somebody had fraudulently filed a deed and so now now what do you do and you know we've got experience with that\nBut it's not an experienced it you know that you're going to run into on a daily basis but wouldn't you want to have a guru er an instructor that said oh yeah this is what you do this or how you handle that because I remember he goes all the way back to when my college days\nWhen I went to school there was not online registration and things like that and and I changed majors at the end of my junior year\nAnd a and I changed from a a pre med to psychology which means that I'm leaving the College of science and going to the college ... sure\nWell I knew somebody else that was going to do that exact same thing because I had gone there first and figure it out oh this is the office in ... I went to a them so it's it's a it's the largest campus in the country according to the land mass and so just knowing which building\nYou go to I mean that could be either an eight hour or two day process you know eight hours in one day or could take sixteen hours in two days to try and figure out that yourself walking a lot of you know going there oh the deans out right now sorry you gotta\nYou gotta come back or no no he's moved to this other I'm like oh my gosh yeah right so just figuring out is but I was able to\nShare my experience with the other person who was doing the exact same thing and they were able to accomplish everything like in an hour and so it's streamlined the process when someone's been there done that before and\nI'll tell you that goes on house on friday yeah it's um it's borderline flip but definitely by an old sure so we'll see what we can get will do will do little Twenty one day yeah test alone on the ... that price\nBut I got it from you know to ... I don't care the numbers to work for me right and uh they're like ... or I'm like I'm just doing it right and like well what are you doing I'm buying everything I can afford right and then finding private lenders to help me with the stuff I Can't afford right sure\nAnd they're looking like oh we're looking at Detroit we're looking at this work and I'm like listen yeah\nCome get educated yeah right yeah just comes in for a weekend without your class anyone's classroom as long as they're giving up to it on the market I get a little education and go right um take the knowledge applied right right and so\nI was listening the less brown this morning and you know as famous lines like you know are you going to make mistakes yeah source right is it going to hurt yeah yes right can you lose money yes yeah right doesn't mean you don't do it no way\nYeah you know it it learning anything like real estate for example is to me a lot like learning how to ride a bicycle and and oftentimes you know we're so adventurous as kids and then we start building\nYou know this shell around ourselves in our decision making and all of that whereas we get older and older and older sure and until you know when we most people passed the age of forty I mean have given up on our dreams and enter in such a rut\nThat they're not able to make changes how I was a church on Sunday and it says life is about choices you are who you are because of choices you've made right and so really it's like do you want to make the choice to step out of your comfort zone and try something different I mean no one was comfortable the very first time if they if they can think back and remember I I'm\nI've got a Thirteen year old daughter and I remember when I helped her ride a bicycle for the very first time\nAnd I remember kind of explaining I'm I'm a pretty good teacher ... not everybody is a great teacher I feel like I'm going um I'm In love out your utilities are and so I was able to teacher and she actually wrote a bicycle without falling over ... you know she had written with training wheels and all that and she had done well but the first time that she wrote a biography and she she never fell off but\nBut most people we had the experience not that it would have mattered because you know elbow pads and he passed away and I like ... I don't know that yeah we we have I mean I don't remember falling off the first time of course what do we do we get back on and go yeah now I mean I haven't written a bike in probably six months\nBut I could go get on a bike you know right now and just in ... in it for any of us it's\nNow it's easy but when we look back everything is easy once you've done it of course everything looks almost insurmountable when you've not done it\nAnd you know again with armed this is one of the things we do if you want to get educated we'll make sure there's good educators available to you um if you're still got some education and it's still just a little hesitant and the mastermind joining a membership that first hour that rooms insanely powerful right that's really really we have one room\nWhere we have a wholesale or who's on his third deal yeah and the landlord has on his four hundred and fifty rental properties right yeah right in the ear those two guys yeah to each other I just like no no no I'll do it this way as yeah residents can be a lot easier to go over that you're looking at the wrong way and the whole room chimes in\nReally really powerful and so education is great you're going to have to continue your education that's that's something the other way um when\nYou bring that up I wanted to mention when you brought it up before there was not you know there's so many professions medicine industry right or a ... a mechanical which is like air conditioning and heating and plumbing and and and uh and being an electrician and an insurance guy or a real estate agent\nYou know all of those have to get a license in order to practice their craft right but\nIt doesn't stop when you get the license on every single one of those have ... as quick continuing education so if isn't it amazing I mean even accountants and attorneys in any profession\nHas continued education so if you want to stay professional", "show_name": "Our American Stories", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "06"}
