I mean\nThat was saying was\nThat Phil Harrison played was saying that they're losing ... where it was a good thing to do and then\nI realized kids are bears in the woods don't say no they'll take their giant claws and shove I mean to you and rip you apart\nThey will get you like a fish or hide you in the bushes and come back in each ... nibble on you a little bit and they don't care if you're still a cat I'm Alive and scream and they almost prefer that they they do they lack of food fresh that legacy\nFund animal stories by the way the food [laughter] speaking of the the way we treat people who are different than ourselves we've got some\nAttention dividing a town in Pennsylvania how we got attention all over buddy man named mark Barbie\nB. R. B. E. not like the ...\nIs the main branch port Pennsylvania I don't know if you've ever been there they told me it was nice we've got we've got a ... D out at\nMe he poured Pennsylvania that I have a I got that rivers that are more just they'll pour it there he's been in office nine months and they said this poor man it's just been taking it pretty hard now what's his problem well he's the first black\nMayor of Bridgeport and if the first gay mayor a rich poor strike to also and he is the first black gay mayor of Bridgeport there and\nI said that Iran is just being torn apart eighty percent of the residents are a white so Saturday Sunday when the being mayor if eighty percent\nAssociate placing them of being racist or something out of the electoral\nCouncil meetings about devolved into heated argument police chief is quick to council members have resigned he's receiving death threats on social media and the whole place is just tore up under\nTake a second look at the positions you're taking on some things that might not be the fact that you're black and gay my fact that you get messed up out of line\nThey said um again how did he get elected but they said\nThey're not allowed to like you weren't allowed to criticize Obama when he was president yeah I'm not allowed to criticize him on his policies on his stand on things because you're either racist or sexist\nEither way it goes that see that happen when Obama era we elected him right now way more white people have had to vote for Obama to elect him when you say we elected to you're not talking about ... ... room I had just talking about this country in general yeah All right do you know he's\nIn there and he starts whining about racism whine about being put up on line about about being an active so wait a minute this racist country of ours this raises the luggage ...\nAnd this little racist town they said it was always real inclusive and and they went ahead and and voted for the guy\nAnd then he started back up and doing stuff and they said you can't disagree with his policy because it turns out to be something else while we're on the subject of this race has these\nBlooms that we are they're ugly head elsewhere but not here on this show\nIn ah Georgia listeners may have noticed this morning the older that the eyes of the nation have turned over to Georgia where they are now what the the black woman is running for governor there\nOh you've made a mistake the mistakes you you're a murderer into Georgia flag and they got it on video no\nNow she says well\nThat's back when the Georgia flag had a had the Confederate flag on it\nIt don't matter ... damn state flag you don't burn the state flag to want to be the governor of that particular state looks bad now they will tell you know yeah but it was back in the nineties\n... what happened to it was back in the eighties what happened to the cabinet and like you say well it doesn't count and he was young we have only victims no matter what\nMm Mm Mm\nYou're a racist I find that most situations where somebody's going to be a racist juicy knocked the white person that's the race that's when I'm I'm seeing more and more every\nDay well you kind of like Texas with the early voting that took place yesterday day one set a record the governor's race has got early voting surging all across the state of Georgia\nYesterday the Fox guy that\nWas out and now you didn't get to serve anybody else 'cause you'd only get it from the ...\nEven though they lie a lot to do or not as fake some of the other news networks they lie a little less they liked to but not a hundred percent of the child like MSNBC so the guy's covering the trap rather he was astounded at the diversity of the crowd waiting\nTo get in a ... they're not going to tell you about the black folks Asian folks Latino foe there were folks there I personally know step Raul that or wait at all day oh yeah\nSo this this perception\nYou have ah the Trump toothless white redneck uh living in a trailer park there will be able to get a hold of wool [laughter] some dumb ass a ... ... it's a it's a pretty widespread\nI Do enjoy the guy in the hard hats last night that came out wearing his hard hat I assuming he's probably in some sort of a oil and gas related industry but good structured bending over oil expand just showed up\n[laughter] yeah but he was young and uh he cut a quite the little stance there right behind Trump you know I\nCan went down there with the uh traveling microphone senior care producer Kenny ... we were hoping to catch a few protesters anti Trump people or they didn't show up probably cause a hundred thousand people for Trump now these anti Trump protesters are very savvy about the day they're not down there\nFor any other reason than to get on camera yeah and they know the news cameras aren't really going to be showing up until about five\nO'clock in the afternoon guinea winter early yeah you're right after the show but he said he ran into Latinos for Trump yeah algae Beatty for Trump Muslims for Trump\nBut the protesters won't show up until they know they're going to get on camera there they're funny that way\nThen they chat and ... and then they leave sec how stupid you have to be the chat that's ... that's the move of a dumb ass chat\nI some simple thing we memorize and we all say they think that chat is really affect you oh yeah it's the only effective on them on each other [laughter] the rest of us you know we're laughing our ass off you know that right they they probably don't ... you\nYou will change we're going to ignore you after you do yeah they don't have a clue how ridiculous they are they really don't\nI come up with a show where does that uh one one point six\nBillion dollars that earlier that was very helpful or show project that or get the apps so that you know I missed that you think about what will happen if the tea and people took you advice at all with their their the guaranteed ... we'll let you go head to lose money goes you've got to share that thing\nAs your ship this news do you know lead to just ... just told me\nI think the reason we went ahead gave up the news is we doubt seriously doubt that any of our listeners had six hundred million dollars to for up to ...\nThat and how many people have ever really taken my advice on anything\nKnown that I Know that smart there was one guy one time oh\nYeah we miss him ... who took your advice and uh that hurting didn't it ... he didn't stop going to the bathroom for like three days\nExcuse for not Mexicans were from out of town hall\nTo an injunction you made the world series ... Fox News [noise]\nMovie perhaps the question most of us have because most of us have already decided this was not somebody trying to actually a blow up the Democrats no say in the end of the world and the\nFirst of all not a single thing has blown up I mean I if I were doing this I wouldn't have had one at least blow up somewhere somewhere maybe by accident and not\nGuilty by that I Would have had something to make it look realistic because if this is not even looking realistic these phoney baloney you only thing missing when you see a\nPicture of these quote unquote bombs [noise] the only thing missing is ah the ticking clock maybe the sticks of dynamite pick it up and the label\nAcme had to be on there somewhere\nThis is the stuff the coyote used to buy together road right\nSo the question is since there's little doubt as to how this occurred was it someone\nThat was really smart trying to make it look like some back woods redneck kick that didn't know how to make a bomb or was it somebody so horribly stupid that this was as good as they could really do\nWell I I tend to lean into the first theory but it was really stupid to send only to the highest profile enemies on that list I Would have included a couple of mine are targets where people whatever a God\nWho what what they say that one who\nYou know so that there'd be spit\nSome guy who lives on elm street in middle America yeah there are already knows\nMaybe to the mayor of Des Moines Iowa or something you know just throw one in there that doesn't fit with the others you know al well that would make them really scratched their heads but the\nThe way this has done it seems like somebody who's smart who's trying to sound down but then again it's like somebody who thinks they're smart they're smart and this is what points to a Democrat so many things\nThey're smarter than everybody else but it really isn't a smarter say they are\nAll of these publicity devices were ... ... that were addressed return addressed\nTo Debbie Wasserman Schultz is office all of them in a brilliant move at one of the idiots on the news last night came on and told us she is not suspected of sending the\nBombs or is she clever enough to think that this wouldn't keep me from suspecting her\nOne can only we do know they were sent by a Democrat to make the conservatives Trump people\nLook bad well this was to dominate the news cycle\nTake the news coverage off the caravan\nTake it off the fact that uh that I hadn't heard about the care of and this morning a blue wave is not\nGoing to happen so instead we can be talking about\nTrump supporters and Trump supporters this is the kind of thing we come to expect that from supporting Hillary said we\nCan't be civil to them because they're so hateful yes the silver\nRe fill of hate and rage now\n\nUnlike the steep Scully situation nobody's been hurt here\nIf this was a Trump supporter sending these things out some people would have got blowed up buddy absolutely let me tell you for a\nBack that's what another thing that tells us it's fake yet because the Steve ... got shot and some other people got shot in that particular situation and the guy wanted to shoot 'em all and if I had about a Capitol police there he was shot them all\nYeah so don't give us this nonsense about welding and this is the Trump supporters they are just you know you got to hear Nancy Pelosi gathering about this to\nThese these these people they're just you know they have this show and they got that shall we hands all we have left to do is just to a\nVital together and and and and hot and and rebel and our democratic\n... know all we have left to do is remove Trump from off at the end of the leeway to stop this from happening in the future I met right after ... removed from office there yes\nNow we didn't warn people that you should probably if you're a Trump supporter and your unknown magnify wherever\nYou probably should check your your trash or you know underneath your house or wherever they can hide some evidence that could be planted on you to make it look like you're the bomber but Timothy has got a different idea\nIs that I got a hundred bucks is somebody ends up committing suicide\nAnd leaving a note behind identifying themselves as a Trump supporter\nIn confessing that to be the bomber ... who's ... him I tell them I Would agree if Hillary's involved in the planning now Hillary's been count on the outside looking in life lightly I Know a lot of the Democrats want her to go away but she was included on the list\nI mean maybe ... maybe she's in on it maybe than enough yeah maybe I mean if\nSomebody yes I Do aside I'm going to lean into her a little bit after that 'cause that that's her a quote ammo\nHey if it's me y'all know outlawed and right now yeah I like that now you like plain black day like that at all [noise] hey like so there's no okay just know what you know this is uh what are you guys gonna be a\n... are you of the school the Halloween is a ... a worship the devil and you're not going to have it in your home or you just\nYou can't go along with it throw in a costume auditing or even if it was you know we could probably play a little bit you know I dabble does like candy known\nIn my day they were only two costumes goes way\nBack when he got to be ghost here where\nThe hard shoulder and one of those on the list now politically incorrect cost to universities light duty in Austin and others have come out with a list and you just can't be anything anymore we can't be ...\nYou get what you can't what he's saying you can't spin\nThe ghost spook a halt gobbling where you put a white sheet over your head and kind of come alive all\nQuiet on the right out [laughter] definitely I I\nYeah my neighborhood we used to all put the sheets over here and\nWe know about that and it wasn't even Alawite unit was April no nos Halloween the usual ... pictures you know they they took pictures I'm go by religious little bit of dress like that it's all in the middle of may ...\nMe and my partner Sarah Garfield elementary we were ... you remember Caspar the friendly ghosts had like a group of duty ran with it wasn't just\nAnd I just take the ones that are best students no matter what they are well you're scaring me mall it ...\nOh I'm saying mullet raises the broadcasting age need what happens when God gets lazy and humans have to pay\nA ... a lawsuit jumps\nRadio network show right\nIt's the best of all of them Johnson but you can do better\nJust like your first wife knew she could do better well she'll also we lose for you to lie to jade back Monday morning at five thirty and keep your seat fifty\n[noise] [laughter]\n\n\n\n\nOne of our many hundreds of\nYears if people often ask that one\nA a a a\nNobody knows who who who is that\nThat is the animal\nWhen those have you not a in side radio like us up bumper\nIs a bumper music that we use the extra behind the curtain I'm trying to help people understand the complex technological world of\nHigh flying morning radio very glitzy glamorous we're all the horror Emile broadcasting we played Lucy was home so that every all the stations ... back in and be listening to every word you say wait a shoot down the glamour their brother\nNo thought of doing the same thing he would do it now I was trying to make it look good he tries to you know he's like well I don't think it's time for a while to jumpstart get nobody at this stage of your career\nThat that would that boy that that one as I've always been proud to serve our humidity yeah yeah some of these I'm most proud of get nobody around here and that ship is sales on somebody else to your voice yeah\nYou said you know the right do you know you know it's probably mess that we do yes as keep a low profile or they're going to start making us apologize for everything we say half a show will just be apologizing for the other half of the show a beer and the biggest\nThing and radio uh was that we are actually at what point Tom a bigger biggest thing and radio and then his radio became less and less important to people\nOr at least the perception that it was less and less important to be the people are doing battle against us what have you believe we even did less well so it's hard to explain but it seems like a smaller world you'd shine more\nOr there's prejudices a foot but although this ... this whole uh radios is not a big deal to anybody anymore\nTotal lie every time that they plant\nA flag over this dead body and try to eat it or for they tried to bury radio they been digging a hole for years and we keep those in the dirt off of us and lay down you go back and saying regular people first thing they're doing in the cars flipped the damn radio on Ninety seven\nPercent yes attrition something oil don't they don't they fumble around with your blue choose object in front of channel in their eyes and I know there's a few people that do that but most people just a kind of get tired all the fault or all when you can just reach over there and flip the radio on just that and it's almost like that's the fancy but\nYeah what was the system we've got or redistribute the tubes digitally sewage drew a very complex Web of wires and continue and why fi connection when I listen and hold your tongue like when they\nDid this new thing where there's like one big tower that shoots it out through the air like why why and everybody picks it up for like Seventy eighty\nMiles in a circle for free is the biggest why fire in the world for free almost like that should've been invented after as an improvement on the other or let me just set the scene where what you're saying is we're pretty great actually set the scene\nFor you you're just a you know while and away the afternoon hours there at your beautiful home and Cameron uh North Carolina it's a lovely bucolic whatever that means part of the world I'm sure [noise] and\nEr while you're in just a ... probably out in the yard you know playing with a dog a movie comes flying out of the sky it lands on your house\nThat didn't actually happen but how cool would it would have been so cool the military has this thing called the Seventeen military or air air craft you you familiar with the C. Seventeen\nTime with the show you're going to man up often\nWay of knowing the man I'm devoting five thirty ...\nGave you are seeing some smart and your smart speaker ... Google Play it could be or see on a heart radio [noise]\nThis is the best of Walter and them jumps on\nJust like a girl she needed a strip of\nWhat there is nothing better than experiencing the Rio pare back live Monday morning at five thirty\nSwinging giants at all because we are [noise] [noise]\nRead all the other hand\nNot store I Am to\nStick to dying straight [laughter] I guess\nWe should mention that the uh the show will be a pre recorded tomorrow 'cause tomorrow's my dad's funeral and pre recorded sometimes that\nDon't get a lot of energy in the emails about where are you guys why are you taking off where are you\n'cause you know right kind of an important thing kind of Maine of you to do my dad's dad\nThat gives the shows that all I don't want to see these emails about a ... show over it okay I like the fact that you miss the show that's not his name was will is by the way I didn't even mentioned that earlier Willis Johnson I only met will is one time and that was one of them wedding\nNow it was ... it was an award show I don't know what we're getting an award for\nBut it was back in New Orleans so many of them they stack up pretty we do get a lot of awards a lot of accolades coming our way he met him a long time ago\nAnd was eighty four back when he was feisty something like that\nYeah [noise] yeah I seen pretty a\nPretty full of vinegar ... he was a mess yeah I guess uh Twenty years from now somebody is going to say I seem pretty close in a girl right now yeah I remember them days I'm going to find that hard to believe really I'm full of anger right now\nWe've got a mail from a couple of nudes notice I didn't say email do this is weird [noise]\nWhere they're like I took out a piece of paper in a pen and he ... a lost art ladies and gentleman wrote letters on a piece of paper like the kind of stuff\nA Mark Twain used to do and I took three or four days to you because you know regular old snail mail does ah this is from by the way from\nA Jimmy and palm hand I'm assuming probably brothers couldn't be you know bother\nAnd so those handy boys the hand there are a handful of bats in my hand boys watch out more from Daphne\nAlabama now you know we're not on the radio and Daphne, Alabama oh these boys is working hard to get their show I bet they're going to disagree with us about that are targeting call the ... well it might be Auburn fans I hate Alabama through much or more than ... than a true\nAlthough I ... what I I don't want to tell you\nThe bring up what a bad season of times I just but I Love 'em anyway you love your team and let her win or lose your level Clinton or no because I lost the game says a while to not\nThis year is the only settled science I Believe in the wall to Johnson show me and my brother love your show listen daily and we use the app all the time till producer Kenny we enjoy his show also you know you don't know the Houston station not if it's the issue of happening in the afternoon\nAnd thank you so much for the best day of Morning Joe on a planet you are truly rebel radio\nDrawl or give you both ... and\nTom I bet they've had some fights over the euro although when them hand boys\nThree down that would get busy day what\nThen that's going to a bar in a ... they they tell\nSal so hard they clean most of the floor of the barn up\n[noise] and I tell you what clean up the bar and is still a job I Do not enjoy I wouldn't think so I'd never cleaned one ever seen it on television and a lot of the house a horse poop I just like Kevin Costner clean about well about a little stall in a barn on yellow stone a few months ago yeah get a\nPitch for dinner and they get what the pitch fork is never really know why they had the little food for well it's so that the uh hey I guess the either the puck drops out in the hay stays on or the the dropped out the I'm not sure how it works\nThat hey drops out number you maintain that it's kind of like a shift in for a goal is to separate or is all what do you separate now hey prone to boot\nBall a lot of times in these horse stalls you've got a witch called chip would you've got a cedar chest yeah things like that which I share the odor and the whole what were you\nEnd up and you want you want to leave the chips behind because they're kind of expensive and you don't want to throw away all your tips with poop so\nA lot of times you can see through that and keep a lot of euro wood chips and throw away Europe I saw Kevin Costner do it and I feel privileged well what's that old boy's name a\nSasha crash or whatever his name as soon as a side all the dirty work\nAs a good and you know you don't have to do that I Know and then we don't have to like to do it like doing it I Choose to do it\nSometimes there are certain people in this world that need menial tasks and form it gives their brain a chance to drift off and think about other things doing chores that don't require a lot of thought\nThat's how he would think representative and labor and that kind of thing 'cause mine off into the missing coal ugly it lets you think so ah I recommend it I did find it hard to believe\nDid he was out there ... after she a\n... that's probably a little bit of a stretch what with the stooges are still in his belly yeah that would already that the bucking horse I've known plenty of rough tough cowboys and grew up poor and no not which you're not ... at a horse ... hard as what Jacqueline [laughter]\nAlthough I Will say it is a cat a Kevin Costner has made for that role you quite good at it\nI now here's what I Wonder if there is this going to come back a writer if they're going to go ahead and kill off Kevin Costner because he's too expensive to keep on the show and they got they used to be get started and then they'll keep all of the other characters in just have\nHim be bad that used to be there\nGreat that we already clubs yeah yeah well that's good that's what you said go to a\nAmerican ... dot com will get you all take care of their [laughter] um\nAnd he said a ... you know how's the apartment market I said I don't I don't do apartments I Do single families he's like single families like one one house and like ... like one house yeah he was like oh well how much could you make from that I was like oh good ones like four bucks door he said well four dollars doesn't excite me\n[laughter] me either then excite\nMe I'm like okay I was like yeah I I I get it as like but you know we want to buy a bunch mhm and I said so what does excite you ... and he said well\nTwenty twenty five thousand dollars a month that would excite me okay I'm like okay\nThat's exactly my goal mhm I mean I Know mine number we talked about this all the time what's your number my numbers twelve thousand eight hundred and forty two to double that for inflation and the fact that I don't believe that Social Security Medicare Obamacare any of that stuff will be there for me when I Need it and so the cover my\nCollective but ... my wife and I are our goal is twenty five thousand dollars a month and you get from real estate\n[noise] and if you divide that by four dollars a door comes out to sixty four house Mm and\nExplain that to him once I use a number fifty houses mhm and he uh he said yeah you know that sounds like a lot of work so I'm not doing the work and you know that's not me\nI'm not seeing a little lawns here who built on this guy got me out\nSourcing that stuff and he's like I guess that's okay I was like well here's what should really excites you if we at fifty properties mhm we bought 'em off or let's say their value and we buy him a hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nAnd they go up fifty percent over the next five to six years ... has and I don't buy them at a hundred and fifty by them like a hundred twenty yeah and so there's going to go up to two twenty five I'm going to make a hundred thousand on every project that's five million dollars worth of appreciation mhm\nHe turns me says that excites me [laughter]\nOh we're site it all on our side\nAnd so we take those all those little Nichols eventually add up to the dollar\nWell you know it's a funny it's kinda like you know when Jeff Bezos start an Amazon like well how much do you make selling a book well I make like twenty five cents well that's not really saying well I'm I'm going to sell the entire world like I'm going to be the world's library right library of Congress right right and like oh well that's you know I'm I'm going to be worth ... billion bucks at the end of the day here so that is funny and then we just\nTake that out a little further and this is a conversation you know people are just they want to make the the five million today and it's like doesn't happen that wasn't\nAnd now unless you win the Powerball tonight\nSure yeah whoa that's rather of our yeah I I don't I don't do a lot yeah\nUm [noise] anyway you know everyone wants that\nThat instant hit right the instant gratification had only make five million dollars you make five million dollars by going on by fifty to sixty single family is or duplex is ... having good credit having some private lenders and working through this market\nOn a regular basis and then five to seven years if you have fifty you'll make their money\nYou know it's amazing when someone says how do I make five million dollars you almost want to say a million dollars at a time for the next\nYou know five years six or seven right so or ... or six or seven right but it's a slow you know\nOne one foot in front of the ... you know Rob I'd like to\nWin the a a gold medal in swimming you cannot do that this year will throw there's no there's no ... this year right as [laughter] time in a place of these things right\nAnd it is that slow kind of meter to progress right one foot in front of the other over and over and over again and eventually you\nKnow you you get to that place a I was doing some math the other day math ... edition and um arithmetic arithmetic yeah and I sat down and looked at our numbers in and we've got either clothes or contracted since the first of September twenty doors\nAnd and that's a ... and I'll tell you right now that's a lot that's not normal people don't do normally do that but can you do that over the course of a year can you do that over the course sure who years yeah absolutely just just kind of click on a long hair so that was the number that got I'm excited so I assume that everybody's got a number that gets them excited at some point\nRight and and again it's almost like um [noise]\nI don't want to discount it ... or even belittle it but if you're just working in progressing ahead and I met with I had dinner with the investor last night I just ... ... worked lives in Chicago but works here in the in the Houston market\nFour days a week ... ... what do you want to do how what do you want to get to see I don't want us to work anymore I'm like okay do you want to have this year we want to do that when [laughter] right let's put a date on it and so we went through that stuff and and it just if it's just a cash\nFlow right 'cause there's so many ways to look at the value of real estate ... and if it's just just to cash flow then you know sixty four for me does it at four dollars a door for twenty five free and clear ... you know it's sixty four means I'm going to have\nSix point four million dollars worth of appreciation on average right right right yeah I've six seven years and the numbers valor while in what we talk about for example in demonstration purposes\nAnd well you know what maybe it doesn't work out that when it's happening yeah I mean for a million new okay that's rough one that's tough\nBut if you're getting the cash flow mhm you're kind of forget about the appreciation there mhm right unless you it's it's an emergency friday can be liquid within within our world and about ten days right right it's about ten days we can get that liquid so it's almost as if\nThere's sort of two things we're looking at I'm looking at it from the castle right because I Want to go swimming in the hashing induced skiing and figure out like that and and and enjoy the beach so that's my goal is that's where I'm working at\nDeals mhm right and that's that's the real benefit about our organization is most rooms\nI'd say Ninety percent of the people haven't done a deal tempers and have done a deal ours is about fifty fifty yeah and that's where we want to keep it\nYeah we're uh if you when you guys come out to one of our Vince wanted things you'll notice is that\nUh they're not huge events and they are it's a room full of folks that are doing deals I mean it is a I mean a room of deal makers and uh and folks that are lending money or buying houses or\nYou know anywhere in between and the way I look at it on the market changes about every quarter ... I've been reading a lot of funny stuff on Facebook where I'm going to like the markets change and I'm like yeah I did last quarter just like it will this quarter just like it has really last five or six years have been a real estate so um\nBut you don't know that unless you're buying deals every single month or a couple of deals a quarter right it can just be kind of\nLike all of the markets change just like a surprise uh and when you come to our club meetings if not uncommon to find easily fifty percent of the room that's been that's doing the least quarterly and I'll tell you what I've been I've spoken a lot of national events I've been in a lot of different real estate clubs and\nNine times out of ten in the room is full of newbies and there's nothing wrong with that and our our group is totally friendly to the new investor of come on out will will you know\nWe will ah you know if he joined the mastermind group you get to see some of that stuff we've got some basic education on the on the website or when you become a member but what's really important is that you just don't be a newbie forever right there is a an expiration on that in fact in fact you know like kids is one of those Jim Rome things\nYou know Jim Rhone I'll tell you that the reason they make those deaths so small cars you can't sit in third grade the rest of your life right you got a graduate of of you got to move on so you can't be a newbie forever and if you're not getting a lot of traction in the first thirty days you you probably are not in the right places that I had a ferret estimates\nVery fair um and that's the thing we want we want to see people succeed we want to see people having to investing their goals figure out their number figure out their targets and there should be always a target and we worked with people in that room ... whether they're brand new or their\nUm you know so we've got folks who've on the four hundred and fifty of house and some of us right now are just say I'm getting a five hundred in the mirror and I'm I'm here because I Know that I Need to keep learning and I need to be around environment folks are doing and so that's critical for us so well on brand new or you know again we have so in foreign fifty problems in our rooms\nWell I'll tell you a good example is when somebody's got that many properties under a that they that they bought over the years uh they're also they're for deals right there were there for that one little tip or trick\nThey're looking for market intelligence hey what are you guys see going on in this market and then the third thing is they're really looking for deals someone someone's going to get a hold of something ... this is how real estate works I don't know why it works this way is just how it's worked for years\nYou're doing your marketing you're talking to wholesalers and you don't get one house under contract you end up getting if you do a lot of stuff you end up getting two or three all at once and they go ah what do I do with these other two\nAnd then they'll post at a private Facebook group or if they've got accountability partner set up yet they'll send a message hey Bob I'm I just got two more under contract I don't know what to do with\nOh I heard Joe buys down there and or talk to Bob or who you know and then you you can make a little bit of money wholesale and that property to somebody in the group one of the things I always found fascinating is\nWholesalers built this entire cottage industry of quote building in business part time wholesaling deals and I don't I don't think it really works like that but let's you're going to build a big wholesale company\nWhich very few have done successfully wholesaling is really a consequence of really good marketing you happen to have gotten a deal that for some reason can't close you know and you sell to one of your colleagues that's in the group and that happens a lot in our club\n[noise]\nIt is amazing how many transactions are happening within our club and we have some times we actually have to just to sort of\nDeals right wing pull up deals right off the MLS ... and the people in our clubs are making offers right there with agents and loan officers in title and lawyers and all that stuff sitting in the room so um it is it is an action take\nYup take us corporate and that's that's the real thing to take away from what American real estate meet up is trying to do is we're trying to find the action takers in the marketplace yeah and if there is only five and\nFind there's five yeah but if there's a hundred and fifty then that's fine too there's a hundred and fifty and inside our rooms it's for action takers they want to move forward and improve their lives yeah and that's really what we're looking for\nYeah or look at it say one of when we started this company one of the things that we talked about is hey what does this thing really I mean what does it stand for what does it really who's it really four\nAnd one of the things that I had seen over the last five or six years is that I Would go to a lot of these real estate events and most of the people in the room are doing real estate right and I said we're I I've never been a part of a professional organization where Ninety percent of the people that show up to the meetings are not in that organization\nLike I was a risk manager I never showed up to any risk management meeting and Ninety percent of the room where people were not risk managers right I mean it's it's so weird to me\nBut that's how most these real estate events are so that's when you when you and I were chatting I'm like hey let's get a group of people are actually doing this because the real value is like you said in that peer to peer mentoring right in that peer to peer environment of we're saying\nHey I'm having this problem with money or having this problem with a contractor I'm having this challenge with the title company who do I need to talk to you to get this solved and the person who is most likely going to help you is not somebody who's brand new\nIt's got to be the ... of room of people who say oh yeah I had that problem one time or I Know a guy who did and they called this person and\nAnd you get resolved it gets taken care of it is not a problem here um I think we're the challenges is that when you when it's just a room full of new investors which I said is fine but the reality is you want to be around if you're a new investor you me around round about your new investors right you want to be around all the all the folks that are taken action\nIf you're around somebody give you a good example if you're somebody who wants to buy ten how's this year and you and your spouse and like I don't know how it can buy ten houses it's that's wild and then you sit in a room where there's a guy buys a hundred years like tens easy\nAnd then you start developing that mindset of all I can do ten guys a hundred I can do ten yeah [laughter]\nBut that's the reality of it is yeah injured right yeah and you know you have you got to get some stuff together you going to have to sit down and some people and will happier for you know we have some of our sponsors and some people in our networking hey go here go here and go here figure it out and then when you're ready getting this room start making offer\n... um [noise] a couple of wholesalers in our group so we would typically tough to map\nOut a wholesale yeah but that's okay if you're a wholesaler but um we're talking about your business and the risk management and and I always make the joke [noise] uh basically tennis players\nLottery winners professional bowlers and wholesalers yeah or the only people in any industry that show their paycheck oh honey right and so I'm only like ... why does the whole so I Need to show me the paycheck yeah I I don't deserve doctors say hey look I just did this final surgery and here's my\nPay thirty grand on this surgery like nobody cares\nIf you're a tennis player yeah you get the ... or we win the lottery you have the big check but uh I don't know why wholesalers feel the need to do it I think it's it's\nIt's you know maybe this one or the first to that's that's fine but no one in our room was holding a big checks nobody put subjects where we're talking about getting deals done [laughter]\nBackward joke and actually at the less sugar land meeting hey I haven't seen a whole lot of because we're all Facebook friends now I'm like I haven't seen you guys post a you know a picture of your bed with a pile of cash on and that seems to be the other thing I see around Facebook all the time when the yo yo yo were killing it and it's like I don't this is this is not not how the real world works\nSo we're trying to separate armies from ... in the market there's a lot of things out there and um are the folks and go to and that's fine and we really don't I mean we've been in those other rooms or not um\nWhich something pressed yeah you know so those guys can keep doing what they do and we think we have a really good business model here that actually helps people and gets people in the right track and for us that we're going to do more to do that for the foreseeable future here and grow this across the country so it's not just one or two market's going forward going for them all\nYeah we're gonna we're gonna take all hunter clubs across the country so [noise] uh Mr Holmes ask here how do you feel about borrowing from your retirement to fund a deal [noise]\nI think I'll take this one for him you can [noise] you know I I think you really got to look at your options do you need that money out of your retirement to do that deal if that is your only option then I think you really do have to look at you know what's the return\nAnd all that kinda stuff um but I think nine times out of ten a lot of people will tell you that\nA lot of people will go to I Need to pull money out of my retirement account to do the deal maybe you don't have the best financing in place like you don't have the best lender\nBecause it's some cases you can be less out of pocket where maybe you don't have to pull money out of retirement a second option I always say is can you work with a private lender instead\nSo you've just got less out of pocket maybe you give up a little bit of the return uh in in return for them doing that deal we actually talk about\nThis issue in particular a class that Robin I teach on money we call him money coaching you actually go to the American real estate meet up website if it's if it's not on there just shoot us an email will send you a link to it but ah what are you guys think about that or what do you think about that Rob in particular how\nFar is if it's high money I'm probably not going to touch it right and I'm going to leave it in there I Do believe in diversification even though some uh some", "show_name": "Our American Stories", "year": "2018",
