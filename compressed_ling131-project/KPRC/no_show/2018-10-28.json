makes sense to college is so high they need every advantage you can get fat that's been that's goes back to the system being rigged against the poor so that's what we'd go back to I guess is it rigged against the our borders that it's the same price for the rich yeah\nBut I mean I guess the rich and really I have burned the money go wherever you want I don't know that's the thing about rich people I don't think of it like if when this this this a big lottery jackpot yeah\nI think it'd be pretty frugal with my money yeah I'm already for growing up as it is like twenty dollars right I'm like oh
