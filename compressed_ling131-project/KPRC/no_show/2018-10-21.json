I still go I Can't get old girl I like the new article where they said that\nThe Texans should get rid of their hateful mascot the Texans eight ... 'cause I don't like that that hurts\n\n\n\nEvery week\nThis week guy basically\nWent through the CDs that I Would have had an eighth grade and I pick my favorite songs from um [noise]\nI actually got done watching a blues traveler video from was Ninety seven so that was good for them yeah right around on straight out until morning\nOut uh for had just come out a few years before that with ... with a hook you up there running around they were really good I was sort of um I\nRemember when I discovered blues traveler and groups like that in fish yeah and so it's kind of funny how like I remember liking that stuff in seventh and eighth grade and be made fun of\n'cause it was dorky and it was like old man music right and it's sort of funny how I Would like the entire full circle and now I'm back to like revisiting some of those records\nThat's not so bad why I've watched the kind of like the dead I watched the video because they were they were saying in this article I was reading how John Popper was way ahead of his time\nYeah because you know it it if you read the lyrics to hook mhm it's actually a song making fun of the industry yeah for making crappy songs yeah like even like the ... the the course part and write hooked makes no sense if you actually get a brings you back right they were literally mocking you as a music\nFan like if you sing the song the video too right but if you sing that song he literally mocking you for singing the song well the video for hook\nWas that the the songs hook was like that and the video for an around was the same way too because the video of her run around\nHad them like the real bad and the real bad blues travelers ugly right signed an ugly when John Popper was like really big too right like not that cool big but like fat big and they\nIn the video they were like behind a curtain and there was like a cool sexy counting grows looking banned in front of the stage\nLip sinking in Miami and that they were doing this on a head it's just funny I knew order did the same thing ... years later for their San Cristobal where they had\nThis really cool hipster looking band would pass a pacifist hit as hipster in two thousand to do in the music video for one of their songs because at that point I mean now new orders cool but like in two thousand two it's like oh those people are old gray haired and now we we welcome that that's cool\nYou know basically David Byrne is like you know the Justin Timberlake of of genetics there's at this point right so yeah but yeah the ... one of those really fun ones I really miss that are really cool I like to see him once I think pop or can still play African soap operas really good Poppers is um definitely\nI mean someone posed a question to me or this week they said that Tom to long\nIs thirty eight million dollars or right around that number in debt how because he started that company that employed all those ex or an essay employees NASA employees know he did that to ... you know yes\nYeah ain't got to go back in the blink when I Need to they don't want him well they are as a superhero well that company they started selling a stock shares a right or out of the gate and they had like fifty million dollars with the stock to sell nearly ended up selling ... million so they are way\nBands that to me often simply all sound the same and I can't distinguish between them uh-huh there's like Twenty one pilots imagined dragons\n\nOne republic but I think imagined dragons I think there are actually GOOD Music children though like I've only seen my friends take their kids to that stuff well all all the members of a imagined dragons with the Juilliard\nThey're all classically trained musicians and we don't have you know real bands like you know presidents of the United states of America is the first song by leading to play on the guitar\nAnd such a\nA\nCountry ... piece you wrote\n\nDo you ever done one of those genetic tests [noise]\nLike a twenty three and media know there were all talking about this week with was with one no I don't I don't want to know where I came from is that might be bad no no that's soon to be said about that I was going to ask about that this week because\nI think that we ascribe too much of that uh-huh tourists like oh of course I'm of course I didn't either and I'm an ... yeah this is why I like to drink it because I'm part Irish or there's something to that effect right I think we ascribe too much to that I think that we of course I Love\nCorn that's why I Am one Seventy fifth hundreds Indian\nExact Native Americans sorry law yeah of course I Love corn on the cob that's just I've noticed that that's we that's the problem with these genetic tests is that it's cool to be curious and be like oh I didn't know that we have that in our background that's one thing but when you're like no\nI Am one Ninety nine thousand Indians so sorry Native American that I grew up in the nineties in the eighties guys I don't I don't know you know we had Cleveland Indians in Washington Redskins\nSo that was before an thing this week that we learned about the ... found out that she was you know whatever percentage way way way way way way down the line I think it's Native American but possibly South American indigenous people I think it goes back to his long yeah\nLike we could have done this years ago yeah and I just think it's funny that the system has been rigged to where people can game it\nBy using things like that in their background to get more things right that makes sense absolutely like I understand you know I think you're fixing to go to an affirmative action ranch [laughter]\nNo like I it seems to me like those kinds of things you can see on the face you understand maybe you don't condone completely but you understand like I understand you know that there's you know for you know black kids in for Hispanic kids and even you know some white kids there's special\nUm scholarships you know for certain backgrounds I understand that mhm but I don't understand when you say that you are one teeny tiny little bit possibly indigenous that that means you are culturally diverse\nMaybe it's because that makes sense to college is so high that you need every advantage you can get fat that's been that's goes back to the system being rigged against the poor so that's what we go back to I guess is it rigged against the war is if it's the same price for the rich\nYeah but I mean I guess the rich and really I have burned the money go wherever you want I don't know\nThat's the thing about rich people I don't think of it like if I Want this this this a big lottery jackpot yeah I think it'd be pretty frugal with my money yeah I'm already frugal enough as it is with like twenty dollars right and like a guy who I'm going to put the candy bar back then like every year that I like\nI'll explain that to like my mom and she's like you could afford a candy bar and this home for what if I'm the same way yeah so it was Ninety nine nine hundred and Ninety nine million close to a billion dollars I don't know what\nI think I Would have a guy by stuff for me I I Would have in my personal something no I Would have my money manager or my accountant and I'd say\nDo I have enough money I Know I Do yeah but do I have enough money to buy that floor of that building across the street and he would say yes you do and I'd say well can you get it for me to or he would say why\nHe would probably want somebody who would say well why well if I had four houses already yes absolutely if I Am coming from my apartment\nI Want him to say that uh would you like it tomorrow okay yes I Would okay I was going to be like\nFive or six hours it's like you said he write his job should be like is the failsafe to be like no\nExactly no flags out of hand and I think I Would have to hire a dietitian because I Would immediately want to go to every cool right I I wouldn't I Would go opposite no like I have like\nBecause I think being excited about food is sort of like when you grow up like lower middle class like that's an excitement things right and so I think for me I Would be I'd want to divert from that and go the opposite and be like no I'm only going to eat things that we're prepared for me at home and I will always ... like I wouldn't be like\nOh what a Bob McDonald so I can have a McDonalds or whatever but that's what I'm saying I Would have to buy have to hire a dietitian right on your way yeah because I Would want to do that because\nThe industry that we're in the people that do the things that we do we always get to go to these great restaurants and I would love to pay it forward again that's good yeah I have to say do that for Charles do it for a child to correct that what do you do for dinner tonight I Want to go to Georgia Jay ... yes yes and not talk to me uh\nI Would it would be a question I Would ... eats at the dumbest restaurants you've ever seen I Would have ... but if you had your nine hundred and Ninety nine ... you have a billion dollars right if you wind up if you win the the the mega million thing and you get like you know the cash value like six hundred or something sure\nYou have enough money to where you don't need to breathe it's either\nAll right I don't have to work you can call them but I Would love to work you can call them sure I mean literally say by the restaurant\nYou're not even that like you could just walk in yeah like you would be able to you would be that connect to where you could just walk in on the busiest night of the week and be like hey and they'd be like ooh\nGet the hell out of here James Harden will say they've got to eat well the thing is that people like Charles can do that now and he doesn't have that much actually I I\nI think it's a personality thing and I don't want to change my personality and I get that money oh I think I'd be a horrible person I don't think I Would like I wouldn't tell you I had I'd be a super villain I Would tell you I had the money that I wouldn't tell I wouldn't have down said like I'd stay working because I think I'd have a much better day knowing that I didn't have to do it and you could just like Bush to be a jak button absolutely\nJust having that by you literally be working for spite yes I was working working at a spike to ruin the lives of the little people no no no I wouldn't do that I Would be working because I Need something to occupy my bothering the day\nBut just knowing that if I had a bad day I could be like oh man\nBut if you had a bill earlier this you don't you don't need this so you do you do you need to that point started doing things out of the kindness of your own heart right but I Would also spruce up the building to as I as I saw that like if if if if I came in this particular studio here and I saw the difference on the wall or like the paint marks\nI'd probably higher company to come in after hours in pain so you'd buy the building I wouldn't buy the building I Would just do it yourself I fix it up and then they would come in the next day and they'd go\nWait isn't that the sixty five inch TV we were talking about and I think yes it is yes it is I I went ahead and I went ahead and grabbed it for us guys and they say oh we can't accept that and I say well\nIt's on the wall don't make me take it off for you I quit yeah they'd be like well we've got a rope and you would because you're a billionaire or I Would buy a whole building myself and say can we move this cluster of radio stations in my building and you can
