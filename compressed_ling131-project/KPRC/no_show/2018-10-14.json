thirty third in almost a third largest city in America but we're a small market yes we don't have the same drawl even with the great players we have on the coasts\nPeople in this city I Can't even watch the games we can't do the regular season games that we can watch the TBS gained yeah but during the season we have no draw yeah about half of what is in the city yeah so and they'll be and TBS
