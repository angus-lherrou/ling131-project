heavy in here and some weeks like you know I talk about like you know the what's the best kind of cheeseburger to the dry heat while you're driving and you know in my little you know elderly\nDog but for some reason I'm just so aggravated right now is thinking about it on the way in here\nThat I blame all this on Democrats in the beginning and like from the for him like from the get go like in twenty Fifteen uh-huh for even picking Hillary sure because if they wouldn't have picked her just as like some sort of preordained duty but she was going to all of course be the first female

you have to have to clarify everything anyway\nI'm just so aggravated with them for picking the horrible horse and giving everybody else this other horrible option right like in return right and I'm also mad at Republicans to for even putting that up there were childish yes we're very like how ridiculous this was in it always goes back to\nI'd really blame I don't know about your industry but my

think it was the one I rediscovered I really enjoy that one\nYeah that's that's probably if we're just talking about I mean I Can't think of anything right now other than Neil Young so how do you go
