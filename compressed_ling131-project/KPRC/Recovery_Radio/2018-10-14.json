I Do have to cover it and hey honey\nThat's Roy wife check this out right here scientists have discovered that drinking a part of the day increases your a performance in bed by risking impotence by thirty four percent compared to non drinkers that's why I drink folks that's it right there\nI don't I Can't handle that man so to cut down on your risk of him despite thirty four percent compared to non drinkers drink a pie a day\nHave a little temple and or you'll get a little more performance then the flop but the teacher told lawyers and they said that drinking more than a pine today did not necessarily increase your benefits but\nUh there is always that risk you drink too much you get the old brewers drew so us studies have been done scientists have performed them and read done their

a good for for preventing impotence I don't know okay but I just know it's not the best during the world it's not\nIt actually might be the worst year in the world can we use it for preventing impotence though I Can't confirm that let's go with it you can buy if you want quantity over quality you might be interested in this story okay now you light has just released their new Seventy seven pac which\nObviously makes your thirty packs look weak in tiny week [laughter] teach purity dirty pack Ninety seven pac comes\nIn a dirty cardboard box with handles and you'll need them because it weighs sixty five pounds\nFor now it's only on sale in College Park Maryland\nWhere I'm sure the kids at the University of Maryland have already wholeheartedly embrace them and there's no word yet on whether or not it will go nationwide\nNow if you remember er um now you may not know there's been a few years ago there was a certain brewery in Austin that came out with the Ninety nine pack a craft brewery and they got the attention um and I think what happened is Matty light was like hey\nWe we see what you did there now we're not going to nine nine pack will go with the Seventy seven pack and a for those that are like the daylights like my brother in law my brother in law he goes out and buys I don't I'm not sure if he does this any more but I knew he used to do this\nA case of ... every Sunday and outlast them all week\nAnd I always said that the day I can convert him from drinking light to drinking craft beer a day they show on near light will turn off\nNow you know what Seventy some back right was that because that's the year it was founded oh see hold on a second bonus what's on tap radio fun fact right there ... found a Nineteen Seventy seven so yup ... just released a Seventy seven pac\nWhich is a really weird configuration because you've got to wonder how they package that I've actually gone to a guy shape box yeah but I think I saw somewhere in there that it's like okay it's I don't know how many levels that doesn't work out evenly so it's like they just crammed the last three cans of the time\nSay to hell with it just got one just they don't care that city guy like you know when you're packing for a good our town you can't get that suitcase shut your age are sitting down and there's three\nSixty three cans in there somewhere and just make it work so well what they did but anyway now like well here's here's here's a tip from your old buddy a James and ... here I'm don't try drinking the Seventy seven back by yourself and expect a impotence to improve\nWellbeing and if you wanted to drink and pine today I guess you can just go out and buy the send you send them back in there you go you know there's your impotence eye\nImages a woody woody preventive preventative measure that's what it\nIs but I Would encourage you do not drink that in a go at the southern star\nNo label buffalo by you or eighth wonder I'm Sorry I think that's a better deal yeah you have to ah get outta here we do and we've had a action packed show uh when I think uh been Robinson came on the show talking about his book beer hacks hundred tips tricks in projects\nOr it's a good read also big thanks to air Salazar Andrew ... in ... bosley new Belgium brewery for stopping by the show after the we we did the interview we went out in a two they can Anthony's they had a beer dinner\nWhereas all sours else our beer dinner wow yeah I had to be interesting it was very interesting my palate would\nWreck\nJudge got kicked out of your tongue got kicked in the face again and if you went on that's a real thing burning see pictures you can get our social media outlets on tap radio Facebook Twitter and Instagram are there you can see the beers that we're we've drank the guests we've had in Studio and other fun things and that's the best way to give us a gesture gyms and feedback I Want a\nSteak also Lost Ark nine who's adjusted the beer that we brought the tables that are brought to the table the boot stout from a stone Brewing Company so please give us a suggestions and a fall is all over social media\nThe finger sponsors speaking of ah those breweries that just mentioned so they're starting to label buffalo by eighth wonder big thanks to the back our grill forgive us these tacos you've been this bad oh man so good of course a ... and butter foods that sponsors are\nBought the tape abortion and cast raining who sponsors are pod cast please share a pot gas because that's how we continue to grow the community\nAll right well yeah we gotta get outta here I've got a painting me honey I'm coming home\nI'm good science [laughter]\nAll right let's go for a visit ... down in the way home barely a bill lucky [noise] I agree with you to stay vigilant and without that radio will be back on my radio airwaves\n[noise]\n\n\n\nAnd the problem is is that your own brain left to its own devices will go there and stew and things get worse and worse and getting the spiral so uh being part of a community is really really an important thing and ah one of the things that um that has come out time and time again with all the gifts that I've had has been oh I stay in community you know I ...\nPatient with my friends with my neighbors with my family I I stay in touch with my church and in fact my churches there when I don't even want to reach out they reach out to me and make sure that I'm Still included in the community\nAnd one of those many communicate communities that we participate in is the a civic community is is the civilization around us our cities or towns and so forth and the most important thing that we can do and that\nIs to participate in that in the in the political life in a in doing the elections and that type of thing so voting\nRegistering to vote 'em I really hope that everybody a registered to vote this week the the deadline passed on Tuesday last day to register to vote and uh so\nIf you haven't registered to vote you're not going to be able to vote in the mid term Jews and still register to vote you just won't be able to vote in November this come this coming November but it is so important that you exercise your right and you're privileged to vote and to get out there and get involved to learn what's going on and to learn a you know make your decision and go ahead and vote\nOr one of the things that is just a confusing to me is uh I moved down here to Houston over Thirty years ago and when I moved to Houston a Mark White was the governor of the state and hand Richard is about to come in as governor it was the time of uh\nOf Barbara Jordan or and or you know Texas was a blue state back then\nAnd um I don't think Texas has changed that much in the intervening time but for some reason we got identified as a red state a lot of people tell me she Steve how can a liberal like you live in a red state like Texas and it was like oh and I moved here it was a blue state\nAnd ah one of the things that it is a confusing to me and when ... will get a chance to talk with my guests today about this as a dance deals she's running for Congress ah and ah but back in Nineteen ten a hundred years ago over a hundred years ago Texas was Seventy five point nine percent rural than that lived in rural counties\nIn two thousand town Texas was eighty four point seven percent bourbon so eighty four point seven percent of the population\nLived in urban areas and in those five biggest populous areas that's Houston San Antonio Austin Dallas in El Paso\nOr all of those are are strongly democratic voting democratic leaning areas Harris County which is the third largest county in the United states and there's actually bigger than like I think twenty other states or in the country as far as population\nHas voted reliably democratic for many many years and um you know so the the for me the uh with my background being an engineer and you know trusting math it doesn't add up to me so we're going to talk a bit more about that today\nAnd talk about you know how you can participate in community\nAnd how it's so so important for you to get out and vote if you register to vote to get out and vote\nTo vote early and to make sure as many of your friends and many of your friends and neighbors that are out there a will come out to vote as well uh no your polling place make sure that you've got everything put together and we'll talk more about that uh with day in the steel when we get back so stay to [noise]\nIf you're in the market for foreign whether it's Harvey related or not I've got
