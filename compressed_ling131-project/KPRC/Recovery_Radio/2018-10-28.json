{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "A lot of people are a out their shopping for crap you're still trying to figure it out and\nOh I'm new to the game well speaking of us ... and butter food's going out to a local store retail establishment it can be overwhelming yeah it's like all these beers it's a wild west\nAnd so we can buy the list of choosing the best beer at a retail establishment whether it's specs which we encourage you go to ... or you know it should be or whatever it may be so what I always say is go straight to the fridge and you're saying why will temperature fluctuates\nHeat is the enemy\nOf fresh tasting beer it leaves the brewery cold gets on a truck cold cold and then it goes into a sexy filled cold to it goes into a warehouse distribution coal dish should anyway should be good distributor and then it goes straight to retail section hot\nWish don't get me wrong it doesn't do much to the beer\nNow right now so if you're looking for the best possible beer absolutely go straight to the beer fridge but it is completely possible that the beer did get up to room temperature before being put in there but it's a James point I have to agree shop in the fridge if you\nCan if not don't worry you're going to be All right yeah buying we're off the shelf is not the worst\nA uh can you get a new label named ... queued up here here we go get ready here uh this one goes up to Greg ... a this rule right here yeah there it is building he listens to show that's my dad we also call them dubbed a dubs uh this is you're All right here check the date codes\nAll the data did announce a new picture not too long ago you did it was so scary about a year and a half old IP a sitting there and it's like\nYou need to look at the date codes and I I told my old man this he's a he's goes a single shelf said man look at the deals you can get here in the single shoveling yeah look close the dates a check those out and if you're not sure what the date code is you're like hey this is all cryptic you actually Google it because a lot of breweries used a Julian calendar\nOr a special code and it will tell you so makes your drinking fresh beer unless it's a beer that's supposed\nTo be asked you what are the day 'cause usually there at the bottom of the ... the can you say the born on day and sometimes they even have born on dates on the on the cans and you have a three to ... when in doubt\nChoose can't now there's nothing wrong with bottles but just remember can't protect the beer better than bottles and because light is the worst enemy UV light is the worst enemy to beer\nIf in fact I'll go into these steps out real quick clear bottles protect zero brown bottles protect eighty percent in Cannes one hundred percent of you'd be like\nYeah liking Cosby or to be skunk or otherwise degrade the flavors you desire though like I said just check the born on dates check the the the glass yeah you want to buy you catch jak glass interesting [laughter]\nAs we talk about drinking responsibly show yeah shooting and we're talking about tips of choosing the best beer when you're at the grocery store we want you to have the freshest in the best beer which also leads me to say you know it's not the farmers' market but shops seasonally and that means very simply this when you see Christmas sale\nUnless it's of course Christmas in July buffalo by you burn company a net done intentionally and it is fresh usually Christmas in July\n... yeah October fest beers in March like yeah [laughter] that's no way no spring beer winter warmer and summer no no no there are a lot of overlap some beer releases but I Will tell you this\nMost of those that you see if you if there are six months apart it's probably last year's release shops easily\nShop easily otherwise you're getting\nOld beer yeah and remember I BAs porters and ... usually are um year round yeah but if you see in October fest here like I said in the summertime like June [laughter] probably not\nFresh grown probably not a last on the list is okay lash\nOut into the salesman at your own written by ... you mean like the discount been yeah ah I I'm not\nSaying that every beer that's in a salesman is bent on the shelf for three years you're trying to get rid of it yes it has [laughter] sometimes or the manager's specials no not ... well I I was okay [laughter] I mean let me defy me let me let me jump in and\nI went to a certain retail establishment and found that they were selling my favorite one of my favorite I ... to hearted ... oh yeah and they were selling it half off well and my first thought is obviously the bears old ... not the case\nThe reason why it was half off it because they were in bottles they were making room for the cans alright I'll what I was saying that that's why I'm saying that just because it's in the sale then doesn't necessarily mean that it's been on the shelf or you know two years and they're trying to get rid of in a fire sale\nLet this be a lesson for all of you to like the fight on Facebook I'm modifying my position based on new facts and so thank you James red lightning me and no I don't wish to fight you any longer [laughter] make you yeah I don't know I don't want it to our muscle you after this you know that's able he's coming up do do a dude I'm taking him out\nBut these are just a few tips are that are we use when we go out and shop at our local retail establishment\nExcellence versus butter food and so what I'd like to do is recap those really quick and first of all if you get the opportunity makes you shop at the fridge makes you check those dating shows in when in doubt she's cans over bottles 'cause it's better protection for your beer for the shock on ... oh yeah and uh I speak shot gunning hands you know you can checking in with\nSouthern star we talk about that but a shop seasonally\nAnd uh yeah reaching the sale been at your own discretion but make sure you know

Dallas street there weren't to go to under the radar brewery at Fifteen ... street and then finally will go to apply to post brewing on Nineteen oh to Washington avenue and then and back at St Arnold's it's about fourteen point seven miles and it's all on protected trails and bike routes\nAnd uh that's that's what's going on it doesn't cost anything but I Do want you to RSVP so tax me at

you know the weather should be beautiful finally I Want to talk to you about a a couple of pod cast the first one is\nFrom voice coach is a place where I got my vocal training um um voice acting and I got me started in all of this radio stuff\nOr they or I'm going to be a guest on their podcast and are going to be recording that on the ninth of November I don't know when it's going to air when it's going to go up on line and then the other thing is um I Am\nNow about\nThirty three or three four episodes in on recovery radio\nAnd um I Am going to be condensing uh that you know cutting out the ads and so forth and condensing it down to a thirty minute\nPod cast of my own so watch for that coming out recovery radio a podcast I'm just basically going to go through and start off with my favorite episodes is my favorite guests and go from there and speaking of favorite guests and favorite episodes\nThis week I'm going to replay a a an interview I did with Jim preteen\nWho is the executive director for the crossroads center at park place\nWhich is listed as a homeless daycare center they do so much more than that on Tuesdays and Thursdays they come in people and give dignity to basic dignity to human beings to the folks in the homeless community and are also providing a pipeline\nTo get them out of poverty out of the street and into unemployment situation there starting and building up a commercial laundry\nWhere we are right now is they're getting ready to make the next step so we're going to be moving out of the current location where they are now and they're looking for a new location to do that and um they're looking for about three million dollars of a grant money or finance to\nTo go ahead and take this step next step so I thought it was great it's a great ministry uh gyms are great man and I'm working very hard to see if I can secure him help them secure funding\nTo make this thing into something much bigger than it is\nThe idea here is that we can provide a vibrant and growing pipeline to get people off the street and into work\nAnd one of the things you get to know when you talk to the people who are running the commercial laundry for a crossroads center park place these are formerly homeless people and you think about it\nYou know I Can't rent an apartment a unified money put together I have kept put rent an apartment I Can't get a driver's license I Can't get a passport I Can't get a credit card I Can't get anything if I don't have an address I Can't get an address unless I have a job and so the lady who runs the commercial laundry now has an apartment\nAnd it took her to pay stubs once you've got to pay stubs from the crossword center park place she was able to go to our apartment complex and rent\nA good apartment so we get back to the gym for king and the crossroads center [noise]\nIf you're in the market for flooring whether it's Harvey related or not I've got a guy you need to meet Mike ... flooring America

which is the opposite just breaking breaking just saw one thing and a gym is the executive director of the crossroads at park place\nAnd we'll get into a lot more detail about what that is um and ah but at a centrally they provide services to the homeless here in Houston and down on the a\nLittle bit on the south side of town down your hobby airport so I'm so Jim hum tell me about a lot you you've been in Houston\nYour entire life I have so you're one of those native ...\nAnd I was born in St Joe hospitals or the one wow and the parents my dad worked and they all feel out in ... right and so I was raised for a short time in ... and my dad got a job at St Clair okay and I was raised in Pasadena okay\nAll right so prima fulltime as you know I thought you know my dad my dad was in the air force and we moved around quite a bit and depending on what oil company you ended up with you know like I had some buddies of mine that\nHad their whole careers or at Exxon Mobil may move them around all over the place they moved around more than a military families but you you do stay put I guess for a while I did during my child okay yeah\nI'm\nWent off to school to Baylor thought I could play basketball wouldn't quite good enough ended up going to Lamar okay All right now to ...\nA ... a level of my life and we got married and Exxon offered me more money and I thought I could ever make\nWell okay yeah so you work with Exxon did for Thirty years OK okay retired was average tenure actually I met with a I'm I met with a guy in a previous\nLife who is uh the VP of human resources a\nAnd his entire job was to manage the careers of executives I knew there was a company and uh so I had actually met Rex Tillerson a couple of times um and he said oh yeah ... you know he started off you know as an engineer wherever that was Thirty years ago and ... which\nFall that's right and then he uh he worked in a you know basically\nIt was very interesting because I I had done a study at that point in time you know I was I was a pretty high up in the company I was in and the idea was you know I really need an executive development program that would really be need for me but the company I was in it was kind of small and and and I was taught I met him and he said oh well yeah we\nYou know it's it's kind of like you said Steve it's kinda like managing a baseball team you know it was like the minor leagues major leagues you always have and you know and and your executives or the pitchers and if the pictures you know throws his arm out or something bad happens you know you need to have somebody in in reserve and so you know\nRex we had him going all the way along and he you know but you know just in case you know there's always somebody out in the wings as well and it was a fulltime job for him he worked for nearly three years at at uc San and that's what he did and I was like well that's really an interesting job so\nI'm so you are so how was your experience with Exxon than what you know what to do with um\nI started out at a paint company okay Exxon had a small paint operation a up off of uh the ship channel here in Houston and we made paying for the how they ask a pipeline oh how 'bout that okay and tankers non at that time was the largest fleet outside the U.S navy\nAnd Jim McHale who's one of the founders of cross roads and you as a friend who you're yeah uh he was the one that said we should call these folks client ... that's who they are we're here to serve them\nAnd you know the thing is that you go and so what what I what I got an opportunity to do\nWas uh one of the many things that you guys providers that um you collect clothes and and if people need clothes you know they basically get a list of of the things that they need and then I got to help fill the orders you know and that the two things that really stood out with me was number one\nYou give a choice so you don't just say okay I Need some shorts and here's some shorts it's like oh no I'm gonna give you a whole stack of shorts and because you know uh the folks that you know are homeless or you know they don't have very many choices in their day kind of they don't have any choices and so part of becoming\nHuman again part of getting that sense of decency back and self worth is okay here's a whole stack of shorts and you know\nI it was unexpected to me the amount of joy I got out of helping guys pick out okay what do you think well I Want him I wanted to be kind of long you know I don't want to really short those ski in a kind of short and I said well you'll hear these are like cargo shorts I got pockets and stuff that was a kind of nice all let's put that to the side and I really enjoyed that a lot more than I thought I Would you know and and\nYou know the other thing that impacted me to was just\nSitting down and talking with people uh and just getting getting their stories and uh it resonates with you know one of the things that happened at St john's after Hurricane Harvey is the number one\nRequest out of the people who have been affected by the storm was I just want to tell my story to somebody right and get out of my head and so I think that's a tremendous thing you offer so so you you handout close what what other services you provide\nI Would I think in our DNA are there are two things it goes back to the beginning of crossroads in two thousand one we were told the founders were told 'em I don't have a place to wash my body mhm and I don't have a place to wash my clothes\nAnd so we provide those two basic services and as far as I'm concerned as low as cultural does open we will provide laundry shirt rush right and and our ...\nAnd then on top of that we serve two meals on Tuesday about hot breakfast lunch and then on Thursday the same thing okay and then clothes shoes socks or underwear et cetera\nWe also provide hygiene kits\nSo have you think about somebody is on the street\nUm what did they take a bath ... right yeah [laughter] so we get on the small bar so we give them which is based toothbrush down home the older whatever it takes a while\nSo that they can have something during the week to help maintain some level of Clinton as\nWe also provide haircuts okay yeah one of the great manager race is a Vietnamese a barber school that comes in most Tuesdays and they this is a great place for their students to learn how to give her oh sure yeah right [noise]\nAnd then we have a two gentlemen Charles stuff and I'm currently is Jones they come in and professional bombers ... it got hairs on Thursday okay yeah he'll cut probably twenty twenty five heads during the morning\nSo that's a that's a kind of leads the next question so how many people do you see on a typical day Thursday\nQuestion well less last Tuesday the day you were there right now we sat down a hundred and Seventy two people okay wow and we have signed in as many as two hundred and twenty ... and his view as a hundred and thirty\nAnd soda that the most of these folks live I mean are they local or I mean where do they come in from\nGreg question we the city of Houston came out there that point in time survey ... um for folks that don't know that just means that you took a specific day and interviewed a bunch of people and got the statistics for them yeah and that one point in time survey said that\nSixty percent of the people it was over a hundred ... solar sixty people that were were surveyed that day\nOr homeless wow yeah OK and\nForty percent have a place to live I thought that the numbers are around around that was\nWhat was even more important was most of those folks live in or around close to call for OK yeah many people travel more and\nYeah so I mean yeah well they wouldn't have the ability to travel\nYou know they're only mode of transportation is walk has to walk out or bicycle ...\nYeah and you do you do you do you also give out um yeah I heard that you gave out bus passes\nTo do the number of those that well it\nThat people need to get someplace\nYes and unfortunately as we as a non profit or we run this operation on about three hundred thousand dollars a year budget ... and we were spending about two thousand dollars a month on a bus passes while we had to\nCut that back yeah so today we get a bus passes for medical need only okay now that there are many other needs after\nOh yeah absolutely [noise] so um two days a week and then it starts up one is a start up in the morning and start stuff\nLike that where we open the doors at six because that's when I cook show yeah within the cruise starts preparing breakfast and getting ready for the day ah we had been told that people start lining up to come in as early as two or three o'clock in the morning\nOkay yeah 'cause when you get here they're they're waiting\nFor some panic so we we open the door\nAnd we don't make them stand in line outside we say come in sit down get a cup of coffee aroma acts and then there's a process that we asked them go through to sign into a computer system so that we can generate that list that you are\nRight when you were just too close bookmark in that point we're gonna come back and continue this conversation so stay with us [noise]\n\nThis is Steve going to host of recovery radio Bob is a toll is the only financial advisor I enthusiast deeply indoors Bob owner of
