ingredients in a hundred percent friendly to dogs and has a health benefits who knew\nI'm sitting here and I'm just kind of blown away by this whole thing why sniffing al\n... yet it yet but that's another one of my favorite actually since like five bucks a can I don't know man I don't know if I Want to be buying my\nDog a five dollar beer I think I'd rather just have one for myself or buy one

the hallways like this train is coming off the\nTrack I Do like to do I do like the name of the beers and they sell for five dollars you can yeah yeah they are not meant to place a full meal so if you're thinking like a\nA I don't have any dog food for you just drink up soccer and [laughter] you get some dogs have you got a barley sandwich\n[laughter] did you did that [laughter] oh I Am doing a thing\nSally Adams from Cape your age we're sending me that story thank you and to our sponsors that keep us on the radio each and every Sunday are sponsors buffalo vibe recover the eighth wonder Marino able brewery ... divider foods others are brewing cast brainy a sponsors our podcasts are ... are they a thank you again for keeping us fed\nAnd our bellies full and I think you to you wonderful listeners that always tune in each and every Sunday please go out and share the gospel what's on tap radio let's build this community together and please drink these products that we discussed [laughter] too if we do it\nAll right we've got to get outta here uh the show for Mr chat there'll be ... next to listening what's on tap Radiohead a fantastic we will be back in the radio airwaves next week\n\n[noise] nah\n\n\nAnd also this week we're going to have a Chanel Dixon who has written a book called the healing side of hurt and a fantastic interviewing and I hope you'll uh you'll tune in to stay tuned for that she is a fascinating woman and someone who has been through a lot in her life and his turn that into something that can help all of us which is exactly the\nThe idea of recovery radio and while I'm Talking about recovery radio also wanted to go into this to a if you listen to listen to the show at all you know we talk a lot about recovery from Hurricane Harvey it's kind of a common\nTrauma that all of us have faced and it gives a good starting point for what we talk about on the show and that is how do you recover from trauma how did you recover from Hurricane Harvey what was your experience with Hurricane Harvey how did you recover from that\nAnd I'm mainly how did you recover emotionally and mentally from that and uh sharing tricks and tips of what worked for you with the rest of us here in Houston to help us all feel faster from this kind of trauma in any trauma in our life\nUm but one people see especially when they see what we're doing this with this bicycle ride with the roost like were riding your breweries\nOr with a a show called recovery radio every time you hear the word recovery now and I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing every time you hear the word recovery you think Alcoholics Anonymous you think twelve step program in our products them is that type of thing and certainly a component of recovery on recovery radio\nAre the wonderful twelve step for programs in the tradition of Alcoholics Anonymous\nWhich has been with us a fantastic program works which has brought thousands and thousands of men and women out of the clutches of alcoholism since the twenties\nAnd is provide the baseline for twelve step programs in all sorts of other areas\nBecause if you know you're an addict or or you've been through one of these programs you know that\nAlcohol is not the only thing that we can become addicted to and uh I Am a I'm an addict and I am in recovery and so I use twelve step program myself every single day\nAnd it has a strong influence on what I say and what I Do a here on recovery radio as well but uh alcohol was not the thing that I I Am addicted to so it's a it's you know you can be an addict and not be addicted to alcohol or narcotics or lots of other things out there you can be addicted to\nOvereating can be addicted to food you can be addicted to gambling you can be addicted to work there is a workaholic Saddam and are they falls will step program\nAnd so the main ... he of this show is the idea of how do we bring together recovery in the sense of recovering from trauma from people who are not\nIn addiction and also with people who are and so from you know take from the twelve step program take from other areas of fought like was you know addiction will coming up the human side of her her approach to addressing it uh we had um ... who's the head of the living ... center down at St john's Episcopal Church in la Porte\nAnd talked about another way of dealing with trauma and dealing with improving our lives that type of thing and you know I'll always remember one of my friends in a recovery ... recovery and ah she happened to be an alcoholic\nAnd uh she was ... and so she was a very strong um\nAdvocate for me are very very affirming person when I was early in my recovery and one of the things that she said to me will always stick with me and that is you know Steve I feel sorry for those people who are art addicts and art and a twelve step program because they don't have a\nMethod they don't have a way of dealing with trauma dealing with making themselves better and handling the things that are causing them trauma their life they may not even realize that they're in a toxic relationship or orange trauma and so you know we're so lucky to be in the program and to be an addict\nAnd man that really stuck with me so the point of recovery radio is to bring\nAll the tools recovery to everybody so you don't have to be an addict to enjoy the tools of recovery so in other words we're all on a journey\nThe jury from where we were where we're going and we all have a need to get better one of the things I Do is I'd bury my feelings and we'll talk a lot more\nAbout that is you know when we get that [noise]\nIf you're in the market for flooring whether it's Harvey related or not I've got a guy you need to make my current at foreign America down

sixty\nAnd learn all about metro and an all about what the union does and what the union did around Hurricane Harvey ah Chanel works of what would you say like you you run the place actually like the obviously the straight\nMan be executive assistant for the union office ... sixty okay\nAnd what we found out at lunch afterwards is that you are also an author and you wrote a book\nWhich is called the healing ... yes and it released in a July ... July ... it's okay cool so um so give me a background are you a native ... native he's down okay so whereabouts you know raised in what part of the city\nI was raised on that you know I ... okay and got a lot in between lark happy and said well yeah\nThat's ... that's\nOkay and I'm so his family's still hear your family and stuff is also or\nYes I have my brother that's here my mom recently passed okay so it's my brother and I have kids and my uncle and okay and kids how old are your kids actually to day activities seventeenth as my oldest child and they're on a yeah she's Eighteen\nToday wow for you ... you have your own child you know and I don't know I found that difficult my my two kids uh well my daughter just turned Nineteen and my son will be twenty two here in February\n... his me I'll have to cut that out\nUh and uh\nThe hardest part about raising kids so far they were good all the way up until when they became adults are still good gas are still good kids but the hard part is me letting go and not wearing in an advise and doing it happening so what's your experience with that done\nWell she just turned Eighteen but as you know they start developing and they start doing their own thing right then you know you kind of had to take a backseat and whereas you want to just go in and ... and just don't do this don't do that and don't they they want to develop their own thing without being tells\nThat oh yeah you don't want my mom said I asked my mom you know what was the hardest part about raising me\nAnd she said the hardest part is seeing that you're going into something as a young adult that you know was going to be a failure you know like um I saw an ad in the newspaper about selling you don't have to you don't have to\nGet out of my street ...\nOkay yeah well it's pretty common law to people so that but you had you had drinking water you had yes you know the power to you know very black\nAnd I'm you know I was sitting up there in Austin watching the watching the NOAA ... a radar and seeing you know the the the biggest number on the scale and the color was white was twenty five inches\nAnd I kept thinking that we're going to reset that at some point because he got up like what fifty four inches in a week just amazing amount of rain and so um how long did it take for the water receded for you\nEven after that we that why still really didn't receive you know like the seven day you still have to drive slow so that you know you don't damage your vehicle\nOn that was one of the amazing stories that you know Horace and for the only guys related a couple of weeks ago was the idea that you know metro got back up and running within three days of the storm passing through and um\nThey were running buses through high water because sometimes that was the only vehicle to get through there so you know he said at one point we were delivering first responders or they need to be it's like wow that's pretty cool so that's neat to be part of that um so uh so how long memories around the house for like a week or yeah yeah the whole week wow\nAnd how the rest of your neighborhood fair than that you know once the water's went away to were were their folks flooded in your neighborhood or\nA street where it's ... ... yeah so the fact some of the first floor did get smaller and yeah\nAnd what we learned through Harvey and learns roller hurricanes have come through Houston is that there's no such thing as you know a little water it's like you know if there's an inch of water there's you know two feet of water it still does that maximum amount of damage you know the water gets into the drywall just gets pulled right up\nSo [noise] so I'm now you have this book that was released and you you actually said you were were you writing it where you're writing before Hurricane Harvey started that way okay and uh how did that change that did it change the direction of the book\nOr change things that are actually not that the during Harvey because\nI was already writing about releasing you know healing and yeah do you have to relive what you are writing about ... and in that week I had some substantial time\nSo you had like ... to relax ... just flow and sell in that time I began to see how grateful outlet and I wasn't coming from a negative connotation yeah lay everything in our family so much great and that was so grateful to not be felt much affected by ...\nWhen you get better at at recovering from trauma or or getting past the hurting getting to the healing when you get better or doing that every time or hurt comes it's a little bit better after\nA little bit better in Russia just at the forefront of higher end or you don't have that negative side of the become liberating free inhaling\n'cause that's you know the the reason that the show exist recovery radio exist as that and hurricane Ike and two thousand eight my house was flooded\nAnd it took us about a year to get the house back in shape or we can move back in but it took almost two years for me to get past the emotional impact I Would still\nNot be able to sleep and have all this anxiety and all this type of thing and then went Hurricane Harvey came through course I didn't flood this time so there is not a lot of temporal damage there but um I recognize the trauma I recognize that hurt\nAnd I was able to get through it much faster like in a week or two and I said what happened what's different about me\nBetween two thousand eight and and uh and Harvey and what had happened and there was a there was a divorce and there was lots and lots of counseling and lots of therapy and um I uncovered that one of the\nNegative characteristics about myself\nBefore I went through all this was and you know worked on myself so much was that um I was never allowed to really be upset when I was a kid I could never be angry at two younger sisters have to have sisters\nAnd there was like you know you got to protect them and you can't be angry with them because they're they're they're girls and their weaker than you and your stronger and it's like oh okay so um what I had a tendency to do and this is what hurt me and the response from hurricane Ike is that\nI Would you know take my hurt bury it and then pretend it didn't affect me ride and say oh I'm I'm good I'm good\nAnd what I was able to do in Harvey then was to say I feel guilty that I wasn't flooded you know there's that and the survivor's guilt and I feel helpless and I feel and I was able to identify all those feelings and kind of sit on them\nAnd let the healing happen because what I found out is is that you know you can ignore you're hurt\nBut it doesn't make that doesn't make her go away and it still toxic and they're kind of eating away at you know so um you know this whole experience has helped me come on berry that so uh you know and it just sounds a lot like\nA you know what you kind of coming for as far as feeling in the book so um so you you got a lot of time to work on the book while you're while you're there right and a while you were stranded\nUm and so\nAre you know the next question would be is that you know that mindset about healing does that help you\nAbsolutely are health right out of the nation by the way my main focal point for even writing this book about healing and let him keep them now and trying to introduce them to the healing fat effort is to get them to come to a place of awareness okay that there is an underlying issue absolutely All right well\nWe're gonna come back and keep on keep on pushing on that\nSo
