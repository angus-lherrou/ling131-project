back story so what's your back story how did you end up in Houston how did you end up seeing I mean gimme gimme gimme or history\nOr started I'm In Austin, Texas in church OK I'm Wondering ... singing in church singing in church my mother's song my brother play the piano I needed a preacher okay and so I kinda grew up listening to them and kind of attack kind of created my whole\nStrong affluence done from gospel music and yeah most definitely yeah\nI got a scholarship here in Houston, Texas southern university from there and the rest is history [laughter]\nSo you used us oh are you what's your degree and then it ... it was a music degree in\nMusic or music performance or with the emphasis in that jazz musical theater wow okay great yes there\nAnd so then you had that degree and you went out and they just you just got all these things and so what what led you to in twenty Thirteen\nYou were finals for American Idol so tell me about that experience about you know auditioning\nAnd and bringing in and okay how did how did you you know get\nWell actually what I'm particularly interested in is how did you get the the internal you know\nEnthusiasm and the confidence to be able to do that because you know I Know a lot of people say oh you know I've got a great voice and I can sing but I Would never do that I Would never audition for American Idol you know we got wind right yeah yeah oh I Know well I mean so how do you how ... how do you get that mental attitude to be tough like that\nUm what I guess it American Idol I I Believe puts people in the ... is it is a great opportunity for artist yeah All right independent independent artists or whatever so I'm from college I wanted to do something that they can kind of deal my brain and take me\nTo another level and I felt like those shows will a couple of agents in LA Toby ... those are the shows that actual gate will actually get you that contract our debt opportunity that you are looking for [noise] so\nDid you did you audition before you actually got picked for the show to do your unsuccessfully or did you first time you auditioned you got in\nAn audition for the show like six staff six times throughout my whole I guess he's in college experience\nGoing OK graduated um two thousand eleven okay I\nMade ... tax cutting rooms and the producers told me to come back next when I made a growing number fourteen\nBut it took six try it on the sixth attempt this when you when you made it in right now okay so that's one of the one of the lessons from you and is it just got to be persistent and you know and not not let the nose bring you down right\nThere's nothing you can do right nothing you can do and so it's kind of like eventually had to say you know what\nI don't need to know how many inches of rain have been following you know um what I was doing on Facebook as I I took the\nThe no a weather radio they add to the un or not the weather radio but there are no aside had the radar and uh it showed rain accumulation is in the top end of the scale\nWas twenty five inches was represented by white black and just watching the entire Gulf Coast term white and I kept on thinking well you know going to go in there and reset it so that you know we get closer to the fifty four inches that we actually had but they didn't and it was like you know\nI fly finally sent out on a camera what day of the week it was after is up there in Austin I said yeah I'm going to stop doing this now because it's just it's just depressing and I have no idea\nYou know the uh I I Lived in a house down in la Porte at that point in time and we never lost power because I could turn on my ring the doorbell you know what I could look through the little camera in the rain doorbell and all the way I can see that there is a light on across the street I can see that there's\nThere's some water in the street but you know it was like looking through a periscope I guess right and then my neighbors also stage so you know I got good reports on that so it was a\nIt was a good thing but that was really the justice of the show was that\nUm I was able to get past that whole idea of I'm going through that trauma and processing it a lot better now than I did and I when my house got flooded back and hike so um that's what really brought the show so family was okay 'cause everybody's out of out of town up in San Antonio and\nAustin yeah if it was it a\nHow's your neighborhood I mean did the other people get flooded or\nNot well not him I stay in a rural area so a guy in a\nHighrise so and that didn't happen with my a complex where I met a hit and everything else um I think us when I was scared about our ally ... isn't that far out into no or\nAll of that old it was definitely fall from the pictures that you saw where where everything was just completely underwater and ah and yeah so I'm like that's just not far does not very far from here and well\nThat's the thing that the reason I asked about the neighborhood and stuff is because\nOne of the surprising things about a hurricane to me is that you know you'd say OK storm surge rain it's going to flood these neighborhoods and you can kind of protect words where it's happening but\nPretty much everybody I've talked to um has said well you know I was okay but you know there was a ... couple of houses down her it was really random it's more like I'm a tornado strike or something it's like it it doesn't really um\nIt doesn't just say okay this one ... across the line or British flooded and then ... this line or not it was Mitt Cynthia wasn't bits and pieces of ...\nA lot of people in my church as a you know price team members and stuff uh like houses or pretty much gone and one lady had to get our whole house every parish and everything ... chicken that a year yeah well and it goes on\nAnd that's one of the reasons I I Do recovery radio when we focus on Harvey is because\nI'm just takes years to get past\nFrom a physical standpoint it gets your ears to get past from a from a trauma standpoint as well and you know it flips both ways you know for for us where we really didn't get physically affected at all [noise] we have that kind of guilt that fear of a well there's nothing I can do and then when you get back you know what can I Do and I want to be doing some things out there I\nI Hope to you know look out homes and and you know a health collect stuff that we brought to the drug or a brown ... mentioned center one of the one of the um images always be certain in my mind as my uh the pass through my church\nUh she sent out a note on Facebook and said okay nobody needs to donate close anymore because she had a picture took a selfie in front of the whole you know in the hall where they had the clothes and it was stacked from floor to ceiling and George or brown oh yeah we're close and was like okay we don't need any more close now we need diapers and now we need you know this ride you know feminine products we need this\nAnd um you know the thing that I always been\nYou know what I harp on constantly on the show is this idea of community you know and whether that's a faith community whether it's your church whether it's your civic community you know it's you know like voting which I I was very important that people vote in the midterms\nUm that being plugged into the community is really how we process that and it's really when Houston shines brightest Iraq is that you know these disasters come through and we all come together\nAnd you know you do hear the odd story about oh well somebody was going around you know saying how the water's coming get out and then to looting the houses after people left manager that once you know in the city of five million people that type of thing\nSo I feel like he's doing really stepped up and they did they did really good at is why I Love that phrase he's strongest in strong I really believe that brought us together and then we got to a World Series championship right as a as a actually there you go at you know that as a way of turning things around\nAnd you know we are a big community you know as one of these things in it and it really does have that small town feeling with four million people there you know I can walk down the street and the people you know make eye contact and say Hi you know where else can you do that right set it up to like All right we get back on TALK a bit more [noise]\nThis is Steve going to host a recovery radio up as a toll is the only financial advisor I Am Suzie awesomely endorsed Bob owner bay

after Harvey rolled through the guy that you're going to do that I'm\nIn his within that September October ... while so quick and\nIt was one of the other you know when I Know you know sugar joy goes well I'm One of the things that popped up on Facebook shortly after Harvey is that she went down to the George or brown convention center and did free concerts\nFor the people there and dance parties where the kids and stuff I was really really nice and and you know that was when I was first starting the idea of the show and I said you know I really need to have around as a guest and certainly
