eliminate the fees and throw away the worry knowing your retirement money is safe and growing call eight six six three four six seven to three three\nWe have talked before about how the real risk of exposure to the markets is not discussed in the media or by brokerage houses we use safe money programs based on specialized plans that can provide first year returns of up to Thirteen percent\nWhile locking in your yearly gains and also know fees are loads taken from your deposit\nThis message is different from what you normally hear on financial planning shows largely because our concepts are different most brokers base their financial planning on something called modern portfolio theory this theory basically divides up your money and puts it into different investment categories another word for this is diversification\nThe process of diversification is supposed to minimize your losses if the market drops one thing that has rarely talked about is that it also limits you again when the market goes up\nWe have a better idea what if you could participate in some of the market gains without participating in any market losses our emphasis is on preservation of your principal participation in some of the market gains and lifetime income that you cannot outlive\nWe help set you up in a retirement that you can be sure of\nMarkets always retests new lows but when the market's

an income account that compounds that up to eight percent interest for up to Twenty years this account can be used a guarantee we'll never outlive your retirement money\nYou see when you suffer a loss in the market even a small loss you have three problems the lost value is just the first problem the second problem is the time it takes to make back that loss but the third problem is is it is almost impossible for you to regain their losses let me explain\nIf you have a market exposed account of one hundred thousand dollars in the markets dropped by thirty percent your account has dropped to Seventy thousand very painful Ryan but that's just the beginning imagine the markets go back up the next year by the same thirty percent\nAre you back to your original hundred thousand dollars no you're not\nWhy is that after dropping thirty percent the account is at Seventy thousand so the next thirty percent gain is on Seventy thousand not a hundred thousand thirty percent of Seventy thousand is Twenty one thousand and Twenty one thousand added to the Seventy thousand is Ninety One thousand\nIt would take a forty three percent gain after the thirty percent loss just to get back to where you were starting\nWhich was a hundred thousand\nThat is why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my listeners is windows negative thirty plus forty three equals zero the answer is when you lose thirty percent of the market it takes forty three percent gain just to get back to zero\nHere's another question when does negative thirty equals zero the answer to that is when you were a client of mind in a safe money account\nThat's because my clients have no possibility of market losses ever so you never have to worry about trying to regain losses also upfront bonuses and a guaranteed lifetime income account that his contractually guaranteed to grow up to eight percent compounded per year for income purposes\nIf any of this is confusing I'll be happy to
