{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Shore and part of the costs but obviously everybody knows that the cost of healthcare keeps going up\nAll ... did you talk to you come up with this blueprint for ha charges model left or something else\nWell there are other health care cooperatives out there but I'm just using this as a model I've done several\nThings in addition to just having the model the healthcare cooperative such as uh trying to um take get patients that really want to be healthy to try to\nPut physical fitness into the equation to get people to follow a healthy diet to exercise a\nReduced stress all those types of things to try to get the patience to do their part and then we want to try to also lower health care costs by negotiating prices for cash prices right we can do pretty well it's lowering prices by doing that\nSo many patients in the group so far\nWill uh about fifty patients so\nFell guy and and how long is the Houston health care initiative been up and running well just a couple of months all okay wow okay and do the do the patients get to choose their doctors in hospitals that go to of course okay yeah it is kind of it's still a self pay ultimately right\nYes in other words what we do is we negotiate prices for tests and procedures in laboratory data\nAnd we put it up on a website for the members to look at people can negotiate their own prices and if they get a good deal from a doctor or procedure but they know they got good service they can they can share it with the group so everybody can benefit\nYeah my wife and I actually tripped over an opportunity to sell papers to memorize years ago where the original agreement between the insurance company in us and the provider was it about twelve hundred dollars and the self pay was three hundred\nWell that's it yeah okay not to have a payment worked after ... doctors want to get paid right after that how how do you pay up if you're in the initiative\nWill we have two two features one is the trust account that that's where we share the expenses and trustworthy expensive costs\nAnd then we have a health savings accounts to pay for routine caution you get a debit card there and you can use that to pay right at the time the service and of course doctors appreciate that they get paid right away\nYou're in the whole thing is over with and you can get it much better price\nSo did the Houston health care initiative is essentially it's more of a a a negotiating body that's doing two things were number one encouraging patient health in fact almost requiring it really and then and then negotiating on on behalf of the patients for better writes about royal\nRead don't require okay a patience to be healthy but we do is we try to provide financial incentives for a while yeah it'd be healthy turn off him trying to coach patients and try to help patients to\nBecome healthy for instance let's say somebody is a smoker well the cost extra sure\nWe're gonna try by using that financial incentive to say okay if you quit you're going to get a much lower rate for your monthly payment into the trust one\nDoctor Steve ... with us on a fifty plus here so are are from Houston health care initiative so or when you go to doctors and say hey we want you to be part of our deal and they typically receptive to what you offer\nWell I don't know any doctor that doesn't take can\nPoint\nThat's a very good point but now let's let's back up and talk about how you sign up and what it entails to be become part of the initiative\nWill if you're interested to sign up uh you can call and make an appointment we had the free annual physical so you'll get blood work and we measured the routine insurance things like your height your weight your blood pressure and\nThings like that and try to identify any diseases that need to be a taking care of we also have a requirement that you can walk a mile in thirty minutes it's not a high bar\nNo but on the other hand you need to do that and if you can't do that I have one word for you and I just practice\nAs a very good point so you you get this this baseline physical when you come on board for for obvious reasons for the the initiatives that insurance as well as the patience and\nSo what what about pre existing conditions though that's not a problem okay\n... in other words if if let's say you have diabetes okay well that's fine but you need to follow the diet you need to take your medicine and you need to control your him a globe and they want to see their to do so you get the same price it everybody says if you don't recharge you extra\nAnd we can bring the whole family on board I present of course was good enough but what about cost at ... how how is how do we how much do we have to pay and how long does this last\nWell of course it's it's a complicated question to answer for for everything right uh but\nLet's say in the age of fifty to fifty five\nThat's the that's a good starting point for this audience let me tell you\nExactly uh the trust fund cost us a hundred and eighty dollars a month okay\nAnd they say is a hundred dollars a month at the age of say of course belongs to you and it's your money if you don't spend that you have it there the next year the hundred and eighty dollars isn't the trust fund and that belongs to the health care initiative and a sense but since this is member room and not for profit if\nThere's money left over the last one we have a subscriber savings account so that money goes into your account pro router\nAnd it builds up over time and so what we're hoping this going to happen is that builds up your premium the amount of money you have to put into the trust fund in the future will go down rather than up\n[noise] one of

history of investments\nPoint eight the beginning of the tech boom in Nineteen Ninety five\nPoint be the top of the tech boom and year two thousand and yet so many people bought or held on to stocks at point B expecting that stocks would continue to grow to point see\nHere's another example point a the start of the housing price bubble around Nineteen Ninety five point be the top of the housing

fictitious point see has been proven to be a delusional concept just like all delusions there is a clinical name for it\nIt is called the appeal to a probability the appeal to a probability is defined as the assumption that something will happen because it can happen\nCould have stocks continued to rise instead of crashing after the dot com bubble yes that's possible could have housing prices continue to rise after two thousand six once again that's possible the problem is many investors take what is possible and they start to believe it is probable or worse yet a certain fact\nAdding fuel to the fire and there are plenty of people that contribute to this appeal to probability just watched the financial news on cable when the market goes up you can literally feel the energy coming from the talking heads on your TV they're so excited and happy when the market goes up just a hundred points in a day\nIt doesn't really make any sense of what does one day have to do with anything how was
