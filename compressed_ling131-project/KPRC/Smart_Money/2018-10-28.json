{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Whatever I'll travel the whatever samples and and and I started with me and just getting involved at the patient thing\nYou know please study my case then I asked Dr burnish at that direct to I Want to help in any way possible because I'm so excited that there is a clinic that's purely dedicated to try and get a headache because\nI was in tears for years because there didn't seem to be any organization out there so it really started with how can I help and they said you want to join the board and I absolutely\nI you know we could we need to come together because there just isn't enough focus or a research on headaches\nAnd the headaches of yours Heidi or cluster headaches started two thousand six what what's the difference between them and migraine headaches\n[noise] you know I'm not a migraine ... that it is a you know the\nBroad strokes cluster headaches they can let 'em extreme amount of regularity very frequently and if it's a shorter intense pain I feel like for me it feels like a knife is Harvey your eyes\n\nTo it only last an hour or two but during that time you just\nUh it just feels like you're being pummeled whereas my ... I think it's a different kind of misery where it might last hours and days and weeks then you just ... I Want to go into a dark room and and you know right\nAround where headaches it actually what I Want to do is kind of move around and thing my head against the wall and and trying to track myself\nThat's\nVery different sensation is very different remedy you know just self help you we'll uh and and let's establish\nRight now that migraines and plus your headaches are way different from a hangover or the one you get if you skip your morning coffee aren't they\nAbsolutely that is yeah it is a difference between something that you can still sort of function you don't know about or maybe you\nCan take an aspirin and take a nap and in a few hours later it'll be gone and you move on gun and you move on with your life whereas\nA cluster headaches and migraines and could build a penny headaches it truly does fraud you of your life you might still be breathing but\nYour life as you know it it it you you can't function you can hear a job you can't take care of yourself your family it drains your financial resources you're taking it you know a high level of medicine or is it really is the distinction and I think\nThat is unfortunately it's unfortunate that we don't have a better understanding of headaches because I Believe they are different conditions and different levels and because\nI'll get lumped in there are people like oh I had a headache yeah that sucks but it just it's hard to convey that there is truly a trend\nAnd when you're on at ten it's nothing like the one you know to me it's like saying oh we all have stomach aches when it might be your your liver your kidney your intestines your abdomen and so I think there's just an opportunity to understand\nAnd research and make a distinction between different conditions that we can properly diagnosed and and really find cures I write not really an underserved area of that it\nWas a good opportunity hardy Heidi bill joining us here this morning from the will Irwin headache research foundation for that will hurt or when headache research foundation I suppose a good opportunity for you to explain just what that is and how it came to be\nFelt in twenty ten or ... or when a a local cup and a couple of inches and they lost their son there twenty four year old son will to the cluster headaches that all the poor kid right all of his life only known where these\nOff off with drug for him with migraines and it devolved cluster headaches and at the age of twenty four he just said I Can't do this anymore and he he lost hope he took his own life\nAnd I understand that decision because when I Am a hundred days into my cycles I often go to bed thinking I it would be okay if I didn't wake up I don't want to live like this way when I'm not in my cycle like beautiful but it it's awful\nAnd ... and Jimmy day um I my hero because they took that grief and their pain\nAnd channel that towards establishing the foundation which is founded in twenty fourteen uh and they said we are going to cure the cutting had a headache so they hired on an Internet neurologist and partner with lots of other medical experts in the area\nAnd so far they've raised ... million dollars but um and that's a great start but there's so much road yet to cut her and her and\nSo if we can come together and support this clinic because again you know when when I first got diagnosed in two thousand six I remember asking my neurologist you know what is the future like and where can I go get for treatment he said I'm Sorry I did because this is I'm just not well served area there really isn't\nMuch progress and so that's why this clinic is so special because it is going to focus on headaches\nOnly just right into the next thing on my list is how important it is for people whose headaches are persistent and harsh of beer that they deal with a headache specialist and not just a neurologist right\nAbsolutely 'cause I wasted a year going to lots of different projects and they would tell you of a migraine and you know and ... when\nFinally when I found the right headaches that's what it said you have cluster headaches and these are the medicines\nYou can take at least aboard the pain you can't get them from come coming so yes the headache specialists if you have it and know that you're not alone there's so many of us out there\nOn and there's an opportunity to support each other and band together to find a cure and if you don't currently set for the surprise you probably have a covert girls love one friend who just doesn't talk about it because they don't want to\nBurden you but um it really is an opportunity for all\nYou know since my wife had started getting these headaches like this I've had to explain that to a couple of people in\nAnd help them understand kind of what she's going through and I every time I turn around I run into somebody else's oh gosh yeah I've had migraines for years I've had severe headaches I I don't know that I've ever heard anybody use the term cluster headaches\nBut they talk about the same levels of pain and you'd never know they're out there kind of been the world she's had a really hard time even functioning ... just getting out of the house for two and a half years is getting better but I Know exactly what you're talking about in this gives us an opportunity to to talk about how it a family to\nAbsolutely because yeah you you can imagine number one you are not there for them you know thank goodness I you know I'm I'm older and I don't have a lot of responsibilities as far as family responsibilities but\nMany people do and you're not there for them number one but number two even if they want to be there for you it's just it's helpless feeling because you're just in pain and really\nYou know only a high dose of medicine that have lots of side effects may or may not help and so yeah your to your shadow of yourself not to mention your doctor's appointments all the time that trains or financial resources and it's just yet to athletes it's more than just the person is that it's all those around people around you that care about\nMy wife had trouble with it because we're we're trying to ... I'm I'm older and we got an a late starter parenting but we've done eleven year old son at the house\nAnd for the last two and a half years it's been hard for her to do all the things she wants to do

your broker is telling you to do he's not saying it in those words but nevertheless is telling you to wait for the next hand he's telling you to wait for the elevator to start dropping why is that if
