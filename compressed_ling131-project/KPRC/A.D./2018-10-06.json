community of like minded individuals people that have the same hopes fears dreams and ideals as I have and I know that together we can make this a better place to live [noise]\nOne of God's own prototypes [noise] high powered some guy never even considered for mass production [noise] to where to live [noise]\nAnd along on the\n\nOn KNPR see\nUsed us more stimulating talk radio [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nOh I'm Nancy from that I'm speaking to you today from my home in California you announced it indoors they don't work for\nThe part of my car but yeah that should I Do I Swear in front of children in ride skateboard right you've got a Greek all over the well that's not all skateboard Greece set limits perspiration because I'm very sweaty well I guess I'd better call steam cleaning or you could go on line to steam dot com set a date out [noise]\nI don't buy things from telemarketers\nI don't switch credit cards to a low introductory rate is going to spike in a couple of months I don't want gimmicks games and if you're the same way try eagle energy simple fixed rights no gimmicks no surprises on your bill great customer service\nA man and Michigan has discovered there can be money in old rocks\nWhen Michigan resident David Missouri I bought a barn Thirty years ago it came with the media right at a story and the farmer who stole the barn that landing in the back yard and the Nineteen thirties\nAnd Missouri ended up using it as a door stop until earlier this year when he saw reports that piece of the media writes could sell for thousands of dollars he took his twenty three pound iron a nickel specimen his central Michigan university and learn it's the sixth largest meteorite found in the state\nUniversities and two pieces to this facility and museum for more testing\nThat's already estimated to be worth about a hundred thousand dollars with museums interested in buying it is Eric pledging to donate a portion of any potential proceed to the university\nThe suffering ... I'm ... this is Fox News [noise]\nNine fifty am Houston K. P. R. C. [noise] and then there's a very good chance that you heard the story because\nIt's the talk of the town everybody in Houston knows about this one and you know it's made some national news because it's pretty incredible but if you're not familiar with the robot brothel situation in Houston\n[laughter] let me let let's rewind a little bit but let's back up just discouraged because All right yeah and you could say that I'm playing for laughs 'cause robot bravo right off the bat sounds pretty freaking funny doesn't it [noise] but there's some really\nInteresting and serious ramifications to weigh that local government in Houston is treating this and look [noise]\nHouston one of the one of the people people one of the reasons people love to come to Texas in cities like Houston one of the reasons that Houston is growing and growing and growing and one of the reasons that uh there's jobs galore in Houston and one of the reasons that\nBusinesses go to Houston is that it's a great place to start a business there is a lotta tools given to an entrepreneur someone that wants to start a business someone wants to expand a business in Houston\nThere's some deregulation that makes it easier for the little guy or girl\nWith the big idea to watch their dreams come to fruition there are opportunities and like I said people embrace\nYour talent people embrace what you've got to offer and Houston if you've got a special talent and skill and ability to be creative any of the above\nWell then Houston is a good place to build that into something it really really is [noise] and like I said a lot of people come to use them because of the freedom you get to start a business to run a business\nEspecially a small business and entrepreneurial situation has a better chance of flourishing in a city like Houston then lost to other parts of America and lots of other parts of the world so\n[noise] the regulations that are well there you wouldn't really calm regulations but the local government attempting to control this robot bravo and their patients and their patrons\n[laughter] even though legally they cannot is a bit of a red flag to me it's a bit of\nA red flag to a lot of people in Houston and it's a bit of a red flag that the rest of the country should take note of [noise] and there's part of the story that to me is a very scary part of a very slippery slope will get into the details of the robot brothel and how much going on could be in front of your freedom next [noise]\nI fifty [noise]\n\nWe're the left in the middle [noise]\nOn the radio\nOn Twitter beef deep [laughter]\nEverything into any more money than I have friends so\nAll right you said a robot brothel and obviously all sorts of sensible questions come up if you are in Houston and you're listening on nine fifty am KP RC Houston's more stimulating talk radio then there was a very good chance you already know all about the robot brothel but for people listening in other parts of the country\nLet's let's back things up a little bit shall we this past month just gone by Toronto based company called kinky dolls announced plans to open a Houston branch\nNow just technically speaking is not a brothel because well these aren't prostitutes these are robots these are these are all this is a place where adult love dolls quote unquote constructed of synthetic skin\nAnd a highly articulated skeletons would be available now this is to\nYou by the way to rent and before you buy [laughter] [noise]\nI don't know why I don't know why\nIt's creepy to have well I'm first and foremost the idea of having relations with an adult loved all that to me is is creepy in and of itself I just can't did I pay not judging if it's for you it's for you and that's great and\nWhile I'm so glad that you are able to walk down a particular avenue of pleasure because I Am not it will always be close to me because I just don't think I could bring myself to do that\nBut the idea of doing that with another highly articulated loved all [laughter] to someone else's just on that with a couple of hours before you which is which is strange because I mean\n[noise] you assume for the most part and less you both saved yourself for marriage that anybody as an adult that you are going to get busy with is going to be someone that has done it with someone else before there's every reasonable expectation that that is the case\nBut for some reason [noise] getting busy with a loved on someone else's used before just seems entirely more\nOf a of an emu [laughter]\nSo that makes sense [laughter] I Can't imagine that this would be something people would be interested in but apparently they approve concept it works and they want to put one in Houston\n\nNow if you are in Houston you probably know exactly where they're says they're chosen storefront is at Richmond and too many rock\nAnd\nCity inspectors stop work on their chosen storefront because they said a renovation jobs had began there without the proper permits and place\nBut here's the bottom line [laughter] even though\nNo laws are being broken by this you know Texas and in particular Houston are places that celebrate freedom local government is just really trying to find any way shape or form they can to stop it from existing there\nAnd the mayor there a guy called ... Turner is pushing city council to prevent the business from opening at that location entirely like I said they've stopped working on a storefront\nSaying that a renovation jobs that'd be gone there before the proper permits were in place now traditional sexually oriented businesses like strip clubs have long been prevented from operating within Fifteen hundred feet of churches schools daycare is parks residential neighborhoods\nAll that sort of thing [noise] the city on ... is just a few hundred feet away from kinky dolls proposed storefront\nAnd the portion of the ordinance Turner wants to revise addresses adult arcade [laughter]\nWhere customers view adult content or using an arcade device you ever you ever been to one of these I guess it's sort of like a video tapes show thing on no again an avenue of pleasure that I've never walked down because you\nAnyways [noise]\nI'm not familiar with it but that's the deal a city or the Anderson part just a few hundred feet away from working ... wants to set up shop and like I said the portion of the ordinance that mayor Turner of Houston moss revise addresses these adult arcade were customers view content that his adult in nature using an arcade device\nNow the council wants to go ahead and amend the definition of arcade device to include not just machines displaying videos but also and I quote an through ... and throughout for more for devices or objects\nAnd they would prohibit entertainment with one or more persons using an arcade device on the premises this is basically going wait a second this is a robot brothel we can't have that oh legally they can what we got to change some laws quick smart before this is actually a thing\n[noise]\nEntertainment was one or more persons using an arcade device on the premises [laughter] would be a prohibited a spokesman for the mayor says because the proposed ordinance changes not aimed at any\nParticular location it was drafted without regard to kinky dolls [laughter]\nThat's what they're saying sure basically gives gives local government the right to shut down stuff that is legal at their discretion\nAnd this is where a lot of people are going I don't know about this I don't know about this because today it's sex robots tomorrow it's chick fillet or whatever the hell it is\nUse guy in radio and then\nThey do on the radio\nOn\n\nThe\nNational ... day and they go every day it's not a day on the list is making some fish tacos [laughter]\nLooking at ...\nBecause all of\nKorea indeed today I Hope I Hope you got free tacos cars today was national taco day yeah [noise]\nBut in a way is it every day but his national taco day [laughter] [noise] the good news is that a bunch of big Mexican food chains gave away free tacos today shepherd Taco Bell a nerve or some people\n[noise] are there taco day promotion is that they're selling gifts that's where you can pay five ... five dollars to buy for tacos for a friend I gotta get that but you know your name's Taco Bell you hang your hat on the talk shows everybody else's giving away the taco usually\nGive away the tacos advocate advocate I think anyway [noise] anyways [laughter] [noise]\nUh if you've been main lining free tacos all day here's some interesting stats and honor of national taco day apparently more than Ninety five percent of Americans say they like tacos\nSeventy one percent before prefer tacos over burritos\nWhat would you rather have a taco or burrito this to me is really an argument of portability because like a burrito ... as long as it's well raft uh if it's one of those that holds together\nThat's to me something that is meant to be non Iran or standing up for or what have you tacos\n... they're going to fall over the ... all over the place this is what I like to do\nI like to eat tacos and then I like to have a tortilla underneath by taco as I'm eating it because I Know I'm going to be dropping so much assorted taco meat and feeling that uh I'm going to have a burrito afterwards and just based on the things that I dropped out of my tacos You're welcome that's a pro tip\nOr from a fat kid [laughter] three quarters of a sea tacos at least once a month to often do you tacos\nA man trying to remember the last time I had tacos besides today national taco day I mean ... wherever you are where they're going to say no hell no I was not going to say no to ... this is not a thing that I Would ever do new [noise]\nI think the last time I had tacos before today was made tacos a little while ago oh man they were good\nI had a turkey meat lying around the house for I mean it was in the fridge or is it just lying around the house but I had turkey meat and I actually made turkey tacos so easy so simple so delicious awesome taco shell that some turkey mean losing a dinner was served and it was awesome by the way\nI just like turkey I'm not one of those people eat turkey because it's a healthy thing to do\n[noise] however I have noticed that really turkey to me is [noise] and you might disagree with is this is where we\nCould have a divergence of opinions with regard to a degree seen is that you appreciate and your tacos and you're talking to me but to me a turkey taco is really good because I guess turkey meat is a little naturally lower and fat\nSo\nWhen you eat a turkey taco I I'll eat a lot better beef obviously tastes like something turkey days like something but\nUltimately tacos tastes like taco they tie it tastes like taco seasoning so the type of ground meat that you've got going into your taco to me is a little bit of relevant and for that reason I appreciate the turkey because you put the taco seasoning it tastes like tacos it's delicious obviously but it's way less greasy which means it doesn't\nDrip onto your hand it doesn't ... doesn't soften the shell 'cause I I really enjoy the whole crunching is aspect of tacos I'll take a crunchy talk over soft taco any day just a personal taste thing\nAgain like the less greasy turkey turkey me but yeah pro tip\nNumber two is that when you're eating tacos\nTry turkey meat talk as if you haven't already because to me it helps with the structural integrity of the taco and gives you a better taco eating experience I Know I Know there's a lot of people to do me eating non ... tacos is something that officially qualifies me as being a bit of a cat a boundary and Phil is dying but I like it and I recommend you give it to go to ...\nThen again I'm acting like eating turkey meat tacos as this bold new idea I guess there's not that bold\nOf a new idea a way a lot of people have been doing it for very long time but it was a new idea to me when I tried it a little while ago for the first time ever since then it's been turkey all the way when I'm making tacos why because I appreciate the maintenance of the structural integrity of the crunchy taco shell\n[noise] the most popular taco meats are in order Carney Assad a barbecue chicken pork and trees or see turkey is not in there at all I think people are missing be missing the boat with the church taco\n... for for some reason sounds dirty or the least popular mean to put in your taco is language also known as ...\nYou ever had that a man wants whenever the could never again I mean look here's the thing I appreciate the [noise]\nThe more responsible approach to eating animal products that is represented by using every part of the animal like don't waste if you're going to end something else's life then\nDon't be wasteful of it so there are those people that say hey you know organ meat and things like type things of that nature\nIt's more responsible way to be a meat eater to use every last part of the animal you know it's kind of interesting you know it's interesting [noise] lot of people\nThis is a bit of it aside how do we get on this ... oh yeah I tried cow town once when I was a kid I was in France grew up in England\nAnd my family went to France for a little bit which by the way you can take the train over there it's not that big of a deal whenever I talk to people about having gone to like friends or Spain or Italy or something like that when I was a kid I was like oh fancy and like it's like\nIt's like if you live in New York and go on vacation in Florida that's what it's like but I tried cow tongue meat", "station": "KPRC", "city": "Houston"}
