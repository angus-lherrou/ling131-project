US dollar consumer confidence index basically that crypto currency is what you think it's worth and how many people are getting into it it's interesting that Goldman Sachs is now getting into a crypto currency that's going to be regulated by the U.S Federal Reserve\nAnd I'm ... and some people\nOr anything that might be an alternative to the dollar in case it hits hard times so cryptic currency is basically a digital\nA base\nWhat you think it's worth but the ... for example supposedly tied and be backed up all the wealth and course Venezuela still has lots of mineral diamond a gold wealth there that could back it up\nI'm so basically it is a\n... something that is not easily verified interest at the will of the market at that time we've seen huge swings going on with that point where people want is all Fifteen thousand and one month and just drops ten thousand next month\nThe global is would want there to be one world currency and it would be electronic currency correct well\nThat and that's one of the things that Iraq has been talking about fears they want strictly digital here in the U.S because and they can track all transactions and all taxes will be paid right and that's something that you as been rumbling about because they have a lot of cash hidden in\nMattresses throughout Europe a lot of wealth or that is not being a taxed as transactions occur and that also makes it easy to control but actually Iraq ironic thing is that\nA China has been talking to come up their own crypto currency but that would be controlled with the a cell phone network\nInformation network digital network as the one belt one road\nYeah but with the integrity of that I'll be any question if you put everything in to digital currency it could be taken away because of austerity measures it could be turning away because of a glitch or they could convict you without jury\nOf some sort of cyber crime and you could have to forfeit all your all your money the the these are fraught with\nA pitfalls\nThat would restrict liberty\nTruth and what's interesting about ... and the reason that really took office for people wanting to transactions that would be not in taxes and Iran has found a way using ... technology to track these people down and the mentally make them pay taxes\nAnd cesium and of course you know here's the thing is that digital currency is only as good and what happens to your storage device what happens to that it's like paper it's only as good as what what somebody is willing to give you at that moment for my own\nSo not not in the next five years or we're going to see an expansion if you're going to do it get in the early days I Know several people have made a small fortune ... one wave of the thing is is like any way if you don't want to ride it too long [noise]\nThere are people that are lost money in it Oh yes I mean I've seen people who basically were using their credit cards and got caught in the hype and then when I dropped it you know a thirty percent wiped out Mm Mm Mm [noise]\nUm\nThe status of Europe we discuss it at the onset of the program uh as far as\nTheir stability their economic stability a and you said that we're looking at a cultural change their\nUm a year ago you made a prediction that they had past the tipping point and they would not be able to return with the exception of Britain is your assessment still the same\nYes and we're already seeing that in Sweden and other places Netherlands is starting to have a backlash a little bit too late\nBut Italy a as a\nBeing for the most strong about it while at the same time they're probably the biggest financial threat to the\nUh All right uh tell us something to look for in the coming weeks of volatility coming but with all the will to deliver the there's opportunity a vulgar you know is warning that you know stocks were a mess that they are what is a voter Volcker is the former fed chairman from the ...\nYeah and uh those warning signs have been there were starting to see the emerging markets there were touted for\nThe last few years as a place to invest to ... a pull back a\nThere's a and to my understanding there's been unraveling the last three years there can be a correction or do something good uh there's\nGonna be a hard asset available of get into ... and uh probably diversify diversification will be approaching a do those three things\nThe spokes be the voice of reason and the sea of insanity if you see a wrong make it a right to get a chance to help a fellow human being just do it because we're all part of a crazy human turmoil experience together\nYou know it may not seem this way to you but the universe is unfolding exactly the way it should be\nI Know this ... because I find myself living in the community of like minded individuals people but at the same hopes fears dreams and ideals as I Am and I know that together we can make this a better place to live I Will see you moved shot chose Madonna and as we like to say about your bill ... which is\nOne of God's own prototypes [noise] high powered some guy never even considered for mass production [noise] to where to live [noise]\nAnd of all the [noise]\n\nOn KNPR see\nUsed more stimulating talk radio\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n... when you say hot what'd you mean I'm just going to go down the corner and sell some jury oh you're going to lose your shirt\n... you know what you gotta have a fix location\nIf you're on a corner for jewelry it better be the corner of West gray and Montrose or you messed up show ... has been on that corner for fifty one years no gimmick sales prices always lower\nBecause they're not paying mall rent that's right most stores do have to pay the rent and then they Jack up the prices on their jewelry to help get you to pay it no overhead from shows means they pass\nThe big savings on to you that your wife the diamond ring upgraded or a bracelet how about a little [noise]\nCame the RCs used and there aren't any article\nThe gallery furniture made it America's\nCasey RC going to the\nSearching for the senator ... Callahan Fox News manhunt do so under way for whomever mailed suspicious packages to CNN and several leading Democrats the FBI\nISIS suspicious packages were delivered the multiple locations in New York to Washington DC area in Florida each package is similar in a parents and contain potentially destructive devices\nSo that you are not consume too much of less it route your teeth your brain destroys your health you should just you know get on with life I don't find the political parties to be that different I don't find a political parties to really represent a useful\nSet of options for us I think it's important to be participatory in our democracy I think that America still as much as we've got numerous things that plague us in the year twenty Eighteen still is one of the best examples of democracy on the face of the planet\nGo to places where there is not freedom and you'll see super quick that\nWe're ... we're maybe not as bad off as we think we are go to places where you're not allowed free speech go to places where you can get thrown in jail for speaking ill of elected officials or royalty or no ability and\nThen compare and contrast with what's going on in America and twenty Eighteen plenty of which is concerning plenty of which is worrying plenty of which makes us angry\nAnd determined to do something all good things but let's promote recognize that America it's still a pretty privilege place to be\n[noise] but I knew there was something up like I said when I got called in Nazi sympathizer\nWhy why do you call them unhealthy sympathizer\nWell this is the weird part because I was a fan of Martin Luther king's again perhaps his words backing up and getting little context but\nLike I said I don't really fall down on on one side of political arguments or another I take each individual in each issue as it comes I think there's room for hypocrisy and corruption\nAnd democratic and Republican parties and I don't think that I Need to do any loyalists line which would prevent me from calling out\nI get angry I get upset that they're not doing their jobs when my taxes and your taxes pay their salaries I get angry I get upset that we have a system where we can't demand that they show up at our desk because we'd like to have a word with them about how they're doing the job that we pay them to do\nBut overall politicians are a whole bunch of Matt I care about you and me care about America\n[noise] but like I said I\nKnew things were taking a funny turn when I got accused of being a Nazi sympathizer for being a fan of the work of Martin Luther king\nWhat exactly happened [noise]\nThere was there was an antifa situation where a bunch of antifa types\nBeat the living ... not out of some Democrats [noise] I I Know I Know [laughter] so saying you just believe for a second and by the way this happened in Portland as well sustain your disbelief here for a second\nAnd know that a bunch of antifa types antifa being the anti fascist folks\n[noise] beat the living ... not out of a Bernie Sanders supporters left them bleeding and I think unconscious in the street because there was a there is some sort of\nProtest counter protests situation going on between the left in the right and a guy who is sort of\nLeft but not left enough or antifa I suppose was out in the street a Bernie booster someone who is further left than the traditional Democrat in that he was all about democratic socialism [noise]\nBut not far left enough for antifa\nSo during this protest situation we talked about it on the show a couple of months back when it happened [noise] he was holding as a symbol of hope an American flag he felt as though flag had been co opted by he felt as though the American flag and been co opted by hate groups and he was sort of taken aback by showing up waving an American flag\nAntifa type said give us that flag\nIt's a symbol of hate and it was like no it's not not to me it's a symbol of America I'm sort of taken aback and then they beat the living ... out of him that happen if I'm not very much mistaken in Portland which kind of sort of plays into our conversation about how Portland is becoming a bit of a cautionary tale bit of a lesson we can all learn from\n[noise] and I said gosh\nThat wasn't the right thing to do\n... beating this guy a violence is never the answer violence can be the answer we have to be enough where we have to be on our we have to be [noise] on enough of the same team here in America to where we are not beating the crap out of each other because a Bernie Sanders supporter won't give antifa types his flag\nAnd I think I was pretty vocal about how anti vote or thugs and the situation criminals they should be treated and prosecuted as such because they left demand bleeding in the street or radical far right now and uh\nI then said you know probably the person who's made the most easily quantifiable social change when it comes to the world of equality in modern history would have been Martin Luther king\nWhy can't we learn from the lessons of Martin Luther king who had a ... a staunch doctrine of non violence that he preached\nAnd it was weird because because I said I like the idea of Martin Luther king's non violent protest because I like the idea of\nPeaceful resolution moving us closer toward genuine any quality because it said Martin Luther king might have had the right idea [noise] a lot of folks on the Internet radio station listeners called me [noise]\nA Nazi sympathizer [noise] antifa being anti Nazi and because I had a problem with antifa and they're violent tactics ... I was certainly part of the Hitler Youth weird times I Know [noise]\nUm [noise]\nThe left them going on in the middle [noise] on the radio on shorter and D. [laughter] [noise]\nYeah I guess it was a real indicator that we're in a funny place in America when I was called the Nazi sympathizer when I was branded a member of the Hitler Youth because I said that antifa beat in the living ... not out of a Bernie Sanders supporter leaving and bloody industry was not the right move and that Martin Luther king's idea of non violence moving people toward\nThe equality was something that I felt much more\nComfortable with a feel like anytime violence plays into a situation chances are we're getting further away from me quality and further away from unity\n\nIf someone says you're wrong about something jerk or are you gonna listen to him right off the bat probably not probably got a double down on being right\nAnd thinking you're right but let's remove whatever the hell the situation is arguing never solves anything because I have yet to be in an argument where one person walked away went you know what you read I never thought about it that way I think the only time that really happens is probably the only time that really happens is probably in\nRelationships you know that you love this person and you want to work things out so maybe\nIt's a person that you were going to live in the same home with for the rest of your life it's that serious of a release\nYou know and and it's really interesting the purple states the purple cities the ones aren't red or blue\nThat's where he seemed to see less of this stuff maybe if\nThere's enough of ... enough people around you I mean I've always had this maybe if there's enough people around you to believe differently than you you start to realize that not all of them\nAre evil eight holes that hate America so he started to be a little bit more tolerant maybe it's true like we said time and time again on the show that [noise] prejudice is broken down by contact I don't know but it's a strange thing\nThat Portland has become ground zero for such phenomenal amounts of politically and sociologically motivated violence when on paper ... a lot of folks in Portland all believe the same\nThing getting ... getting together to agree with each other would appear to be the order of the day\nIn cities like Portland but it's not [noise]\nFor some reason like I said it's become a hotbed of political violence and the police the police are having a very hard time doing their jobs because well this political violence weirdly enough has the tacit approval of the politicians that it seems to be benefiting [noise]\nOn a sec [noise] can't wait to tell you what the head of Fort Leslie unions demand [noise]\n\nFolks rises fraction of the calls and they do happen to specialize in engagement rings and diamond ring boat grades goes you know she's been thinking about a ... grade\nAnd uh you know even if you're not serious about during and you're just going to use it to voting relationship\nSure you can take the brainchild challenge you know you want to go shopping show all want you to because that way when you come into shows you know wow now ...\nPercent financing for twelve months on purchases some exclusions upon ... jewelry to call neural with gray Montrose would have been ...\nUh this is Jimmy bird with a message from my friends who do you know losing now you already know the dean at least they can save you up to fifty percent every month it's understood that easy leave saves you big money\nBut what's funny is if you talk to somebody who actually leases with the you know the first thing they ... the experience we were talking about the leasing process with the folks that ... people love all they never have to leave the house to get a brand new car any make any bottle any color\nBeing able to deliver your car to wherever you are and you can find all of the documents online I Love the Dina leasing with them you're not paying more for the luxury experience\nIf you haven't filled the dean of experience were stand is about time you do called you know listening to ... won three to ... thousand that settlement three to non zero one thousand or go to the auto leasing duck or if your financing gr vehicle for more than forty bucks you're doing it wrong all the folks who do you let them\nYou can have a healthy ... like a mind of healthy is fine ever but either way to\n[noise] get gay guy in radio and then\nThey do on the radio\nOn and\nSo you know as you are saying it's weird what's going on in Portland I mean here's this place is supposed to be a haven for liberals here's this place where ideologically\nEveryone is much more on the same page than they are in other parts of the world and it just supports my theory that the difference the difference is what makes us stronger the difference is what makes is able to coexist and get along\nYou get around a bunch of people that only think talking act and behave the way you do anything else that looks different is going to be well harder to process harder to understand easier to be afraid of\nHate exists better in\nA vacuum\nI seen it happen time and time again in various cities that I've called home in America I mean\nFrom New York New York City is well people think\nIn one way in the northeast I mean not as a rule but generally speaking it's pretty fair to imagine that from New York City all the way up to Massachusetts when you swing a cat you're going to hit a liberal Democrat\nAnd then I moved to Houston which is the exact polar opposite\n[noise] but\nHaving spent more and more time in a city like San Diego or I'm On a couple of different radio stations I see it I see it in action I see the fact that there are very different folks\nThere are politically divided folks that live right next door together and San Diego 'cause San Diego's an interesting town you have a huge military contingent plunk down in the middle of hippie DeVito who sprout eating California\nAnd all of a sudden politics become much less of an issue Irish or passion people people are impassioned people are divided people are\nAll up in arms about politics in much the same way that they are over the rest of the country but I don't see it get into daily life as much I don't see as much hate when I'm In San Diego\nBecause if your neighbor voted differently than you and they loan you their lawn more or they might be really hot or whatever the case may be it's less\n\nOf a viable proposition to stay mad at him contact contact destroys prejudice\n[noise] so I guess it's sort of makes sense that in a city where you have this kind of group think that you have in places like\nPortland where everybody's already sort of in agreement with each other\nThat there would be a certain amount of conflict\nBecause when you live around a bunch of people that look talk think act and we have the way you do it doesn't teach you how to get along with others as well doesn't teach you how to respond to people that are different than you as effectively\nSo for whatever reason we can't really put our finger on exactly we've got some viable theories but for whatever reason Portland has become ground zero for a lot of political violence\nAnd boy has it put the police there and a tough situation to the point where this past Monday just gone by I Believe it was the head of Portland police union demanded\nThat the city council take action against the violent protestors in the city saying Portland has become one of the most politically violent cities in America\n\n[noise] demanding that city council do something about this\nThere was an article on Oregon live and they they're they're in the thick of it there in the fray there live and\nWhat this head of the police union has been talking about and in Portland they say\nThe mayor along with the city council\nBasically endorses antifa\nNow look antique as weird thing [noise]\nMaybe you're an ... member may be the anti fascist sentiment of antifa speaks to you and she is one of those things though where you can slap a label on it and it's not necessarily it's not\nNecessarily really clear what it is you can say you're anti fascist well good for the vast majority of the rest of the world is anti fascist we've seen fascism we know is unbelievably ugly we know it's lead to genocide we know it's led to incredible human cost Reno that fascism must be stopped wherever you're in a position to stop it\nSo saying I'm anti fascist well it's basically saying I like puppies crazy like puppies everybody likes puppies of course you're anti fascist everybody's anti fascist but\nThat blanket assumption that because something is anti fascist\nIt's good and all the behaviors of people that are part of this organization or things that we should condone well that's where it gets a little sticky\nYeah slap and easy to like label like anti fascist on something and it's sort of put blinders on people when it comes to paying attention to their real behavior\nAnd look\nThis is a lesson for each and every one of us to be learned from what's going on and Portland the right has its own version of it\nThe right has his own version of well all they were saying is they really really like other white people\nOn that you're talking about the KKK right they love white people that's not no no author said is they love white people know shut up don't buy into this garbage but they vote oh okay\n[noise] the same thing exists on the left but\nIs a little bit tougher and more insidious and more difficult to root out because people like the KKK well we know that is wrong and bad and evil and horrible but if you say were anti fascist were anti the KKK oh okay that sounds All right to me\n\nBut weren't you the people that beat the living ... not out of a Bernie Sanders supporter and left him lying bloody in the street because he wouldn't give you as American flag when she was holding up as a symbol of hope but we're anti fascist that doesn't make the other part of it okay", "show_name": "A.D.",
