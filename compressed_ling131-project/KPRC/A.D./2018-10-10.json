dog fight no it wasn't really a mock the dock fight so it's a get in there but however that's a new dynamic into this game um with the fact that now they can't attack ... twenty twos and maybe thirty five with out\nRadar so is the is the control of the middle east less about resources and more about testing military technology and abilities\nNo well I think the Russians technological development with his weapon system was only a icing on the cake for us and and and I do believe they were actually looking when they moved and that's why they moved and was because they realize they had to\nGet you can't miss this opportunity and they've already seen multiple upgrades on their se twenty five is on the other fighters and weapons systems\nSo this is field testing a military hardware for a complex down the road\nRight and also providing you know combat training for soldiers that you can't really get like you can get some of the Ukraine right now but it's a little different type of combat\nAre we ever talked about the Saudis in a couple of weeks where do they stand under the ah the emerging reign of Solomon well\nOne of the big things is happening is is a a journalist Cal ... who kind of disappeared and uh about four days ago the b._b._c. interviewed him and now he's totally disappeared now instead of hearing that he was at the Saudi consulate in Turkey and got chopped up and sent home now I've got\nRight or because he was talking against ... agenda even though he was kind of pro ISIS pro jihad a\nBut he has been against some journalists Yes sir but I didn't mean to interrupt you know he was he was pro jihad is he was pro a\nPro attacking Yemen and stuff so it was pretty much fit fit in line with the obvious agenda however he was speaking and saw him on and that's one of the things that dissent object uh you can't have too much with this one of the reasons why the sheiks the royal family got rounded up but in the ... and go\nWe'll we'll follow your lead right so\nThere's been kind of a backlash but then again he was trying to put a good face on an emerging Saudi Arabia their Sommer wealth London is expanding by about another six hundred billion\nA ... but now they're not the kind of backing off in their IPALCO on aramco a\nWhich may be indicating they still see a future for oil which they do but however they're going to take their time mentioned they're moving to check\nIt and that's something you said over a year ago that we were looking for a diversification of the Saudi wealth into the emerging tech markets a and and certainly I mean I guess all all\nThe difference as we deal with countries in the middle east your government controls all the resources as opposed to here where the private sector allegedly controls the resource\nRight and meanwhile it's like the Saudis are trying to do a back room deal with the Russians with oil and bypassing the Iranians and this is the great irony about the Russian Iranian relationship as militarily is very cohesive but when it comes to business as cutthroat who Russia and Saudi Arabia\nWho goes Russia's imagine that yes uh\nI'm okay we're running out of time uh what else do we need to talk about on tonight's intel over\nWell basically you know I think we're going to look at this the stretch of the u._s. airways winding down somewhat a we have the threat of ... are being attacked by Syria which again has said that all foreign entities need to move out of Syria or suffer the consequences which means you know uh and that\nIs dangerous with the Kurds because

Thirty years of political thought in DC\nOkay what would that entail in broad strokes well\nBasically we've had this mindset and if you look at nor rat\nAnd they're a defense grid network it shows the south of Mexico all the way up to Canada that we've had this you know North American unit a viewpoint which is ironic because un views North America is a one and there go a long term plan of tens owns in the world and\nUh we have that mindset said to shut that down\nWith means shutting down the border in Mexico there's no political clout ed you know mindset for that and then with a Canada\nWe could do be self sufficient but because of globalism and with the lack of manufacturing we would suffer for about ten to Fifteen or periods\nYeah but there is manufactured in Mexico or when you're talking about ... defense of North America or the bottom line is if for whatever reason somebody chose to to attack uh\nMexico the problem for the U.S would be a refugee situation similar what are the Europeans are facing now in North Africa in the middle east\nNobody ... yeah yeah I'm just saying that that that yeah we we keep the Mexican down there we\nGive him some manufacturing jobs and most of the TV and film or you just because of NAFTA cheaper labor force but when you're talking about ... and the fact that it looks at North America from Mexico to Canada a that's not necessarily a problem\nWell it's not necessarily a problem but it's a new mindset because originally back up until the eighty late eighties a mindset wasn't there\nOf it even has gotten away from us I Apologize to

of course you have because everybody does\nThen man I Can't recommend this book\nHighly enough I mean all of his books are great but it really is truly a survive a guide for survival guide for some of life's more difficult ... situations anyways we'll talk to the ... and just a little bit but until then like I said we're killing time so let's have a look at the events of today and our segment my witness news shall we\nTaylor Swift after remaining successfully neutral for many years has finally entered the fray of the political world Taylor Swift has endorsed Tennessee democratic candidates for the house and Senate\nHowever before she can finish ... stepped up to say the beyond say makes the greatest endorsements of all the time of all time actually there is a really really bizarre and somewhat disturbing twist to the Taylor Swift getting into politics story and she's not getting into politics she's not running for anything but\nThis is the first time she's ever been anything in her career than completely neutral\nWhite supremacists are abandoning Taylor Swift as expected Taylor Swift endorsement of democratic candidates in Tennessee is causing her some support but not everyone who is renowned seeing their sweat the hood will be missed and into that category fault the white supremacists yeah\nSee white supremacists on the Internet channel or the Internet forum for ... rather adopted Taylor Swift a couple of years back as a sort of\nArea in ... and now she's endured some democratic candidates they simply simply cannot deal yeah white supremacists on the Internet forum or chant adopted Taylor Swift as this area and got us and now they can't deal with the fact that she's endorsing Democrats many are calling her a traitor even though she was never one of them in the first place\nSome think she was paid as if Taylor Swift means the money which she obviously does not there's even this ridiculous theory being floated around that she did it because she has a black boy friend [noise]\nMore you know it could be that she believes in love tolerance he quality and is looking for a candidate that speaks to her sense of belief\nJust like how I never would have known\nThat got affected you and so that's a great gift to me that I got to find out a book that was difficult for me to write and had a lot of ramifications with my family they weren't all thrilled with that\nRussia they weren't\n[noise] and so to hear that means the world to me means\n[noise] you know I I was trying to help myself and I was trying to help\nIn the process hopefully other people and that's why I thought it was an important book because I think we get lost and and you know if you are in the same story over and over and you don't have any information you don't know what to do sometimes somebody else's Journey Out\nOf there is can help you find a way out of yours\nYou know I think I mean and there were so many there were there were so many points in that book or I'm like oh this is how you might deal with this but I think that the most important thing was\nYou know I I think when you're going through whatever it is you're going through especially with family especially when you\nYou know you did something that took some doing in that you don't want to throw other family under the bus when you don't necessarily know who to talk to knowing that there is someone else out there that is going through or has been through something that that it that was the really big thing [noise]\n\n\nAnd fifty on Facebook used big news hot topics but most of your interviews but to speed for those of us who really just care about news that matters to us is that nurses ...\nOr join the conversation which they get to know go to keep your radio dot com boom like button again but keep your she radio dot com including the blue like button joined us on Facebook\nGet\nScammed on the news you know use guys out there in radio Iran\nDo on the radio here we're talking with Louie

between [noise] should I write this stuff because it doesn't make you more successful are popular\nComedy wise to do these kinds of things they actually kind of arrest your career you know they kind of they kind of hurt\nThe idea that everything's fine and everything's rosy and everything's you know but I always felt like it was important it always was something I felt like I had to do and that's that's why I did it and\nThing you just told me that your experience with it and what I meant to you is exactly the reinforcement that that makes it makes everything worth it no matter what I went through which makes it worse to know that\nIt meant something to you because it should not be what we're all doing for each other that's kind of my way I'm trying to live my life\nI mean look you've probably seen the receipts you know a little bit better what affects your career and what doesn't but I actually got into your comedy through that book it was one of those things where I was going on a road trip but I was like oh this is a you know all I got this audio book I'm going to listen to that as I as I draw\nI have and I got the hard copy as well because when I was driving I wanted to read it and well it just you know I I got into your comedy and everything else that you've done because of that\nKind of that song yeah that's good to know she you know you never know what you never

always answer the email\nWell from the movies to the books to the TV shows to stand up specifically stand up everything you do make such a big difference in people's lives and for that reason I wanted to ask you if you had to take one\nMoment if you had to take one moment maybe it was seeing somebody else on TV maybe it was listening to a record maybe it was seeing someone live and he had to pick one moment where you knew for a fact that you had to do comedy that that was going to be your life what would you say that was\nIf I had to pick one moment that got me there are one thing that would propel me to it\nI mean you look at the obviously you had you know the moment where you broke but like where you knew it was a must for you\n[noise] when people stop me afterwards and said hey that was that was so great that really was the thing you may may forget about my troubles\nDuring the show and and right you know that was in and um and\nThe little carbon Mickey fans you know where people had access to us because there were only five comics and when we're done we would always hang around and talk to people\nAnd when people would say to me I you know my dad was like that and I'm Glad you talk about that thing or that joke really meant a lot to me because I'm also struggling with my weight and that kind of satisfy so I've always felt like I Love the response of the laughter\nBut I always feel like if I could get people that take something home might sound uh-huh that would make make them feel better long after they saw me that would be my bonus and that's that but for me to say\nOne day I just said well this is this is all I can never hope to do this or you know I just I felt once I started doing it a day I knew I had to do it I was almost like my drug\nUh-huh [laughter]
