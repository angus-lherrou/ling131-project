disappeared from Saudi conflict in eastern turkey Saudi is reportedly considering an admission reports\nIs a lot more easy to get understand and feel good about then hope and change what does that mean what does that look like\nAnd for that reason I always like to I was like to provide you with as many clear concrete examples of things that we talk about so we can figure out exactly what's going on that we can relate to a perfect example is is\nYou and I talked about really being in charge of your own life about personal responsibility on the show a lot you and I talk about the fact that quite frankly if you're like me [noise]\nDoesn't really make a difference who's been in office an elected official is never made any tangible real concrete difference to the way your day shaken up when you wake up in the morning\nWe talk about this all the time if you're looking for a politician to effect change in your life well then you are on the train to disappointment Phil population you because\nLook [laughter] the way you vote as important as important to be participatory in our democracy these decisions to vote like in the elections that are coming up and then not too distant future they have wait these actions have consequences\nBut they're slow moving consequences and by the way local elections these are the ones that really stand a chance of making any kind of real difference in your day to day existence that has that much is definitely true\nBut well we always talked about on the show if you're looking for change in your life if you're looking for something to be different when you wake up in the morning if you're looking for your day to be different\n[noise] well then that comes down to you and it always has and always will we talk about\nTaking control of your own life we talk about personal responsibility we talk about ... being the captain of your own ship writing your own story\nStuff like this but because I like to steer away from mindless platitudes that politicians pandering on a regular basis because\nI like to give specificity to what it is we're talking about I always look for an example of these things\nWhat does it look like taking your life in your hands what does it look like when you affect change in your daily existence what would be a good example of someone being captain of their own ship\nAnd today today I Want to share with you a really inspiring story\nAbout a man whose life was in one very definite way completely out of control\nBut you know what he made a decision he decided to captain is aren't ship he decided to effect change in his life he decided to write his own story and turn that ship of his around\nHis name's mark his cook and\nWell he competed this past weekend just come by and the granddaddy of all iron mask [noise] the Ironman world championship in Hawaii and he did this [noise]\nAgainst all odds he did this when few years back people have said this would have been absolutely possible [noise] I'll show this inspiring story with you next [noise]\n[noise]\nThe less from going out there in the middle [noise] on the radio on Twitter you can do [laughter]\nI think we probably talk about the most on that show the thing that we keep coming back to is personal responsibility I guess you'd call it the idea that yeah you should participate in our democracy but ultimately your life will always fall to you if you're looking for a\nPolitician or any elected official to make a concrete change in your life it's going to be a disappointing life because ain't nobody going to make a difference really\nBut you\nThere's only so much other people can do you have to get yourself there and if you listen to the show for any length of time I'm going to go out and lemon guest that you feel the same way but you know what I think it's so important to have concrete examples because as you were saying\nAnd politicians and so many other people not just limited to politicians um\nReligious leaders motivational speakers all these types they like to deal in big flam flam without really giving you the answer to anything what does this actually look like when you take control of your own life and take action and do something that only you can do\nFor yourself and you know\nI really really\nLike stories about health and fitness and I like them for a very specific reason [noise] it's not because like I'm some health or fitness junkie but I remember once thinking to myself when I got in kind of out of shape\nThat\nThere was only one person one person that can deal with this and that was me\n\nI can call in favor as I could get people to do things for me and pretty much any other area my life I can blame things on other people in a year in my life I wanted to but I remember\nHaving this very sort of clear realization that the only person that was going to get me in shape was me and so I got in shape\nAnd\nFor that reason I've always really enjoyed stories of health and fitness because they are really like the rest of your life\nIn that\nYour health and fitness falls to you and only you as the rest of your life but it's a real great example of something that's very clear because you know you can find reasons you can find excuses you can find blamed to apportion to other people and other things when things don't work out the way\nYou want them to but ultimately if you want to be in shape and don't get in shape or as down to you that is down to you\n\nAnd he did it cut to a couple of days later the man did it he finish it two point four miles of swimming a hundred and twelve miles on a bike and a twenty six mile run\n\nDid it in a time of sixteen fifty one unbelievably impressive stuff and I love this story because it teaches us two very important things it teaches us that only we can take\nResponsibility for our own lives but in doing so well inspire change and others and it also teaches us\nThat starting no matter how small starting [noise] is the most important move\nThe government [noise] kinda\n[noise] money money man my [laughter]\n\n\nNetworks with over fifty different lenders now you can get a personal loan for up to five

by any chance [noise] want children but perhaps you're not able to have them or maybe you know someone who falls into that category\nI got to tell you I've never tried to have kids myself but so many people around me have had difficulty having children for one reason or another\nMaybe\nThey haven't found a partner in life but they know being a parent is incredibly important thing to them and they're going through all sorts of medical\n\nOptions are perhaps are looking into fostering are adopting or what have you but it it it's a very very difficult thing\nI've got gosh\nFriends and family members of plenty who wanted children more than anything else\nBut either had a very\nDifficult time conceiving had a difficult time going full term and having the baby or had a difficult time\nGetting pregnant at all\nThere's so many people that you meet all of us now that want children that want to give a child a loving home that want to have a family\nAnd want to be parents so many people I Know that have such a hard time doing that and it causes genuine pain and genuine heartbreak oftentimes\nThere are humongous expenses associated with becoming a parent but it's not an easy thing to do\nAnd you know it's crazy to me because as many people as you know that are struggling in one way or another to have a child to have family\nThere are so many more that\nAren't dedicated his parents didn't want that kid\nMaybe gave that kid up maybe gave the kid up and it was really difficult idea but there's so many kids that have nothing there's so many children all over the world that have nothing and no one\nAnd there's this humongous surplus of people that want nothing more than to give\nThe child a loving warm carrying family and home\nAs one of those things where you look at it you go how is this possible how can you have so many people that want to have children and so many children without parents\nAnd look I Know protecting the welfare of a child is a very important thing and far be it for me to pretend to understand the intricacies of adoption\nAnd all the rules and systems that are in place to protect a Welsh and the welfare of a child but\nI Do know that it it's like food surpluses when people are going hungry in the same country it seems unconscionable seems like there has to be a way to simplify the situation\nAnd give people what they want and what they need so anytime anytime I hear a story [noise] anytime I hear a story of it becoming easier for a child to have a loving caring home\nI get happy about it and hey if that story also is about",
