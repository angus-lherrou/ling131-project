[noise]\nThe PR so you're going to keep your seat\nFrom the gallery furniture made America studios suitcase your seat\nTrying to heal in Pittsburgh and Carmen Robert Fox news\nGood ... a rabbi leads the community and a prayer for the eleventh victims murdered by a gunman at a synagogue on Saturday or on the\nSame day the stuff that Robert Ballard wounded in a shootout with police appeared in court in a wheelchair to faced federal charges\nThat last car that we'd have for a Brazilian years couldn't handle it but now we could drive across the country in this thing and\nBe fine fantastic and bloody task Dick and then depending on what car you drive in and how you're driving it eventually something happens that Christine\nSense of freedom that you feel from having a brand new car [laughter] that sense that you can go anywhere and do anything in that car will never ever let you\nDown that goes away something happens I check engine light comes on you start hearing something a little funny you get your first ... first scratch\n[noise] you know like a was this kind of cost me and all of a sudden you're back in it you're back in that stress of being a car owner of you how this happened to you [noise] uh this happened to me today [laughter]\nGot a new car a little while ago my last one my last one was an oath to the tape deck that I promised myself I Would drive into the ground and I did so I treated myself with a new car while at least a car that was new to me anyway\nAnd something happen today where I heard a funny sound and then the check engine light came on and\nI don't really know enough about cars I grew up in New York City in London primarily taken a subway or that you as we call it in England\n[noise] I don't know enough about cars to know what the sounds sounded like and uh I had a chance to really figure out what the check engine light is all about but I Do know one thing like I Can't afford it [laughter] just a you know it's just the way the world works\nMy thing my cars right on schedule to have its first problem and that's all right it's part of life part of the circle life if your car [noise] eventually this China's gonna come off\nBut you know [noise] I realize I realized as I was trying to mentally calculate\nWhat I could afford to put into a car moving forward in addition to the car payment I realized that I Am in about the same fiscal situation but I was a three or four years ago [noise]\nAnd I've been working really really really really really really really hard I this is not a boo hoo story we're going somewhere I'm not wanting I'm very fortunate in many ways\nBut I realized that in\nThe last three or four years of hustling my butt off doing this show [laughter] and being on my own now twenty five or so other radio stations bus in my butt\nSleep and approximately three and a half hours a night except for a weekend where I just collapse into the car but\n[noise] I haven't accomplished a whole lot\nI haven't moved myself forward financially all the hard work has been more about survival than anything else and that's fine this is a life I chose don't get me wrong I'm not complaining like I said in many ways I'm extraordinarily fortunate\n\nBut it was depressing to me because it made me think it made me think\nAbout what you and I do together but we talk about when we're hanging out together and how\nLook this show is actually grown considerably in the last couple of years in terms of the number of listeners and numbers stations were on\nLike of that I could not be more proud that's rolling right along however however\nYou would think with all that there would be extra cash in my pocket and it's a tough one it's a tough one for these conversations that you and I have in the world of media it's a difficult game\nGetting people to throw money at a political show\nI must be real here we spend a lot of time talking about politics we talk about a way of laughs and conversations we talk about music but ultimately we seemed to come back to the events of\nToday and the marketplace of ideas\nAnd who's running for what it was occupies a good portion of our conversation [noise] and I learned a long time ago when I started doing this when I decided who I was and what I was going to be\nWhen I decided what the show was going to be all about when I decided what kind of conversation you and I would be having\nI decided a long time ago I wouldn't do that kinda shameless pandering inside taking my I I just wouldn't do it because it's not who I Am\nIt's funny when I first got advice from some people and talk radio that really knew what they were talking about people that had been around for a long time people that it's fostered the careers of massive\nPersonalities they're like it's going to take longer for you but here's what you can't do you can't not be yourself\nIf you're not being yourself it just won't work so be yourself understand it's going to take longer to pay off and that's fine I'm happy waiting it out\n[noise] but the reason I bring it up like I said I'm not complaining I'm incredibly fortunate the time that you know I spent together really is the best part of my day every single day\nBut something that Ted Koppel reliable old school liberal broadcaster like Ted Koppel said about the state of media\nAnd the money that is in the division that is\nWay too much part and parcel of the American experience at the moment [noise] the money's just too good for people to not want to be divided and I was like oh\nBecause I refuse to ... because I refused to vilify someone that doesn't believe in the things I Believe in because I refused to swear allegiance to a political party [noise] because I respect you\nToo much to dumb down our conversations and I don't believe in part taking in a simple narrative for simple people [noise] I'm going to have trouble fixing my car well according to Ted Koppel I Am what did he say it's an interesting an illuminating one and we'll get into it next [noise]\n\nThe veterans I Want to thank all your small businesses out there who've donated whether you gave cash or whether you gave product owner thanks so many of you who've gone out and donated your time and volunteer I Want to thank so many of you who've just raised awareness so that veterans\nWith ... they have a place to do a number to call that number is eight seven seven seven one seven P. TST that's eight seven seven seven one seven Seventy eight Seventy three eight seven seven seven one seven PATS date veterans\nYou served our country now let our other veterans serve you were all behind you were all hear from you there is an answer call camp hope it's ...\n\nThe left or more ham radio there in the middle [noise] on the radio\nOn Twitter and these guys [noise]\nMore do you don't really like the Ted Koppel said this I really like that an old school highly visible liberal broadcaster reliably liberal broadcaster like Ted Koppel came out and said this now this is a sort of thing that you and I talk about on a show\nAll the time whenever I'm just going to face the grim reality of my place in the pecking order broadcasting more people now who Ted Koppel is ... I'm okay with that but\nDuring a panel discussion at the national press club he basically said exactly\nWhat I've been saying for years that there's great cash in division and that the media is feeding off of it like you wouldn't believe and this happened like I said during a panel discussion at the national press club he pointed out that\nTom media moguls like former CBS chief Les Moonves have acknowledge that despite the chaos Donald Trump's candidacy in presidency have been\nOf tremendous fiscal benefit to the press doesn't matter which side you're on but if you're a liberal for us there was a lot of ... in it for sure\nAnd he'd do the right wing types well look it's well known that you do\nBetter it's well known that you do better if you're the underdog when people feel like they're rebellious\nOutsiders and they found their tribe and they found their club and finally they found somebody that understands them when you can kind of ... as\nWell as big bucks in it and it's harder to sell the overlooked underdog narrative if your guy or girl gets elected so right wing media folks had a really great run while Obama was in power boy did they ever\nWhen like I said you're a guy or girl wins you're at a bit of a disadvantage but this is where Trump is magical because you can be on the right and still be\nA never Trump you can still generate all sorts of cash by going I don't know about this thing that he said ... [noise]\n[noise] ... it's sort of a golden opportunity for people on the right like if a more traditional old school candidate had been elected\nFor fiscal again I Wish I Wish things were different I Wish there wasn't such great cash in division I wish that\nConversations like the ones you and I have every single day where we go hey maybe maybe if we recognize the fact that they're all we're all kind of working toward the same thing we all want similar stuff we just have different ideas about the best way to get there [noise] maybe we can get along perhaps even learn something from each other and get\nThere that much money [noise] honey I Wish there were more people having conversations like ours but until then [noise] so happy to have you here\nI Know he's my cars making [noise] doesn't really matter [noise]\nMe different got I've had a several times I've had mixed bombing I ended up ... do the job they are all license background check plumbing technician expert highly experienced\nThey respect your your property and they come in there and you just know you're in good hands to the minute you see you and when they leave your hands are clean your knees are wet everything's fix everything is good to go get better than that\nMix plumbing handles all your whole our commercial plumbing services they do repairs and installations it can get pretty tricky but not for next job too big too small seven one three eight six eight Ninety nine\nO seven that handy dandy online addressed mix plumbing dot com it's warming ... thirty eight five forty eight [noise]\nYeah we sort of stop paying attention and wrapped up a lot of\nThat yeah it was ... he blamed me by my credit card debt and I blame him for building that man cave\nIt's are so anyway we stop blaming each other dinner homework and read that a smart way to consolidate debt is to get a fixed rate loan but getting a loan was brutal and time drain so I was in my man cave researching personal loans and I found the best egg have an a plus rating with the ...\nYou don't get to get on the news you know these guys out there in radio and land on\nThe news feed for those of us who really just care about news that matters to us join the conversation stay under no so to keep your she radio dot com and click on the blue light button [noise]\nOn the radio\nOn and on\nAnd\n\nAnd nobody else knows it but you know\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] we more\nPassing of the great Tom Petty\nAnd you know what this week marks about a year and two weeks since I got to see the great Tom Petty I think I saw the second to last show he'd ever play and you know it was an amazing amazing thing because\nHe was part of this line up for this festival could do that I've been going to have been part of for the last four years in Southern California so amazing moment in time and I think one of the things that I appreciate the most about this kind of thing is it that it offers you the opportunity to make some memories but\nYou don't understand what a big deal to him that he was so many going into this\nAnd I resigned myself I had resigned myself that seeing him\nWas never going to live up to the hype because for a\nSmall piece of personal history a big part of the reason that I think I wound up in radio was because I fell in love with radio and a big part of the reason why I fell in love with radio because my uncle was on the radio Ninety six WC M. F. in Rochester New York a station that still going\nHere's the thing though when I talk to my uncle about it he tells me oh yeah there are classic rock station now they're playing [laughter]\nThey're playing all the same records that I played except for then it was just rock now it's classic rock\nBut one of the things that made me kind of fall in love with the idea of radio was\nA tape that I heard the tape that I had heard of my uncles station doing account down of the top Ninety six songs of Nineteen eighty two and\nMan I discovered this years after it had been done\nBut it was like oh my gosh this is amazing as my uncle lives as my uncle counting them down his bed testicles\nAnd one of those songs that was on that was Tom Petty's you got lucky\nI remember the first I clear as day I can remember I remember the little old one speaker boom box cassette planes stereo thing that my parents allowed me to have in my room\nAnd I remember listening to this tape and I remember hearing\nThis guy coming out of it\nThe keyboards at the beginning of that song were unlike anything I'd ever heard the drum intro oh my gosh so incredible I I just started playing drums and I immediately after listening to it ran to the drum set and tried to figure out that little pattern that stand was doing on a high ...\nAnd it just blew my ever loving young mind because I never heard anything like it before the drums the keyboards and then this guy's voice he\nDidn't seem like everybody else he had a cool Boise out a good voice but he had a voice like he kind of didn't give a crap like he wasn't trying too hard he was just being himself and you know what when you look at Tom Petty in any way shape or form does that guy fit any kind of rock star mold\nDid he have stunning good looks or did he look kinda like a giant bird with a big beak\nDuty have one of those incredible rock voices did he have an amazing set of pipes that could project to the back row no no he wasn't any of those things but he was so unique Liam self and he was so good and he was so different because he was being himself\nAll these things sort of just washed over me and my First Listen I was like what the hell is is this is awesome this is also very different from everything else that is on the countdown to the top Ninety six songs of Nineteen eighty two I Believe it was\nAnd just fell in love with Tom Petty but for whatever reason I never got to see him a lot of people think a lot of people think that when you're in radio you get to see whoever you want to get all the proceed all the ... and I'm not gonna lie there have been some pretty cool", "city": "Houston"}
