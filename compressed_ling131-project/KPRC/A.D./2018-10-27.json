and I tell everybody on the University of Maryland university tough\nThe left them going down there in the middle [noise] being on the radio on Twitter and these guys [laughter] [noise]\nSo like I said I Want you to breathe in ... [noise]\nLet go of negativity in partisanship [noise] and rejoicing good news for America feels good to be back on top of the first time since two thousand eight the U. S. grab the number one spot and the world Economic Forum global competitiveness\nCompetitiveness index which means fiscally ain't nobody beat in America\nThat was the way it was very very very long time and there's people that would have argued even during the great economic downturn that no one was beating America but\nThat was a as a perspective it was challenging to indulge and you know what we're back up in the game [noise]\nThere's a global competitive index uses like I think about a hundred different indicators to rank the top one hundred and forty different economies below us countries like Singapore Germany Switzerland Japan the Netherlands Hong Kong the u._k. Sweden Denmark\nSo they have it\nWe're number one usa usa and the other thing like I was saying before is I had to I had to record a commercial for I heart radio or a company that I work for the other day and we do this from time to time and I guess what is it is this is this what you'd call\n'cause it wasn't like hey listen to us or hey go by this thing it it sort of I guess what we do to reach out to advertise advertisers we let people know that I guess what we reached nine out of ten Americans every single week which we do\nWe can help you grow your brand your business we can help you reach your target consumer we can help you advocate to them we can do all these things that can help you build your business that are good for business that are good for your business\nThat was the general thrust of all these commercials that I had to record in the past but when I open up my a\nWebsite my little Web portal that contained on my copy and I'm going to get in trouble for talking about this because it is sort of inside baseball but you know what it is good news and I'm stoked to share it with you [noise] when I opened up my little portal and got my new bit of copy\nWhere um I find out what it is I'm going to be saying in this commercial I was pretty ... because it was something along the lines of hey unemployment is at the lowest it's been in a very very long time that means\nIf someone wants to work there probably working so if you're looking for a new and better employee\nIf you're looking for a new and better employee\nFor your business if you're trying to grow your business you're going to have to be competitive you're going to have to really kind of court these folks are going to have to figure out a way to reach these folks because they're not at home checking the want ads like they've been since the global collapse\nBack in the two thousand eight\nEra when everything went horribly wrong and everybody was looking for a job and everyone was looking for a job on line and there was tremendous competition now it's the other way around now companies that want to build their business are going to be actively looking for a way to get to you to fight for you\nTo get you to come and work for them\nThey'll be looking for ways to incentivize your job they're going to be looking for ways to court you they're going to be looking for ways to make your life better and nicer and you know that's a cool as\nThing isn't it isn't it [noise] for the first time\nSince I started doing these things I had to cut a commercial that said hey better watch out unemployment is a historical lows so\nIf you want better employees for your company you're going to have to figure out a way to reach them what better way to reach them than when they're commuting in their cartoon from the jobs they already have because they're not looking for you you got to go looking for them and we can help you do that\nKnow it's pretty cool right to balance of power that it shifted between employers and employees\n\nIt's very different from anything we've experienced in the last decade and if you've grown up if you have\nOver the last decade or so I\nStopped being school aged maybe gone to college and enter the workforce this is the first time this is the first time that the scales are\nWeighing out in your favor I suppose it's a good feeling right just knowing it just knowing that people are going to be competing over you as an employee is a good feeling\nAnd you know you're probably going to be able to demand more money from your existing job in the not too distant future because I don't know if you know this but the workforce in America is getting old there's a lot of people that are getting ready to retire and people then well more cautious about reproducing\nIt's not like the days of the baby boomers it's not like the days where people were having kids left right and center it's like the days of oh man can we afford to have a kid we want to be cautious with the kid both of us have careers that that that that\nUh [noise]\nThere's gotta be a lot of demand for you the American worker and they're not too distant future\nAnd not only that but economically America is back on top again it for the first time in about a decade and these are all good pieces of news now there's going to be people to go huh that's fantastic Donald Trump has fix the economy there's got to be people to go\nNo he didn't everything is horrible there's no need to do with Donald Trump and you don't see you don't see that cliff we're about to go above\nAnd then there's going to be people who say look at Donald Trump taking credit for all the economic policies that Obama put in place to put us in this wonderful position where we're number one again I Want you\nTo like I said breathing [noise] breathe that\nLet go of all of that\nWho is English got a job in England and my parents had lived in Brussels before and they decided after having lived in New York where they're from and I'm from originally that it would be a nifty idea to get back to Europe especially with a young child they thought hey look this kid see a little bit more of the world\nI was devastated because well my father's job moved around a lot I think it was like my fifth school that year\nAnd and\nI just sort of kind of settled down vaguely I just maybe kind of sort of made some friends\n[noise] and\nI was just kind of sort of starting to assimilate a little bit and then my parents dropped a bombshell we're moving to England oh man oh no\nI won't have any friends or will you still have one friend my most important friend my best friend at least all be able to bring my dog with me yeah\nAbout that\nAre going to have to leave and I have to leave your dog here right after we will for a that was his name we're gonna have to leave him here because well he\n... it is it like it's still upsets me thinking about this still obsessed me talking about this because I Love this talk more than anything my first dog he's a rescue he was a rescue we got at the local dog rescue dog pound I I don't remember I was so young at the time but we went\nAnd his name [noise] did you ever have is when you were a kid you ever sort of like in fantasy land come up with names for things I don't know where the name will for came from but I kept telling my parents over and over again I wanted a dog and I wanted that dog to be called will for [noise]\nAnd they're like okay we got this dog beautiful dog beautiful dog cross between a golden retriever a golden lab I think it was a great Pyrenees mountain dog\nIt was a Ninety pound puppy and its name was Caesar and my dad was like you know you know [noise] that dog collar Sid Caesar on it\nBut to me he looks a lot more like a will for you know you can call him well for if you want so he became well for he was my best friend oh my gosh I was inseparable\nWe would go places but he was huge use like a Ninety pound dogs so he would he would drag me places where I'd go like I'm taking the dog for a walk now and uh he would immediately yanked me off my feet as he chased a cat or something like that\nOr was it was glorious Lee fun and also little terrifying as well\nMy kid sister who's really are at the time a will for would walk through the kitchen wagging his tail and like center flying across the room it was a huge puppy is the greatest use the absolute greatest and he man he loved me like I said I've been to a lot of schools and not a lot of time\nAnd one\nOf the schools one of the schools that I went to when I first got well for I'd take a school bus that was a traditional thing and every single day will for would break free of my mom as we were [laughter]\nAs she was a leading me to the school bus and he would get on the school bus and the kids would freak out they'd be laughing and he would he try and go with me to school every single day\nAnd I don't know if you know much about great Pyrenees but if you have a great\nPyrenees do you have to have a fence and it has to be a high wind because great Pyrenees are the ultimate protectors\nThey are fed to oh my gosh they're amazing beautiful incredible dogs they're great with kids they're great with other pets if you live in a place with animals like a farm or something like that it is their instinct to protect them through these massive gentle giants\nI fostered a great Pyrenees puppy a couple of great Pyrenees puppies before they were adopted once and I saw the instinct at work because they are very very young but whenever someone came to the door these little puppies would place themselves between me and whoever was at the door\nNot an aggressive way of being defensive but speak softly and carry a big stick way of being defensive great Pyrenees or just awesome because well they are that they're gentle giants but they're aware of their size and they know they're intimidating and so they're very protective but very quiet and laid back with it\nVery absolute greatest\nBut like I said my dog will for was fantastic and part of the reason why you got to have a big fence is because they're shepherding dogs they're hurting dogs it's their instinct to get out and parole the perimeter make sure everything's okay and they're protective role they are trying to get out into the world and and make sure that nothing on toward is going on\nAnd so my first school that I was at a time when I had well for he would jump onto the school bus with me try and come with me wherever I went\n[noise] then I transferred to the school that was literally next door to my house and I walk to school every single day and I'll never forget [noise]\nI'll never forget the first time it happened and then it happened several other times where people want their the dog out on a playground or the dog out on the playground I was like there was a dog got on a playground I when I looked on as us that's that's my dog\nHe scaled the five foot high fence that we had and tracked me to my school and came up to the window and I remember saying to my teacher that's my dog can if we take them home and like know your mom has to come and pick him up and so she did\nBut when I say we were inseparable best friends we were inseparable best friends was the greatest [noise] but my parents were there looking at me going yeah here's the thing\nIf you take a dog to England [noise]\nThey've got to stay in quarantine in a very small space for a very long time I think it was like six months nine months the better part of the year that a dog had to stay in quarantine [noise] so I had to leave my dog behind", "city": "Houston"}
