incredible thing because it's the exact opposite it's the exact opposite of pretty much\nEverything else in this world\nIn that [noise] everything else in this world\nBecomes less magical less meaningful less Barclay as you get older as you get weighed down by the income princes of daily life as an adult all the things that used to make you why died in full of wonder as a child\nGo way become less special you don't get excited over the anthropomorphic mouse that theme park which is really just had adult dressed as a mouse\nEating ice cream or something your doctor tells you you need to stop doing it you're gonna die it's not a special treat that makes you jump up and down and feel loved\n[noise] as logic creeps into your\nEveryday life as you start to become responsible for maybe another human life yeah that kid or something like that everything else becomes slightly less magical\nAbout being a fan well that somehow gets that much more magical\nBecause you're fandom it's something that you pay for ... years every when seems to matter more if your team has been losing team for a while as a fan of the New York Mets I Know a thing or two about this will give you another perfect example David right David right of the New York Mets not from New York ...\nFrom Virginia but you know he came up in New York Mets farm system and he played every single game of professional baseball that he played as one of our New York Mets or in the New York Mets system somewhere\nAnd\nThe guy is going to be just fine\nNow sadly he had spinal ... which is cut his professional baseball career short but he had an incredible run got to hit a home run in the world series\n[noise]\nPhysically he just can't play baseball anymore but you know what he's got to get paid the rest of his twenty seven million dollar salary that he's got left on his contract I think he's got to be just fine but it doesn't matter\n[noise] every time that guy would get a hit since he started having his spinal troubles I'd be moved to tears he would show up at the park hours early to do this special stretching routine necessary for him to get on the field and play\nAnd I don't know what it was that I was working through my life that made me care about this guy so much I mean obviously he was one of my beloved New York Mets and that really really matters obviously he was a great guy\nObviously he was a guy that a gentleman like brand new mobile learned a lot from when I came to attitude and gratitude and passion and hard work and hustle an incredible role models so maybe that's what I liked about him\nMaybe it's the fact that he always seemed to be smiling\n[noise] maybe it's the fact that he seemed to be truly grateful to be doing what he was doing [noise]\nMaybe it's the fact that growing up in Virginia and he was a fan of the Mets farm system\nAnd he grew up going to their minor league games and playing for the minor league team came up in the minor league system and then became the team captain of the New York Mets went all the way the world series where he hit a home run I don't I don't know what it is but\nEvery time that guy got a base hit for the last several seasons even though he's been out for a couple of seasons before he retired I cry\nIt just he worked so hard such a good guy he deserves is to make millions upon millions upon millions\nYeah deservedly so that's what the market was support bang David ride million so that's what he got and he has a hang up his baseball career a little bit early but he's going to make twenty seven million dollars\nBut still still\nAs I watched his final game at city field tears streaming down my face\nNow many people get a chance to say goodbye and say thank you the way he did to a team that's been everything to him\nAnd I know that if I was sobbing uncontrollably while I was watching and come up to take his final at bat\nThat I knew that that sold out house over forty thousand people in New York City feel I knew there wasn't a dry there [noise] and again\nYou fly logical reason to it that there was a professional baseball player he plays for a team on by people that don't really care what you think uh uh everybody that plays on the team isn't from the town that you're in so you get this weird sense of local pry there really isn't just a Bible that whatever\nYou don't need to be logical when it comes to being a fan and that's a great thing and that's why I think fandom as you get older becomes that much more important and everything else gets less magical that kind of fandom\nEspecially if you watch your team loses for years and years and years becomes that much more important it was a beautiful thing about our Houston Astros by the way in case you're wondering where my baseball allegiances lie I'm it goes mess mess will always have my heart but I Love the Houston Astros I mean how can you not love the Houston Astros\n... and you know what that's the weird thing this is this is the attitude of the fan\nI don't understand how anyone couldn't get excited when the New York Mets when I don't understand how anyone could getting excited couldn't get too excited when the Astros win when I first moved to Houston\nFifteen or so years ago I remember going All right let's see what the local team is all about\nI was like oh well you know like my Mets they seemed to wear a lot of orange they became a baseball team in the same year that's kinda cool and then I was watching sports on TV when I first moved to Houston, Texas and I could you not the actual line that the sports caster used was and in sports the Astros find a new way to lose it was like [laughter]\nI can relate to this being a Mets fan I can relate to this very very strongly\nSo [noise]\nI I guess this is all just a way of talking about baseball which I Love and and if you love baseball to me probably had a great time and if not well Neal excuse me this minor indulgence\nBut being a fan of whether it's of a band or a sports team or whatever the hell it is you happen to be a fan of\n[noise] is this die hard\nEmotionally connected feeling that has nothing to do with logic and reason had some beautiful break from logical reason that we are forced to\nDeal with more and more every single day we make our way and the adult world\nHe's a man who's worked hard for many many years to become the man he is he's a man who is on everything he possibly could to put himself in a position where he might wind wind up as part of the Supreme Court the highest court in Atlanta highest court on the face of the freaking planet in many ways\nAnd\nDon't seem to be all that interested in the truth people seem to be\nTremendously interested in winning this could be a good man's life that we're willing to destroy\nBecause the system\nDoesn't afford him the protection that anyone else would get in the situation has life being torn apart\nNow that maybe it's a horrible awful I'm going to remove my thoughts and opinions and conjecture from this maybe it's a horrible awful tiara terrible agree just person that has done all these things let's assume for a second he's done everything that he has been accused of\n[noise] let's assume that for a second\nWe have to be sure wouldn't we I mean these are horrible things\n\nIn the minds of so many Kavanaugh is guilty of things that will destroy his life and his family's life forever\nBefore before\nAny kind of real results for any kind of real investigation of come back now will this investigation turn up anything conclusive I don't know I don't think so but it's still vulture like feeding feeding frenzy with which this country\nIs willing to judge this man whose life could be ruined by these proceedings\nThat has me a little gas and on the flipside of that this is a man who's been accused of some very serious things and there's so many people who are willing to go down this nonsense looked at him\nThere's no way he could have done these things we want the political advantage man if we get this guy and we get him in for life\nAgain this is a man\nWho is on the verge of being appointed for the rest of his days on this planet to a position of tremendous power and the highest court in the world\n\nHis character or lack there of will have a profound impact on the life of every single\nAmerican and for that reason for that reason if there is concern that maybe\nMaybe this guy could have done some of this stuff but she has been accused of doing\n\nDo we not want to be thorough out of respect for our country out of respect for our fellow Americans out of respect for the flag and all that stands for\nIsn't it incredibly unpatriotic to want to do a rush job on something like this\nBecause it's going to give you an upper hand in some situations with regard to your political and sociological release it the right thing to do to put a guy in immediately when there's been these questions raised about who he is\nOr is it better to examine the situation and know that you can get your guy in to a place where he can advocate for your values your standards of human decency\nYour ethics your morals your beliefs and you can do all that with a clear conscience\nYou can have a clear conscience about the whole thing\n\nBut now now [noise] now what America is doing right now\nAmerica sees a temporary yeah America is really very ...\nThat sort of cliche that people apply to millennials everybody wants it fast and everybody wants it now and nobody wants to work for it Kavanaugh situations perfect example\nThere's obviously an election coming up and there's a power struggle a heated death grip power struggle I think we really think do we really than anything is going to be that different\n\nThat were really all going to go to hell\nA hand basket if your guy does or does not make it\nDepending on how you feel about cabinet oh\n\nNo no stop take a beep take a breath you want to do the right thing and you want to know that you did the right thing you don't want a sniper at your neighbor for a temporary advantage that probably won't affect your day to day life\nI don't think you do if you are like me you can't think of an instance where a politician made any kind of difference in the way your day laid out when you woke up in the morning there's all the all this hope that maybe they will\nBut I have yet to run across that the way your day goes the way your life shakes out has and always will be down to you\n\nA temporary rushed job to get a little bit of perceived power which could wind up either destroying a good man's life [noise]\nOr [noise]\nPutting undeserving person in a position of tremendous authority well that doesn't do us any good like I said\nThere's a difference between being a fan and being a patriot [noise]\nOff or not valid in all states that were hit by law laws are subject to let her approval the website for details needs some
