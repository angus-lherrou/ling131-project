US dollar consumer confidence index basically that crypto currency is what you think it's worth and how many people are getting into it it's interesting that Goldman Sachs is now getting into a crypto currency this can be regulated by the U.S Federal Reserve\nAnd I'm ... and\nSome people or anything that might be an alternative to the dollar in case it hits hard times so cryptic currency is basically a digital\nAre based on\nWhat you think it's worth but the ... for example supposedly tied and be backed up all the wealth and course Venezuela's still has lots of mineral diamond a gold wealth there that could back it up\nI'm so basically it is a\n... something that is not easily verified and it's just at the will of the market at that time we've seen huge swings going on with that point where people want is all Fifteen thousand and one month and just drops ten thousand next month\nThe global is would want there to be one world currency and it would be an electronic currency correct well\nThat and that's one of the things that Iraq has been talking about fears they want strictly digital here in the U.S because and they can track all transactions and all taxes will be paid right and that's something that you as been rumbling about because they have a lot of cash hidden in mattresses throughout\nEurope a lot of wealth or that is not being a taxed as transactions occur and that also makes it easy to control but actually Iraq ironic thing is that\nA China has been talking to come up their own crypto currency but that would be controlled with the a cell phone network\nInformation network digital network as the one belt one road\nYeah but with the integrity of that I'll be any question if you put everything in the digital currency it could be taken away because of austerity measures it could be taken away because of a glitch or they could convict you without jury\nOf or some sort of cyber crime and you could have to forfeit all your all your money the the these are fraught with\nA pitfalls\nThat would restrict liberty\nTroop and what's interesting about ... and the reason I really take office for people wanting to do transactions that would be not in taxes and Iran has found a way using ... technology to track these people down and then she only make them pay taxes\nAnd cesium and of course you know here's the thing is that digital currency is only as good and what happens to your storage device what happens to that it's like paper it's only as good as what what somebody is willing to give you at that moment for\nMy own so not not in the

radio reaches an awful lot of people therefore it would be who you to advertise with us\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is because I had to record I had to record\nSomething very interesting was a very interesting piece of data and at the other day when it was sort of ... talking about people talking to businesses about why they would want to advertise with us\nNow generally speaking in the past it's been like we can help grow your business we can help you reach your target consumer all of which by the way is completely and totally true radios and you know radio is a really weird thing\nA lot of the time when people go what are you doing on the radio radio still exists I Know I'm just surprises you are for get this\nRadio this archaic piece of technology that is really change very little since the days before TV when the families together on the wireless radio\nIs reaching more people than it ever has everybody thought that it would go the way the do do everybody thought that satellite radio would and radio it it did not everybody thought that age the radio would and traditional broadcast radio\nDo you remember that there are secret station broadcasting next station to find out what Tom ... radio [laughter] I mean a T radios great I'll listen to it all the time but I think I'm kind of in the minority but it was one of those things was making people go oh traditional radios gone away and then cell phones came out\nI remember I remember like we were in radio we were scared of cell phones we were we were we were scared of cell phones I mean not me personally but overall we were kind of scared of cell phones I remember it was one satellite radio was becoming a really big thing and I was there I was a\n[noise] I had a a a toe in both pools I was like the morning guy on all nation on serious acts up at the time and\nI was also on a bunch of FM stations and I remember going to this meeting once and having some big marketing might come in and go more not afraid of satellite radio\nWant to know why and uh we all went why he was like how many have you have a satellite radio on you nobody held up their hand 'cause no one carried a satellite radio with them than it was like how many of you have a phone on you\nKnow we all have phones and he was like ... thing that phone of yours you won't believe the technological advances that are going to be made on that phone in the next couple of years there's like two thousand [noise]\nMan is was like I hadn't been in radio that long maybe two thousand nine two thousand eight before before the all those ads were like oh just use my phone for texting in and making phone calls\nOh you don't have abs no I don't need up so just like the techs make phone calls get with the times man\nIt was right around the time people running that those sorts of ads so people would understand that having a smartphone would pay off I by the way I was a tremendous hold out when it came to smart phones out of all my friends out of all my co workers out of everybody I knew I was the last person to get a smartphone just because I didn't like the level of access of gay people too many\nPeople would be like saying I send you an email okay I'm Out right but you get the emails no no I'm Out I'll I'll get to it when I get home and\nOpen up my computer while I have to be able to get you this information is really important call me but I Want to call you I don't want to bother you while the email bothered me just as much if it's handing me a piece of responsibility I'm not interested in on the weekend\n[noise] that was my sort of stance against the smartphone\n[noise] but this is right around that time this was right around that time when smartphones were just about to take off [noise] it was before your grandmother had won your kid probably wanted one and you were just sort of trying to figure out how it all worked\n[noise] but\nThey said that phone that phone of yours that's what's going to kill radio for not careful\nAnd uh we don't want oh gosh got to be careful of the phone as it turns out you just listen to the radio on your phone now by phone is actually become our friend in a paradoxical twist of fate that that particular person did not see comet [noise] but yeah\nRio's bigger than ever before\nAnd besides the fact besides the fact that it feels good to be on tough for the first time since two thousand eight the U. S. grabbed the number one spot in the world Economic Forum global competitiveness index\nBesides that I had to record a commercial talking about I heart radio and how we reached nine out of ten Americans every single day and why that was useful to you and like I said in the past in the past it was all to do is\nWe can reach your target consumer we can help you grow your business we can help you cultivate an audience for your brand we can help you build your brand through all these different things the personalities through social media through all these different facets that\nAre part of radio in this day and age [noise] but\nAs I was opening up the program that gives me to copy coffee to read for this particular spot I was like oh that's a new one [noise] wow that's a new one and you know what that's really excellent news\nFor America that's great [noise]\nI don't care who voted for that's awesome [noise] what was this piece of news [noise]\nFascinating stuff and we'll get into it next is good for you it's good for me it's good for all of us [noise]\nOr transaction with rex you get a full service team back by technology they don't market homes to wait traditional agents do rex uses a data driven process to attract hundreds of qualified buyers directly to your home the moment it goes on the market\nAnd rex charges only two percent total not those six percent commission your local broker expects to get started called a three three rex home eight three three rex home bats a three three R.

S. grab the number one spot and the world Economic Forum global competitiveness competitiveness index which means basically ain't nobody beaten America that was the way it was very very very long time and there's people that would have argued even during the great economic downturn that no one was beating America\nBut that was a it was a perspective it was challenging to indulge\nAnd you know what we're back up in the game [noise]\nThere's a global competitive index uses like I think about a hundred different indicators to rank the top one hundred and forty different economies\nBelow us countries like Singapore Germany\nSwitzerland Japan the Netherlands Hong Kong the u._k. Sweden Denmark\nSo they have it\nNumber one usa usa and the other thing like I was saying before is I had to I had to record a commercial for I heart radio\nThe company that I work for the other day and we do this from time to time and I guess what is it is this is this what you'd call because it wasn't like hey listen to us or hey go by this thing it it sort of I guess what we do to reach out to advertise advertisers we\nLet people know that I guess what we reached nine out of ten Americans every single week which we do we can help you grow your brand your\nBusiness we can help you reach your target consumer we can help you advocate to them we can do all these things that can help you build your business that are good for business that are good for your business that was the general thrust of all these commercials that I had\nTo record in the past but when I open up my a website my little Web portal that contained all my copy and I'm going to get in trouble for talking about this because it is sort of inside baseball but you know what it is good news and I'm stoked to share with you [noise] when I opened up my little portal and got my new bit of copy\nWhere um I find out what it is I'm going to be saying and as commercial I was pretty freaking stove because it was something along the lines of hey unemployment is at the lowest it's been in a very very long time that means\nIf someone wants to work there probably working so if you're looking for a new and better employee\nIf you're looking for a new and better employee for your business if you try and grow your business you're gonna have to be competitive you're going to have to really kind of court these folks are going to have to figure out a way to reach these folks because\n[noise]\n\n\nHere you know

guys in radio and [noise]\nThey do on the radio\nOr you\nWant to those people that gets all excited when Halloween rolls around even as an adult maybe if I had kids maybe if I had kids I mean the into it I I don't know I I've always been\nA skilled resentful of the whole concept of Halloween why well\nWhen I was a kid and you and I have talked about this in the past but when I was a kid I moved from America to England\nMy dad who is English got a job in England and my parents had lived in Brussels before and they decided after having lived in New York where they're from and I'm from originally that it would be a nifty idea to get back to Europe\nEspecially with a young child they thought hey let this kid see a little bit more of the world I was devastated because well my father's job moved around a lot I think it was that like my fifth school that year\nAnd and\nI just sort of kind of settled down vaguely I just maybe kind of sort of made some friends\n[noise] and\nI was just kind of sort of starting to assimilate a little bit and then my parents dropped a bombshell we're moving to England oh man oh no\nI won't have any friends or will you still have one friend my most important friend my best friend at least all be able to bring my dog with me\nYeah about that\nAre going to have to leave and I have to leave your dog here we're going to have to we will for and I was his name we're gonna have to leave him here because well he\n... it is it like it's still upsets me thinking about this still obsessed me talking about this because I Love this dog more than anything my first dog he's a rescue he was a rescue we got at the local dog rescue dog pound I I don't remember I was so young at the time but we went\nAnd his name [noise] did you ever have is when you were a kid you ever sort of like in fantasy land\nCome up with names for things I I don't know where the name will for came from but I kept telling my parents over and over again I wanted a dog and I wanted a dog to be called will for\n[noise] and they're like okay we got this dog beautiful dog beautiful dog cross between a golden retriever a golden lab I think it was and great Pyrenees mountain dog\nIt was a Ninety pound puppy and its name was Caesar and my dad was like you know and you know a dog collar Sid Caesar on it but to me he looks a lot more like a will for you know you can call him well for if you want so he became well for he was my best friend oh my\nGosh I was inseparable we would go places but he was huge use like a Ninety pound dogs so he would he would drag me places like I feel like I'm taking the dog for a walk now and uh he would immediately yanked me off my feet as he chased a cat or something like that\nOr was it was glorious Lee fun and also little terrifying as well\nMy kid sister who is really out of the time a will for would walk through the kitchen wagging his tail and like center flying across the room it was a huge puppy is the greatest use the absolute greatest and he man he loved me like I said I've been to a lot of schools and not a lot of time\nAnd one\nOf the schools one of the schools that I went to when I first got well for I'd take a school bus that was a traditional thing and every single day will for would break free of my mom as we were [laughter]\nAs she was a leading me to the school bus and he would get on the school bus and the kids would freak out they'd be laughing and he would he try and go with me to school every single day\nAnd I don't know if you know much about great Pyrenees but if you have a great Pyrenees do you have to have a fence and it has to be a high wind because great Pyrenees are the ultimate protectors\nThey are fed to oh my gosh they're amazing beautiful incredible dogs they're great with kids they're great with other pets if you live in a place with animals like a farm or something like that it is their instinct to protect them through these massive gentle giants\nI fostered a great Pyrenees puppy a couple of great Pyrenees puppies before they were adopted once and I saw the instinct at work because there are very very young but whenever someone came to the door these little puppies would place themselves between me and whoever was at the door\nNot an aggressive way of being defensive but speak softly and carry a big stick way of being defensive great Pyrenees or just awesome because well they are that they're gentle giants but they're aware of their size and they know they're intimidating and so they're very protective but very quiet and laid back with it\nVery absolute greatest\nBut like I said my dog will for was fantastic and part of the reason why you got to have a big fence is because they're shepherding dogs they're hurting dogs it's their instinct to get out and parole the perimeter make sure everything's okay and they're protective rule they are trying to get out into the world and and make sure that nothing on toward has gone on\nAnd so my first school that I was at a time when I had well for he would jump onto the school bus with me try and come with me wherever\nI went [noise] then transfer to the school that was literally next door to my house I Walk to school every single day and I'll never forget [noise]\nI'll never forget the first time it happened and then it happened several other times where people when there's a dog out on a playground or the dog out on the playground I was like there was a dog got on a playground I when I looked on as like us that's that's my dog\nHe scaled the five foot high fence that we had and tracked me to my school and\nCame up to the window and I remember saying to my teacher that's my dog can if we take them home and I know your mom has to come and pick him up\nAnd so she did\nBut when I say we were inseparable best friends we were inseparable best friends\nWas a greatest [noise]\nBut my parents were there looking at me going yeah here's the thing if you take a dog to England [noise] they've got to stay in quarantine a very small space for a very long time I think it was like six months nine months the better part of the year that a dog had to stay in quarantine\n[noise] so I had to leave my dog behind and he\nWas given to my aunt and uncle who are going to look after him but he proved to be too much of a handful apparently he kinda he kinda freaked out when he was separated from me he had some separation anxiety he was\nHe was upset he would chew the furniture he he missed his family\nAnd so [noise]\nWe'll for actually is very intelligent and he became a seeing eye dog he was donated I suppose um to an organization that trains seeing eye dogs and they trained them up and well ... and I thought", "city": "Houston"}
