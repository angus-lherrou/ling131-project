Sweden Denmark\nSo they have it\nWe're number one usa usa and the other thing like I was saying before is I had to I had to record a commercial for I heart radio or a company that I work for the other day and we do this from time to time and I guess\nWhat is it is this is this what you'd call\nBecause it wasn't like hey listen to us or hey go by this thing it it sort of I guess what we do to reach out to advertise advertisers we let people know that I guess what we reached nine out of ten Americans every single week which we do\nWe can help you grow your brand your business we can help you reach your target consumer we can help you advocate to them we can do all these things that can help you build your business that are good for business that are good for your business\nKim Jong is in the ... of this world would love to see us argue they would love\nTo see the seeds of discontent continue to be shown in America they would love to be able to see us not enjoy the good when it's right there in front of us so I'm telling ya I don't know how you feel about your day to day existence or how things are going but\nYou are alive at ... in many ways is a terrifying time but there's also many re many many reasons at the moment feel optimistic you my friend have all kinds of reasons to feel good don't deny yourself that [noise]\nMoney [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nSo many of you who've just raised awareness so that veterans with ... they have a place to do a number to call and that number is eight seven seven seven one seven P.

those people that gets all excited when Halloween rolls around even as an adult maybe if I had kids maybe if I'd kids I'm the into it I I don't know I I've always been\nA skilled resentful of the whole concept of Halloween why well when I was a kid and you and I have talked about this in the past but when I was a kid I moved from America to England\nMy dad who is English got a job in England and my parents lived in Brussels before and they decided after having lived in New York where they're from and I'm from originally that it would be\nA nifty idea to get back to Europe especially with a young child they thought hey let's his kids see a little bit more of the world\nI was devastated because well my father's job moved around a lot I think it was that like my fifth school that year and and I just sort of kind of settled down vaguely I just maybe kind of sort of made some friends\nAnd\nI was just kind of sort of starting to assimilate a little bit\nAnd then\nMy parents dropped a bombshell we're moving in England oh man oh no I won't have any friends or will you still have one friend my most important friend my best friend at least all be able to bring my dog with me\nYeah about that\nAre going to have to leave and I have to leave your dog here we're going to have to leave will for a his name I have to leave him here because well he ... or is it like it's still upsets me thinking about this still obsessed me talking about this because I Love this dog more than anything my first dog\nHe's a rescue he was a rescue we got at the local dog rescue dog pound I I don't remember I was so young at the time but we went and\nHis name [noise] did you ever have is when you were a kid you ever sort of like in\nFantasy land come up with names for things I don't know where the name will for came from but I kept telling my parents over and over again I wanted a dog and I wanted a dog to be called will for [noise]\nAnd they're like okay we got this dog beautiful dog beautiful dog cross between a golden retriever a golden lab I think it was a great Pyrenees mountain dog it was a Ninety pound\nPuppy and its name was Caesar and my dad was like you know you know a dog collar Sid Caesar on it but to me he looks a lot more like a will for you know you can call him well for if you want so he became well for he was my best friend oh my gosh I was inseparable\nWe would go places but he was huge it was like a Ninety pound dogs so he would he would drag me places like I'd go like I'm taking the dog for a walk now and uh he would immediately yanked me off my feet as he chased a cat\nOr something like that or was it was glorious Lee fun and also little terrifying as well my kid sister who is really all the time\nA will for would walk through the kitchen wagging his tail and like center flying across the room it was a huge puppy is the greatest use the absolute greatest and he man he loved me like I said I've been to a lot of schools and not a lot of time\nAnd one\nOf the schools one of the schools that I went to when I first got well for I'd take a school bus that was a traditional thing and every single day will for would break free of my mom as we were [laughter] [laughter] as she was a leading me to a school bus\nAnd he would get on the school bus and the kids would freak out they'd be laughing and he would he try and go with me to school every single day and I don't know if you know much about great Pyrenees but if you have a great Pyrenees do you have to have a fence and it has to be a high wind because great Pyrenees are the\nUltimate protectors they are fed to oh my gosh they're amazing beautiful incredible dogs they're great with kids they're great with other pets if you live in a place with animals like a farm or something like that it is their instinct to protect them\nThrough these massive gentle giants I fostered\nA great Pyrenees puppy a couple of great Pyrenees puppies before they were adopted once and I saw the instinct at work because they are very very young but whenever someone came to the door these little puppies would place themselves between me and whoever was out the door\nNot aggressive way of being defensive but to speak softly and carry a big stick way of being defensive great Pyrenees or just awesome because well they are that they're gentle giants but they're aware of their size and they know they're intimidating and so they're very protective but very quiet and laid back with it\nVery absolute greatest\nBut like I said my dog will for was fantastic and part of the reason why you got to have a big fence is because they're shepherding dogs they're hurting dogs it's their instinct to get out and parole the perimeter make sure everything's okay and they're protective role they are trying to get out into the world and make sure that nothing on toward is going on\nAnd so my first school that I was at a when I had well for he would jump onto the school bus with me try and come with me wherever I went\n[noise] then I transferred to the school that was literally next door to my house I Walk to school every single day and I'll never forget [noise]\nI'll never forget the first time it happened it happened several other times where people want their the dog out on a playground or the dog out on the playground I was like there is a dog got on a playground I when I looked on as us\nThat's that's my dog he scaled the five foot high fence a we had and tracked me to my school and came up to the window\nAnd I remember saying to my teacher that's my dog and if we take them home and like know your mom has to come and pick him up\nAnd so she did\nBut when I say we were inseparable best friends we were inseparable best friends\nWas the greatest [noise]\nBut my parents were there looking at me going yeah here's the thing if you take your dog to England [noise]\nThey've got to stay in quarantine at a very small space for a very long time I think it was like six months nine months the better part of the year that a dog had to stay in quarantine [noise] so\nI had to leave my dog behind\nAnd he was given to my aunt and uncle who are going to look after him but he proved to be too much of a handful apparently he kinda he kinda freaked out when he was separated from me he had some separation anxiety he was he was upset he would chew the furniture he he missed his family\nAnd so [noise]\nWe'll for actually is very intelligent and he became a seeing eye dog\nHe was donated I suppose um to an organization that trains seeing eye dogs and they train them up and well ... and I thought when when I was told is that he was becoming a seeing eye dog I was like yeah sure right you just gave 'em up\n[noise] but years later years and years later\nI talk to my aunt about it and she's like oh no no we did we were just telling you that because you're a kid he was a seeing eye dog I got report somewhere about his progress and he was a great seeing eye dog\nNow it doesn't make it any easier on six seven year old me that I had to leave my dog behind but it was good uh this beloved dog who just wanted to be family and help and protect and serve wound up doing exactly that but I was bomb the hell out that I had to leave my dog and I remember we moved in September", "station": "KPRC", "city": "Houston"}
