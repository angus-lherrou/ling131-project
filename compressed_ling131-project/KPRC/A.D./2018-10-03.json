and you know what we did for the most part we wound up talking about baseball here's the thing though if you're like me if you're a master baseball fan but I Will let me ask you this what would you rather talk about baseball\nOr politicians [laughter] yeah I Know me too that's where you and I was saying that if you're not a baseball fan you'll forgive us this indulgence but we are going somewhere with this\nAnd that is in a weird twist of fate we seem to have conflated fandom with our political process in the United states of\nAmerica and it's damaged our patriotism only because well look\nAs we were saying earlier Mark Twain said something to the fact of patriotism is supporting your country all the time and your government when they deserve it\nWhere your politicians when they deserve it something to that effect and we seem to a flip that time honored expression on its head\nAnd look you know of course that this whole time and we haven't been talking about baseball we've been talking about cabinet and the situation around him\nThe patriotism is about supporting your country wanting what's best for your country a hundred percent of the time\n\nAnd we seem on both sides and looking at everyone in the situation we seem only too happy to\nHear the country further and further apart to widen the gap of understanding to widen the divide\n[noise] [noise] by pledging undying allegiance to politicians and it's the weirdest thing because\nUnlike these baseball players we do pay their salaries they shouldn't be accountable to us\nAnd\nThis is a man Kavanaugh's a man who's been accused of some monument to lead terrible things\nHe's a man who's worked hard\nFor many many years to become the man he is he's a man who is on everything he possibly could to put himself in a position where he might wind wind up as part of the Supreme Court the highest court in the land the highest court on the face of the freaking planet in many ways\nAnd\nPeople don't seem to be all that interested\nIn the truth people seem to be tremendously interested in winning this could be a good man's life that we're willing to destroy\nBecause the system\nDoesn't afford him the protection that anyone else would get in this situation has life being torn apart\nNow that maybe it's a horrible awful but I'm going to remove my thoughts and opinions and conjecture from this maybe it's a horrible awful tear terrible agree just person that has done all these things let's assume for a second he's done everything that he has been accused of\n[noise] let's assume that for a second\nWe'd have to be sure wouldn't we I mean these are horrible things\nIn\nThe minds of so many Kavanaugh is guilty of things that will destroy his life and his family's life forever before before\nAny kind of real results for any kind of real investigation of come back now will this investigation turn up anything conclusive I don't know I don't think so but it's still vulture like freezing feeding frenzy with which this country\nIs willing to judge this man whose life could be ruined by these proceedings\nThat has me a little gas and on the flipside of that this is a man who's been accused of some very serious things and there's so many people who are willing to go down this is nonsense looked at him\nWas no way he could have done these things we want the political advantage man if we get this guy and we get him in for life\nAgain\nThis is a man who is on the verge of being appointed for the rest of his days on this planet to a position of tremendous power and the highest court in the world\n\nHis character or lack there of will have a profound impact on the life of every single American and for that reason\nFor that reason if there is concern that maybe maybe this guy could have done some of this stuff but she has been accused of doing\n\nDo we not want to be thorough out of respect for our country out of respect for our fellow Americans out of respect for the flag and all that stands for isn't it incredibly unpatriotic to\nWant to do a rush job on something like this\nBecause it's going to give you an upper hand in some situations with regard to your political and sociological beliefs is it the right thing to do to put a guy in immediately when there's been these questions raised about who he is\nOr is it better to examine the situation and know that you can get your guy in to a place where he can advocate for your values your standards of human decency", "city": "Houston"}
