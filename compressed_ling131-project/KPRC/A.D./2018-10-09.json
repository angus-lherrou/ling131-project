[laughter] there's some stations on I'm On that are so right leaning that initially um approach to a little bit aside from people thinking economy red coat from England\nBut eventually become sort of find common ground get on the same page have great conversations we all move forward together\nNot the most money gig in radio because well the money is made in division by taking aside and screaming at other people and telling them they're wrong and telling a chorus of people to believe whether you believe believe you and believe the same things as you that they're right about everything that's where the cash is [laughter]\nThis radio show will probably never afford me an opportunity to drive that nice of a car but it affords me an opportunity to move the ball of humanity further down the field so I guess that there's some people to get it some people to come around and some people that have open their ears and their minds a little bit\nIf only to the idea of having a conversation with someone but things differently than you potentially being a learning experience and that's great and then there's other people that resists no no no no no I'm with you on this I'm not really on that\nAnd nothing you say is going to make me think that anybody that voted differently than me could possibly be a good person\nDemocrats think the thinking that all Republicans all Trump voters all people that\nAre sort of even vaguely in favor of the idea of Kevin are being where he is\nAre evil you just want to watch the world burn [noise] and then well folks on the right thinking that anybody who's on the left\nAnybody that voted for Hillary or wanted to vote for Bernie well they just want to come to their home they want to take their guns they want to take the food out of their mounts shirt off their backs and they want to give it to people that have never worked a day of where it never works hard day at work in their life and there's people that believe that\nAnd so for those folks those folks that are determined to stay in their corner those folks that are determined to hate rather than less than those folks that are determined that anybody devoted differently than that must be evil incarnate and hate America\n[noise] well I thought I come at this a little bit of a different way today [noise] I thought I Would\nCome at it from a position of\nDivision that exists in this country right now which is widespread\nAnd\nObvious and difficult to deal with [noise] is genuinely hurting America [noise]\nAnd allowing us to be played by other nations how do I notice I noticed the star\nWars [noise] yeah I Do [noise] what his Star Wars have to do with other nations wanting us to argue with each other we're going to do next [noise]\nSix [noise]\n\nThe ... down there in the middle [noise] on the radio on Twitter as deep as [noise]\nOf this is how Star Wars proves that the division in this country does not service\nWhatsoever and in fact that it's just something that\nHas playing the hands of people that would like to get one up on us [noise] different nations that have been locked\nIn internal power struggle with the United states of America Star Wars now what are we talking about there was an interesting article on this on the verge I think it was but I was talking to my ... I was talking to my brother in law\nAbout this this past weekend just go by [noise] brother in law and sister\nAnd a little baby Eli my new and perfect nice now month and a half old came to visit so I could spend some quality time with my new imperfect nice we had a great old time but uh my brother in law is a bit of a bit of a marketing mocking the world of\nNerdy stuff he's an editor Superman comic books and well\nAs is the case with most of these things he tends to get the dirt on it before folks like the verge write articles but we were talking about the division in America and how\nHow these things that are just meant to be fun for all of us turned into a deeply politicized on fun issue left right and center and how it seems so senseless and how it seems so pointless and how does this free can happen\nEverything from the weather to our favorite movies like yeah sure I'm not going to go\nWatch that movie oh football you know obviously it's football but the weather movies football all these things now are about taking sides and having a political agenda and it just shows you that the division in this country is absolutely insane infecting every last area of our life and it doesn't service whatsoever\nAnd we noticed because well look when Star Wars the last jet I made it into the theater there were people that were very angry about it there was an immediate backlash lot of people felt the film was to progressive\nAnd there is this idea that really new Star Wars movie was an exercise in telling the politically correct line\nPeople of different ethnicities and genders and her relic rules that hadn't existed in the past and a lot of people thought this was virtue signaling and pandering and like I said there was this immediate backlash\nNow [laughter]\nYou look at your fellow American is anything less than your fellow American who\nDeserves as your fellow American your respect\n[laughter] you're losing your being played there being played by Russian Twitter about of all things\nSee what I bring this up we've\nTalked over and over again about\n\nUnity in this country and how valuable it is and\nYou know I think a lot of people like the idea of like oh unity is valuable but it's it's more difficult to put into practice All right what about this\n\nDivision in America so valuable to Russians and whoever the hell else it is that they're willing to dedicate Twitter box to getting us to fight over freaking Star Wars that's how valuable it is to them that's how valuable it is to them to have us at each other's throats while they go about doing what they're doing\nSo if you can't get together\nOn the same page with the idea that be nice to each other because your ball on the same team\nIs a good idea [noise] get together on the same page [noise] because every single time you don't [noise] you are letting someone else when [noise]\nEvery single time you can't get on the same page with your fellow American you are being played by Russian Twitter boss over Star Wars\nOr something pretty close are very right get along [laughter] when it\nDon't buy things from telemarketers\nDon't switch credit cards to a low introductory rate is going to spike in a couple of months I don't want gimmicks games\nAnd if you're the same way try eagle energy simple fixed rates no gimmicks no surprises on your bill great customer service over Ninety percent retention for a reason\nEight seven seven Ninety three eagle eight seven seven Ninety three eagle you see the license number one there was there was like for [noise] you know\nGet get on the news you know you guys in radio and then\nThey do on the radio\nAd on arguing about politics\nIs entirely new level Russian boss interfered in the discourse about Star Wars the last year I knowing that sowing the seeds of division\nAmong Star Wars fans would just be yet another thing that we would find ourselves fighting about\nPeople saying that\nThe star wars franchise was being torn down in an effort to be politically correct Luke Skywalker being painted as a ... old idiot being replaced by a female as a signal of the patriarchy being torn down old ways being a thing of the past new ways involving heroes of different ethnicities engenders\nBeing the way forward Star Wars and you know\nRussia sees it as incredibly valuable to have us as Americans at each other's throats so they fanned the flames\n[laughter] so much of the dissent on line about SARS last year I came from Russian Twitter bots because it's valuable valuable to have those divided the old expression divide and conquer exists and it exist for a reason\nSo interesting times we live in where Russian Twitter box helps ... and\nGet the upper hand by getting us to fight about Star Wars and\nIt's an interesting one because we have arrived at a period I guess because enough Russian Twitter buses succeeded in sowing the seeds of dissent we have ... we have arrived at a period in our history where\nWell this lonely sensible position of\n[noise] I wouldn't call neutral but this lonely sensible position of accepting other people that think different things in you that we believe in on this\nShow [noise] well that's not\nThat's not the way forward any more from a business or entertainment standpoint it used to be it used to be you remain on the sidelines or used to be you remain neutral used to be that you didn't want to take a side because you risk alienated alienating half the people that\nWere your fan if you were in the entertainment or sports business\nNow it's the opposite look you and I talked about this in the past when Nike got in on the\n... thing [noise] it was a calculated move it was a calculated move it was an assessment of risk\nAnd Nike decided it was moving forward more risky to not pick a side then to alienate potentially exactly one half of the sneaker buying public\nNike our company that are about making money there's plenty of ways to do good in the world there's plenty of ways to\nFight for equality and justice in a world without choosing to go into business with a polarizing figure like con Capra Nick but Nike felt after having I'm short run all manner\nOf cost benefit analyses because a company like this doesn't make a decision like that without doing a ton of research that it was more beneficial to them\nAnd remember these folks are not necessarily folks that occupy any of the moral high ground given their practices of ah getting a very young children to sell ... so switches onto those Nike's of yours for deep deep discounts and third world countries not a\n[noise] they decided it was worth more to them to pick a side\n[noise] and it's interesting because in the past remaining\nNeutral not taking a side would have been the way that you respect the almighty dollar but the Russian bouts of down their work and in matters if you pick a side or not [noise] you know the Russian Boston just fanning a flame as well\n\nWe don't have this to look back on in our lifetime but you go a little further back you'll see that times in history where we were politically as divided as we are now\nTend to have come out after a financial downturn\nExtreme right extreme left\nThis tends to happen after the economy goes in the toilet\n\nAnd we are obviously coming off the heels of the biggest recession since the great depression the subprime mortgage crisis some of these sort of take out the better part of a decade to get back on our feet after a lot of people still aren't on their feet and well these times the people looking around for someone to blame\nAnd historically speaking even though it has to have in our lifetime you go back further you will see the most divided America or any other country for that matter has been\n\nThe most divided country's ever get our after times of economic downturn where people are looking around going I lost my house I lost my car last every penny I had in the bank I lost my business I lost everything I had everything's gone to hell my wife left me my husband left me\nOr whatever the case may be everything's horrible now it was great before I'm looking around for someone to blame must be the people voting differently than me this level of division that we're experiencing is just a little bit of history repeating\nAnd another fantastic example of someone deciding they're not going to be on the sidelines anymore is Taylor Swift yeah Taylor Swift making political news to sort of\n[noise] did Taylor Swift easily just lose half of our audience by going political Taylor Swift did quite a\nQuite an admirable job of being one of the few celebrities to stay the hell out of politics\nUntil last night when she jumped into the U.S Senate and house races in Tennessee where she's from [noise] she\nPosted a message on Instagram endorsing the Democrat and the Senate race\nGuy called Phil Bredesen over Republican representative Marsha Blackburn\nShe said quote as much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office I cannot support Marsha Blackburn her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me\nIt's interesting\nShe's a picking party politics over identity politics but\nWhatever the case may be you know this is probably how she feels she's got every right to feel however she wants to feel you know what I actually do kind of admire I Do kind of admire people being willing to switch sides or something like this I don't know what her voting record is though with regard to being a Republican or Democrat\nI don't know if she's always gone I'm going to go over the chick 'cause I like to vote for women and that you know a knee jerk\nReaction to vote for someone because of their gender or their color skin or their race or their religion or any of the above is to me just as silly as voting for someone because of the Republican or Democrat", "station": "KPRC", "city": "Houston"}
