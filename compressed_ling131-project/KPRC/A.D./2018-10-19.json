reach nine out of ten Americans will I hurt radio does that we can help you do that\nIt costs to find out how is basically saying hey I Want to be a part of the show want to be on the radio well guess what radio reaches an awful lot of people therefore it would be who you to advertise with us now\nThe reason I bring this up is because I had to record I had to record something very interesting was a very interesting piece of data and at the other day\nWhen it was sort of talking about people talking to businesses about why they would want to advertise with us now generally speaking in the past it's been like we can help grow your business we can help you reach your target consumer all of which probably was completely and totally true radios and you know radio is a really weird thing\nA lot of the time when people go what are you doing on the radio\nRadio still exists\nI Know I'm just a surprise is your foot get this radio this archaic piece of technology that is really change very little since the days before TV when the families together on the wireless radio\nIs reaching more people than it ever has everybody thought that it would go the way the do do everybody thought that satellite radio would and radio it it did not everybody thought that age the radio would and traditional broadcast radio\nDrew remember that there are secret stations broadcasting next station to find out what Tom ... radio [laughter]\nI mean a chi radios great I'll listen to it all the time but I think I'm kind of in the minority but it was one of those things was making people go oh traditional radios gone away\nAnd then cell phones came out\nI remember I remember like we were in radio we were scared of cell phones we were we were we were scared of cell phones I mean not me personally but overall we were kind of scared of cell phones I remember it was when satellite radio was becoming a really big thing and I was there I was a\n[noise] I had a a a toe in both pools I was like the morning guy on all nation on serious acts up at the time and\nI was also on a bunch of FM stations and I remember going to this meeting once and having some big money might come in and go more not afraid of satellite radio\nWant to know why and uh we all went why he was like how many have you have a satellite radio on you nobody held up their hand because no one carried a satellite radio with them than it was like how many of you have a phone on you know we all have\nPhones and he was like that thing that phone of yours you won't believe the technological advances that are going to be made on that phone and the next couple of years there's like two thousand [noise] man is was like [noise] I haven't been in radio that long maybe two thousand nine two thousand eight before before ... over the all\nThose ads were like oh just use my phone for texting in and making phone calls oh you don't have abs no I don't need up so just like to ... get with the times man\nIt was right around the time people running that those sorts of ads so people would understand that having a smartphone would pay off by the way I was a tremendous hold out when it came to smart phones out of all my friends out of all my co workers out of everybody I knew I was the last person to get a smartphone\nJust because I didn't like the level of access of gay people to me people would be like saying I send you an email okay I'm Out\nRight but you get the emails no no I'm Out I'll I'll get to it when I get home and open up my computer while I I have to be able to get you this information is really important call me but I Want to call you I don't want to bother you while the email bothers me just as much if it's handing me a piece of responsibility I'm not interested in on the weekend [noise]\nAnd that was my sort of stance against the smartphone\n[noise] but this is right around that time this was right around that time when smartphones were just about to take off [noise] it was before your grandmother had won your kid probably wanted one and you were just sort of trying to figure out how it all worked\n[noise]\nBut they said that phone that phone of yours that's what's going to kill radio for not careful and uh we don't want oh gosh got to be careful of the phone as it turns out you just listen to the radio on your phone now by phone has actually become our friend and a paradoxical twist of fate that that particular person did not see comet\n[noise] but yeah Rio's bigger than ever before and\nBesides the fact besides the fact that it feels good to be on tough for the first time since two thousand eight the U. S. grabbed the number one spot in the world Economic Forum is global competitiveness index\nBesides that I had to record a commercial talking about I heart radio and how we reached nine out of ten Americans every single day and why that was useful to you and like I said in the past in the past it was all to do is\nWe can reach your target consumer we can help you grow your business we can help you cultivate an audience for your\nBrand we can help you build your brand through all these different things to personalities through social media through all these different facets that\nAre part of radio in this day and age [noise] but\nAs I was opening up the program that gives me to copy coffee to read for this particular spot I was like oh that's a new one [noise] wow that's a new one and you know what that's really excellent news\nFor America that's great [noise]\nI don't care who voted for that's awesome what was this piece of news [noise] fascinating stuff and we'll get into it next is good for you it's good for me it's good for all of us [noise]\nDo it and I'll tell you how much that costs commercial carpet cleaning is well not just your home air duct cleaning natural\nStone ceramic tile grout cleaning bathrooms kitchens all of it countertops oriental rug upholstery they can do it all hoops steam dot com to eight one eight to two oh five six one to eight one eight to two oh five six one I don't buy things from telemarketers\nDon't switch credit cards to a low introductory rate is going to fix\n\nThe left voice on the other [noise] being on the radio\nOn Twitter you can do [laughter]\nLike I said I Want you to breathe in ... [noise]\nLet go of negativity in partisanship [noise] and rejoicing good news for America feels good to be back on topic for the\nFirst time since two thousand eight the U. S. grab the number one spot and the world Economic Forum global competitiveness competitiveness\nIndex which means basically ain't nobody beat in America that was the way it was very very very long time and there's people that would have argued even during the great economic downturn that no one was beating America but that was a I was a\nPerspective it was challenging to indulge\nAnd you know what we're back up in the game\n[noise] there's a global competitive index uses like I think about a hundred different indicators to rank the top one hundred and forty different economies below us countries like Singapore Germany Switzerland Japan the Netherlands Hong Kong the u._k. Sweden Denmark\nSo they have it\nWe're number one usa usa and the other thing like I was saying before is I had to I had to record a commercial for I heart radio comedy that I work for the other day and we do this from time to time and I guess what is it is this is just what you'd call\nIt wasn't like hey listen to us or hey go by this thing it it sort of I guess what we do to reach out to advertise advertisers we let people know that I guess what we reached nine out of ten Americans every single week which we do we can help you grow your brand your business we can help you reach your target consumer we can help you advocate to them we can do all these things\nEveryone that would seek to dethrone America as one of the greatest places to live and work which let's be real here it still is\nWould be stoked to see us at each other's throats and not enjoying this our competition would be stoked to see us at each other's throats and not enjoying this our enemies would be stoked as he is at each other's throats and not enjoying this\nKim Jong is in the ... of this world would love to see us argue they would love to see the seeds of discontent\nContinue to be shown in America they would love to be able to see is not enjoy\nThe good when it's right there in front of us so I'm telling you I don't know how you feel about your day to day existence or how things are going but\nYou are alive at ... in many ways is a terrifying time but there's also many re many many reasons at the moment feel optimistic you my friend have all kinds of reasons and feel good don't deny yourself that [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] yeah you know you guys in radio and then\nThey do on the radio\nAnd on right now do you\nWant to those people that gets all excited when Halloween rolls around even as an adult maybe if I had kids maybe if I had kids I feed into it I I don't know I I've always\nBeen a skilled resentful of the whole concept of Halloween\nI well when I was a kid and you and I've talked about this in the past but when I was a kid I moved from America to England my dad who is English got a job in England and\nMy parents lived in Brussels before and they decided after having lived in New York where they're from and I'm from originally that it would be an if the idea to get back to Europe especially with a young child they thought hey look this kid see a little bit more of the world\nI was devastated because well my father's job moved around a lot I think it was like my fifth school that year\nAnd and\nI just sort of kind of settled down vaguely I just maybe kind of sort of made some friends [noise]\nAnd I was just kind of sort of starting to assimilate a little bit and then my parents dropped a bombshell we're moving in England oh man oh no\nI won't have any friends or will you still have one friend my most important friend my best friend at least all be able to bring my dog with me yeah\nAbout that [noise] we're gonna have to leave\nLeave your dog here we're going to have to leave will for his name I have to leave him here because well he ... is it like it's still upsets me thinking about this still obsessed me talking about this because I Love this dog more than anything my first dog\nHe's a rescue he was a rescue we got at the local dog rescue dog pound I I don't remember I was so young at the time but we went\nAnd his name did you ever have this when you were a kid you ever sort of like in fantasy land come up with names for things I I don't know where the name will for came from but I kept telling my parents over and over again I wanted a dog and I wanted a dog to be called will for [noise]\nAnd they're like okay we got this dog beautiful dog beautiful dog cross between a golden retriever a golden lab I think it was a great Pyrenees mountain dog\nIt was a Ninety pound puppy and its name was Caesar and my dad was like you know and you know [noise] that dog well his collar Sid Caesar on it but to me he looks a lot more like a will\nFor you know you can call him well for if you want so he became well for he was my best friend oh my gosh I was inseparable\nWe would go places but he was huge he was like a Ninety pound dogs so he would he would drag me places like I feel like I'm taking the dog for a walk now and uh he would immediately yanked me off my feet as he chased a cat or something like that or was it was glorious Lee fun and also little terrifying as well\nMy kid sister who's really are at the time a will for would walk through the kitchen wagging his tail and like center flying across the room it was a huge puppy is the greatest use the absolute greatest and he man he loved me like I said I've been to a lot of schools and not a lot of time\nAnd one\nOf the schools one of the schools that I went to when I first got well for I'd take a school bus that was a traditional thing and every single day will for would break free of my mom as we were [laughter]\n[laughter] as she was a leading me to the school bus and he would get on the school bus and the kids would freak out they'd be laughing and he would he try and go with me to school every single day\nAnd I don't know if you know much about great Pyrenees but if you have a great Pyrenees do you have to have a fence and it has to be a high wind because great Pyrenees\nAre the ultimate protectors they are fed to oh my\nGosh they're amazing beautiful incredible dogs they're great with kids they're great with other pets if you live in a place with animals like a farm or something like that it is their instinct to protect them through these massive gentle giants\nI fostered a great Pyrenees puppy a couple of great Pyrenees puppies before they were adopted once and I saw the instinct at work because there are very very young but whenever someone came to the door these little puppies would place themselves between me and whoever was at the door\nNot an aggressive way of being defensive but speak softly and carry a big stick way of being defensive great Pyrenees or just awesome because well they are that they're gentle giants but they're aware of their size and they know they're intimidating and so they're very protective but very quiet and laid back with it\nVery absolute greatest\nBut like I said my dog will for was fantastic and part of the reason why you got to have a big fence is because they're shepherding dogs they're hurting dogs it's their instinct to get out and parole the perimeter make sure everything's okay and they're protective role they are trying to get out into the world and and make sure that nothing on toward has gone on\nAnd so my first school that I was at a time when I had well for he would jump onto the school bus with me try and come with me wherever I went\n[noise] then\nI transferred to the school that was literally next door to my house I Walk to school every single day\nAnd I'll never forget [noise]\nI'll never forget the first time it happened to that have been several other times where people want their the dog out on a playground or the dog out on the playground I was like there was a dog got on a playground I when I looked on as like us that's that's my dog\nHe scaled the five foot high fence that we had and tracked me to my school and came up to the window and I remember saying to my teacher that's my dog can if we take them home and I know your mom has to come and pick him up and so she did\nBut when I say we were inseparable best friends we were inseparable best friends\nWas a greatest [noise]\nBut my parents were there looking at me going yeah here's the thing if you take your dog to England [noise] they've got to stay in quarantine a very small space for a very long time I think it was like six months nine months the better part of the year that a dog had to say in quarantine\n[noise] so I had to leave my dog behind and he\nWas given to my aunt and uncle who are going to look after him but he proved to be too much of a handful apparently he kinda he kinda freaked out when he was separated from me he had some separation anxiety he was he was upset he would chew the furniture he\nHe missed his family and so [noise]\nWe'll for actually is very intelligent and he became a seeing eye dog\nHe was donated I suppose um to an organization that trains seeing eye dogs and they train them up and well ... and I thought when I was told is that he was becoming a seeing eye dog I was like yeah sure right use gave him up\n[noise] but years later years and years later\nI talk to my aunt about it and she's like oh no no we we were just telling you that because you're a kid he was a seeing eye dog I'd got report somewhere about his progress and he was a great seeing eye dog\nNow it doesn't make it any easier on six seven year old me that I had to leave my dog behind but it was good uh this beloved dog who just wanted to be family and help protect and serve wound up doing exactly that but I was bomb the hell out that I had to leave my dog and I remember we moved\nIn September and I was like okay I've got no friends I mean this cold rainy country school is freaking hard English school was like way ahead of where my American school was and I was just expected to know things scholastic Lee I was lost I had no friends I had lost my dog and I was like at least at least\nAt least ... around the corner\nAt least Halloween where I get that glorious glorious sweet sweet free candy that can last may the rest of the year so I can drown my current sorrows and all sorts of sugary treats\nAt least that is coming up and then I found out [laughter] at that time in England [noise] Halloween was seen as sort of this sinister pagan thing", "city": "Houston"}
