I got some side I I really did what you want to know what made it go away or you want to know me to go away the ... over my white and this was the fact that I was from New York or sensibly the home of hip hop\nI was a person who grew up in England but originally I was from New York I had an American accent and a ... like I said whenever\nThey got used to me eventually but others club\nWhen I decided that I was going to battle rap I got some side I I got some incredulous looks I got some that really white kid is going to own ... let's see how this goes\nAnd are are like ... and coming up on this corner where you from I'm from New York oh oh snap oh damn oh an American emcee from New York the home of hip hop and all of a sudden because of my New York fruits\nOr what they perceived to be my New Yorker it's I was taken more seriously as rapper and to me the whole thing was\nUs coach silly it really was the idea that\nSomething like music\nCould be viewed as a divisive thing was strange to me the idea that the competitive nature of a rap battle [laughter]\nWas not for everyone was strange to me because I'd always viewed music as being a meritocracy if you're good great if you weren't does not matter where you come from who you are the color of your skin\nMusic like I said meritocracy\nI remember that was sort of the first time and and by the way I battled I think pretty much every Tuesday night for the better part of a year\nAnd a rarely rarely did I lose like I said\nI was quite rhythmically aware I was reasonably good and creative I mean today and I I still have a bit of a way with words that sort of how I make the vast majority of my living so apply that to the hip hop form and I did okay I did I I mean I don't think I was really up against anybody who is all that good\nBut nevertheless\nI dealt with all this sort of like side either this cultural Inc in credulity that I was a white rapper\nIn England\nWhich I thought was ridiculous and I thought it was equally as ridiculous that they took me seriously once they found out I was from New York are like oh east coast style and like your shirt whatever good you define it if that's whatever floats your boat great\nI didn't think that I should be given a hard time for being white nor did I think that I should be given a pass for being from the east coast of America\n\nBut I Do remember feeling kind of sad about the whole thing\nBecause I remember thinking hey no there's stuff should matter and be be music is one of those things that should bring people together things like music culture style\nFood [noise]\nThe should never be things that drive people apart [noise] they should be some of the glue that unifies us as a people [noise] and I was reminded of this when I found out what happened to the rock over a new movie role [noise]\nDid you see this [noise] like I said [noise]\nThese are things that should bring us together not the fire [noise] we'll get into that [noise]\nThe less\nMorning on the other in the middle [noise] being on the radio on Twitter you can do [laughter] [noise]\nYou know our culture [noise] food [noise] music [noise] days I think [noise]\nBut I think you'll agree are wonderful tools for bringing\nPeople together there's a reason why food brings people together there's a reason why people refer to breaking bred as a bonding experience food brings people together art brings people together you can be moved to tears by something\nA painting hanging on a wall a drawing a book something that bond is altogether and the realization of the human experience\nDegree bonded together by art you can find common ground in food and music in style\nMeetings an interesting one because music works on a level that we don't fully understand like scientists have for years and years attempted to understand the emotional physical and spiritual ways the music can affect us\nThe fact that music can move to tears affects the cords and notes arranged in a certain structure and a certain order have the ability to affect us in an emotional manner the way nothing else on this\nPlanet can is something that not even science has a real explanation for\nMe it's an incredible thing\nYou put some songs on doesn't matter who you are what color your skin is where you go to work how you were brought up what language you speak\nNone of these things matter you put a certain record on your blood is going to move and it's a beautiful bonding\nThing to be [noise] to be brought together\nCool and that's [noise] that's a damn shame because like I said our culture music style these are things that can be used as agents of change to bring people together [noise]\nI shouldn't be a divisive thing [noise] it was going to be\nPeople say you don't understand is appropriating a culture that is not your is it now\n[noise] explain to me where there's mouse on that because there's not [noise] and what we're seeing a version of this happened today with Iraq who was apparently not black enough to play a black man true story full story next [noise]\nGum and you can get the loan you need now regardless of your credit\nGo to forty

racist was going on with Iraq and his new movie have you heard about this well All right we'll get into the specifics of it ... a lot of people saying that the rock casting\nHimself in a specific iconic black role is a racist thing to do because he's not black enough or we'll get into it [laughter] shortly after Devin feels discuss discuss is the show on the History Channel that he finds to be the most racist of off\nRecently discovered what I Believe to be the most racist show on TV show called ancient aliens [noise]\nDon't know if there's some fans here but if you don't know ... ... is a show on the History Channel [noise]\nA name that which with each passing day means less and less [noise] and on this show they talked to scientists [noise]\nAnd the scientists discuss the or the ruins of ancient civilizations like pyramids and stuff and they explain how they were probably left there by aliens and I think this is deeply racist\nBecause the entire map of this show is just white people looking at the ruins of ancient non white civilization going you think brown people made that\nNo [noise]\nHave a much simpler explanation [noise] alien from outer space came down [noise] do you think the egos bastard stone masonry to that degree absolutely not no white alien from outer space [noise]\nSo like I said the rock is apparently not black enough to play the role that he casts himself in it takes\nAn awful lot for me as a political correctness has run amok\nBut [noise] and\nBy the way has someone who is not just white but incredibly incredibly white [laughter] I'm not necessarily a present in a position to speak about this but\nThis might be a case of political correctness run run amok the other day Dwayne the rock Johnson announced he was going to play John Henry are you familiar with the story of John Henry John Henry is a character from American folklore\nWho race against a steam engine to prove that he could dig a tunnel faster\nAnd then he died after winning the contest\nNow here's the thing this is a well it could be kind of interesting I think it's going to be for Netflix is not going to be a retelling of that John Henry story the rock said that his John Henry will quote lead an ensemble cast of the most popular folklore figures and legends from different cultures around the world\nThat's if it happens at all so do you remember when Iraq was on Saturday Night live and was talking about running for president he said hey ah nobody knows what if some it was really clever he said nobody knows\nI'll get the ethnic vote because every nobody knows what I Am at everybody thinks I'm just what the hell they are but were you aware of the rocks ethnicity\n[noise] the rock is half Simone and half black and apparently that's not black enough for some people for him to play John Henry the Internet freaking blew up over this news saying that there is absolutely inappropriate that he plays John Henry because his skin is to light\nAnd he hasn't done enough to identify as black yes the rock is not identified as black enough in his life not as an act for a meeting when the rock isn't on screen\nHe hasn't or he has an identified as black enough to justify going on a screen pretending to be a mythical character from folklore\n[noise]\nWho happens to be black even though he is half black now today [laughter] no word about this chaos yet from the rock or are we becoming too sensitive do you think\nLike I said our art culture music food these are things that have incredible unifying abilities\nYou people seem to be so hell bent on being divided at all costs that well\n[noise] [laughter] [laughter] this becomes a problem\nThe rock is half black not black enough scarlet Johanson\nWasn't allowed to play a transgender person so there's that and I wonder where the turning point came because Jay Leno Jerry ... played a transgender person in Dallas Buyers club I think was that the movie\nWon an Oscar lauded for his courage and bravery\nAnd when it was announced the scarlet Johanson was going to be pretending to be something that she's not which is you know basically what actors do\nMan oh man oh man did the Internet lighter up for it\nAnd initially initially her representatives kind of took the stance that hey if you want to talk to 'em someone about\nA person who is in transgender plenty transgender person to talk to Jared letter maybe you've done ... at his Oscar that he got for the role and he's willing to entertain this nonsense\nThat was the that that was the direction of the defense that scarlet Johanson representatives took when I initially this was leveled against her that she was stealing a job that should have gone to an actual transgender person\nWe talked about there's a lot on the show and I don't even remember the name of the movie but I don't think the movie is going to get made now because they lost their star and well to me that that was a desperately sad thing because well\nAnd again this is something that we dealt with an awful lot in the past but if you look at the suicide rate\nFor straight Americans\nIt almost doubles if you happen to be gay and then it doubled again to a level of I think around fifty percent if you happen to be transgender [noise] that's a horrible awful terrible thing\nAnd anything that leads to the normalization of people's experience to the point where they don't feel as apt to want to try and kill themselves is a good thing so transgender stories being told I think in pop culture is vitally important because it can it can make it", "city":
