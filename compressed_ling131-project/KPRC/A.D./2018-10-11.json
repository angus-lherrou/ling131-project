but however that's a new dynamic into this game um\nWith the fact that now they can detect F twenty twos and maybe thirty five without\nRadar so is the is the control of the middle east less about resources and more about testing military technology and abilities\nNo well I think the Russians technological development with the weapons system was only a icing on the cake for this and and I do believe they were actually looking when they moved and that's why they moved in was because they realize they had to\nGet you can't miss this opportunity and they've already seen multiple upgrades on their se twenty five is on the other fighters and weapons systems\nSo this is field testing a military hardware for a complex down the road\nRight and also providing you know combat training for soldiers that you can't really get like you can get some of the frame right now but it's a little different type of combat\nUh we haven't talked about the Saudis in a couple of weeks where do they stand under the uh the emerging reign of Solomon well\nOne of the big things that's happening is is a a journalist Cal ... who kind of disappeared and uh about four days ago the b._b._c. interviewed him and now he's still he disappeared now instant fearing that he was at the Saudi consulate in Turkey and got chopped up and sent home now I've got right\nUh because he was talking against ... agenda even though he was kind of pro ISIS pro jihad or\nBut he has been against some journalists Yes sir but I didn't mean to interrupt you know he was he was pro jihad as he was pro a\nPro attacking Yemen and stuff so it was pretty much fit fit in line with the lobbyist agenda however he was speaking and saw him on and that's one of the things that the Senate object uh you can't have too much with this one of the reasons the law the sheiks the royal family got rounded up and put in the ... and go\nWe'll we'll follow your lead right so\nThere's been kind of a backlash but then again he was trying to put a good face on an emerging Saudi Arabia their sovereign wealth is expanding but about another six hundred billion a\nBut now they're not the kind of backing off in the rye fiasco on aramco a which may be indicating they still see a future for oil which they do but however they're going to take their time and to their movements attack yeah isn't\nThat something you said a over a year ago that we were looking for a diversification of the Saudi wealth into the emerging tech markets a and and certainly I mean I guess all all\nThe difference as we deal with countries in the middle east your government controls all the resources as opposed to here where the private sector allegedly controls the resource\nRight and meanwhile it's like the Saudis are trying to do a back room deal with the Russians with oil and bypassing the Iranians and this is the great irony about the Russian Iranian relationship as militarily that very cohesive but when it comes to business as cutthroat who Russia and Saudi Arabia who [laughter]\nThose Russia's imagine that yes [laughter]\nUm okay we're running out of time what else do we need to talk about on tonight's intel over\nWell basically you know I think we're going to look at this the stretch of the u._s. airways winding down somewhat a we have the threat of ... are being attacked by Syria which again has said that all foreign entities need to move out of Syria or suffer the consequences which means you know uh and that\nIs dangerous with the Kurds because without them or without the U.S they'd fall\nSo the U.S has caught in this quandary with us relationship with turkey still have aircraft at ... or\nYou know we can't really project power but yet the same time we're trying to help has ruled F. and stop the Iranian land bridge going across\nA I asked this question uh probably every six to eight months the U.S has the ability to be a self sustaining self contained nation a basically a maintaining our level of comfort in luxury\nFor the most part a given enough time to uh to to reorganize correct\nRight what we'd have to turn back Thirty years of a political thought in DC\nOkay uh what would that entail in broad strokes well\nBasically we've had this mindset and if you look at nor rat\nAnd they're a defense grid network\nIt shows the south of Mexico all the way up to Canada that we've had this you know North American unit a viewpoint which is ironic because un views North America is only one in their ... a long term plan of ten zones in the world are we have that mindset said to shut that down\nWith means shutting down the border in Mexico there's no\nPolitical\nEd you know mindset for that and then with a Canada we could do be self sufficient but because of globalism\nAnd with the lack of manufacturing we would suffer for about ten to Fifteen or periods\nYeah but there is a major factor in Mexico or when you're talking about ... a defense of North America or the bottom line is if for whatever reasons somebody chose to to attack uh\nMexico the problem for the U.S would be the refugee situation similar what are the Europeans are facing now in North Africa in the middle east nobody ... yeah yeah I'm just saying that that that yeah we we keep the Mexicans down there\nWe give them the manufacturing and most of the TV and film or you just because of a bath to cheaper labor force but\nWhen you're talking about ... and the fact that it looks at North America from Mexico to Canada a that's not necessarily a problem\nWell essentially problem but it's a new mindset because

it a of a a Donald Trump in those situations\nAnd we saw what happened when people tried to play Donald Trump's game that we're not equipped to do so I think the most obvious me most obvious\nExample of this being literal Marco Rubio yeah he tried to get in and he was swinging for his life trying to stay alive for another ten minutes and the debates and well he made that crack about Donald Trump's hands on the size of him and uh implied that Donald Trump was not exactly packing south of the equator\nAnd it was like I said and attempt to play Donald Trump's game and well Marco Rubio is just not equipped to do that\n[noise] my ... he might be and look I'll give you a perfect example in the past in the past if you heard that someone had said they don't want it to despite the president's son\nYou'd have said this person has an unhinged lunatic this makes no sense\nThey will have no political career moving forward in fact there are a lawyer who oh gosh well it looks like the best part of their legal practices over and done with as well but like I said these are strange times we live in the year twenty Eighteen Michael ... challenge Donald Trump junior to a fight and I\nHonestly think that this is part of his continuing move toward a democratic nomination for residency in a year twenty twenty [noise]\nSee what happened was is I I don't know if you caught or not but it's well a beautiful little microcosm of the strange place we planted in and this day and age Donald Trump junior\nTried to make a joke linking Anthony wiener disgraced former Democratic politician Anthony wiener to attorney Michael Don ... a porn stars lawyer\nAnd a real thorn in the side of Donald Trump's administration and the Twitter feud when something like this\nDonald Trump junior posted a link to an article saying that Anthony wiener\nDisgrace democratic ex Congressman Anthony Weiner who went by the name Carlos danger on line when he was sexy underage girls in the most despicable sick way possible may soon be released from his twenty ... Twenty one month prison sentence due to good behavior but by the way why we letting this guy out early\nHe did something truly reprehensible [noise]\nHeated something that and I think we should be the best that I think would probably be treated with something like oh I don't know chemical cast ration he was jailed for sexting an underage girl absolutely revolting and well\nTo me is basically child abuse and molestation and just unsinkable to me that he's getting out early for good behavior but that's neither here nor there\nThe interesting it was Donald Trump junior\nTweeted out this article and said who else is excited about ... wiener twenty twenty it's going to be Carlos dangerous and by the way\nWhen people say he tried to make a joke [noise] tries the operative word Donald Trump junior not clever not funny\nAnd has access to the best comedy writers on the face of the planet and given the millions of dollars that he's got he could hire somebody to punch that up significantly but he did not he went with something that can meet ugly fell flat\nAnd it was met\nBy a response from Michael ... that well suggested perhaps a fight would be the best way to solve this sort of situation he said this [laughter]\nSee that and that's actually kind of funny is that if if I were you the last thing I Would be doing is referencing other people getting out of federal prison because after you are indicted you will likely be passing them on your way and by the way they don't have silver spoons or gold toilet and the joint butter Bob buckle up butter cup\nAnd then later for good measure ... challenged both the president and his son to an estimate fight for charity\nOr like I said I think there is a very real possibility that this man will be in serious contention for the Democratic nominee for president\n\nBecause there hasn't been anyone able to play Donald Trump's game the way Donald Trump can\nRemember when Marco Rubio to try to do that he made a crack about Donald Trump's hands Donald Trump was just decimate eating the competition in the presidential debates and the run up to the election and he was making short work of the other potential Republican candidates for president\nAnd he was doing it by playing the game the way he wanted to play it\nHe level then lowered the playing field and he took cheap ... shots in a way that would make everybody else look absolutely disgraceful but people sort of found amusing and coming from him\nAnd Marco Rubio is in there during his very best to try and stay alive for the next ten minutes so he could just possibly potentially have a shot at the nomination so what did he do he broke out that hey I shook Donald hands thing and his hands are small you know what they say about guys were small hands\nThat was his attempt and it was a brave and [noise]\nSensible attempt I mean he was going to go down and anyway it he was on his way out anyway so why not go out and swinging\nSo he did and Donald Trump made short work of Marco Rubio\nAnd managed to turn the whole situation around on him giving him the nickname little Marco Rubio\nAnd saying that uh his situation south of the equator was just fine [noise] something that Stormy Daniels would deny a little later on in the proceedings however [laughter] however\nThe Democrats the Democrats don't really have someone who can play at that level\nI don't really have someone who speaks Trump [noise]\nBut Michael ... Michael ... ... you could do that\nAnd he's making moves so generally speaking you would say that if somebody threatened or someone with physical violence and challenge them to a fight they were getting the water politically speaking with this this could be a very real things can be a very real case of ... making a case for his nomination in twenty twenty [noise]\nFirst of all I Want to say a big thank you to our listeners of the Michael berry show and our entire station Katie our age because you've been so supportive of camp hope\nOr by the a P just the foundation of America\nYou've been supportive because you've always supported our veterans because you are veterans you of the family members of veterans who the supporters of veterans I Want to thank all your small businesses out there who've donated whether you gave cash or whether you gave product owner thanks so many of you who have gone out donated your time and volunteer I Want to thank so many ...
