fire suppression systems he's got like a a how what a like a quarter of a billion dollars that's before he got the van Halen money\nSo uh say Samia goes doing All right doing All right so you guys are doing All right to uh don't forget your home for a stimulating talk more stimulating talk radio is K. P. R. C. home of Walter ... Johnson each and every morning\nOne of God's own prototypes [noise] high powered some guy never even considered for mass production [noise] to where to live [noise]\n[noise] ...\n\nOn KNPR see\nUsed us more stimulating talk lady oh [noise]\n\n\nNo I just discovered ... dot com it's a totally addicted new jewelry site with big name luxury brands and you know which ones I'm Talking about unique designers you can't find anywhere else I'll let a fraction of the price I'm going back on gasoline dot com tonight\nI folks I'm white man's Harry ... Potter Molly seems like all the buzz in the replacement window business these days is composite frames and how strong they are statewide remodeling has been offering composite windows for years but usually for a particular\nHeart rate goes from the gallery furniture made in America studio\nSees Casey RC nine fifty\nSo just Russia after a big\nHe tweeted it out and it went viral over and over again and it was a line of people in Houston that stretched outside of a building and down a block and wrapped around the block\nAnd like I said this was during Harvey this is a good chunk of Houston was underwater\nAnd he said this is what makes Houston special these people are standing in line during a disaster to you know why they're standing in line [noise] they're not standing in line\nBecause they're waiting for help they're not standing in line waiting for some sort of assistance they're not standing in line waiting for anything to be given to them\nThey're standing in line because they're waiting to volunteer\nSome of these people lost absolutely everything and they are standing in line because they want to help others they're lining up for the opportunity to help others when some of them have already lost everything that's Houston and it's one of the many reasons so I actually get a little choked up when I talk about that [noise]\nBut that's one of the many reasons that I feel that she uses a really really special place but I digress\nIf you are listening on nine fifty am Houston K. P. R. C. [noise] and then there's a very good chance that you heard this story because\n[laughter] it's the talk of the town everybody in Houston knows about this one and you know it's made some national news because it's pretty incredible\nBut if you're not familiar with the robot brothels situation in Houston [laughter] let me let let's rewind a little bit but let's back up just discouraged because All right yeah\nYou could say that I'm playing for left his robot bravo right off the bat sounds pretty freaking funny doesn't it\n[noise] but there's some really interesting and serious ramifications to the way that local government in Houston is treating this and look [noise] Houston\nOne of one of the people people one of the reasons people love to come to Texas in the city like Houston one of the reasons that Houston is growing and growing and growing one of the reasons that uh there's jobs galore in Houston and one of the reasons that\nBusinesses go to Houston is that it's a great place to start a business there is a lotta tools given to an entrepreneur someone that wants to start a business on wants to expand a business in Houston\nThere's some deregulation that makes it easier for the little guy or girl with the big idea\nTo watch their dreams come to fruition there are opportunities and like I said people embrace your talent people embrace what you've got to offer and Houston if you've got a special talent and skill and ability to be creative any of the above well\nThan Houston is a good place to build that into something it really really is\nAnd like I said a lot of people come to use them because of the freedom you get to start a business to run a business especially a small business and entrepreneurial\nSituation has a better chance of flourishing in a city like Houston and lots of other parts of America and lots of other parts of the world so\n[noise] the regulations that are well there you wouldn't really call them regulations but the local government attempting to control this robot bravo and their patients and their patrons [laughter]\n[laughter] even though legally they cannot is a bit of a red flag to me it's a bitter of\nOf a red flag to a lot of people in Houston and it's a bit of a red flag that the rest of the country should take note of [noise] and there's part of the story that to me is a very scary part of a very slippery slope will get into the details of the robot brothel and how much going on could be in front of your freedom next [noise]\n\n\nThe ... in the middle [noise] on the radio\nOn quarter as deep as being [noise]\nEverything into any more money than the average so\nAll right you say robot brothel and obviously all sorts of sensible questions come on if you\nAre in Houston and you're listening on nine fifty am KP RC Houston's more stimulating talk radio then there was a very good chance you already know\nAll about the robot brothel but for people listening in other parts of the country let's let's back things up a little bit shall we this past month just gone by Toronto based company called kinky dolls announced plans to open a Houston branch\nNow just technically speaking is not a brothel because well these aren't prostitutes these are robots these are these are dolls this is a place where adult love dolls quote unquote constructed of synthetic skin\nAnd a highly articulated skeletons would be available now this is to\nYou by the way to rent and before you buy [laughter] [noise]\nDon't know why I don't know why it's creepy to have well I'm first and foremost the idea of having relations with an adult loved all that to me is is Caribbean in of itself I just can't did I pay not judging if it's for you it's for you and that's great and\nWhile I'm so glad that you are able to walk down that particular avenue of pleasure because I Am not it will always be close to me because I just don't think I could bring myself to do that\nBut the idea of doing that with another highly articulated loved all [laughter] that someone else's just on that with a couple of hours before you which is which is strange because I mean\n[noise] you assume for the most part and less you both saved yourself for marriage that anybody as an adult that you were going to get busy with is going to be someone that has done it with someone else before there's every reasonable expectation that that is the case\nBut for some reason [noise] getting busy with a loved on someone else's used before just seems entirely more of a\nOf an emu [laughter] so that makes sense\nIs just beyond the pale morally speaking is absolutely freaking ... repugnant Houston city councilman Greg Travis is threatened law abiding she stony into our thinking about visiting this new robot bravo saying I've already got cameras lined up that whenever if ever this occurs\nAll the after it twenty four seven with cameras filming everybody goes in and everybody who goes out and we will posted on social media so people can see\nWho is using this that's the part that's creepy that's the part that's scary that's the part where you want to pump the brakes and take a very close look at what it is to be free\nWhen a politician says if we can't shut you down\nBy legal means we're going to social media shame your customers [noise] with a gross invasion of their privacy [noise]\nLike I said this doesn't sound like a bit of an Orwellian nightmare to you and a bit of a slippery slope or at least the beginning of it [noise] it is\nWe should all watch very carefully [laughter]\n\nGuy in radio and then\nThey do on the radio\nOn\n\n\nNational holiday they go every day to day second delicious making some fish tacos [laughter]\nLooking at her show [noise]\nBecause I'm a full\nIndeed today I Hope I Hope you got free tacos cars today was national taco day yeah [noise]\nBut in a way is it every day but his national taco day [laughter] [noise]\nThe good news is that a bunch of big Mexican food chains gave away free tacos today separate Taco Bell nervous Humvee evil [noise] or they're taco day promotion is that they're selling gifts that's where you can pay five ... five dollars to buy for tacos for a friend I kind of get that but you know\nYour name's Taco Bell yeah hang your hat on the tacos everybody else's giving away the tacos usually give away the tacos\nAdvocate advocate I think anyway [noise]\nAnyways [laughter]\n[noise] uh if you've been main lining free tacos all day here's some interesting stats and honor of national taco day apparently more than Ninety five percent of Americans say they like tacos\nSeventy one percent before prefer tacos over burritos\nWhat would you rather have a taco or burrito this to me is really an argument of portability\nBecause like a burrito ... as long as it's well raft uh if it's one of those that holds together\nThat's to me something that is meant to be non Iran or standing up for or what have you tacos\n... they're going to fall over the ... all over the place this is what I like to do\nI like to eat tacos and then I like to have a tortilla underneath my taco as I'm eating it because I Know I'm going to be dropping so much assorted taco meat and feeling that uh I'm going to have a burrito afterwards and just based on the things that I dropped out of my tacos You're welcome that's a pro tip\nOr from a fat kid [laughter] three quarters of us he talk\nIt was at least once a month how often do you tacos\nOh man trying to remember the last time I had tacos besides today national taco day I mean free tacos wherever you are where they are going to say no hell no I was not going to say no to ... this is not a thing that I Would ever do new [noise]\nI think the last time I had tacos before today was made tacos a little while ago oh man they were good I had a turkey meat lying around the house\nFor I mean it was in the fridge was just lying around the house but I had turkey meat and I actually made turkey tacos so easy so simple so delicious a taco shell that some turkey mean losing dinner was served and it was awesome by the way\nI just like turkey I'm not one of those people east turkey because it's a healthy thing to do\n[noise] however I have noticed that really turkey to me is [noise]\nAnd you might disagree with is this is where we could have a divergence of opinions with regard to the greasing is that you appreciate and your tacos and you're talking to me but to me a turkey taco is really good because I guess turkey meat is a little naturally lower and fat so\nWhen you eat a turkey taco I I like it a lot better beef obviously tastes like something\nTurkey days like something but ultimately tacos tastes like taco they tie it tastes like taco seasoning so the type of ground meat that you've got going into your taco to me is a little bit of relevant\nAnd for that reason I appreciate the turkey because you put the taco seasoning it tastes like tacos it's delicious obviously but it's way less greasy which means it doesn't\nDrip onto your hand it doesn't ... doesn't soften the shell 'cause I I really enjoy the whole crunching is aspect of tacos", "city": "Houston"}
