and horse face going at it [noise] it's not my words there's you know the old expression you get the government you deserve you ever heard that one or people because the government they deserve it whatever the twist is\nOn it I'm not sure who we can be ... who we can attribute this one too [noise] but the idea is that the people of democracy wind up with the leadership that most suits them and their\nAttitudes\nThat one yeah well I I have a hard time reconciling\nA world where we deserve what\nWe've got going on now I mean I Know people are freaking ridiculous things are very odd and a year twenty Eighteen and there are many things that you could say about humanity specifically the humanity that exists in America that are humongous head scratcher Z and make you wonder exactly who we become and what we are\nBut is this a government we deserve look you might love Trump you might despise Trump no matter how you feel about Trump\nYou might be an always Trump you might be a never Trump he might be you know sometimes Trump\n[noise]\nBut it's got to be a moment in our personal histories where we look at what's going on and go well that's different that's not something that our forefathers or for mother's\nEver had to deal with and we never had to deal with the president calling a porn star horse face in the past and well we never had a\nPresident that was called tiny by a porn porn star yet this might not be what America wants or needs but maybe it is what\nAmerica deserves right now I don't know I'm wrestling with this one I keep coming back to the old adage you get the president that you deserve or you get the leadership that you deserve the government you elect is the government you deserve is that the direct quote is always yeah St Thomas Jefferson on our now now I got a double check this\nYeah that is Thomas Jefferson the government you will act as the government you deserve so yeah\n[laughter] uh uh uh\nIt might not be what America wants or needs but maybe it is what America deserves right now I don't know a president who's involved in a full blown Twitter war with a porn star where there is mudslinging and name calling yesterday President Trump hit up Twitter to gloat about Stormy Daniels defamation case against him being thrown out of court\nHe said quote now I can go after horse face and her third rate lawyer and the great state of Texas\n[laughter] uh yeah\nShe will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total con\nAnd stormy clap back with a few insults of her own\nQuote ladies and gentlemen may I may present your president\nIn addition to this in addition to his um shortcomings he has demonstrated his incompetence hatred of women and lack of self control on Twitter again and perhaps a ... game on tiny\nThat's what she said uh then we all thought this was going to go away remember when Stormy Daniels was on Saturday Night live we thought that was the height we thought that was the apex of the Stormy Daniels\nStory arc in our country's history but no no it's fired right back up again I mean\n\nDonald Trump knows right he knows we read this stuff when he treats it like calling somebody horse faces it just [noise] I look this is just one in a long line of things that Donald Trump has done that is beneath the office of president a lot of people just going to say that he's a normal guy walking and like he talks that then uh\nThis is the type of Santa Cruz has put at\n[laughter] [noise]\nI'm a big believer in the idea of being a gentleman and I think\nThat's that's that's where I fall down on this stuff\nLike let's assume that Donald Trump was the guy who I could get behind those while in favor of his policy [noise]\nAnd I'm not going to lie there is a lot of people that are completely anti one hundred million percent anti everything that Trump does I'm not a fan of Trump I don't like Trump\nBut there's certain things that have happened since he became president when I'm like oh it's good for America it's good for all of us can be traced directly back to him\nI Know he'll say it can be and his policies might have had something to do with it but whatever the case may be there are some good things that have happened to America\nAs a result of Donald Trump or since Donald Trump became president\nI'm not a person who take sides I'm a person who likes good things no matter where they come from for the people of America that's it you know there's we talked together on the show a lot about my political allegiances and how they essentially straight up do not exist\nBut I'll never be able to reconcile the idea of\n\nThe behavior of a president that is so far beneath the office of the greatest power on the face of planet earth\nHorse face in tiny do we deserve this did we get the government we deserve what Thomas Jefferson said was that see what happened nice work\n\nWhatever the case may be story Daniels quote unquote third rate lawyer Michael
