Fox News ... searching for the man they believe fatally shot a female student during an argument out by the dormitory in Salt Lake City\nOf conflict in warfare whether that warfare be psychological and physical that we would know to be on the lookout for it if you're being divided chances are so much trying to talk\nTo you and we're being sort of successfully divided at the moment but like I said\nThe best way I can think to describe this division is an indulgence really\nThe anger that people express toward people that have vaguely ... for a different political beliefs on them and you see the division all over the place you see it you're not left enough to be calling yourself truly left\nWe need socialism weeny democratic socialism Allah Bernie just being a Democrat isn't good enough\nTraditional democratic politics like Hillary will never get us there and on the right ... rhino you Republican in name only I could never vote for an establishment Republican they're just a Democrat in disguise\nSo there's the obvious divide down the middle and then the warring factions are in sort of miniature civil wars and a really ultimately all it is it's like I said these are indulgences\nAnd this has a lot to do with a our enemies sowing the seeds of division among us and be the fact that we're coming out of this massive recession\nAnd when people are coming out of a massive recession when they feel as though there should be significantly more zeroes behind the number and their bank account\n\nOftentimes folks look around for someone to blame\nAnd\nThat need to blame someone is capitalized on by our enemies who would seek to divide us by politicians who would seek to gain our allegiance by dividing\nUs\nIt's a time honored trap that we find to over and over again as I was just as it's not just here in America it happens all over the rest of the world\nSo at least we've got that we might not have smart and up we might not have become better we might not have learned from history lessons but at least we're only making the same mistakes that the rest of the world is made over and over again does that make you feel better I don't know\nBut that's exactly what's going on\nNow I Know you say dean how how do we know this division as a result of the financial crisis well\nThat recession that we came out of was the biggest one in our lifetime but it wasn't the biggest one in American history and if you look back if you look back at political divides and extremism\nYou always find that hard on the heels of a recession or depression\nPeople become\nMore divided people are at each other's throats so we'll just continue to play a role\nIn X. two of the play\nOf economic crisis that we're going through right now but over and over again I Would urge you\nTo remember these divisions these pockets of anger\nThese moments where we seek to blame other people for the mess our country's in or the mess we're in or the fact that we don't have as much money as we think we should have or the fact that our house is worth as much money as it used to be or whatever the case may be\n[noise] these are like I said best way of describing it indulgences [noise] and I would always urge you to remember that focus on something more akin to the story to tell you ... it has to do with pizza elect is hanging out on essential\nWe filmed a TV commercial for top tax defenders and um they had some of the people that they've helped come in and I got to meet him and it was interesting because there\nWere guys that were several of them were small business owners probably twenty twenty five of them and the different stories of what happens in health things happen and and how top tax defenders was able to help them with the IRS and I went person to person how much\nAre the less morning on the other end and metal [noise] being on the radio\nOn Twitter and indeed [laughter]\nSo you know I think I'm just gonna keep saying this until it catches on [noise] division [noise]\nSquabbles squabbles between factions on the far right and then not read enough the far left and then I left enough divisions between\nAmericans as much as they are things that play directly into the hands of our enemies\n[noise] they are as we call them earlier indulgences I say that because well that's exactly what they are they are societal sociological luxury items fighting amongst each other [noise]\n[noise] it's a sort of thing that we dispensed with I Wish we can dispense with him with it just to buy this willingness to sniping at each other I Wish we could dispensed with it when the chips were down\n\nBut the one thing that kind of gives me hope is the fact that well when a crucial moment comes we seem to be able to hang together\nThere's always a piece of prospective that makes it very clear in certain situations that were on the same side and we know this we notice on our heart of hearts and we know this [noise]\nWell we noticed because things like this happened in the world I'm gonna give you a story of hope that involves pizza two of our favorite things\nThis is actually from a story in ... comments Michigan newspaper group\nI Want to read to you from it for a second if I may\nStory starts saying it's kind of poetic sometimes pizza is more than just a meal\nFor Julie Morgan enrich Morgan of Indianapolis it was the nice gesture that came with two pizzas delivered from their favorite pizzeria soon after they learned that rich would enter hospice care the made their day\nJulie Morgan posted on Facebook about the experience\nShe said that she and rich lived in battle creek Michigan twenty five years ago but I live in Indianapolis now they lived in battle creek Michigan twenty five years ago and twenty five years ago there were a young couple\nWhen a crucial time comes when the chips are down we like Dalton was for the Morgan's are there for each other\nI think ... check to see how these folks voted before he made his epic four hundred and fifty mile piece of delivery trip\nI don't think he did\nAnd you know what ultimately I Hope because I Know you wouldn't have either\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nBeen for many years independent electrical contractors seven won three eight six nine Nineteen Seventy six\nHours city there's freedom here our stories and we have things that don't exist and all the boys oh or issue very few students surgery can vote and Julie ... noon at three is always going to get bigger and we're all gonna for grown how to go [laughter] all the ... you know fifty\n[noise] don't\nGet to scare 'em and you know the guy down there in radio then\nThey do on the radio\nIn Atlanta you know I have to reduce you mean then all of humanity in general to crash tasteless warship the money but [noise] it's important to keep bringing this up because I think there is real power in this piece of knowledge this division that knew me all of us\nKeep going on and on about that all of humanity seems to be complaining about yet is only too willing to participate in\nThis division is the byproduct of a financial downturn among many other things I mean there is a perfect storm of a financial downturn and the emergence of a digital age where we are effectively put into our own corners\nOf we talked about this and then passed right he talked about this how Google Facebook\nThings of that nature they were meant to bridge gaps of culture and under ... understanding and language and all the above I mean look language barriers don't have to exist anymore thanks to Google Translate yet we remain divided why because Well Google and Facebook are trying to sell us to sell itself constantly\n[noise] you don't have talked about this in the past but try this some time with some topic I remember I think I think I heard about it during a Ted Talk or something like that or some\nMeaningless frittering I was doing with my time on the Internet where it was pointed out to me that if\nI look for something on line I'll get a completely different set of answers based on what I've been looking for previous to that and\nThis is a big part of the division that we experience not just here in America but all over the world and the perfect example that I can I can give you\nThis inaction is I had a neighbor who was Egypt and\nHe was moslem he uh was he ... he I think was living down the hall from me 'cause he was going to medical school but we got to be buddies yeah I'd be out walking my dog I'd run into and we talk we like the same rap music [laughter]\n[noise] but I had this notion to try something once and one day with him I did I was like hey I'm going to Google Egypt on my phone and you Google Egypt on your phone and let's see what comes up bear in mind he was Egyptian and I am about is white and American an English as they come\nAnd we both schools Egypt I saw terrorism beheadings fire famine end of the world stuff\nBear in mind all we did was we both searched the word Egypt on Google he saw plane tickets\nHotel deals things of that nature\nGroupon ths for resorts or [laughter] some sort of discount code for some rather nice resort in Egypt so I Googled Egypt I get the world is ending and they're all terrorists they want to kill you if he goes Egypt he gets hey you can get a massage for a discounted rate at this rather splendid resort in Egypt\nSo\nIt is a perfect storm\nA lot of the divide that we experience in America and all over the rest of the world has to do with the digital age this thing that was meant to bridge gaps of culture and relays or race and religion and understanding which is only ... only really managed to further divide us because they're trying to predictably sell a stuffed away Google does\n\nAnd the financial downturn that we've experienced you look at a time and time again to lessen the history has taught us repeated times throughout the course of modern civilization yet we seem to forget it\nAnd it was a real historical precedent every time there's a physical downturn every time someone broke and every time someone is coming out of being broke\nThey spend the next Mm ten Fifteen Twenty years after session after depression after some sort of financial crisis looking around for someone to blame that it happened or that their house isn't worth what it's supposed to be or that they're broke or that they lost their job people look for someone to blame\nWhen they're fiscally uncomfortable if we all had more zeroes at the end of the number that we see pop up when we check our balance a checking account a lot of the at each other's throats stuff goes away\nAnd you know what look this is obviously a play is obviously a play at a very specific in strategic time to gain a little bit of traction going into some elections [noise] but\nThis might might actually do something to show some seeds of contentment the president clarify this past Monday just gone by that the ... the proposed tax cuts\nThat he's talking about would be to help one group of people in one group of people on me I have to you and me he said assuming that we're all middle class yeah president Donald Trump spoke to reporters at the White House as he left on a campaign trip to Texas\nThat his administration plan to produce a resolution within a couple of weeks calling for a ten percent very specific number calling for a ten percent tax cuts for middle income people\nWere putting in a resolution sometime in the next week or are we going to have two weeks not it's not a specific but he said we're putting in a rose a resolution we're giving a middle income tax reduction of about ten percent were doing it now for middle income people\nThis has been the rallying cry politicians for the last five ten years got to do something to help the middle class people\nThat are physically disadvantaged are taking advantage of a system about doing work\nPeople at the top are taking advantage and who's getting sucker punched every single time one of these things happens\nThese massive banks and insurance companies and corporations in the wake of the financial collapse they all got massive ... billion dollar government bailouts meanwhile\nPeople at the other end of the spectrum are reaping the reward of social benefit and who's paying who's paying the taxes and who's getting the benefit the middle class this has been the rallying cry politicians on the left and on the right for the past ten years yet there hasn't been anything\nConcrete done about it until now and we don't know if it's got to be done but that's the that's the talk doing it now for middle income people at ten percent tax reduction\nDrums edited administration was studying a tax cut to be ruled out sometime around the beginning of November oh you mean for the for the congressional elections funny that but nevertheless is might it's my ... and put some\nCash in your pocket and well cash in your pocket means cash in your pocket which I like for you and for me and for all of us but it also means less looking around for somebody to blame less division\nMore of an ability to get along with folks and I got to tell you I don't care where that comes from ... to ... it could have come from Obama it could come from Trump\nIf it puts money in your pocket relieves some pressure\n[noise] I Am cautiously optimistic about it\n\n[noise] Trump's fellow Republicans are all seeking in the elections to hold onto their majorities in the Senate and house of representatives and this could go a long way to helping them do that so maybe it's a ploy but it could have real upside for you\nIf you're noticing that I'm not taking a side on this one is because I'm not the only thing I like is something that makes your life easier and better [noise]\nBut he said that the tax cuts would be unveiled before the election they'd have to go through Congress afterwards so there is there is some there is some potential to be the new gold on this one I'm going to unveil these tax cuts right before the election\nBut uh they're not all walk they got to go through Congress he said we won't have time to do the vote will vote after the election\n", "city": "Houston"}
