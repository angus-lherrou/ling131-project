friction off the surface in the wings and everything is kind of short range it's not a panacea but you know in retrospect the Pentagon was saying that you have twenty two new was there there will be fifty two in the area was escorting\nAnd it wasn't like they had a real ... the Russians kind of ... like we won the dog you know mock duck dog fight\nNo it wasn't really a mock the dock fight so it's a get in there but however that's a new dynamic into this game um with the fact that now they can detect a twenty two maybe thirty five without\nRadar so is the is the control of the middle east less about resources and more about testing the military technology and abilities\nWell I think the Russians technological development with the weapon system was only a icing on the cake for this and and I do believe they were actually looking when they moved in and that's why they moved in was because they realize they had\nDo you get you can't miss this opportunity and they've already seen multiple upgrades on their se twenty five is on the other fighters\nOr in weapons systems so this is field testing a military hardware for a complex down the road\nRight and also providing you know combat training for soldiers so you can't really get like you can get some of the Ukraine right now but it's a little different type of combat are we ever talked about the Saudis\nIn a couple of weeks where do they stand under the uh the emerging reign of Solomon well\nOne of the big things that's happening is is a a journalist ... who kind of disappeared and uh about four days ago the b._b._c. interviewed him and now he's still he disappeared now is appearing that he was at the Saudi consulate in Turkey and got chopped up\nAnd said no no you're right uh because he was talking against ... agenda even though he was kind of pro ISIS pro jihad a\nBut he has been again there's some journalists Yes sir but I didn't mean to interrupt you know he was he was pro jihad as he was pro a\nPro attacking Yemen and stuff so it was pretty much fit fit in line with the obvious agenda however he was speaking and saw him on and that's one of the things that the sun\nObject uh you can't have too much of this one of the reasons the law the sheiks the royal family got rounded up but in the ... and go we'll we'll follow your lead right so\nThere's been kind of a backlash but then again he was trying to put a good face on an emerging Saudi Arabia their sovereign wealth is expanding but about another six hundred billion\nA ... but now they're not the kind of backing off in the ... on aramco a\nWhich may be indicating they still see a future for oil which they do but however they're gonna take their time and to their movements attack yeah isn't\nThat something you said a over a year ago that we were looking for a diversification of the Saudi wealth or end of the emerging tech markets a and and certainly I mean I guess all all\nThe difference as we deal with countries in the middle east your government controls all the resources as opposed to here where the private sector allegedly controls the resource\nRight and meanwhile it's like the Saudis are trying to do a back room deal with the Russians with oil and bypassing the Iranians and this is the great irony about the Russian Iranian relationship as militarily that very cohesive but when it comes to business as cutthroat who Russia and Saudi Arabia\nWho does Russia's imagine that yes uh\nI'm okay we're running out of time uh what else do we need to talk about on tonight's intel over well\nBasically you know I think we're going to look at the ... the stretch of the U.S or we're winding down somewhat a we have the threat of ... are being attacked by Syria which again has said that all foreign entities need to move out of Syria or suffer the consequences which means you know uh and that\nIs dangerous with the Kurds because without them or without the U.S they'd fall\nSo the U.S has caught in this quandary was his relationship with turkey still have aircraft in ... ah\nYou know ... we can't really project power but yet the same time we're trying to help has ruled F. and stop the Iranian land bridge going across a I asked this\nQuestion uh probably every six to eight months the U.S has the ability to be a self sustaining self contained nation a basically a maintaining our level of comfort in luxury for the most part a\nGiven enough time to uh to to reorganize correct\nRight what we'd have to turn back Thirty years of a political thought\nIn DC okay uh what would that entail in broad strokes well\nBasically with had this mindset and if you look at nor rat and they're a defense grid network it shows the south of Mexico all the way up to Canada that we've had this you know North American unit\nA viewpoint which is ironic because un views North America is one in their ... a long term plan of ten zones in the world and uh we have that mindset said to shut that down would mean shutting down the border of Mexico there's no political clout ed you know mindset for that\nAnd then with a Canada we could do be self sufficient but because of globalism and with the lack of manufacturing we would suffer for about ten to Fifteen or periods\nYeah but there is manufactured in Mexico or when you're talking about ... a defense of North America or the bottom line is if for whatever reason somebody chose to to attack uh\nMexico the problem for the U.S would be the refugee situation similar what are the Europeans are facing now in North Africa in the middle east nobody's attack\n... yeah I'm just saying that that that's yeah we we keep the Mexican down there\nWe give them the manufacturing and most and TV and film um you just because of NAFTA and cheaper labor force but when you talk about ... and the fact that it looks at North America from Mexico to Canada a that's not necessarily a problem\nWell it's not a ... problem but it's a new mindset because originally back until the eighty late eighties a mindset\nWasn't there of it even has gotten away from us I Apologize to the audience a fellow bill on Twitter at intel over watch and do those three things for us to be the

having blown up his phone after having emailed him a bunch of times saying don't know where you're talking about it's there it's just you looked up the wrong thing\nAnd it was like that that doesn't seem true that doesn't seem right I mean hey look I've been wrong about a lot of things before I've made lots of mistakes but that doesn't seem correct to me and what this guy didn't know or\nDidn't realize that I knew was every time you do this sort of thing it creates a time stamp\nSo I was able to look and see what time this piece of audio was created that all the brouhaha was about and\nIt
