Court and in some ways tried to bring them all of the challenges that I think our last radioactive a\nMagazine side than California Skeeter weekly magazine so you know that's the kind of level with

the commercial terminal where you fly out on the airlines and there's general aviation were private planes fly out\nAnd depending on the state and I understand this go state by state difference but under federal law\nYou are not prohibited from carrying a firearm in an airport you\nCan tell you get to the security checkpoint the TSA checkpoint there now you can't carry beyond that but you can carry up to that point you can walk to the term in most states some states they have a state law but not Michigan so these guys are at the general aviation not the commercial aviation side of things and they're open carry it\nAnd the airport manager comes out and ask them if they're law enforcement and they said no we're not he said well you you guys can't conceal carry\nA in the airport is of course they're open carrying anyway and so uh Jason said well we told them that we could\nHe said you're carrying his only prohibited and the sterile area Michigan says otherwise propaganda airports are actually statue of tour really preempted which is cool anyway says uh\nAirport may just have to call the sheriff's office so discuss it okay and they went on went out to their claims they have little private airplanes and starts your airplanes and checking them they're going to fly work instead of as I was doing the ... on the bird and he says I noticed a deputy started walking out onto the ramp\nSince then I saw him talking with the airport manager for a few minutes then he came over a deputy came over\nThe deputy says that yeah we got the report and ah I left the airport manager know
