{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "And let's start dominant right handed a that was a little bit different kind of work with but um but yeah\nLet me let me ask you that that was she a shooter before you met her she'd been around guns wishy ... really a shooter\nAround them but never really know her father took her out and talk about gun and a little bit just give her name bury him [noise] but ah but never but you know she always wanted to go hunting and things like that but she never really push the subject in her father never\nPushed on her and uh so now yeah now she's one of the bird hunting with me she wants to learn about deer hunting\nUm she just died of an ad and they're really love that\nOne that's really interesting how did you first broach the subject\nWell you know I just just normal conversation are brought up and other deer hunter man then next thing I Know we're just running out or just you know she has an interesting thing is I Do and you don't usually people who can tend to be the same mindset assures as well\nYeah\nYeah yeah just just kind of you know everything outdoors you know just encounter and um it just came up and she said you know I've always been interested in that and a cigarette and arranging she broke a couple turned looked at me smiled real big and I like it\nAnymore [laughter]\nSo she's um she's five three um stick one am I going to do that are very well at all nope nope but um but I did tell her like you know will ah Oregon do different stock because I actually just remember like college about the credit off the beat the Ninety nine I chose the BP\nSo I got it so now my old trapped gun I'm I'm probably going to be finding a shorter ... put on there for\nAll right I'm going to make a suggestion to think about this okay remember that just putting a short stock on it doesn't do it\nFor a number of reasons one is that\nThe barrels maybe longer maybe a little heavy a look at the percentage of weight of a gun I'd want to your guns versus your weight and then versus her weight imagine using that percentage on you so you may be carrying a twelve or sixteen pounds guy to pursue the same percentage of weight\nSo that's something to think about another is if she shooting off the left shoulder\nYou try to get a gun suited to hurry will make all the difference in the world for shotguns and then obviously you can get her out and do some pistol shootings why proceeding you're going to have a whole bunch of flying in front of you look I Know congratulations\nOn finding somebody who sounds like a real good for you Justin I'm excited for you\nAnd I wish you two are nothing but a lot of good shooting a lot of fun and that's a great life together proceeds to report that is great eight six six gun a year range force look about one of my first ... you've been to we have a couple of those coming up as well as pretty much any other also signed\nThe season [noise]\n\nI

or gun collection there are part of it goes from colonial times up into a Korean War\nBut the interesting things is of course they do they have a um um shirts they call it grand no shirts that had a male and the stock\nYou know I always heard as a and about stock I always heard it called the ... shirt so that they call it rained all shirt on everyone in Greenville yeah yeah and I go to look at that right away and I forget\nAnd then they add some oddities from earlier times they and they also have a lot of civil war stuff including um worse breach loading are being\nMade by the state military working Greenville South Carolina cow over fifty rifle it was maybe teen Eighteen sixteen to Eighteen fifty five so while the hostilities are going on and it's very interesting and gotten it looks\nLike a modern um uh whenever gun wow I'd never I didn't remember it and I went back there in June and\nA couple of and took a couple pictures are thinking about that is a lightning is a very good you can stand there and you can get pictures and everything and there's very few that don't come out because but why don't you don't take them either\nCamp arresting how often we discovered this something we think it's been around for a certain period of time actually somebody did it many many years before you can go and just like it's hard to find something that is truly new\nIt's not it's not all ever got it just adds a lover on it you know and in fact I'm not sure exactly how it works on but it reminds me of a lever gun [laughter]\nThere's long yeah go ahead and the other\nThe other museum go ahead\nAnd not so Minnesota it's\nAbout the the nurse silver age we're now than James van younger brothers tried to take over the bank and take money no nonsense then\nThey stole the money

the guy from the hotel and went up to upstairs window and did a lot of damage at that and some other guy shot their horses and\nAnd I mean it's already inconvenient to get out of town with the money they managed to steal [laughter] and then they got most of them the chance to get away with the younger brothers are rolled up\nWhile and I I've been there twice and I thought they had a big gun that the guy from the hotel to the doctor I'm\nOn display for a year and I managed to catch it last uh last year you're before expert on that on display yeah it was a it was a civil war single shot the fifty Cal curvy\nAnd see I'm just trying to do this and this is the hold here we go to these museums and find these interesting God's me come back it sticks with you that this is why we go to these highly I got to run but thank you so much that is very cool a couple of other uh\nMuseums out there they and they may not be necessarily firearms museums but their museums that have an aspect of firearms in them of course that's frankly a significant portion of the history of not just the U.S for the world can be told what part of it can be told\nThrough the development of firearms whether

unseen wounds of war known as the TST mhm\nThe we ... we spoke last week about a story from the VA a report or maybe two weeks ago now a ... new VA report on suicide and those numbers overall slightly decreasing the numbers of the what they described as the younger vets the Eighteen to thirty four H. slightly increasing\nUm\nAnd we we talk a lot about those issues and our\nFamilies and veterans face and how do we reach that because in that report also the vet the vet the v a set of themselves that it was an urgent crisis and it was too large for the VA to deal with by themselves so they admit I we need help with this we need communion step in and help with this\nWhich is how what camp hope and be just the foundation is is the community coming together it's people or whether it's a treat cupcakes bringing out\nYou know a few boxes of cupcakes or whether it's a a a an eight year old girl selling crayon hearts which by the way I'm Margo who has been doing that for the last three years is now raised\nI think forget\nSee their Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars a lot of Korea hearts and just say oh yeah uh she's going to be out at our barbecue on friday night November the

girl just finding a way to do something sometimes\nAnd um but yeah the first time I was told that my post traumatic stress disorder was not combat related\nAnd I didn't quite understand how getting shot and blown up and losing friends didn't qualify\nYeah at all and to the point I don't think I've ever heard someone being accepted on their first attempt even when they're using an advocate whether it's a VA advocate or it's the da da\nTo a unicorn okay yeah\nAh we've had guys come through our organization who've had their backs broken in Hilo crashes and got the same thing you got it

reminds me there's a scene in an old movie where the Vietnam veterans going to apply for his benefits and she's like how do we know you've even been hurt any proceeds to remove his prosthetic legs for where he lost to Vietnam and slam it on her desk and be like it is is that words I worked\nFor you anyway big kudos to the VA to Donald Trump administration are getting this up and running any thing
