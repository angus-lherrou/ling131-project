I Would be I Would consider looking for an older Marlon as opposed to a new one\nAnd I don't know how you feel about buying a used gun older gun versus brand new but for me I'd be looking for an older one just 'cause I like him so much\nWhat would you do that [noise]\nUm we're obviously and the gun stores around the cell use guns you could poke around you could actually just color and doing that to Dr Carender areas do you have any ah older Marlon liberal actually thirty thirties\nNow there's also a couple or three Web sites that are very well known and very well respected are probably the biggest of them is called gun broker gun broker dot com\nAnd you could find guns there and you can buy them and what they do is they ship them to your local gun store and then you do the background check their and usually have like a three they approve appeared if you don't like it you can return it but you check that out with people there or who you're buying from but you could check gun broker dot com\nOr however if you go in the store you like to look to the new Marlon there's nothing wrong with that just by it and you know I think it's going to be fine I Love ...

wrote my book but I was lucky to not happy TST I was just trying\nAnd to convince myself and I wasn't sharing the full pictures I still have nightmares I Am depressed instead of dealing with these

focused exclusively on service to my neighbors in my home town that I could feel the whole inside of me but it's just getting worse\nSo after eleven years of trying to outrun depression in ... symptoms I finally decided that it's faster than me that I have to stop running turn around and confront it\nFinally went to the VA in Kansas City yesterday and it started the process to get help
