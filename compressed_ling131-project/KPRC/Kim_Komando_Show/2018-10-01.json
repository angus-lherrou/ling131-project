guarantee yourself a brand new iPhone every year but is it a good year as a good deal rather or is apple jacking up the price in a way that you never thought of before well if you're an apple loyalist any plan to upgrade every single year forever more\nThe iPhone upgrade program is a great way to get a new iPhone an apple care plus for the cheapest price but the problem with the iPhone upgrade

school\nUm you know the school district isn't that great so we're sending our to like a Christian school and another district okay but I have no way to contact her like during the day if I'm going to be late or something like that but she's only eight years old so\nI didn't really want to give her an iPhone or you know I'd like to be able to like texture so somebody\nTension to watch or something like that but you know I didn't know if you knew of anything that would be good for an eight year old I remember when he was three you said you got it was something that had three buttons on it yes [laughter]\nMom dad and grandma and that was that was\nIt was all it was though he could only called three people avoid those were the days right\nCall there isn't anything like that exist\nOr you know what I think I'm going to pull that out and say okay everybody there you go [laughter] you know we're all his eyes and look at me and go oh come on mom really\nI you know what I think I'm going to do that I'm gonna you know what you just give me a great Christmas I [laughter] that's funny 'cause I well\nYou know because I have this box of like old tech stuff [laughter]\nI'm sure he'll in there All right so so your little angel eight years old and we don't want to give her a a bona fide iPhone but want to give her something to get in touch and but I also think it's important if we had a maybe some little\nBells and whistles with it or it's OK you mentioned to watch you can go with a watch a\nHit because they don't carry up her so I thought she wearing\nIt yeah and that's actually not a bad idea there's a a product called ... it's do you watch the okay I watch okay and it's actually kind of cool you're gonna have to wave video calls with her\nBut he but what I like about it is that you also have a GPS on board so GPS tracking an alerts and so what you can do is doing what's called the geo fenced area around the school\nAnd if the watch goes outside she goes outside the geo fenced area then you get a notification on the phone\nIf something bad is happening she has an SOS button\nThat will tell you that she's in trouble but in addition to that it turns on both the camera and microphone so you can see what's going around the kid\nWell that sounds perfect\nYeah I think that's kinda cool and you know so that's one of 'em it that that's like two hundred bucks a pack what a lot of parents do is they'll buy kids an older phone right 'cause I don't know or maybe like maybe she'd be okay with the phone but there's a the no kill thirty three ten\nIs an older phone that you can pick up for like fifty bucks okay but in a lot of people it's kind of crazy now a lot of people are buying as because they don't want all the bells and whistles a smart phone\nBut I still want a phone so you can make calls and has a to a camera and onto him has to make a visual camera um it does texting\nShe can take picks and like I said it's like fifty sixty bucks and it comes and fun colors\nOkay and like the price better but yeah the ... and you know I like those oh yeah see that's the sewers sleepy it's something that\nYou know you try or out on phone uh-huh and then you kinda say then you know and then see how she takes two it okay uh there's also another one I I just want to tell you about is um is something called the blue tank\n... and so you might want to look at that one but I Would say either the watch if she likes if you really feel because nobody knows are better than you I mean you know her better than she knows herself right now you know", "show_name": "Kim
