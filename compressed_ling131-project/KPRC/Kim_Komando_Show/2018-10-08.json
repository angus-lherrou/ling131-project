Washington editor Nick\nHow are you I'm good what's going on [noise]\nUm I've been looking into some money making apples um the ones where you can earn money watching movies and TV shows or share your

all really good question um how much money are you trying to make or would you like to make\nA\nLiving you know on a book extra months\nLiving here it's so it's not like you're like OK I Need to make a thousand dollars were you know two thousand dollars or anything like that or a you know some of the ap she mentioned like swag bucks is the one that led to watch TV Shop kick is the one that you know let you cumulative points for shopping\nUh there's I pull this way it's something that allows you to take surveys a Google also has their opinion ... that will pay you one dollar per survey\nYou know if you wanted to make like\nA couple of hundred bucks a month that may be the way I was in costs go a couple of weeks ago\nAnd I had a put TaskRabbit on my phone 'cause one of these apps right um

through the ... and then I made like seven bucks my foot that's not bad I mean I'm already here anyway right\nAnd so you know so the way that the absolute illegitimate apps is that you don't have to worry about malware and viruses but I always caution people that some of these they don't actually give you cash that they may give you like an Amazon dot com gift card\nOr a gift card to Starbucks um there's also other ones like one's called folk\n... pie that you could take a picture of anything and then they submitted to the various um agencies and so you may get a couple of bucks that

our privacy can have devastating consequences one great way to secure your privacy so you can have their freedom to be anonymous and untraceable online is to use what's called a VPN it stands for virtual private network\nWhen choosing a VPN you really need to trust the company running it and I recommend FDR freedom VPN F secure as a publicly listed company they had the thirty year spotless track record of protecting its customer security and privacy\nAnd they're stealing anything that they can but that's a whole another topic\nWhen you are ... traveling in countries like Russia and you do come back you know the general rule is that number one before you go is that you make a complete backup of everything [noise] uh so that this way if you need to restore that you'd be able to because sometimes coming back in the country are going to a country believe it or not that you may have your device confiscated\nAnd if it is confiscated weather here or abroad or three or six month you might be able to feed again but quite possibly a year okay and nobody wants that to happen so that was not your issue I Would recommend that you change all your passwords to any account that that you have bad access to\nA especially your even though you didn't use a VPN because I wouldn't want you to take any unnecessary risks and then be sitting here thirty days after a trip and typically they're going to wait until you you're at home for thirty days and then you start seeing some weird stuff happening you know what I mean\nUm and if you haven't already set up some type of

this gang pop ups as would you like to play and you control the character of command you actually have to type in North south east west grab use whatever it may be so have you got nothing to do this weekend you're on Google\nJust ah go ahead and go with the term text adventure\nAnd this story caught my attention over at ... security crazy story that I have to tell you about how voice fishing scams are getting more clever I mean we just heard about a fishing scam with the check well what about if somebody called you and this happened listen to this ... bags into small\nPortland credit union last week he got a call himself from it from an eight hundred number that matched the number that his credit union uses actually got three calls from his credit union the same number in rapid succession\nHe didn't answer the first to just let him go to voicemail but then the third time they called these like oh well this was really be important I should answer\n[noise] so he was greeted by a female voice to explain that his credit union had blocked too phony looking chargers in ... in Ohio made to his debit ATM card [noise] she then read him the last four digits of the credit card that was in his wallet\nIt checked out\nHere we told the lady listen I any replacement card immediately about travel out of state California well the woman on the line said oh don't worry about you keep that card we're just going to simply block any future charges that weren't going to be made in Oregon or California\nOr those the only two states you're going to be and he said yeah I'm just going to California and she said oh not a problem any charges that you make an Oregon or California will be fine\n\nWe're going to freeze the card everywhere else he said well that's a little strange but he figured well you know what she's probably do me a favor [noise] she said you know it just to make sure that everything is on the up and up I just want you to feel comfortable is this your home address because this is where we're going to send the new card when you're done with your trip\nHe says I guess that's my home address including my apartment number everything's perfect ... is this your mother's maiden name and he said uh yeah she said this is the correct spelling of your mother made yeah yeah absolutely\nShe said can you please verify I Need to verify\nThe three digit coat printed on the back of the card in your wallet\nIs this number these three numbers on the back of the credit card that's in your wallet and he said yeah uh yes so at this point everything seem ... pretty legit right\nThen she says so that I can apply the same PIN number to your credit card that I'm mailing out to you I can you give me your PIN number so this way you don't have to go to the bank everything's all just going to work uh and so that your PIN number will be the same PIN number that you have right now and\nHe said oh okay well you know here's my four digit pin the card\nThat he hangs up and then he looks at his account\nThere were two fraudulent charges on account from the date earlier totally three thousand four hundred dollars [noise] there was a twenty nine hundred dollar charge from a Kroger near Atlanta there's a five hundred dollar cash withdrawals from an ATM\nAfter everything was said and done he had just three hundred dollars in his account\nSo what the scammer head was every single thing about him except for the pin\nAnd so by her going through all these gyrations with the card they were able to duplicate the card obviously they had and duplicate of the card she had the number she had everything in front of her but she didn't have the PIN number\nSo by going through every step she had the PIN number isn't that shady Andrew isn't that\nWhat would they
