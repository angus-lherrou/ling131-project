about a range finders and I bought an icon range finder and in the area where I hunt it\nOpen ground and and ... not a tree around a lot of times uh you don't even see the deer closer than a couple of three hundred yards\nAnd my partner and I had went up the Snake River on an earlier hunt and we had seen the biggest back I'd ever been around so he called me up at day or two later and wanted to know if I was still thinking about that one and I said\nThat sure was so I just purchased a new icon for the fourteenth scope and\nMy six and I\nWent out and I added in that night at three hundred and fifty yards and uh we went up there and yet because of the bluff on that side of the river or the deer was he had to cross clear on the other side to even see what was up above\nThe insurer not that big buck was there so he took the quarter mile downriver drop me off I snuck up along the base that bluff crawled up to the top\nAnd he was up there still but it was really hard in the tall grass you couldn't see his legs was way different even in the life size target I had shot at the night before\nJudge the distance but I got my range founder out it was three hundred and sixty two yards and I had a bullet drop compensation scope\nAnd I dropped it with one shot he came tumbling down the hill and I would have never been able to do that without the range fighter 'cause ... shooting up here in the grass and the whole different setting where I cited in my gun or it was really tough to judge just how far away was\n... it actually gives you confidence to make a shot that you might pass up otherwise done\nExactly because I had taken previously were\nLuckily a hundred hundred and fifty yards at the most I just happened to him you know in this open country that doesn't occur very often but I was able to get back and have twice the size\nRack than any of the others I've gotten and if I ever get a bigger one I'm plenty happy with that\nWhat caliber rifle you shooting fix\nPerfect that

okay the company says it caused between six dollars and twelve dollars an hour for the new robot to hit the streets\nQuite frankly in Manhattan I give us thirty minutes because before someone knocks

that's right and twenty sixteen drone came within two hundred feet\nA plane that was approaching LAX\nWhat if that collusion has actually occurred All right Kevin poor man he's with the University of

them\nOh well thank you Jim I appreciate that appreciate that I listen to every weekend so I actually watch\nWell good I'm going to wait you either [laughter] so ah so how can I help you today\nWell I should've minding my own business but you didn't\nI didn't have an acquaintance chew recently\nUh reconnected with a a daughter he had it in a very when he was in the military in Europe okay ah and that was a\nLittle Nineteen Ninety eight she was born in ... and the people in his family are pretty concerned\nAh so I thought I did that old easy buttons and just do a background search on her and she was like a no avail us ...\nOh man so you're good at getting late well wait so so you put so she's what Nineteen she's Twenty years old okay\nAll right so she's Twenty years old and that's right because you said Nineteen Ninety eight um\nYou couldn't really find anything about her like on Instagram or Facebook or anything like that oh I did\nI did I found a a Facebook account that looked like it had ... origins a January twenty Eighteen oh but that's not very much of a social you know not in Iraq\nAnd so so you are trying to do a background check on this young woman so that this way you can tell your friend more about her or you afraid that she's not really the daughter or that she's going to scam ham or well\nAll of the above okay uh she does a prayer for money or they're not rich by any means uh uh the the family just ... but a lot of concerns over this and it's causing trouble in the family so\nI'm sure and then all of a sudden you have a kid coming out of the blue right and you're like okay\nI I'm just a bystander and all that well here are\nGood friend I mean you're worried about right and you want to make sure I was\nI was concerned and at at least so ah I don't like she anybody get hurt\nA ... and and I heard you talk about these things before in a different sites for getting people up but I used to ... dot com yeah his book goes all up and I'm coming up with nothing\nYou know there's also family tree now\nWhere okay you\nMight be able to find something in your family tree now it's supposed to be like where you put your family tree together but it really there's a lot of information they're\nA little and of course much like any other site Jim you have to be careful especially when you look at people searching sites is that what appears to be an actual box that is going to help you find somebody is nothing other than an ad so you really need to\nKeep your wits about you and don't do this if you're having a beer glass of wine okay ... click and other places are and then of course there's the surge which is another place for you to check but I mean if you are really trying to\nTo find information about this young woman is that you know I'm surprised that that\nYou know he can't friend her on social media or somebody that he knows could friend her on social media\nBecause that would be the easiest way you know especially if this is his daughter and so you know what how can and then you could then he can share his credentials with you if you want but he if he wants and then you can start snooping around and see if there's anything else out\nThere yeah I don't think he wants anybody ... thinks oh he doesn't want to know I don't think he wants to know [noise] why\nYou have a we have an uphill battle all around right what does your gut telling you\nMight get is telling me that that she is his daughter and I don't\nThink she's got a very good background and I think she's just out to get what she can get\n... well maybe you know you can do your background search you can see what you can find online\nAnd you know maybe you're just counting your friend on the warning signs things to look out for a you know as far as you know first she's going to ask for ten dollars then it's going to be a hundred dollars you know whatever it may be you know as it goes on I and\nMaybe you know he needs to text you every time that she asked for money so that this where you have a record of it because he's not going to want to remember or it sounds like he's probably not even been a tally and now that I think about that\nThat

you might recommend well here's the good\nOh no I was gonna say you know so here's the deal is that you know he the the the sun is going to know about the tracker okay\nAnd at twelve years old it's probably not a bad idea that the sun does know that there's a track or you know there's really no way to unless unless he could actually get the phone and install this tracker on and not have the kid no right\n[noise] I mean that's another issue okay alright that's sad when there's a a depending on the carriers of rising ... do you know who the carrier is\nA belief that ...\nOkay if the mobile has it to 'em because he's probably paying for the kids' cell phone plan right\nI'm Sorry if he paid for the kids phone\nOkay is that the carriers they also they have something like family located or packages and the ... and it's like ten dollars a month but what I like if it's from the carrier is that not only can he see where the boys that but the boy can see where he's at\nAn okay and if the if\nHe had you know his grandparents where he want to even the normally you can have up to ten people on a plan\nA a you know and you know there's also glimpse which is also something you might want to look at that but not through the carrier and that's G. L. Y. M. PSA glimpse\nAnd clear glimpse works a lot like find my friends but it works across platforms okay and so I Would look at the tea mobile website look at their family ... like I said normally it's like ten dollars a month for up to ten phones or whatever\nAnd then you know the boy can also you know the sun can actually have a sense of security that he knows if something does happen with his mom\nThen everybody's close by and he can see exactly in paying somebody and if not look at that glimpse program that glimpse app rather because I think that'll do the trick to and thanks for your call Chris and I thanks for letting me keep company there on the way home stay right where you are we going to talk about how you can get copies of all the data that apple and Google has on you you're on the ... commando show\nOver the years apps and has earned my trust which is why I'm a committed user and you'll see what I mean when you experience the economical apps an eco tanks forty seven fifty this is a fantastic wireless all in one printer it's my partner choice because it's cartridge free\nAnd comes with up to two years I think right in the box enough to print up to eleven thousand collar pages\nThat's the equivalent of thirty a cartridge set the bar in a run to the store and buy thirty cartridge that it would cost me around Fifteen hundred dollars was ego tank you easily refill the printers ain't tanks and second tank is a Compaq space saving printer that's truly cartridge free it's available everywhere\nMore information at ... dot com slash eco tank camp and for a limited time through November first get free overnight shipping when you use to promote count eco tank came I check out when you buy any eco tank printer\nOffer valid within the forty a contiguous states exclusion so what's your your idea for the new out okay visualize this we start off with the cameras zooming in on the Houston pattern cutters logo\nAs a baby the way we get an aerial shots showing three industrial buildings on the bigger with Eighteen wheelers getting loaded when I'm not sure I Would want to get much better if you have a clip the large Dr Gates did that really wasn't a moving\nIn and out of our over find them and I don't think ... ... ... feet on the idea of wiping bidding anyway ... account\nThough [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nOr how to tell you about one of our great sponsors I'm Talking about be prepared dot com it's your one stop solution for emergencies food water gear and resources visit be prepared dot com slash Kim you know what you're going to be ready for anything not to be prepared dot com slash Kim [noise]\nAlright apple has launched a privacy website this past week it over to privacy died apple dot com I Wonder there and get a copy and download actually er and send you a copy of all the data that they track about you\nIf you use Google and you have the same thing that website is takeout dot Google dot com stay right where you are we have another jam packed fun filled our as she definitely don't want to miss or on the west\nAre multimedia network\nThe caravan\nOf migrants moves closer to the U.S border I'm an Carrick Fox News Mexican agents blocking the Central American migrants briefly before allowing them in the Guatemalan border Fox's William allows you and ask\nAnd so hard or at a start up with money from Tokyo showed off a robot that can pick up toys and can pick up close up the floor and put them in their proper places yeah\nThey're going to sell these robots I could clean up put the dirty place in the dishwasher\nSees objects through built in cameras overtime at wanders around the house takes him and tore up all the household possessions\nOr they say maybe all these robots could help keep the kids entertain so they wouldn't be on the X. box or the eye pad anymore and I know what you're thinking sure I mean I could totally aired without screen time I could also turned my own butter but let's\nAnd I get crazier [noise] All right if you or someone you know as a reader there's a new kitten do paper white that's out of the big deals as you can now take your Kindle and you can read when you're taking a bath that's right so if you drop it in the water\nIt still works Amazon says the new readers the fitness lightest Kendall paper way to ever\nSix inches three hundred and ... where free display or the lighting is now ten percent brighter than before and that they mentioned it's waterproof\nIt can be in water for up to an hour at six and a half feet deep it's I.

fill up spots show up on a map if you need an e v charge the listening show you buy the station what type of plugs charging speeds other business details\nA and so if a business has a charging station available by the way that's going to be lifted too so again if you need an even charge you want to update Google Maps on Iowa west and Android [noise]\nAll right I ran across an interesting story over at the wall Street Journal this past week and the title was you want twenty percent for handing me a muffin\nThe awkward etiquette of I had it\nAnd I don't know if you've noticed it but I certainly have that wherever you go where somebody choosing square and they're on their eye pad or on their phone is that they want to get tips for just about anything out there have you noticed that Andrew\nI'm so glad that you found this dinner bringing this up this is such a pet peeve for me it's on but I don't want to name a possible I don't out your boss will sponsor a future sponsors so I'll just say there's a place it is called bone marrow Brett\n[laughter] I'm Talking in code [laughter] and they have their yesterday [laughter] have amazing\nThe delicious food yes get the Greek salad ... it's the best out I've ever had\nBut every single time they ask you if you would like to tip the person that is just standing there at the register so because of ... era I developed the seven foot wall with that if you have to go farther than seven feet I Will tip you\nBut if you don't [laughter] I Am probably not\nGoing to do that though if you're just taking my credit card writing my apple pay my ... pay\nA farmer's market I bought spinach pasta was\nTwelve dollars for one thing of pasta and they asked they asked for a tip on the app that you tip of course not\nOkay so my hair stylist lovely lovely young woman named Nicole\nAnd you know like a lot of hair stylist she she rents her station right\nAnd so this is pretty much her business well it is for it and what I Love about in the coal is she treats her\nStation like it is a business so she's professional she's on time if I say I need to get my hair done this afternoon show part the water or she'll make it happen in in for somebody her age to have this type of business at command something she uses square\nAnd to you know when you pay and so you don't go to the front desk for anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent\nSo I told her I said you know I said you got this all rock and she's like what do you mean and I said you know research has shown that whatever you put in the middle that's what people are going to tap\nAnd there'll be a certain percentage that will that you can guilt them into going to [laughter] you know the third call which\nIs the goal of all businesses that people out of more money\nSeinfeld I explained to her I said so you know you're married and you got a two and a half year old and a ten month old little pictures up there the kids you know\nAnd they you know and they're trying to get a they need new you know they're getting ready for college and they're cheekbones looking really hungry whatever it may be\nI said seriously research has shown so instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty percent or just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent\nAnd see if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I should so out of work out she goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and some people are gone like thirty percent\nBut the ... isn't that different though because that industry has a history of gratuity\nBut if the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on this great so when you're a bone marrow\nDo you tip yeah really\nI Do that's why they keep asking because people like you keep tipping okay here's the reason why\nGay many many moons ago I worked at ... which is a bar like Houston right and\nAnd when you will eat table and I also waited tables and when I was at a a shoe at a sports bar downtown temp day when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at\nSo if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want\nBut at that but as ... okay but sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in\nAnd said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed\nMe a muffin that if I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nAnd how you can surf the Internet anonymously but oh my gosh you know what I had to tell you you are in for such a special treat because on the phone we have my dear friends Jackie and how [noise]\n\nI mean and so we're we're the road warriors today\nHow are you why are there were a basket there'll\nBeach in California that's just south of half moon bay\nAnd is it is a beautiful there\nWell today the fog Israel and a little bit but it's really nice should be maybe in the low seventies um but it's always got a little chill coming off the water\nAnd now let me tell you something I Can't imagine I don't know why that you chose that over me but for everybody who is not a regular listener Jackie was my assistant for over ten years and she became a dear dear friend of mine and we put up with her husband how just because we have to honor\nThat and they uh they retired they sold all their worldly belongings and they put it in a bus which is how big the\nForty five foot\nAnd behind that you have your hot rod\nYeah well we have a twenty five foot trailer that we call her car and\nAnd which is a\nUm an eighty to ... an oath to core but\nOkay so you've got everything in this way everybody has the picture and um I I thought you guys were coming back to Phoenix I heard\nYeah we are or right after Thanksgiving we're heading that way we're in our last month and a half year\nAnd so what what has been like a really great thing that has happened the last year that you guys been RV\nWell great things I mean every day's an adventure in what we're doing um but I guess one of the highlights a has been for us this year when we got to Wisconsin this year as you know we have ... you don't know we have a full size a refrigerator\nAirbus and if you're ... decided to die when we got to Wisconsin\nThat I have to understand we're up in northern Wisconsin and they are the places are few and far between up there [laughter]\nSo systems to take care of this thing was a quite a challenge and of course we went online and um we got some help from our forum friends that are out there are kind of doing the same thing we're doing\nUm the the question was going to be if we are going to replace this how do we get this thing out of the bus I mean this thing is huge so I'm the last we heard or was that we have to take out the side windows and doors\nAnd pick up outside and basically toss it out the window [laughter] um [laughter] short generally that didn't happen because some very smart person on the Internet said you should check your\nMother board in the refrigerator while it's very possible that if you change the mother board you'd be back in business and sure enough that's what we did\nAnd that was it that was it ... it was\nIt was it was an ordeal et cetera on an eight or eight inch pedestal and of course the things quite heavy so getting it out and even doing the repair it was a challenge but I'm rather interesting but I'm thankful that we've got the Internet in places where we can get some good information\nYou know if you just take your wife out to dinner where you wouldn't need such a big refrigerator [laughter]\nGosh we go out to dinner practically every week\n[laughter] nice [laughter] All right so Andrew but ... I Want you to listen up because how has a technical question that I bet you're you will have input on fill out give us a question\nYeah basically what's happened is we had a bunch of super great movies back from the old days watching the kids go up and some of my early days ranchers which I don't know if I Want everybody to see but we have those digital lives and we're now in possession of\nA stick obviously that's got this information on it we're looking for an F. D. P. side which is a file transfer site or but we can get out for our kids to be able to jump on there and drag that\nTwenty two gig radio are back on to their own computers so that was the best person that we know that knows about all things digital or we decided to call the gym commando show so here you're dealt\nIn so so when the sun is Andrew is that they use like a drop box or something like that right and the money to gig cats huge it's really a huge huge\nHuge and so unless you could you know you can break it out into individual videos right and then you too might be the best place that's what I was thinking too is that you just put it up there and then it can play and then if somebody wants to download it they can download if they want to\nKnow and then you can delete it\nYou want to you or your protective yeah you can protect and put in on it you know with a um a private URL\nOh okay so that is somebody's searching for you know how big adventure [laughter] which we all do\nI mean they are right\nThat they do that has big adventures doesn't quite come up well I totally miss you guys\n[laughter] well we wish you do it's a very much for pleasure glad to talk to you today yeah\nReally break up the files put it up on YouTube and when you guys come back out we're gonna do years three\nOf Hal in Jackie on the road because if you're an RV or they have a lot of lessons that mother board story\nThat they can pass along and they're really really great good godly people and I love them dearly thank you my good friends they right where you are more coming up here on the came commando show [noise]\nNow I don't know about you but someone has been telling me how to brush my teeth all my life parents teachers dentists and all these different technique\nUp and down sideways my dentist says to make sure that however I Do it I should do it for a full two minutes of course Ninety percent of us don't emotional issues worn out toothbrushes to boot\nSo let me introduce you to quit quit the electric it's small light and sleek there's a built in two minute timer that pulses every thirty seconds to remind you to switch sides with quip\nNew brush heads are automatically delivered justice dentist recommend every three months for just five dollars\nTry clip and see why it's backed by more than twenty thousand dental professionals quit starts at just twenty five dollars bats it\nDoes it get quip dot com slash came right now and get your first retail pack for free with any quip electric toothbrush your first refill package free at G.
