with the von in California and Nevada California Hi there John\nHi Ken welcome thank you what's going on um well\nA little confused um we're traveling to Europe next month and my husband and I both have gone to identity theft so I'm very careful about what I Do and I was reading that I probably should have a\nG. P. N. app so and I'm using ... and I'm Wondering how important is that I've researched telling Larry\nEither [laughter] it was good his fat\nDifferently is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on me that that's\nAll right well let's start at the very basic okay is that when you're on a public why everything that you do is like traveling right through the airwaves okay\nSo if you are typing in your bank account and your password your Amazon dot com has whatever may be is that anybody can just pluck that out of the year\nSo and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network is that it's going to use all this sophisticated encryption so it's going to scramble it all up to I was traveling in the airwaves you won't be able just pick it out okay\nAnd so the whole idea behind using the VP an app is that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use\nWhen you are scouting around in Europe where you guys going\nUm we're doing um London, France Amsterdam and Germany\nOh how fun yes can't wait\nI'm so excited for you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're ... this is like the coolest thing you're going to totally ... when you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or paper daily square or whatever it may be\nIs that you hold up your phone and his augmented reality\nSo you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two\nOh my gosh oh it's so cool it's so cool\nAnd then the other thing are ... are you went to like military stuff\nAh my husband is\nOkay there's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to go to the museum which means most most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had to pick like the right cause songs and you know if you could do a food toward any of these that he has to be great anyway back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your line in a souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so uh so you're right there are all these different VPN lose some of them I Can't say on there because like hide your\nWhatever uh then there's Nord VPN and then there's also freedom VPN which they were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of F secure and it's a public company and this is the VPN that I use than it is free of like for example when I was in London last month\nAnd so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a common that show picks but she can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go tell your credit cards that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another app that you need to get its called mobile\nPassport you heard we talk about that I'm no okay you need this app okay just if you don't do anything else and get them out okay All right so you leave the United states you're on your way back there's four hundred and fifty people on the plane right right\nAnd they're all coming down this pipeline all go to go through homeland security\nFor a border patrol now if you have multiple passport on your phone I guarantee you that four hundred and thirty four people are going to be standing in line\nThey do and here's personal cell phone number so tell us what's going on because you have a really cool contest happening\nWe do and thank you Ken for having me um we ... the

you can't buy advertising in you can't do anything else so it's all done by reviews so if you have learned one thing from me over the years just one thing leads me one review go to pod net dot com says contest thunder thanks for\nComing on board with us today and now we've got Laurie in Oklahoma City Oklahoma high there Laurie\nHi Ken welcome\nTo this week I learned that Google Plus we'll be shut down all that stuff on the nineteenth hole that's the bad old for that little spot in search of an online can yeah\nI've heard options including gets hard line dot ... plus horrid dot com coastline dot com and you need a week um or any of these calls\nWinter warning and I'm not looking for the call right now one happy Google was user find a new community by auto\n[noise] so you first of all you're one of the to Google Plus users who were really upset [laughter] they're showing\nA single parent community triple digit membership while griffey immunity good are over forty thousand\nWell you know the reason why I the reason why I say that is Google said that they shut it down not only because they had were going to talk about this and the next hour but they had it open for three years but basically the heads of goals that nobody is using it anyway so it was shut it down so you do have different options there's one side\nOr that you didn't mention is bad it's called the ds for off\nAnd that's D. A. S. P. or a with do use for it looks and it works\nIt acts a lot like Google Plus where um it's a little bit different meaning that you choose a pod as the kind of that's what they call their ... their groups pod so you can create a pod if that's what you want you sign up and then you join the conversation\nUh and then it also integrated into your other social media so if you did want it to everybody on Facebook or on Twitter ... what have you that you had this group going that would be one way there's also another site called steam it and that's S. T. E. M. I. T.\nAnd of course you know there's always read it if you wanted to get into more of a type of a message board feel\nBut all but some links for you over a commando dot com\nAnd if you do to have a Google Plus again like I did and you forgot about it which I did a there are ways that you should shut it down and you can just Google that the delete Google Plus account you haven't done that already\nYou might want to take some time and go ahead and do that within the next couple of days they right where you are we've got some insider secrets on how to get the lowest air fare online you're on the Kim commando show [noise]\nEveryone knows sleep as important especially for your health\nThe mattress you sleep on effects whether you'll have a good night's rest or not and that's why I Want to tell you about my new Casper Sleep mattress I sleep cruel and comfortable every night they should the unique combination of farms that provide the right pressure relief and a line that\nAnd I know that once you try Caspar you're in love yours as much as I Love mind switching to cast a no brainer it's a high quality mattress at an affordable price Casper ships right to your door for free in a small how do they do that size box\nAnd if you don't love it they'll pick it up and refunds you everything sleeping on a mattress is the best way to try it for cash for it to the test of your own home for one hundred night risk free\nGo to Casper dot com bubble ... fifty dollars towards the purchase of select mattresses that's Casper dot com promote Kim and get fifty dollars towards the purchase of select mattresses terms and conditions pie that's Casper dot com ...

multimedia network\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle concerned about the disappearance of a journalist\nIf this guy by the name of Dr Freddie up new see there he's Facebook's official head of health research that's right a giant social media site has a head of health research he wants to large scale access to more granular data he says on patients social and behavioral characteristics\nYou might remember there was a proposal in place or Facebook want it to match up user data and help hospitals figure out what patients might need special care or treatment\nWell Mark and Dr Freddie are gearing up again so I'd stop posting anything about what you eat what you do what you smoke up on Facebook unless it's something like wow you know another great breakfast organic goats and flaxseed and fresh fruit\nAlong with a yummy carrots celery broccoli smoothly I just can't wait for dinner to\nA yummy tofu salad though in the ... probably not [noise]\n[noise] hey also this past week Google had their big product announcement here's what they want you to by surprise surprise to get a brand new set of ... that's right the ... three is one of their brand new phones a five point five minutes just split is going to set you back eight hundred bucks\nThen there's the pixel three ... a six point three inch display starts at nine hundred bucks this is interesting and I got some camera upgrades of course they all do but they have a new color called not pink\n[laughter] what shall we call the color of course not paying that work\nThere is also an official charging stand there is now the slate that's twelve point three inch tablets eight hundred bucks I mean like androids stuff has some check out\nA there's also the home hub this is their smart speaker bolted down hundred and fifty bucks as Ghost Ship on October twenty second comes in green bank not paying a dark gray and white and also has built in you too isn't that fabulous maybe not\nBut this home hub is actually something is really fascinating\nIt's not as robust as Amazon's Alexa but it's a really strong competitor and the reason why I bring this up is that if somebody under shopping list for Christmas and they like Android and Google or something you might wanna check out\nIt's as I mentioned a hundred and fifty dollars but some of the cool things that can do can turn it into a digital picture frame you're not using it there was no camera onboard either so if you're a privacy conscious and keep that in mind\nBut when it is a digital picture frame it taps into all your photos that you have up in the cloud and Google Photos again good Christmas present for those Android folks on your list\nAnd one of the cool things about the new Google products is maybe just maybe a stop to all the robo callers and the scammers because here's the deal the new go Google Pixel phones are going to screen your calls to stop the robo callers and scammers\nAnd Apple's linked to the game but they this past week said oh we're going to kind of have that they filed a patent called detection of spoof call information\nIs going to enable an iPhone to check whether the calls legitimate and if not you can get a call alert no ring no vibrations got a check against established legitimate call parameters but it's not there right now I'm On apple end up getting gear\nAnd speaking of new phones Samsung says we had the greatest phone ever and it may not be for you but it's for the so called Instagram generation it's for the selfie obsessed attract great\nSamsung's new smartphone they say is the world's first a feature not one not to not three but four count them four rear cameras the a nine as a twenty four mega pixel main camera also have a telephoto ultra wide angle and ... is\nA is not cheap it's seven hundred and twenty five bucks [noise] think about a new ad slogan for Samsung shameless self promotion isn't under appreciated art form\nLet's fix that Sampson we've been putting out fires for years [noise] All right this final story is a total mystery\nThink about this if you're wearing a smart watch is keeping track of your beats per minute well how exactly does that work what is going on why would a fitness tracker detect a beating heart on a roll of\nToilet paper that's what you heard me right a roll of toilet paper if you put your smart\nOn a roll of toilet paper it will say that it's beating eighty one beats per minute\nI tried it out myself Chinese tech site advocates report this past week the toilet paper is having a viral moment because fitness tracker owners have discovered they just play a heart rate when attached to her role\nThey also tested others cylinder objects a bottle a can a banana even an appendage of a stuffed animal all of which showed this mysterious phantom heart rate like\nAs I mentioned the toilet paper a BPL of eighty one a coffee mug at a beep PM of Seventy two banana Seventy two beats per minute [noise]\nAnd it's not just other fitness trackers also the apple

E. three four are okay that's the top row and the bottom row and you walk with your fingers across ...\nAnd then some people they make it more difficult so instead of going down to ... to rose they'll go down three\nRight that's the actually the the third most popular is one Q A V. to W. S. X. which is the first two rows\nAnd let me tell you something if you were just look at that as a password you'd be like that's a darn good password exactly because it's not a word in the dictionary got word at all and it's got like a couple of letters you know\nOr some some a haiku you know a gang symbol for most you know things like that and the and that's the deal but I think so many of us are getting tired of passwords oh I'm Sorry I don't I mean and then you know so let's say you don't know your password well then you have to go through the whole password reset\n... what was your or second grade teacher his middle name\nUh [laughter] well that's the way to\nTo step verification is so great especially Yahoo I mean I don't know how many people are actually still using a Yahoo account but I Am for fantasy football and ... only use it for fantasy football so every single year obviously I forget my Yahoo password 'cause it's been six months and they used it\nBut if I have an a Yahoo app on my phone they send me a message through the ... and I can get in yeah and that's really the off yeah the two factor authentication is easy I mean and it really is and we look at people

website over at pot net dot com once again that's ... net dot com and back to the phones we go with Tom\nIn Peoria, Illinois hello there Thomas\nHello Hi welcome what's going on\nWell the question I had to do with a if any if you could recommend a website or a resource that folks in something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise] ah\nSo you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver as that what's happening\nYeah that's part of it yeah or I I end up using an app or using a program to to accomplish the task I get done and I go visit their an easier way to do that\nOr maybe an example okay we babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday Spanish so I thought it would be cool to make a little book at the end of the summer the shit here's what I Do to grandma's house on Tuesday perfect\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in touch it ended up being thirty five pages long about fifty to sixty photos but it was a short it was really hard you know what I thought it was like there are publishing program that maybe could have helped me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now there it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nAh there are sites like ours that will do round up so say you know here at ten great photo apps but we would only hit ten out of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available I see\nIf you're looking for a particular app you can always read the reviews people are brutally honest about what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew a you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yes we're shuttle flight you shutter flies at\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that a huge these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nOne of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book no yes and we got it and 'cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word ... called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular app that only does one task is that you might want to look at okay\nUh what is it there's Henri that work and work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form about those pages and getting that that\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kind of fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you created the animated book that that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures they re communicated back and forth on fiber they ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to come to take months to make those animation\nAnd so so in the next time you have a task putting in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh call us\nOkay okay [laughter] okay I mean that's why we're

like well with me the best ... that I can find full small medical office\nAnd also what I was looking at it that was old or a I'm a software that you are just and then the field that search engine optimization ethical would all all all ...\nAll right well let's talk a little bit too so what's going on with your business on line\n[noise] well the problem with them or if it's obviously was most businesses have as you know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out of the bad reviews balance it out\nBut obviously it doesn't work that way you know the people have experience it's usually doesn't go online and foot post there the\nPositive experiences have what you at your business [noise] so what am I here mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses to what I Need to do it by something someone to neutralize the negative responses that happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation type\nManagement farm okay [noise] is I Would encourage you to do this yourself because\nYou are may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do with and then you will further understand how this all works okay because as it as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too\nIs that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody do the job when you've already done the job right but\nAnd so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp or where where is it\nSo I'm Glad for all the\nMedical it's like ... grade the current\nOkay all they need they use excel\nOkay so okay a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nSo anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews the with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay but because I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for you\nKnow if they had a great time they're happy to do that\nAnd you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before you say you know can you help on line and\nJust dropped somebody rep in there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now outweighing the negative reviews okay okay so that's the ... the other thing you can get let me finish\nThe other thing you can do is with health grades is drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it\nAnd what I have heard is that when you do this is that health grades will remove it health grades also has a program called recognize Dr status\nAnd that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay um there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam I get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business you'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to accentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization", "show_name": "Kim Komando Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "15"}
