[noise]\n... early total home don't run away from all hanging harmful\n[noise]\n\nBack\nIn time rational here with a re Elgin words looks at her looking at some stories and lose one of them is this a Hurricane Florence has about the hammer or North Carolina is one of those deals where uh people\nSee of what's happening with guns well you know what we've got to watch it it uh during Hurricane Katrina when everything stops there's no support network has no police there's ... there's nobody there to help your ... your on your own\nAnd a lot of people look that went honey I think maybe we ought to buy a gun you think absolutely you know it's like okay what are we going to do and I was asked people what your plant where do you go to will will will call for help well first of all the cell phones are not going to work 'cause all the towers are down\nThere's no electricity and oh yeah just like Katrina the police are not there anymore either right you're just there so you know if you and I'm not saying you have to arm your to your take on the world\nBut it's probably not a bad idea to think about things like that and it's a multi level preparedness you know you've got your water you got your food you got to know your firearms ...\nToilet paper emergencies done serious but I got to have that\nSo yeah if you're if you're in the past there take it seriously\nOr get ready right now like as in today before the sun goes down serious about it because uh twenty four hours before it hits there's nothing left on the trend in stores that's exactly right you know it just just that way trust me as a Louisiana resident I can attest to all that and I can also tell you how to get rid of hurricanes\nI was at about four years ago I bought a big hole house\nGenerator ha we've not had hurricane since I\nAll prepared I'm ready for a man with the power goes out we're there everybody's going to hunker down at my house that makes them it's like having number Elena never rain that that ... as\nIt is magic deal I'm right we're talking one of the things about the quality of guns and try to explain to people you don't understand it may be seeing the machinery that's got a lot to do with oh of course it does yes because you don't rely on hand people\nWe used to have artist and then it got hard to get artisans because you couldn't find anybody who's willing to apprentice for ten years straight to learn how to make stuff because I Want it right now which might break you know and so uh would have CNC machines they make parts that are absolutely interchangeable I mean\nIt's hard to say it was perfect but they're pretty darn close to perfect\nWell it some more so than others but at the end the overall average of quality has gone up so exponentially it's ... it's just insane and ah yeah now you're you're you're going to find one this maybe not this perfect measure the odds are so much better today than they were\nWell and if you do have a problem if you do have something that's not working right the other thing that's happened is that I Know your days loophole Lebanon phenomenal guarantee but that's pretty much true across the board now if you're with a gun maker has product and it happens they get out and go hey this is not working I\nAlways tell people don't complain to everybody called the company because they want to fix it exactly and if you're going to know if you're on your facts or you want to know\nHa ha or the or seen the world is for somebody to tell all of his friends for the next two months about how bad this was one of a single phone call goes out the whole problem\nAnd it's amazing people said well what are they going to they're going to send a box is it going to send a shipping label you're going to be able to send it to them for free exactly we'll fix it or replace it and they will send it back to you know it's amazing that you give them a chance to make it right\nIt's a no brainer actually but the sometimes it will just would rather complain\nBut at work and they don't know that you know what I could use to get the run around and they don't realize you know pretty much in the farms industry people are going to take care of you\nI think so yes exactly very few exceptions to that All right tell you what if you'd like to be part of the aftershocks race going to hang around if you want to talk with us give us a call right now eight six six talk going we're good junior just Tom talked gun\nIf you've ever listened to after shuttle shame on you crazy [laughter]\nYou got to get the gun dealer you out it's free

glasses backwards it can read your mind\nAll right maybe not All right I ran across this next story over at the New York times I\nThink about this data collection speaking of technology\nHow much do you think your personal data is worth I mean everything that you do every website that you visited everywhere you go the TV shows that you watch the products that you buy it's all fair game for advertisers now even when you take the kids temperatures listen to this\nThis flu season Clorox paid kitten so\nIt's a tech startup that sells Internet connected thermometers now these aren't the Mummers we used to have his kids like you know mercury Glasser monitors\nThis smart throughout murder will sync up with a smartphone app that allows you to track fevers and symptoms okay get this\nThe data shows Clorox which ZIP codes around the country have increases in fevers\nClorox then directs more advertisement to those areas assuming that house oh they're going to be the market for products like what do you think this infecting wipes yes you follow me Kansas says they have sold more than five hundred thousands thermometers\nAnd the data's coming right out I'm In real time people don't have to visit a doctor to search for symptoms on Google or post something on Facebook about being sick\nSo now Ken the is selling its data other companies pharmacies manufacture distribute medicines cough cold products right to the retailers show hasn't this genius sell a product that collects data that you can then sell and\nMake even more money we should have thought about this [noise]\nOr I

tied to the data breaches whatever that may be you could be eligible for compensation small businesses are they're paid users will be eligible for twenty five percent refund for any fees paid during that time\nSo here's the deal I was going to pay up to eighty five million dollars to settle this class action lawsuit that includes fifty million for compensation for up to two hundred million affected folks plus another thirty five million for the lawyers so the lawyers are getting thirty five million\nOr the two hundred million effective users are getting five hundred million so uh to the

news\nIs that the next week a on the thirtieth of October I mentioned briefly during the news segment at the beginning of this hour\nIsn't it yeah is that apple is set to release a Mac will care for okay they say under a thousand dollars but you know the prices on you know yes exactly [laughter] ...\n... yeah I Know I hate when people do that it's like under a thousand dollars of thought to say yes it's nine hundred and Ninety nine dollars right\nA little tough and so you know and your other options that you look at refer\nA and\nSo if you go over to apple dot com and you have to actually ... to the bottom of the page crack and then there's an option and the second comment says refurbished and clearance\nIs that you I think you might be able to start looking and you know you look this weekend but you know as more people are buying the newer stuff they're going to be trading and the older stuff right\nOr selling the older stuff whatever may be and so what I live with you by refer golfer apple is that it tells you like for example what what year was this Mac book released and then if the screen has to be replaced they do that at all so still comes with a one year guaranteeing warranty\nAnd so you still have that but it's still going to be you know you're still looking for you know twelve fourteen hundred bucks\nOh she living it let me ask you a question I talked to a guy

and things like that but then\nIt may it got me thinking about other things that millennials and guaranteed generations ears are not going to understand or ever use correct one of the first things that I think would be is is interesting and my son is experiencing this right now is television commercials\nMy son watches everything on your trip right he doesn't\nKnow what cable television is it's all YouTube but then we hook up the ... and we're going to watch Sunday Night Football\nAnd it goes to commercial things like what's going on here so we just kept us can we've asked for this you know
