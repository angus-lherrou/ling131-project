{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Um and so in this market to identify that it is the the capital resources and versus the actual asset mhm I'm is pretty critical\nAnd I'm not sure anyone other rooms here in in Texas that they're teaching that I\nI I think that's a good point one of the things I here's why I think that's different because people are get attracted to the things that we're doing our folks that are that are either in it or they're about to start doing it and they recognize that they're already in the network where all the deals are taking place\nSo when you are naturally amongst a a group of folks who are doing the deals that works out we're really looking for capital of the way I like to to to put these things into buckets is\nYou really got a you've got the business side of this and you have the investments sort of the side of real estate is slipping into selling\nAnd then they're investing side of this business is lending and being a landlord buying hold for the long term\nAnd when you look at marketing I'm marketing for what will it depends on what you're doing if you are looking for flips at wholesale deals your marketing for deals your marketing for sellers real estate agent wholesaler homeowner or whatever\nIf I'm a lender or I'm acting as a landlord when I'm really marketing for is dollars is money it's capital\nThat's why those two things are so different when you get in a room and it's mixed up with wholesalers and lenders and buying whole landlords and flippers and all that everybody starts talking marketing there's all this confusion because they're not even marketing to the same thing right\nRight well like I was a plumber marketing for his business yeah yeah totally different that's right on the retail customers right oh\nYeah so it it's it's interesting to to identify that marketplace and that is\nThe issue up here and I I Would say it's it's much different in Southern California yeah I think a lot of cheap money out there are things you and ate pretty standard hard money out there and just point if you have experience\nYou can find private lenders for [noise] you know six percent or so and so it's you can work that it's just finding the actual property yeah versus here there are\nThere are all over the place the number one investment opportunity in the country right now she's just I'll just crazy how many deals are sort of watch that break down as kinda understand the conversation then the ... for us to sort of shift a little bit and say OK so\nGlad we asked right so yeah the things we do in our classes is that first half hours where do you want to learn this weekend mhm\nLike you paid money to be here you gave up your weekend it was a beautiful weekend here in Tom's phenomenal right and so let me make sure that you walk away with everything that you were looking for and so again I don't know how other people do those rooms anymore but for us if you come to our room\nWe're going to put a whole bunch of list of questions and when I go over those questions throughout the course of the weekend\nAnd we try and stay on the script and try and stay on time um and go through it but we found out as a ... and people were looking for the money mhm and uh\nSo that tells you that there is a obviously great opportunity in this market 'cause the deals are usually the hard part mhm um I Would say probably in Dallas it's it's inverse to that run you probably harder to find a deal the news to find the money in Dallas so [noise]\nUm it's an understanding that market is critical mhm it's truly truly truly critical to understand if you're on a\nUm you know where you're in a buyer's market and you're in a seller's market\nRight cause that where it all starts and for us we taught marketing\nBecause now hey we're we're in a good market here ah for buyers yeah right so we're going to show you how to get the capitals so you can become a more powerful Barnes marketplace um again so having that local based understanding when we do these educations is critical\nVersus someone coming out of North Carolina to teach me about yes options\nVida by some do it's like what a waste of time you know the other thing I'll I'll say too as as a real estate investor matures\nThey don't they don't have a need to find deals you know there as they mature they're able to find just by networking right or anything a part of our group they there's deals there right\nSo really does come down to hey where do I find the best capital and they're not talking about how do I find money there's money everywhere but how do I find money that works for the deal\nWorks for my my goals and the length of time\nFlorida yeah for double for double capital what the right terms and all that other stuff and so you know there's those two sides of this thing when you're first starting now you're looking for deals and once you get the deal thing figure it out and you're like oh any more money\nWhich is a good thing right that's a good thing when you go oh any more money um\nThat does it cost me an arm and a leg I think the the best place to do all that are courses over the American real estate meet up where we do have the local intelligence we've got the local market intelligence we've got what's going on in your some market and your networking with a handful of folks in there that are all doing it and again when people are in the mastermind\nSection is I Can't find money off of the ... exactly how we do yeah there's no secret here go do this ... and we share for those in those masterminds and so we want everyone to be success arouse more successful [noise]\nListen if we can create a hundred successful people out of that sugar land a real estate group\nThere'll be a

little a little give away to help people get started but a lot of people look at it as an there's more risk and the thing is is there's not more risk and in some cases there's actually less risk and embarrassed market than in a ... market\nBut one of the things that we can do to help people get started Larry's we get a big stack of tickets here for our show today\nWe say we give away some passes to one of these have take classes definitely especially if there's somebody out there that now believes they hit a point in their lives when they realized they deserve more we got to we've got to help

down or whether the markets are going sideways\nAnd it just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving

Hansi retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is\nEight eight eight six six to eight seven to three that said it eight six six to eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but it hit us up at Houston oh TA dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nBut Larry that's one of the things I think people kind of miss on in a down market as it is we think oh it must be more risky and in some cases it's actually you can prove it out to be far less risky in a down market with how margin and different things work but at the same time\nAnything that we don't understand we're usually afraid of it isn't it just mainly fear that holds people back from accomplishing their goal so absolutely you know and in fact\nI'll share a story I sure what my students Jim the other day it was funny we were talking about this whole concept of fear of leaving a job\nAnd the worst thing that ever happens to any of us especially if you're listening is it all of a sudden you start working for someone else and then your net worth is tied up and to what other people define it to be let me explain what I'm Talking about Ryan so yeah I remember the old story of the frog and a frog can jump as high as it possibly wants to\nBut if you want a frog in a box and you put a lid on top of that box and all of a sudden the frog charge a couple of times to jump\nBut hits the lead even when you take the little way the frogs still will not jump higher than it could be for and that's kind of most of us out there we start getting into these routes we're relying on a paycheck for somebody else we start to believe we can't make any more money and what's great what Jim is ... and a lot of other students\nAnd we've been doing this for over Twenty years right now is that feeling of when you first start making more money than you do at work\nBecause then all the sunnier this frog again you can jump very very high and all of a sudden that cap that you've been believing your whole life has gone away\nAnd that's the sad part right now 'cause most people out there are stressed out that they have to stand a job they have no other outcome or vehicle when reality you can go ahead and you can short the markets\nGreat analogy like when I use is each week and I like using it as well I've said this over and over again when you're learning how to short the market meaning you're able to trade when the market goes down\nVery legal coach ... and the great part about it is I think of yourself in a car right now and you know you want to go somewhere but if the car only one and drive and never went in reverse\nYou can eventually get there it's not going to be cost efficient for gas or time but you'll have actually get there where why would you want to do that\nPeople do that everyday Ryan with their trading they're only looking on the markets to go higher and as you said when the markets go lower it could be an opportunity to buy at a discounted doesn't always mean there's a problem with the stock\nYeah absolutely right there there's opportunities all over the place and and I love what you're talking about what the frog because 'cause it it it you know teaching a class last night and I have another session with with the same group tonight\nAnd you know I was talking about how a lot of the the the obstacles that we have to overcome our mental right and and what you're talking about the frog hitting its head on the boxing you move the box and all of a sudden they can jump up\nIt is that it it is that feeling that we're putting on ourselves right and we we have the whole oh ... I Can't do that type of a conversation I have a five year old son who who over and over the the word I Can't or or just not even really allowed in our house because we do start to put\nThose uh would you start to put those binders on us and and make it so that we realize oh if I jump high it's gonna it's gonna hurt my head as we stop even trying you know a while ago they are you know I'm ... years and years ago they said it was physically impossible to run a four minute mile a this ... about a week ago there was the world championships for Iron Man and Kona\nAnd the the winter and about a six minute mile for twenty six miles after doing a hundred mile bike ride wow if you can't run a four minute mile you're you're not even on Olympic lipic track and field team anymore at least one for a minute mile not not to mention back to back to back straight\nSo so so these these these these restraints that we put on ourselves we also put on our finances and we end up kind of\nPainting that our own picture that we end up residing in it and if you're if you're willing to kind of challenge the norm and you're willing to put in a little more effort\nOr a lot can be granted to you and it really just does come from getting started and putting a little bit more effort in but we could help a few more people get started we've got a stack of tickets you of the show is just beginning what are you say we do know that give away let's do it\nRight now we've got half day class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to really generate that consistent income in the market whether the market's going up down or sideways\nNow in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these classes and so if you're driving now is a good time to pull over and get that phone ready included with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit it's packed with lessons from some are top instructors now the professional insiders kids critical because it makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty we need you to call now and reserve those seats the number is\nEight eight eight six six to eight seven to three that dated eight six six to eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at Houston oh TA dot com and see if you can score some passes there we're up against the clock Larry what do you have a\nForce next you know lots of students keep asking us all the time half I'm looking to make more\nIncome does that mean I have to get more jobs and the answer is absolutely no let's talk about that back multiple streams of income on the other side of the break with Ryan and Larry [noise]\nAt online training academy our mission is to offer exceptional financial education so you could live the life you've always wanted maybe it's just having that peace of mind so you don't have to worry so much about the bills or even just having the luxury of not working so hard\nTo have more time to spend with the family graduates of online training academy share but there's all kinds of stories here's one one racing graduate had to say\nI bar tended at a casino basically they're open twenty four hours a day seven days a week and so I hadn't had a Christmas often maybe eight years and I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different of needed time I needed my life\nAnother student says ... al ... and try to get something that I had always wanted to death and ... as I said that but at a chemical or start that changed my life I\nLearned more visitors on line at Houston O T H ... that Houston oh T.

A. dot com that's Houston oh T. A. dot com\n[noise] you're listening to power trading radio now back to the show [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in humid Larry Jacobs director instructor development and half instructor it online training academy really shed some light on different income streams of side of the market we're talking a little bit about passive income we're talking about active\nAnd can we were talking about making money out of money not time is money money is money right and having our money working harder for us the average millionaire and we we learned and I both flip through this article a little while ago and there there was a report on how the average millionaire has\nFive or more streams of income out there in those multiple streams of income or really what create that financial freedom that everybody's after right not just that one source and that one source of income when you have that sole source that is why\nJobs stance jail we'll be right stands for just over broke as if we're just relying on it we are just over broke because if it goes away we're in a world of hurt well in this segment here we wanted to spend a little bit of time on retirement accounts\nThe markets have been super volatile right we've had a big us we've had big downs and so what can we do to protect those retirement accounts and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe been with us for the whole show get excited\nThe best is yet to come and Larry whenever I'm Talking with a lot of our listeners sometimes to be a social media\nAnd a lot of them when it comes to retirement accounts are saying number one they're saying they don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire or just not quite sure really what they should be doing with it so it's kind of a consolidated message that you can or individual messages whichever direction you'd like to take it\nThat that you and your instructor team early giving to those people who are concerned about their retirement accounts especially with the with the big drop we had in the market the other day well the simple thing I Would share with our audience\nIs the cavalry ain't come and there's nobody is going to protect your capital better than you can right now in the way to do that with education\nI mean right now statistically about every ten years the market has corrected we saw fifty percent correction in two thousand uh fifty eight percent correction in two thousand eight\nWho's to say we might not see a sixty four sixty seven percent correction in the market imagine your four O. one K. becoming a one oh one K. and the reason for this is\nThis is the first generation right now that it's been subjected to market fluctuations in your retirement accounts\nThink about it prior you had pensions that was completely outside of the market you're basically boss put aside their profits or payroll to make sure you had a retirement account and right now that's gone away you're completely dependent upon your four O. one K. and he's just scary\nThought Ryan you know I've talked about this all the time\nRight now people have been told and I've been doing this pretty pretty habitually of putting money into their retirement account every two weeks when they get paid but here's the big problem and I want everyone to listen to this 'cause it's kind of scary right now is that you've been putting money into this market the last three years at an all time highs\nNot when the market was low so imagine when there's another correction the first money that's going to come out is the most expensive amount of money that you've been saving towards retirement\nA lot of our students come in they want to learn the right way to be able to preserve capital how to make sure they're in the right funds when they're putting on their trades to be able to maximize for their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term\nIt's always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and that was one of the topics were ahead of my class last night is is the markets don't change the marks don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape but getting printed off right but the market still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high\nAnd somewhere along the lines we kind of got distracted from that and I think the average investors out they're investing their money on payday and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so if we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price\nIt's pretty much impossible for us to make any money now one of the fun things about the markets whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income account\nIt's it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this\nWhole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or or things that we want to be invested in rather than being invested in the right things and and uh there's this guy Dan that ah when I first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects\nAnd Dan used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a a little story to help you remember it I won't share though there\nWas just kind of funny you say you can't let her stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you're invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is if you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially investigating of this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about us at all and then honestly why would they write and Larry you're talking about\nYou know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are\nAnd and it's it is true and the reason\nThat I firmly believe that it's because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of Mike accept for me and so in the end as kind of courses that can sound\nNobody cares right there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going men I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who is closing their retirement status\nPerpetual kind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person has many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person spent\nGetting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart and we go well he's the professional in the situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up ah falling behind the eight ball and the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that 'cause we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have their class coming up in your area that the costs of where you see exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half the class including with your past is going to be our professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now\n... when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is\nEight eight eight six six to eight seven to three that dated eight six six to eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but it hit us up at Houston oh TA dot com and see if you can score some passes there are now Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside\nBut also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down\nAbsolutely a little out of our students have figured out they can use other type of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market isn't a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth they can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they come to this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for this correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are\nFrantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives a lot of people don't understand that again the markets go down there is an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices of stocks when they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over
