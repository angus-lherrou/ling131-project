{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "And what they don't realize is all of these really great loan programs that are out there\nThey have that paraded in two thousand eight the credit market actually crashed not really the real estate market the credit market collapsed\nNow the problem is where you gonna find the money oh there's all these deals where I Can't find the money well does it really matter if you get your clothes and\nI Can't tell you how many stores or heard about people that casually properties that were doing very very well in the bank said hey it's time to re fi we're not going to give you the same loan mhm we're not going to give you alone at all\nAt all so that with a lot of multi\nFamily family yeah yeah so that that happens and I don't I don't think we're in that market I think we're in a really good marketing and I think it's time to buy some real estate and that's what I'm I'm you know my wife and I are doing\nYou know what's interesting is when you look at a lot of the national economists especially when they start talking about real estate I see everybody's eyes are on a crash\nBut if you remember back to two thousand sixty thousand seven very few people were tired of fresh yeah so\nI Am I'm a I'm always counter to what the what the you know ... the prevailing thought is yeah and if everybody's thinking crash and crashes automatic practitioners crash I'm like uh maybe the black swan here is it's not a crash it's actually rapid appreciation for the next five to seven\nYears [noise] and you know sort of deal the\nUm so it's a little differently Joe Kennedy right before the great crash and Wally ... shine guys shine issues that's right you know hey I'm going to go out and give cash or my stops the my family and I are in the stock market and he was like whoa whoa what she's young guys you shine guys in the stock market there is a problem right and you know\nAnd then showing cherry a good friend of mine he he feels differently like\nHe was getting his hair done ... and his style is was talking about the flip so she's doing and he was like wait when the\nHairstylist who he was in a way to live in Phoenix bloodbath out ah as well you should read the sign like when the hairstylist is is doing flips and we probably have an issue and let the markets just to soften the whole\nWell I'll I'll tell you the most in and I'll make it his family oriented as I can and most important scene in the big short is when a\nI think it's Michael brewery is at the gentleman's club in Florida yeah they're looking at all those condos and they end up because their investment bankers and that's just what they do a so they're at this club and their tax there talking to one of the uh\nUh employees there and he starts talking to her about loans and he says oh yeah you're condo she says\nOh no I got eight condos in warehouses and he's the guy he looks at the guy says we're leaving right now they jump on the plane was black yeah there was above all we got to figure out I mean if if if these very unsophisticated people are buying real estate then it's time to get out and I don't see a lot of that no I don't think so\nYeah when you when you hear what am I Wish I could find it Chris Hansen interviewing\nA a real estate investor use that term lightly on on a sixty six I think it was sixty minutes and they're sitting on the balcony and when these unfinished buildings in Miami Dade right Miami Dade County I think he was in Miami a and they're having this conversation he says if she's a a they don't tell you till the end but he says\nSo you know what do you know about real estate oh I was just buying stuff and I was flipping these contracts for fifty grand and was making more and more money goes well what did you know about this how about interest rates and how does that affect this she's like\nYeah I didn't know any of that I just knew if I kept do this I was making money said well what exactly do you do for a living she says I'm a nurse and they just like cut ... and they go to the end you're like oh my gosh these people were literally leveraging millions and millions of dollars sometimes their friends money IRA money that's sort of thing\nAnd they just they weren't very sophisticated they just knew if I bought it it would go up in price now\nHere's a very scary ah ah here's a very scary similar situation when I talk to people about investing in the stock market I hear the exact same thing as I heard two thousand eight\nFrom real estate investors I hear I don't know I just put more money in the Amazon to put more money and apple put more money than Netflix which Netflix today is that it's a bloodbath but I just put more money and it's worth more well why is it worth more I don't know I just put more money in well what are you telling me you don't understand why it's making why it's worth more no I just do I put more money and it's worth more\nAnd I hear that more often in the capital markets than I Do in real estate yes but the people were investing in real estate very sophisticated we've got you know those are the lenders\nA very sophisticated they want you know quadruple documentation and they want you know blood work in your first born before they ever do alone right there's so much for the paper works ridiculous and ... to right now I'm just a you know I'm I'm given blood or here but [noise]\nBut that's very different the two thousand eight and when I look at what somebody says there's a crash coming in real estate I'm like are you sure because when I go over to the stock market I go to the capital markets side all I here's put money in and make money money comes out like it's a slot machine and I know when that starts at an asset class there is a problem\nI see in a multi family too when I see the multi family all let me just put money in and\nI just up the rats that I Do a little bit of rehab on the front and up for new driveways and all of a sudden I'm going to make a million dollars I'm seeing that that is that I'll tell you right now that's absolutely happening there's a lot of people and multi family they're doing really really well but at some point that's going to stop [laughter]\nIt was a gentleman strategy we met in Dallas for multi family he was just by everything at Seventy per se if he could get his casual the cover oh seven percent of his cash flow covered his cover the whole\nSexually everything's so such he was running a thirty percent margin thirty percent Marta which I thought it was which is ... right so I asked him I said because he he's listening to the show and all that he goes I Know you back on multi family but here's my business model\nAnd I said that is brilliant and then I said when was the last time we bought an apartment complex he was about four years ago and I thought that yes [laughter] he said they'll but it's really great asset class I'm like yeah if you run on thirty per cent martinis yes it's it well almost anything is on a third well why why does our lender wanna ds your one point two five\nYou have to have a twenty five percent margin to cover the debt and all your other expenses right there's a reason that now when that ratio goes to one\nOr less than one and they're just throwing money at people just to go do real estate that's when you know it's all they want to hire just portfolios that's the one point for it right yeah yeah absolutely you know make a forty percent margin I professors right\nSo this is Robert Jason were from Merck and real estate meet up we would love to catch you guys at one of our meetings out there or go to American uh R.

Fox News how Florida Man accused of sending homemade bombs to several prominent Democrats in federal custody this morning\nIs meaning that there is a position that prompts on the way up and there's also protection or even a position to make a profit on the way down and so when you start looking at things as far as the market's going there's multiple directions in the market the up down and the sideways\nIt's critical to make sure that we have strategies kind of like the hedged mentality that can make money if the markets are going up down her sideways and you're one of the things I talked about in one of my classes a long time ago was or wasn't imagine if you went to work and they said hey you know what\nWe really like you you're a great candidate we think you'd be a great fit for the company\nBut you can expect to be laid off one third of the time one third of the time we're not going to pay a\nYou know and that's really what happens if we're only trading any bullish direction anytime the markets are going sideways our retirement account or income account is laid off\nAnytime the markets are going down a retirement account or income account as is laid off not to not to even bring up the fact that maybe it's it's deteriorating a little bit especially as the markets are going down\nBut one of the things that we can do is always okay with you Larry one of the things that we can do is we have a big stack of tickets right here we are just kicking the show off we've got a bunch of tickets we can give away and we can help a few people out there get started becoming more consistent in the market by by doing a quick little give away for these passes that are too are half the class is what do you say let's do it\nAll right well right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area that have their classes while you'll see exactly what it takes\nThe market's just into the market making money generate more income as the market's going up down\nOr sideways now the happy classes about three hours long and if you would have set a passes to these half day classes that is going to be your investment just a little bit of time spent three hours of your time any financial education scenario rather than maybe on social media or watching TV sounds like a good investment\nTo me well just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of these passes or one of the half day classes to get your bones ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluded with your passage is going to be a professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is a much much more the professional inside of it makes it so you can get started right now\nGoes century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is\nEight eight eight six six to eight seven to three that dated eight six six to eight seven to three\nIf you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but it hit us up at Houston oh T. A. dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nThere is we stay on kind of this consistency track because of this this consistency conversation I should say you know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money as the market going down\nWhat are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bonds but how 'bout diversification as far as different directional vehicles go\nWell you can always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people pulling out of the markets the Marty money's going somewhere either go into gold\nIt can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here is it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before we teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock short bond short gold shark\nThey're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is\nIs that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing will last February Goldman Sachs may two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shortening the market now imagine that we just have a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy you know but if you start to learn how to trade like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make your money and not have to sit there and think about a second job when again tell but later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up\nIt's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou're going to go in a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you could waste a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection ... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter what the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car and there's so many so many other analogies that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life\nIn our normal everyday life we there's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where was how to balance a checkbook class writes a lot of the checkbook most right\nI just dated myself victory over there but it is it is true though I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to do rely on the quote unquote professionals really guide us through this process where unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's\nThat's what they do for a living your real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to it was up to the individual to make sure that they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nHasn't ... they they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner\nThan they do analyzing what investments to to select it it just puts his behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more of these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a great idea let's do it All right well right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area\nThey have to classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to generate more consistent income in the market\nUnderstand how the market works I understand what the risks are involved with a lot of different investments out there and really how to capitalize capitalize on the upside now they have to classes about three hours long\nAnd so you'll be investing three hours of your time to really raise that financial IQ start getting better and returns on your investments now just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passage where these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes it's going to be

A. dot com\n[noise] you're listening to power trading radio now back to the show\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs director of instructive element and housing structure it online training Kenyan really shed some light on multiple streams of income a little bit of a passive income we talk a little bit about active income and then specifically spend\nA lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the the the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus dreams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but but even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago Larry about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later and so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right I mean how many times have you talked to a a a surgeon and they said oh you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm In a practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill just doesn't really work that way we've got to have the skill first otherwise that operating table can be a dangerous spot to be laying\nNow unfortunately it ends up being that same the same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nBut really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this\nJust as seriously we work too hard for this money to have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just because it's paid and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money in our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing a bearish market which was what you were just touching on his right as we were going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets there deteriorating and it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talked to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right naturally that point you were getting at a before he took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of giving you the floor here to take that back over border some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nRight and the number one mistake that most people may cause they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting nervous now one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because historically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen so what's now becoming more important than ever\nIs it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now well you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nOther asset types like futures in ... and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is well I got the mortgage I got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teach her students read out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nAnd you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big ups in the big dams and we do generally have a crash about every and we call 'em crashes but we do generally\nHave a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that is if you go back and look at um how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that you got about a fifty percent drum Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty St yep same thing\nAnd so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about ah we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account and\nThey lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in one year and that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down\nWhen they take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty to take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now to leave it at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYep absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow is get them out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the cost of ... exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow to identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation on just a second you have a chance to win instead of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving\nRight now is a great time to pull over included with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now ... through twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is\nEight eight eight six six to
