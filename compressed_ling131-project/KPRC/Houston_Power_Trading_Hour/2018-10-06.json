{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Was over fifty thousand dollars of equity I always making Ninety One thousand dollars a month and cash flow and have a net worth of nearly an additional eleven million dollars and that was the melt down when I realized that on stage\nI just I was like you got to be ... I get off stage I get on the phone call a business partner and I said I don't know what else we are doing but we need to immediately stop all this whole selling and flipping and go right into buying hold\nLike there's no ... to me there's no choice there's really no choice if you've got decent credit you got some money I don't see why you don't buy these things and hold onto them below two hundred thousand dollars\nThere appreciating so rapidly because there's no wins and tore and rents are continuing to rise particularly for single family rental properties because multi families getting really expensive to live in and there's just not enough of it\nThat was the melt down it was realizing\nThat I literally wholesale to weigh a hundred thousand dollar monthly income in nearly twelve million dollars in net worth twenty five houses a time at a time for the last five years\nI'm like you got to be key I cannot do this\nSo one of the things we also figure it out and this is this'll be great for some you guys\nI don't like subject to deal saw some to deal is where someone is buying a house in keeping the loan and the sellers name and you as the investor who bought the house pay their notes we bought a sub to deal not too long ago and one of our companies\nAnd recently sold it and I saw the sold HUD\nAnd we'd essentially made about thirty eight thousand dollars on the deal will they held the house for three or four years so the moral of the story is appreciation is really king in these rental properties you want them to cash flow\nBut if you want to continue to build your wealth in a rapid fashion its hold on to these things as long as you can\nAnd I'll tell you what I've done the month of September I realize it's we're in October but one of the things I did is I I told myself and I had a conversation my family and like I cannot let a single house if it's a decent house that's got good cash flow we just can't let it out the door\nWe just can't let it go we've got to buy the house\n\nSo that's what we've been doing in thirty days or bought ten properties technically it's Fifteen doors and when you look at where only out of pocket I'd have to go look at the numbers again around two hundred thousand dollars they're bringing\nIn nearly Seventy five thousand dollars in rent and when I talk to folks about real estate investing they get all excited they think well you know all the fix and flip shows and that's great but\nWe're real wealth is created by holding on to these assets\nAnd that's what we're really pushing towards us that's what I'm doing it robs do and how many of these things can you hold on to because of the longer you hold on to him the more that you're going to make\nWhat we're seeing down here in Texas is appreciation in the eight to Fifteen Percent range so let's call it ten percent\nIf you've got a house that's worth a hundred and fifty thousand dollars it's appreciating over a thousand dollars a month\nOr say they're getting you got a hundred and fifty thousand dollar house it's appreciating ten percent a year that's Fifteen thousand dollars a year it was right down your bottom line\nAnd I'll tell you the tax treatments a little bit different when you're hold onto asset long term versus buying flipping it today I'll tell you if I could do it all over again the meltdown for me was we should've held on to more of these properties\nThey I mean it's as long as you can get the long term financing it's it's almost insane just complete insanity to not hold on to these pieces are real estate\n... and hold onto them long term long term appreciation long term breaths we're also paying down the mortgage as we're holding on to these things assuming we got a advertised mortgage\nThe real trick in this business everyone thinks it's hey going out and quote finding a good deal\nWe were joking and our earlier meeting in our passive investor network we were joking about how no money out of pocket deals are really no not no money out of pocket you still got a rehab to do still got to turn the utilities on still got to do all these things that require a little bit of money\nReal estate's not free however when you refinance out\nYour second loan you do a short term loans to get the rehab and the Senate in there and then you refinance into a long term typically a thirty year fixed rate mortgage\nAnd at that point you may not have much money or any money in the deal and it's cash flowing\nAnd of course one of the jokes a lot of real estate ... says well how many no money out of pocket deals can you do well there is a limit [laughter]\nSomebody's got to advance the contract or the rehab somebody's got to turn the lights on somebody's got to pay to get the background check done on the ticket I mean there's that does take some money\nBut then the question is how many deals can you do if they've got ten twelve Fifteen Percent per year an appreciation now granted that's not typical not all properties have that but I Will tell you this over the long run it's really difficult\nIt is painfully difficult\nTo lose a truck ton of money on single family real estate is rental properties\nYou bond with enough equity in him you hold onto them long enough star casual and start appreciation appreciating you're paying down the mortgage you're getting a write off certain expenses towards your taxes\nIt's a it's a wonderful investment it's one of the reasons why why we do it but who knows where all tell you the meltdown for us was not losing money on a deal\nThe meltdown for me it was not not you know missing out on deal the meltdown was I realized I had eleven million dollars right there in my hands that I let it slip through over the course of five years\nSo don't make that same mistake don't let the meltdown gets ya buys me these things you can get your hands on that you can afford\nAnd build some real wealth with you guys are listening to the American real estate meet up radio and we'll see you guys next time you're listening stores sell\nBelieve the\n[noise]\nThere's a lot of heat coming on Amazon now they're going to do well they did not only are they dominating everything but ah they're destroying businesses and people are ... starting to ask the question what will you do and the only thing left the only place to buy anything left is Amazon and then\nYou measure mated America studios this is Katie Orr sci fi\n[noise]\nSupreme Court countdown on ... who sounds Fox News hours from now the Senate is expected to vote on whether to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court President Trump of course made the right decision and picking judge Kavanaugh and President Trump\nI Love being a part of these happy classes and being able to really introduce people to how to make money as the markets go down\nSo they don't have to fear the bear right you don't have to be afraid of it bearish market bears\nMarkets just like bullish markets are great opportunities to make money and even even sometimes greater opportunities to make money because which would speed the market goes down\nIt's that whole fear and greed ... principal the up markets are driven by greed the down markets are driven by fear and you know I I remember asking a class once you know which which which motion was more powerful fairer agreed\nAnd I had somebody say I I I think it's greed and we chatted about it because most of the class thought it was fear and one of the points that I came to was if it was greed everybody would do everything in their power nothing nothing would ever standing anybody's way of making money but it ends up being fear 'cause the fear of the unknown the fear of trying something new\nConsistently stands and the way of people's people's ability to make more money and it gets back to your point of that is why most people go out and they just get another job rather than generating another stream of income like passively are actively via the markets because that's a safe zone they already have a job to get another job well it's not the most appealing thing\nIt's a little more safer for our psyche and so those are some of the things we help our students overcome a so I Love that you went down the shortest path there\nBecause that is a great way to make money as the markets are going down and one of the things that we could do to help get a few people get started really being able to see the opportunity and embarrassed market is we've got a big stack tickets here that we are going to give away today where you say we pull a couple of these out and we give them with some more listeners get some people educated\nAll right well right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area\nAnd at the half the class and really it online training academy ... we focus on generating income as the marks going up and at the markets are going down but the half day classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to be able to do that\nNow they have to class or about three hours long your investment is going to be three hours of your time to come in and raise that financial like you to help you get better returns in the market in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kit makes it so you can get started right now\nHow century twenty we needed a call now and reserved those seats the number is\nEight eight eight six six to eight seven to three that said it eight six six to eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at Houston oh TA dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nLarry's we start to kind of continue down this path of making money in multiple directions we've got the job market we've got the down market you know what are some of the hurdles people have to overcome we touched on a few minutes ago as far as the Bush by us that we already have is being consumers\nMaybe maybe you could take that into it into a ... expand on that ... for our listeners and even even anything else that you work with or that you deal with when you're working with new students whether they have twenty years' experience or their brand new to the markets on how they really can structure things to make sure they're poised to profit as the markets are coming down\nGreat question right in the number one mistake that most people make when it comes to trading are investing is they try to do it on their own\nThey don't get themselves educated now it's okay I'll do it on my own it eventually maybe I'll get around to some education\nThe problem is the very costly less and why would you want to spend all that time energy and money when you can learn a system and what I Love about the term system Ryan it's saving yourself stress time energy and money\nAnd so we teach our students is to trade again like banks do back in February last year Goldman Sachs had a ridiculously large winning day was ... million dollars in one day simply by shortening the markets and so I Want to use this analogy hurt me use it before it's like driving a car\nIf anyone said T well you can go anywhere you want to go in this world right now but the car can only go and drive you can never put it in reverse\nIt'd be pretty frustrating Dr number one you're educated enough to know that the car goes both directions well most people don't realize so did the markets you can trade when the markets are going up you can trade when the market's going down and what most people have learned\nBy coming to the academy ... becoming educated and not trying to do it on their own is if there's a simple step by step process the system regardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're somebody who's ... somebody's committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nYeah and when you look at how we learn how to do anything that's really how we learn how to trade and invest as well it doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I was stressed inside of my classes that we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my\nMy mentors really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focused on the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being is it's a natural tendency for us to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to make I got to me I Want to make a hundred dollars a day we got to do that starting right now right rather than building the skills you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times\nWe tried to put the cart in front of the horse there and that's where the appropriate type of mentoring and teaching and different things like that can\nCan can really help you know too many times we we approached the markets and and and when I talk to people is very normal that did they say\nIf I say I I lost a question are you looking for a get rich quick program you know and and everyone always says oh no no no I'm I'm not looking at looking for that and I say well good 'cause that's not what the financial markets are this is where you really have to develop the skill to be able to go in and generate the income but once you have the skill\nYou can generate the income but the skill has to come first and it's that the patience of developing a skill that really determines in my opinion whether or not somebody is successful or not it's just like I I compared to flying an airplane I mean how comfortable would you be if you sat down a inside of a seven forty seven and you're about to fly from LA to New York\nAnd over the intercom you heard that the pilots say well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I just finished my Youtube video on drag versus lift we are ready to take off\nRight at that that's not going to get you there you have plenty of knowledge on\nOn how flight actually works the mechanics behind it but as far as the skill to fly and navigate that plane across the country that's a that's a whole different conversation and\nWe would never get on that plane because that's a life or death situation but unfortunately we do that with our money all the time we did that with a lot of things all the time and and when we're dealing with our money is a financial life or death situation that we can be putting ourselves\nAbsolutely let's face it we've been doing this for over Twenty one years right now we've had over half a million students have come through the academy to learn how to trade the right way the way that the banks make money at the end of the day what you're really hoping to do is find freedom you want to be able to\nFind a way to generate income ... spend more time at your family some people want to move on to do a different type of job maybe one of volunteer locally in your community the thing that we want to do most is get back the time that we don't want to lose and so\nA lot of our students have been very grateful to come in to spend a little time with us and learn how they not only can generate more income but also save themselves more time\nYeah absolutely we're coming up next to a break when you say we squeeze in another give away let's do it All right well we've got our half day class coming up and your investment in there it's going to be three hours of your time's three hours of your time to come out and see exactly what it takes to generate more consistent income in the markets whether it's going up down or sideways\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you were driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency and much much more\nThe professional inside her kid makes it so you can get started right now ... when you get a call now and reserved those seats the number is\nEight eight eight six six to eight seven to three that said it eight six six to

A. dot com\n[noise] you're listening to power trading radio now back to the show\nWe'll come back if you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs and director of and structure development and having structure it on they had any really shed some light on income we talked a lot about multiple streams of income we talked about different types of income passive income active income a little\nWhile ago we did a whole a whole series on passing versus versus active\nIncome and and it's so much fun to talk about income everybody needs more income whether it's whether it's for income for today or whether it's income for tomorrow in and that income for tomorrow is what we want to spend a little bit of time on in this segment talking to a little bit about the retirement accounts\nAnd so one of the things that may be missed out on that last segment as far as talking about more ... more generating more income well don't worry we're going to be doing it in this segment but really focusing on that retirement side of the the income equation\nWhether you're tuning in for the first time maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry get excited the best is yet to come and Larry sometimes I'll be talking with a lot of our listeners and and that happens a lot of social media we got the Twitter we've got the Facebook\nRe we've got all these different avenues where they can reach out they can ask questions we have different the different ... in our series and stuff like that but one of the things that we hear a lot there's two things really that we hear a lot\nNumber one we're hearing from people saying that they don't have enough money to retire even with the markets at all time high is right now\nThey don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire are consistently saying they're not quite sure what to do with their money so maybe if you could address a few of those topics because I'm sure we got a lot of listeners in one or two of those ... one or both of those situations listening to us right now\nWell let's talk about urgency because right now historically statistically the markets and the correct about every ten years or so so here we are ten years later like I mentioned earlier on the show we're seeing the Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates were seeing the housing markets starting to reverse so what does this mean for you\nWho are listening right now with the first thing we got to do is go back to how this all started if you have a four one K. where you're only able to trade in mutual funds the biggest concern you should have right now is the fact that prior to\nTwo thousand we came into the mutual fund world the Nineteen nineties where it was a roaring bull market well the first time we experienced any pain was back in two thousand so what makes this different than most is if you have a pension where your boss has set aside money for you\nThose monies were protected because it was coming out of our their payroll are coming out of profits and it was put aside to separate account and it wasn't subjected to what was happening in the markets will everything in your four O. one K. is not protected in fact if you think about a congressional people in senators they don't have for one case they have\nPensions intentionally because they want to make sure that they have this money available through our taxes will right now you should be thinking about especially if you're putting money in every two weeks into your Ira or four one K. you're investing at all time highs\nAs you might have mentioned I don't remember but let's just worth repeating that the market falls three times faster than it goes up so right now if you've been investing the majority of your money in the last couple of years at all time highs right now than it is a lot more\nFor this money to fall you should be concerned because we saw what happened back in two thousand eight it was a four O. one K. the became a two oh one K.\nAnd again it took about six years to recover\nWell this is much higher than we've ever seen before in fact if I look at the Buffett index speaking of course of Warren Buffett right now it's higher and more extended that we ever seen that index have been in the past\nAnd they simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this for all and K won't become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement and still work when you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life\nAnd the the the the way to make money in the market hasn't changed or a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down it's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high so what's the probability of buying an all time highs as being you buy low up or opportunity\nRight can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations\nThere's ... there's constant pull back there's constant wholesale offerings even as the markets are going higher and over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and ... opens up the downside for ah\nFor for risk you know we we talk a lot about the the the bullish biased and how as consumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the market's going higher and higher and every pay the average person buys more stocks they buy stocks through their mutual funds to therefore when case\nAbout through their RSP through their IRAs doesn't matter what account type it is that's ... that's the general practice kind of around the world is on payday would just buy stocks\nWell it doesn't matter what the prices though just matters that it's payday and so we are going to invest into it now the markets are collapsing our financial advisors have a brilliant way of of of talking to us about why it's okay to continue to buy as the markets are going down\nRight a ... dollar cost averaging as the markets are going down they say by more by more by more is it's going down and then when it comes back you're going to be rich\nAnd while that math actually makes a whole lot of sense the problem ends up being is we don't stop buying when it's on its way up if all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging would be a very powerful strategy\nBut when you're averaging your price back up buying these all time highs\nOffsets all the money that was invested in that four one K. back in two thousand nine and we're taking the\nAverage price up with this which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK right we just have to know that\nA Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right and they'll think Wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer\nAs the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor\nOne of the ways of where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as I said okay let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming
