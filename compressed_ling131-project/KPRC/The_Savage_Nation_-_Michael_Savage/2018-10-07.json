Brett Kavanaugh to a seat on the Supreme Court followed by a swearing in Republicans and Democrats still reeling from the long process just\nI don't know maybe we can follow you around and see how it's done yeah some of the bands are you playing\nWell right now is mainly my project says just Omar ... at a I play also and ah my friend's project which is just Bradley ...\nOh I I I ... yeah I think within what was I think we had him on the show case last year oh probably yeah good do uh sit tell me a little bit about your background\n[noise] uh I'm originally from Mexico City and uh I play a lot of Spanish music and I've been doing it for Fifteen Years now\nSo Fifteen Years yeah so you're you're kind of statesmen then here have music thing or are you uh do you have a music on SoundCloud or or CD Baby\nOr no right now this is my new stuff this is still and still working on it I still yeah she's going to ... now have you been in\nThe in the music business for for almost two decades now it's so easy as an artist I think now to be able to record songs\nBut because you you could do it with these you know with the software that's all you know it comes on the laptop problem is\nIt also allows you to sit there and tinker with it and go back and fix it and smooth things out as opposed to just ... they're going to a studio like a sure hill or something and you're you've got three hours this is what we're gonna get dumb so do you find yourself in the whole axle rose Chinese Democracy thing going back and re tweaking songs over and over again\nYeah absolutely I think I went through the motions like long but now you know now I tried to do it lives since I've been playing with uh my friend Bradley we've been doing everything life so uh for example with his band we've never had a rehearsal really see how we've done everything live but\nYou know from open ... showcases interest in providing better you are you recording somebody's performances now uh with his band we have with my project we haven't yet but we were trying to do that yeah\nThat that a lot of people go into the studio they create a sound and then they're never able to recapture that sounded a live performance yeah totally a a a ... there's ... there's a million stories about that but but I mean obviously the goal is to be able to\nTo craft music that you can perform in front of an audience and then there's people that are performed brilliantly for the body and just ... they released assigned like well that's where ... where it's not the same where where's the sound we I think we interviewed Johnny ... who's been around\nExcuse me for a couple of decades and he said that he had so much criticism about his studio recording songs as opposed to his performance but he just started recording this live performances and they actually put out a couple of albums that well\nYou know that's actually exactly what I Want to do I I'm I'm not interested in doing a study on record as we I I Want to record everything like\nA million years ago when we started doing this show and it was it was obviously pre recorded or we would go back in a post production and we would spend hours yeah so I disagree with everything I ... you know what people people don't expect you to sound perfect ... they wanna they wanna they wanna feel you don't want to see the motion and so so good\nI feel like they want you to sound real more that\nRight [laughter] perfect that's perfect ... uh so um what are your influences and obviously you're going to be doing some Spanish a yeah language music force tonight but what are your are your books as\nWell ... I play a gold ... from buffalo maker which is kind of like a a let's say Cuban music goes back to Spain and it's you know interpreted by like ... a musician\nAnd is that very intense a guitar playing right or a little bit it's mainly written ... a real flamingo\nIs a little bit more intense in the play but room by so many Britain\nGood All right uh\nSo when in the future do you think that both the ... project is going to put out a long awaited offering\nI'm a you know I'm I'm thinking about it by the end of the year I'm going to have something where the at least like I Need to be with three or four something\nGood to have goals but not too much pressure\nUh All right so I'm now a little background as some of the songs you to play to like like like you said it is going to be in Spanish language so um do you think\nOf the the non bilingual do you think that the motions and the intent to the song will become obvious or do you need to give a little explanation before we get into that but now I think it's going to be really evidence that it speaks for itself\nYou know it it's funny because we were talking about I guess still young I'm\nThe I'm the weight of the social project ... and the gypsy kings were two of the acts that helps a kind of introduce the concept of Latin music to angle audiences without anyone ever understanding the lyrics because there was so much emotion involved in the ...\nAbsolutely actually one of his own was that or I would've plays one of the social clubs I look back I\nOut I met I discovered the gypsy kings in a war that out to the guy had among my third ... [laughter] I just figured out how to rip it and put it on my iPod or a ... a Facebook page how can people folly\nAbsolutely students are my music pages Omar poker face but\nAt the L K E R s e okay All right I'm a ... on the stage the Tonight Show or we appreciate your time and look for you to ... in your talents [laughter]\nThank you very much and it's the outlaw day showcase recorded at the house of blues a veteran music institution for at least twenty seven years brought to you by your baby stay on the bay\nOne of the most provocative interviews ever caught on tape how do I know you guys aren't going to chop it up later and make me look like in any\nNew and improved outlaw Dave show\nUnderstand why during nine\nUh yeah you know what I got home last night I saw these ridiculous political shines in my socialist liberal neighbor's front yard signs on the Democrat Jeanne on voting cares about putting a shining their yard like that's going to change my mind on who I'm voting for\nWell since you're voting for you finally found this guy had been a change political view on the\nCampaign or on the radio show and frankly nor do I care to listen to it on my phone is still on new\nAnd improved outlaw Dave show\nMy name is ...

picking up a little bit of it is hard doing that and um then I just wrote my own stuff and it was a different direction and\nYeah that's what that's how it kind of came to be that I'm doing my own
