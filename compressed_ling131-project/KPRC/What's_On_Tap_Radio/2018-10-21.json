S. A. dot org P. T. S. D. U. S. A. dot\nOr about to launch a brand new website very excited about it either I knew who uh hopefully a little bit easier to navigate ... a lot easier to donate I hate pay pal we're getting away from out thank God I hate pay ...\nA ... my apologies for [laughter] that doesn't change the facts I hate the place they are they make it as difficult as possible this story from CNN [noise]\nOf current and former members of the British military rates of post traumatic stress disorder our highest among combat veterans recently left the service a new study finds\nResearch also found a rise in the number of current and former military members showing symptoms of the disorder\nKnown as ... between two thousand four and two thousand fourteen among veterans whose last mission included a combat role in the Iraq or Afghanistan wars Seventeen point one percent reported symptoms of probable pie GST\nWhen given questionnaires focused on the condition those deployed in support roles such as ... medical or logistics in the same location reporter to six percent rate of pay TST [noise]\nNew studies the quote closest thing we have to a true picture servicemembers mental health said Simon Wesley professor psychological medicine at King's College in London and author of the state author of course he's going to say you're right I mean you have horses yeah best thing ever I'm\nSharon ... devil link a lecture and putting epidemiology at King's College who led the study\nAdded quote for the first time we have identified that the risk of Pete DSD for veterans deployed in conflicts\nWith substantially higher than the risk for those still serving\nNow that seems a little bit odd to me that she would make that statement I mean that seems obvious to me for a lot of reasons one\nThey're still in there probably not going to tell anybody they're having nightmares right right [laughter]\nThere aren't a lot of hand razors in the military yeah yeah yeah I'm an Avon the are you ready as me I'm I'm having trouble can't sleep ... yeah that would be me yeah there there's not really a whole lot that while they're still active\nDuty now and then and this is just my opinion but when you are active duty you're still going you're still moving on a daily basis you you don't completely have time to start remembering and thinking 'cause you're still going\nA kind of like when you retire after working thirty forty years that's when you start feeling the body aches really bad I attribute it the same thing\nYeah well then you know we all understand adrenaline what adrenaline does to us and what ... is is to continue to do even after being wounded no matter what the wound\nA were able to do things we would not necessarily ordinarily be able to do or otherwise be able to do without the adrenaline flow I think that's why a lot of the guys when they come back they search for some sort of adrenalin rush there are and those are sometimes things where we lose\nOur vets and it's not listed as suicide but they're\nTrying to reach that adrenaline feeling again so they get on a ... motor cycle and they had down the highway as fast as they possibly can\nFor doing Ninety nine to ten ... yeah ... speaking from experience or we are [laughter] I don't want to talk about a year\nOr so look searching for that a dreamer so which has gone\nA there's the crash yes erratic caffeine crash oh sure oh yeah it was bad yeah it was ugly are so similar different but similar as far as just you know what happens to us there's that crashed effect that's I'm One of my\nQuestions that I have about some of the organizations that do a lot of\nVery important work very need work around the world and doing really really good positive things but what happens when they come home from those are your it's like coming home from war you are out with all these guys doing great significant purposeful things and you come home and you're all by yourself\nAnd you're all in all of a sudden just another guy on the block and nobody particular nobody's special and you're not saving something you're not rebuilding something you're not points something out of the rubble and you've lost that sense of purpose and there's\nA crash that happens that is so so powerfully dangerous um\nSo the story goes on to the point of that story is just sheer again that what we face here in America is not unique to our military society it's true in any military uh around the world Canadians have the same issues the Brits clearly have the same issues\nWhat they don't have in Britain what they don't have in Canada is a place called camp hope they don't have a group of people\nThat\nOften refer to them as a core of compassion that is just the civilian world who doesn't necessarily get it\nBut they hurt by what they see they hurt in hearing the statistics of suicide and family breakups and ah all the tragic results of ... and they want to come together and do something\nPeople like Russell borrow a people like Margot who makes a crayon heart and sells it for a dollar\nUm [noise] people like Abigail is set up a little lemonade stand and\nSold two hundred dollars worth of lemonade or the next year sold lemonade and brownies at her dad's office and brought in Eighteen hundred dollars I Love those stories I Love those the pure innocence of a child\nThat here's the story of vets who are in crisis there is a place called camp hope and I want to help that place ...\nThere's many veterans as we possibly can\nWe called up the road hope and we're glad to have you as a builder of the road who a supporter of the road to hope a prayer warrior for the road who we need you need your volunteer time we need your dollars we need your prayers we need all of that\nSo thank you for being apart Ramon

the low man on the Supreme Court has\nTo actually approve of the ah cafeteria food\nSo we've got to do it yeah well I think it's just a hazing yeah sounds like a little hazing\nYeah the last low low person on the totem pole I heard brought in\nA ... machine so\nThey don't bring the big panels that any more like a fraternity or what do you want to Betty\nBrings it a keg or later I guarantee like beer I still like beer a ... year\nWas talking about in the NFL for a second they liked to drink beer now the NFL all the\nFans do at least because one fan has been charged with disorderly conduct and been banned from Gillette Stadium what are you talking about James while in case you didn't see it after\nA tirade kill the Kansas City chiefs scored a touchdown last Sunday not that today but last Sunday several fans taunted the wide receiver in the end zone spy flipping them off and was than even tossed beer in his face\nOoh well patriots\nAre not messing around and we're not talking about patriots I'm Talking about the organization\nOh okay not like people who are willing to die for the country now okay\nI'm Talking about the new minute patriots you know Brady I Know on their own brand of Brazil Brady wasn't messing around now I Know the organization I got it around yeah 'cause it Patriot's fan who threw beer on the chief wide receiver [noise] uh the he's been\nBanned for life on July ... am and we'll get charged with disorderly conduct any political throwing objects at a sporting event\nHey I got a reason to clap for the NFL finally our rights been two years but I'm clap and now that's awesome\nSo how do you think the wide receiver tie Rick Hill the Kansas City chiefs responded that\nThis took a knee [laughter] ... dismissed what happens he's just dismissed it says you know my coach told me don't get emotional\nDon't get mad about it because it comes with the territory really always mad at all because you're wondering in New England came away with that game a with a forty three to forty wind despite hills three game touchdown and\nThen he got passed and said I'm sue him that's it man for life\nYeah well uh I I actually uh I applaud Robert Craft in the patriots organization for a for that a measure because frankly if a fear that big of a Jack ... go ahead and throw beer in somebody's face um yeah you did you knew what you were doing\n... that just not gonna be tolerated you're not you know the here's what happened on a five year\nOld they're caught in a moment ... ... and they're like hey let me throw this twelve dollar beer in the face of this player I don't like oh yeah well how about how you act that a ballgame\nYeah or if somebody standing out on the street holding up a sign that you don't like can you punch them in the face of us just caught up in the moment yeah no it's not appropriate I'm Sorry you are ... and ... actually you know what I'm going to go and declare it right now that's the ... of the week\nWe talked about this a few weeks ago there was a Yankees played the Oakland Athletics and there was an athletics than and the Yankees in a winning the game and what are the fan due to the athletics than he dumped his entire beer\nIn the face of the ... athletics than the good news of the story went viral and they reached out to the athletics than the athletics set this guy a game tickets instead of CARE Package oh yeah\nAnd the guy who threw the beer in his face obviously was probably getting a backlash that Yankee fan felt bad and they actually are met up at a bar in the Bronx because the ethics and lived there in New York and they squashed it and now they're friends\nOh you mean they actually solve\nThat without going to court and doing all that other stuff oh oh okay cool still banned him for life Yankee Stadium my opinion\nAnd then we had another story learned your lesson last week a a Red Sox closer was coming out and somebody through a beer can at him as he was actually in the bullpen and he he he just miss getting hit or miss and I think they caught that went to here's the deal there's cameras everywhere folks\nIf you're going to act like an ass clown you're probably going to get caught yeah\nAnd and I don't think you and I hope you because you will be I really hope you do um for for no other reason than the fact that you suck at math and you realize the you're the same person who's gonna complain about paying Fifteen dollars for a beer and just threw it away\nAgain we're talking about this ban has been charged with disorderly conduct and has has a lifetime ban in Gillette Stadium now the lifetime ban is that punishment too harsh\nNo kidding me oh you ... if you act\nLike that you deserve it I'm Sorry you know what if if my kid back when they were kids really small if they go to daycare and they bite somebody is like oh yeah you're right yeah you can't you can't behave in here I mean there are three I understand but no you bite somebody it's like no no you got to find new daycare\nOkay you can't behave and these are adults you know but you know exactly what you're doing you get caught up in a moment oh yeah well guess what shouldn't a done that\nBut you learn owned by the way this how you stop it from happening again you enforce it now\nThey said ah if this continues to happen ... yes this guy's been slapped with fines but to find they'll start increasing as they should yeah so the idea lifetime lifetime ban you can't you can't do like to lifetime bans so if you go to a sporting event the civil there'll be Savage\nThirty to twelve dollar beer on a plate or they're doing their job you may not like the outcome but doesn't give you the right to dump your twelve dollar barrier nachos on a player and that's our number one it was on ... radio coming up and our number to crush living hell beer for your dogs [noise]\nNo I won't worry company will be joining us to talk about October fest and much more disguise so join us for another six minutes of actually

not wearing a uniform no she just had to\nSee the logo on her shirt and that's a unified and I'm looking at the picture and you really can't make the deal sea logo unless you know well you know you're looking for and in fact it's a shirt that anybody can buy it it's available anybody can purchase it and support the deal is the department of corrections so\nI don't understand what the ... who is but you know\nBeen multiple attempts to reach out to these people by various news agencies nobody's wanting to talk about it but ah what do you sing I mean you know as far as I'm concerned first responders who you want to have a beer giddy up\nI'll buy it now when I was working at her home brew shop years ago and I remember a pilot came in once and he was in a I'm In his uniform uses\nPilots have you ever made up his wings on down and he's an airline pilot and we used to have a greater and I'll say okay for your beer and he was like no no no I Can't\nAnd the reason being because he's in uniform even though he just got off a shift and he was picking up a whole Bruce applies to go home Abreu if somebody were to see him drinking a beer and oh yeah it was it on social they could just go
