I mean like\nWe we have we talked about ... no no I think we may have just mentioned in passing but I\nThink that there's a tie in here maybe you can help our listeners understand how this whole thing kind of comes together well us do our best to do that go creek would grill is in existence now at the former CEO slash a a ... a it's an old\nBlue historic location in Cyprus longtime Cyprus residents all recognize it as ... um it's a it's a building that's been there for quite some time she got a lot of historical legacy and it's been a Cyprus institution for a long time so we're very excited when we found that it was it was a possible to be the next in line to own this and continue the legacy\nHave and the international live we are alone are\nAll right and so ah I've been out there when you guys were working in renovating it and I think in the last three months four months only take you guys they read of ate the whole\nThing we bought it in early mid mid may and shut it down for about three and a half months she'll reopened in August\nSo since may uh you actually spent more time with mark McCaffrey than his wife\nOh yeah yeah see I didn't spend that much time with mark McCaffrey is life\nNo no go ahead and is there a lot of\nRenovation when it goes on when you're taking over a different restaurant or is it just you know maybe clean up the bar and maybe hanging pictures\nThe lemons ledge or something on the\nTable there was a little bit more than just shining and dozens in and doing some other stuff we had it was a pretty big undertaking especially when you're working part of the building that we have is over Seventy years old so there's always a special set of of challenges with that um the main part of the building was built in Ninety nine so\nMuch trouble with that one but yeah it was it was a good amount of work but it's a it's a it's a labor of love and I've loved this room as a longtime Cyprus resident I've been a big fan of this building for a long time it very excited to have enough\nAnd so you and mark McCaffrey our partners in this venture and you guys up there you go and so that's how this whole thing ties in so that means in in in I've known Brian uh for a couple of years now and we've we've hung out many times and so it's great to have you on the show a nice that you've got the place open and it's running but let's get to the heart gay disappear show right\nOkay you got here that you got any beer out there and whose ... with a ... like how's this going down I mean ... you got you got your a\nMass produce cheap beers are you going to have some crap you're out there what are you know nobody got what do you got we've\nGot you know we we've got we've got all the the mass produced bears we've got it if you want you know one of the domestics Sacramento you are at a we have a fantastic tap well we've got a thirty eight\nA craft beers on tap we rotate 'em constantly Travis bulk is our beer manager and they put a new label named her up there for a trap it's uh they would go\nAnd uh and he does a fantastic job of making sure that we've got a good balance of some really killer craft beers\nWith a really have the emphasis on the local stuff\nUm so you know\nNo label and and the really big focus on all the Houston breweries as much as we can and ah you know some other stuff from out of state just really fantastic fantastic job that he does with all the bears and so it's a it's a great barrier wall where we're very pleased with it\nUm and where we're getting a lot of really good feedback on the selection of\nCommunities all behind like you guys are getting a lot of good positive vibes and oh yeah yeah wonderful are were hanging out with Brian Sandoval of creek would grill ... grill partners with the backyard\nWhile now this is the working breweries so that's just going to happen you know what they have trains to go right through the brewery it just happens don't stand on the tracks\nTrait I gotta catch you guys are you still owe me eight bucks from Denver anyway again Brian Sandoval a we've reached the coming out here and uh uh you talked about the the food that's out\nThere a dollar I get into the movie they talked about the\nBeer I Want to know about the food because we're we're radio guys we like to eat\nWell what's the best thing that goes with bears burgers right and ... so at our heart where a burger joint we've got some really killer a high quality burgers I'm really good some some unique won some interesting\nTake on some burgers we have chicken sandwiches we've got salads we've expanded the menu a little bit from what there was there previously to to uh appealed to a little bit of a wider audience um but yeah the the food is the food is fantastic I mean we're a burger joint and and my background previously was with raising chains and there was a a\nA humidity impact asked us you know hey so Brian from backyard by me Brian from canes and mark from backyard or going to open a restaurant and what kind of food is going to be and we went\nWell it's going to be burgers and chicken [laughter] like what do you think it's going to be it's right in my right uh so yeah the feedback have been really good\nAnd you got to stage that's there now that's the other thing I've noticed age yet that break because it is a historic building as you said part of its Seventy years old\nAnd now what's\nThe use for the stage what are we gonna do are we going to have concerts\nThere is that we've had we've had a couple a couple of little live music events mostly kind of really low key stuff some local artists we uh you know we've talked to a couple of the national guys uh you know we'll see where we're not a hundred percent certain which direction we're going to go with that um it's a really great a vibe\nWhen there's live music and we want to do what we can to explore that and and and keep that tradition up there have been some fantastic big names that have come through and played in that building and uh and we want to keep that going so\nYou know I mean look for that later this year or early next year will really start to focus on getting that once we've we've got the restaurant operations and beer operations we feel like we're a hundred percent there than\nAnd we'll start expanding and looking at doing some light and it's a big space out there too I mean\nBradley better is probably why I said I think he just like you know like I Hope he doesn't have any you know that's just insane [laughter] that's just my ... it takes time to warm up and run up still working a lot of teams just look at me to stop sucking All right have a real smiley face [laughter]\nAnd I mentioned that don't make that they used to say\nThat [laughter] but I did when I was so happy and laughing [laughter] I like my ex [laughter]\nOr early in the shell brought to table we bought the hops solo would you have a fantastic beer great lady you I mean we're talking to my ear off about it\n[laughter] I Do [laughter]\nWith a commercial break same for their say can you give me that the ... you said it's it's the opposite were so fresh it was like twenty minutes off the vine into the beer thirty about ours so yeah within minutes thirty six hours usually within twenty four hours for\nThirty six hours from the vine to to boil where you where did you get the hops from coming from the ... valley up in Washington okay got so during the harvest whenever they're harvesting at the time are ready to to brew up the the the ... we're going to you and uh they cut it put it in some boxes ... make it back\nAnd we have to use it like immediately get to meet the kind of time everything around it gives a beer and nice\nAs a a good ... to it but it's not a fortunate as like a smooth hot
