adults thank God I hate pay ...\nA ... my apologies for [laughter] but it doesn't change the facts I hate the place yeah they make it as difficult as possible this story from CNN [noise]\nOf current and former members of the British military rates of post traumatic stress disorder\nOur highest among combat veterans recently left the service a new study finds research also found a rise in the number of current and former military members showing symptoms of the disorder\nKnown as ... between two thousand four and two thousand fourteen among veterans whose last mission included a combat role in the Iraq or Afghanistan wars Seventeen point one percent reported symptoms of probable pie GST\nWhen given questionnaires focused on the condition those deployed in support roles such as ... medical or logistics in the same location reporter to six percent rate of pay TST [noise]\nNew studies the quote closest thing we have to a true picture service members mental health said Simon Wesley professor psychological medicine at King's College in London and author of the state author of course he's going to say you're right I mean you have horses yeah best thing ever I'm\nSharon ... devil link a lecture and putting epidemiology at King's College who led the study\nAdded quote for the first time we have identified that the risk of ... for veterans deployed in conflicts\nWith substantially higher than the risk for those still serving now that seems a little bit odd to me that she would make that statement I mean that seems obvious to me for a lot of reasons one\nThey're still in there are probably not going to tell anybody they're having nightmares right right [laughter]\nThere aren't a lot of hand razors in the military yeah yeah yeah I'm an Avon the are you ready as me I'm I'm having trouble can't sleep ... yeah that would be me yeah there there's not really a whole lot that while they're still active\nDuty now and then and this is just my opinion but [noise] when you are active duty you're still going to still moving on a daily basis you you don't completely have time to start remembering and thinking 'cause you're still going\nA kind of like when you retire after working thirty forty years that's when you start feeling the body aches really bad I tribute at the same thing\nYeah well then you know we all understand adrenaline what adrenaline does to us and what it enables us to continue to do even after being wounded no matter what the wound\nOr were able to do things we would not necessarily ordinarily be able to do or otherwise be able to do without the adrenaline flow I think that's why a lot of the guys when they come back they search for some sort of adrenalin rush there uh and those are sometimes things where we lose\nOur vets and it's not listed a suicide but they're trying to reach that adrenaline feeling\nAgain so they get on a ... motorcycle and they had down the highway as fast as they possibly can\nFor doing Ninety nine to ten ... yeah ... speaking from experience or we are [laughter] I don't have to talk about a year\nOr so look searching for that a dreamer so which has gone a there's the crash yes erratic caffeine crash oh sure oh yeah it was bad yeah it was ugly are\nSo similar different but similar as far as just you know what happens to us there's that crashed effect that's I'm One of my questions that I have about some of the organizations that do a lot of very important work very need work\nAround the world and doing really really good positive things but what happens when they come home from those are your it's like coming home from war you are out with all these guys doing great significant purposeful things and you come home and you're all by yourself and your ... and all of a sudden just another guy on the block and nobody particular nobody's special and you're\nUh saving something you're not rebuilding something you're not pulling something out of the rubble and you've lost that sense of\nPurpose and there's a crash that happens that is so so powerfully dangerous um so the story goes on the\nPoint of that story is just sheer again that what we face here in America is not unique to our military society it's true in any military uh around the world Canadians have the same issues the Brits clearly had the same issues\nWhat they don't have in Britain what they don't have in Canada is a place called camp hope they don't have a group of people that\nWe often refer to them as a core of compassion that is just the civilian world who doesn't necessarily get it\nBut they hurt by what they see the hurt in hearing the statistics of suicide and family breakup some or all the tragic results of ... and they want to come together and do something\nPeople like Russell borrow a people like Margot who makes the curry on heart and sells it for a dollar\nUm [noise] people like Abigail who set up a little lemonade stand and\nSold two hundred dollars worth of eliminated or the next year sold lemonade and brownies at her dad's office and brought in Eighteen hundred dollars and I love those stories of love those the pure innocence of a child\nThat here's the story of vets who are in crisis there was a place called camp hope and I want to help the place reaches many veterans as we possibly can\nWe called up the road hope and we're glad to have you as a builder of the road hope a supporter of the road hope a\nPrayer warrior for the road who we need you we need your volunteer time we\nNeed your dollars we need your prayers we need all of that [noise] so thank you for

you\nDoing fantastic the name of the book is beer ... a hundred kids tricks in projects and uh then I was talking to some coworkers earlier about this interview and they asked me what the heck is a beer hack\n[laughter] good question I think that's a great place to start um I think it can\nBe a number of different things it's ah sometimes attempt sometimes a trick or a short cut 'em but ultimately a bit of information that makes\nYou a better happier more effective and efficient beer drinker\nI went through the book and it's a it's a great read to very easy read you know for someone who only read books when he was in college uh but\nI wanted to go through some of the hats and get you to kind of explained some of these these some of my favorite ... to that you have in this book in the name of the book again is called ... hundred ... projects in Robin ... is the author of it a number forty three I like this one\nHow to order a beer any pro sporting event I didn't realize that this was something that people need to understand how to do\n[laughter] I think again you can always do it better um have a a number of pieces of advice here what if they're offering to different sizes of beers some stadiums do just get the\nBigger one you're getting ripped off anyway and you're going to get a better value out of it um the other one is always order two beers instead of one um one because you're probably going to go to because I haven't been to a baseball game there wasn't seven hours recently\nUm and to your seat you're the people in euro uh making them get up over and over as you can get out to go get a beer I'm not all that hospitable um\nBonus tip on there was that they can give you a a cap to put on the top of your beer so you're not in school and they when you're coming back that's another one too but hey you know just just a you know like little little moves to help make everything work a little better\nSo is it better to get draft beer or can beer bottle of beer at the sporting event\n[noise] you know it depends um I feel like they've gotten\nBetter at like as they have more craft beer in a stadiums in arenas they like\nThey may be a little more focused on like keeping the lines clean I used to go um to mix games 'cause I live in\nNew York and I swear to God the beer the garden tasted like butter\nWho not in a good way die out on her\nAnd it doesn't yeah I'm not really sure what was going on but it doesn't anymore I'm I'm happy to report they didn't have the renovation and maybe that was part of it um but if the beer tastes like butter out of the tap 'em maybe grab a Canada next time\nAgain we're talking about beer hacks uh we've been Robinson and I wanted to move on one of my um things I like to do is enjoy a beer in the shower I have a buddy that says if you're drinking a beer in the showers like drinking by the pool and this is one of your ... [laughter]\nOh man I'm I'm using that won the first year this one's been questioned um by some people [noise] um yes I\nThink that you know the shower beer is probably not a an everyday occurrence for for most\nPeople and maybe doesn't need to be but um sometimes you need one and then you know I mean we can chalk it up the multitasking I'm a big role in that one has\nNo glass like bring a can or something goes wrong ah chances are uh you know I'm not sure a hundred percent how your shower but chances are you not have shoes on a but people actually like I've seen these these suction cups\nThat are suction cup cup holders or or can holders I suppose um that you could actually put on the wall of your shower I'm you know I guess that's a if you're somebody who's doing this a a little more regularly and and professionally I suppose\nI just kind of usually put the um where the soap the soap older it's kind of works out pretty well for me\nYeah exactly the old the old catty up top yeah\nI'm Marie on a talking again about these ... a hundred kids in shrinks in projects author been Robinson and one of my favorite things to do\nAnd this is my favorite hacked to disguise is number sixty four shocking and beer because then it's amazing the amount of people that don't know how to shock on a beer and I think to to that point then you don't have a lot of fun in college\nI think that there's all sorts of different ways to have fun uh definitely shocked at least at least one beer in\nCollege for a member correctly um yeah the old old rule that we used to have back in the day when you're shocked cutting of beer is no garage doors or if you've got a huge wide opening\nYou're going to end up with beer for a shirt to 'em so that key but yeah outline you know where where the opening should be higher you should hold it\nUm where you should cut it and I actually haven't check on her head and check on the beer and who knows maybe a decade uh but went on a pod cast to talk about the book last week and we talked about this\nAnd all of a sudden chest puffed out about who is better\nA at a ... ... you know you know we geeks who drain you their food trucks to draw a line\nWill do that today was like whoa guys you guys are way too much fun then the restaurants they don't get to have that much fun so when it starts slapping more permanent San you\nGuys that's what

right the salaries they sounds great powers is\nOn is our new year round what age sour six pack a and I think from from what we can tell us a only what is our six back to us on the market right now right on I'm Sorry you were talking\nAbout the ... also a it's a you know such traditional ah saves on beer now we've a sharpened up a little bit with our ah our sour would aged er Felix now are what age spirits are certified in oak barrels for up to a year\nAnd uh we used to the fight with bacteria wild east you know real traditional methods are real traditional Belgian methods and the tradition of the safe zone is another thing right so we're taking to traditional beers\nA safe zone is generally a like a French farmhouse sale and uh we've taken these two very traditional beers and blended in together to kind of brighten up each and kind of accentuate each a flavor profiles from east style of beer\nYeah I think the coolest part about our ... our program in general is none of it can be repeated by anybody else because\nYou know rather than as I mean is there any other movies that are doing anything similar to the ... on yeah are out\nThere but I think what's really unique about our program is we have the oldest continuous living is our culture and the United states our ... our culture started in our in our food was over Twenty years ago now\nAnd that was back before their use banks you couldn't get ... you know a bread straying from the East Bay he couldn't get locked to stream from summer we had to like\nIt was trial and error in the early days in a once we found what we liked\nWe just cultured that one that one culture just kept going\nA blending it out into other barrels adding adding different beers to it and then finding what we liked and then just going with it you know so we kept adolescence and I know those are my listeners that are really you know beer knowledge as though you're asking about new souring kind of you know yeah it was so there's a there's a wild this in their ... and different\nStrains but a a pretty detailed there if we want to go into ethically something we don't have enough yeah but yeah\nI've been here yeah yeah yeah I have no bacillus\n... these things that are their traditional beer a set of fires but once you find what works and once you can actually keep the certain strains alive by treating it the way that it needs to be treated and really just to trial and error and figuring out what works well and what works best uh and you keep it alive and you just hear it\nWhen it was just the reason why yogurt ... has a ... is because of a ... that's in there it's ... it's a you know it's just wild ... train that's out there um and you need you used to make beer so um yeah that's how we set a fire or beer\n... got a new Belgium in Studio ... aerosols are the ... manager and then Andrew ... especially the brand manager and what was the first described just a social services on that one yet on really good and now she's ever refreshing and this beer with will just be a year round or is this last oh yeah a little six ... six pack\nOn really tasty hold out in ah Houston as a matter of fact ...\nIs meant to be kind of a nice entry point sour for you for what is our yeah I'm a southern sign that\nThe salaries are really taking off a especially those that don't really drink beer they drink a lot of wind and rain just
