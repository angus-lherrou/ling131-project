been an intern for Fifteen Years wow yeah we're open at some point that he's going to really you know we have our fingers crossed that he's going to really apply himself mixture that would be good and so as the director pod casting what are you got for us [noise]\nWell I wanted to kind of highlight as you said we've got our commando pod Cass Tech news this week tech news today but really what I wanted to highlight was\nUm our other ... so we have our history in the highway podcast which I mentioned before and this was an awesome pod cast\nUm hosted by ... worth of you know you have he does a

with machine learning how it works with\nAlgorithms and how they're trying to get to know you as much as possible uh on line and your habits um it's just it's a fascinating part I guess the people he interviews are are also\nAnd you know the Stevens to hold believe I don't know if you've ever had the chance to actually speak with him about this topic but his whole believe is that we are putting all these gadgets around us without thinking about the ramifications and that we have this Internet of things we have artificial intelligence we have Facebook whatever may be\nAnd we buy all this
