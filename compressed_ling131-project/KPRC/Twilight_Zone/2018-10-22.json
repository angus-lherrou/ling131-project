{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "But I live in if you're not getting all three hours that came commando show and joined ... beds right head over to get\nKim Dotcom and for just a few bucks a month you can watch the show you can get the podcast chat with all the great folks in the chat room because they're fabulous by the way\nAnd then we have contests you can come see the show and the list goes on and on the on the head over to get Kim Dotcom once again that's get Kim Dotcom it all three hours of the show it's great for when you're walking exercising driving because after all knowledge is power\nA time in Scottsdale, Arizona hello there Tom\nBlow their Kemp what's going on well I have a\nQuestion uh uh I'm just give it a little set up here I'm a dentist and ah have a a website that I have one phone line right now I Want to try to put together for another part of my practice and I've been toying with the idea of putting a ... a function I'm not sure what you call it\nA in the website to where people could ask questions before they came in\nAnd the question I Would have for you is it is a beneficial or that you you know is it are easy to do and of course what kind of backed up to I Need to have as far as the employment of people to support that are the questions or what have you\nYou know all of us all yeah all really good questions by the way Tom I'm you know we read deployed shop dot commando dot com\nAnd uh you know we put a chat function in in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing\nYou know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being there it really will help with your return on your investment are you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\nWell obviously I have to have someone to play so I just recently was approached by a company that said they would do is they would have ah\nThey employ individuals to support the ah the ... function somehow that would work as they would give me thirty quit or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a perspective ah clients would ask them than those so dirty question so I Would give them the interest as well so\nAs I as a person would call him they would get a hold of this company and they would have if they asked a question of is she they had the the canned answer that I've already given but of course I'd almost should include she goes to all of those dirty flushing\nYeah ... and say here's the reason why I'm hesitating with that is that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor I'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our businesses that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extent is that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself or my oral history and my real hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the website and see what kind of volume that you get and you you are able\nTo turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office that you could say you know what you're going to get in a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact to getting\nThe same question time and time again\nOf which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on\nBut I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you'll engage will be people that you can convert to a a paying client because they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built\nThen as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that if you're building your site from scratch they have names like Ben desk chat is free uh there's also a live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the side or somebody building for you\nOr your school the the we do a ... started to build them we have another company and building a another website will always have a little bit but when the media but third tempting has told me about that in this chat function\nAnd I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't let the third party do it yet I Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters do kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also lift some of those questions under ... as part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening in chats and bugs and things like that\nOr is that you're able to say you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you so much for your call come right back we're going to talk about browsing without all the bad stuff you're on the came commando show [noise]\nNow I don't know about you but someone has been telling me how to brush my teeth all\nMy life parents
