a brand new\nThirty eight million dollar facility it is absolutely breathtaking and uh I'm going to post a picture\nI'm looking at the flight line from the second story this building I have one of the best views on the planet right now and I'm a post that on a Facebook here shortly to share that with you guys All right we're talking with Jason McCann now this is this is a family that has been in the air conditioning industry and business\nFor generations\nAnd one of the things that I really like about these guys as they advocate and promote alternative technologies and when you get into ... this is they promote a technology called geothermal technology\nAnd uh you know I don't like using big words are complicated words to things because it scares people that it's unfamiliar to them so Jason\nLet me ask you this what are the simple compared is\nThat this is not some alien technology how ... how would you compare this and it features in benefits a package to consumer that would be able to go either way\nWhat a what your carnival is when you break it down to earth to cool the refrigerator or free on in the system so instead of a box outside your house fan who\nIs using water and the earth do the same job um once you get with that is extremely high energy efficiency\nUm sometimes fifty Seventy percent more efficient which means less energy use your light bill is lower than the best conventional or\nTypical equipment\n[noise] um you get all of the same features otherwise if you want to basic geothermal unit that just turned on and heard a lot we have that to stage which up in the little ... give it a little better comfort\nWe have that fall in murder that comfort super quiet we have that as well\nNow that the key to this is the efficiency ... you're talking you take the the best most advanced equipment twenty to twenty what's the highest rating were conventional settings right in their\nTheir stuff out there that there are twenty two to twenty four se are what you just don't get rich and the rating and the higher the number to less electric the\nRight so it's the super efficient the best conventional equipment traditional ac system you can get today let's say it's twenty ... let's just say twenty four seer right the youth thermal is like forty to fifty see or is that right\nExactly it's forty four Yes sir\nOkay and basically what that means is is twice as efficient as the best conventional you no matter how much money you spend you cannot you can only achieved half\nOf the performance you can get with geothermal that hum as a comparative and the the only difference in these two systems as one's got a big box outside with a fan right the the compressor veteran and and the other one is got a a a a basically a too but it goes down in the ground\nThat it's just that simple that's right that's right and then they are so many\nIn the attic whereas convention or you've got to pieces addict portion and out\nNow that you have an example you gave me an example of a house that you can solve the geothermal system it right and and the geothermal will last twenty five years yeah right so that you gave me an example of an electric bill\nOf a guy on one of these large homes and I think that really\nSays it all your your mechanical systems represent about forty to fifty percent of your total electorate will depending on how old the system is\nRight that's right that's exactly right so tell me the story about that house\nYeah this is how it costs like come on and it uh as I Know that the house is about thirty five hundred four thousand square feet um it's got to two\nSystems in it a total of about eight ... I think\nUm and in the summertime is why don't ever gets over a hundred dollars and that's keeping the hell the home at Seventy two degrees all the time\nAnd he's not looking at replacing the system and every twelve years not at all you know so\nI mean there are some some some huge advantages to these technologies um but like anything else uh you got to deal with people who know what they're doing and you got to deal with people who have a long term success and experience with these types of alternative technologies you know I'm I built a lot of steel frame homes and I'm going to tell you something I\nPrice point versus function there's a lot of functionality and these cabinets that are offered today that are you will not find inside bill cabinets you know one it's very tedious\nTo the hardware is just not available ... there is some limited hardware for site builds up but all the really cool stuff that the manufacturers are pumping out they're keeping it to themselves now\nOh yeah yeah our um our manufacturer that we represent has got they they use exclusively blow him a drawer guys in hinges\nYou know everybody wants to go to the soft close and that's that can be done at a job ... Kevin but a factory cabinet just does it so much better you get a a great fit every time a we've come out with new uh it's called them the lego box and it's basically a a stainless steel metal\nDrop box and I mean as far as the glide the smoothness you don't get any swelling from the wood or anything like that and that's available then and there's nothing wrong with or a dove tail wood box but this is just the next level up of and it it comes at a cool grey\nYou know a couple of gray colors that you can put inside and um it it really is you know it's styles up your kitchen\nOr you know what I find ah with consumers is\nThat they usually react to the first person that they talk to you right\nSo if they decided to do a cabinet and they called Joan heard a little girl friend Joan and Joan ... Baba came over and build some cabinets for me you know they don't explore their options and you know cabinets today are like cars\nI mean they're glossy finishes baked on I mean they're they're manufactured in a in a paint booth\nI mean these things are all the the capabilities and the features and when you just look at the general construction\nOf a cabinet or you cannot compare\nThat to a site built oh product that\nTheir worlds apart which are in in in some cases you're going to pay more to haven't built on site\nRight right but you know in in Europe elder you you know for years we've been fighting the well that's what they do they do custom built cabinets\nAnd and what we do the same thing we will sit down with you when you come into our show room we will sit down with you designed it we can draw up on a cat system almost like you see on TV you know show you what you're going to get we can we can substitute a drawer stack versus just the drawing the door\nWe can give you all the the pullout trash cans all the the fund goodies inside the cabinet and we can show that to you but a part of that process is is deciding what you want seeing you know\nGoing out there and looking at it and then coming in will will design it at our show room will go through all your choices but then will come out to the house because a lot of these guys especially um [noise] the big box stores they don't want to\nThey want to leave the the show room or the store to come out and measure you provide the measurements will come out and provide the measurements for you that way for the most part we tried to get it right and take up every inch of your kitchen and and give you the the features that you want\nNow I I'm I'm I'm going to tell whether you're a builder an interior designer an architect or a remodel or or homeowner okay\n... ... if you go to their show room and people have come to your show room ... that we're listening to show I Want you to tell them hey you're going to be impressed when you're walking they've got some awesome cabinets and I'll tell you that\nWhat you need to do is say hey show me the warehouse [laughter] okay ... and I want you to do that with anybody you think you're going to buy cameras from right because obviously if you're selling cabinets you must be installing them\nYou're not really calling some guy in a truck and saying hey got they're going to deliver cabinets over there next week I Want to get over there and put 'em in go ask them say take me into the back and I want to see your warehouse OK you are going to be startled at the I mean they've got Ben's huge\nFloor to ceiling fans of cabinet that they install for multiple multiple groups of these sales organizations okay and believe me I'm a builder and I'm a Ramallah you do not want to be buying\nInstalled products like this from a salesman he want to buy it from the guy that's going to be installing it because I Can't tell you the number of ways that can go wrong but there's a bunch a lot\nAnd when they come out to look at your space you're going to get something that's predictable it'll be it'll fit it will be perfect there's not going to be the screw ups and you know you gotta ask yourself why with all these people alleging to be professional cabinet people sell something and not want anything to do with the install\nBut they want the credit right right yeah so you're paying more money\nYou're not getting the product on and you don't know who the hell is putting yourself in so\nTake it from me go to cabinet tree and you can't miss this company because it's T.
