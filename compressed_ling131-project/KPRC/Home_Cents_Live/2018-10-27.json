A. dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the shows doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach that financial freedom goal that you're after\n... what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have you have bags in bags loads of these these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now in another well the first thing we always understand here\nThat with trading it's simply a transfer of money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck think about this time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming up to the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right 'cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear our students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nBeen through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money and that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation\nAgain if you're ... and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there's no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great just sent me a postcard\nAnd she did and she said she was trading because that's a whole nother piece of ... people go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before after golf she goes oh\nBefore of course it I Love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago they did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection it doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduced you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that\nInside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end what do you say we do know that give away\nYeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here\nOh right right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big enough you will find out how and how is out at the half the class you know just a second you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half the classes to get your bones writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluded with your passages are professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy\nHow to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currencies and much much more the professional insider kit makes it so you get started right now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is\nEight eight eight six six to eight seven to three that dated eight six six to eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but it hit us up at Houston oh TA dot com and see if you can score some passes there Larry thanks for joining me always great to\nBe here Ryan hopefully some people are out there are going to take up take us up on this and a change their lives will be greatest I always like to say education appreciates possessions appreciate\nIt's been fun with your financial family on the radio airwaves this week we'll be back next week and look forward to speaking with you again but between now and then mail your trade ...

Fox News he said Donald Trump supporter suspected of sending a series of pipe bombs to prominent Democrat a latent\nOr and people would disorders of ... of the immune system are more susceptible to health problems related household mold now uh the problem is is that when when you when you have a healthy immune system\nConcentrated exposure to mold will try to defeat your immune system correct if it's already compromised and you've got a whole ... it can it can go any number of direction try correct\nNow testing in ... the the the the the recent flood that we had and the lack of professional mitigation companies who have been trained on how to contain\nRemove a mold and to ensure that it's been are mediated before reconstruction is isn't it has been provided\nHave created a whole slew of problems with you know if you leave what's the problem if you go in and you try to re mediate that space and you don't get it all\nSo I'm ... grows it's a it's a living organism and if it has moisture and and uh content to to feed off of it continues to grow and\nSo if you leave some of it behind it will just continue to spread and it'll continue to grow and you'll just have more and more of it now there are you'll you'll see mold and in a variety of different ways you might see just a little tiny speck on a piece of drywall you might have a little piece in a you know to piece of carpet and you'll get this ...\nYou see it around your shower or whatever the case is\nUm but the the important thing is is when you find it\nThe testing process by a consultant and by the way we don't we don't do testing right we do remediation work um so we're not the company to call to to go out and test year quality in your house there's there's professionals that do that we try to stick to what we do well and and they they do what they do well\nThey go out and they do these these tests and then as a result of those tests they end up bringing back a protocols you mentioned in that protocol says here's what needs to happen in order to remediate the mold\nIt is absolutely essential that you have somebody who knows how to follow that protocol and and and follow it to the letter to make sure that you end up with your house being are mediated\nThat includes making sure all the mold is gone but secondly it includes the containment process while the mold is being re mediated\nWere working in in a property where another company who wasn't qualified to do it went in to do a very small mode remediation did not contain it\nAnd put fans indie humidifiers in the house and now there's mold everywhere in the house and so it's really important that it's not just about getting them old out but it's about the process used to actually remove it that makes sure that you don't end up with it in other places in your home\nYeah unlike a tile in your shower I'm most of the other services in your home are porous yes right so you're sheet rock your would your stood all of it this stuff in permeate fat\nOr and what drives in his moisture and say Los Angeles has its primary food source show your entire home is built out of that so part of the process uh once the the the Mac consultants have identified that this is mold and what types of mold than your first\nStep is to contain it correct before you start carrying it out\nYeah yeah the worst thing you can do is just start swinging a hammer yeah uh that's that's not the answer to the to the to the problem um and so a containment is absolutely key\nAnd you you know you want to contain where you're working [noise] and anywhere that you think you may have\nAirborne bull spores and your house could be on your on your on your ah furniture or something she want to contain that area and then you want to have a contained area where you're actually cleaning it\nAnd making sure that you get it you get it all removed you can you can clean it all out of your furniture and all that kind of stuff that can all be done you just want to do it in a you know in a safe contained environment so that you aren't spreading it as you're doing it\nSo there's a there's a technological understanding that mean that the process of going through training is pretty extensive I mean it's it's not a not for the week and\nIt it it it's a you know it's a it's a quite a ... a lengthy course I'm it requires a reasonable amount of experience working with somebody who's already been certified to to even be able to get yourself through the course\nThe exam is really difficult um there aren't very many people who pass it on the first run um how you document what you're doing how you were mediate it how you can change at all those things are covered and there's a lot of complication to make sure that you get it right\nNow in here the reason that we're talking about this is because the way that our our homes are built now\nAre creating an exacerbating these problems are they're making them bigger okay one our our air conditioning technologies change we're going to be talking about that in the next phase\nA on today's show but ah what's happened is these systems in many cases are getting oversized and we started feeling all the air\nGaps off our home so that we can make more efficient right well it's eliminated the air exchange\nSo now these conditions that we are talking about when you have it's easier for these mould problems to develop in the house where you don't see 'em in in closets and dark spaces where you don't and then the ac system is circulating through the house\nSo if you're if you're experiencing certain conditions like a clammy feeling or you can't condensation throughout the house you really need to get on top of this\nAnd engage a company like yours to help identify where the problems are\nYeah and it's it's a ... is a good point the you know yesterday grows on on your drywall and your carpet and all that kinda stuff but once it gets started into your duct work in your in your home or your commercial property it's you know that that's how it spreads out of the room that it started in into various portions of the property so\nI'm part of the part of the process or certainly understanding whether you've got that air flow going or not and if you do it's really important to make sure that part of the part of the mediation process is the full and complete duck cleaning to make sure there's not existing in your in your duct work [noise]\nAll right we're talking with Bob Hillary's the owner of the franchise here in Houston for Paul Davis to eight one eight six Seventy seven fifty five to eight one eight eight six Seventy seven fifty five you can find them on line just search Paul Davis emergency services or Paul Davis a restoration\nWe're going to run out to a break so stay

franchise or for emergency services here in the Houston area ah okay\nWhile and I'll tell you something else you need to choose your own mitigation companies do not let your adjuster shove it down your throat while this company as well advocated by a lot of the insurance companies there is a huge difference in these companies\nAnd uh you know the the other thing the other misnomer that people have that I understand about this business because I Do a lot of consulting work Republican jesters is that the bigger the company the better in this case\nBecause the insurance companies are defining what they're paying\nPer fan how many fans what they're going to pay for the tower removal replacement\nYou need to make sure that there is electrical mechanical plumbing or any licensed professionals that those are actually uh companies like AC companies and electric companies that these are licensed companies with the states that are performing these tasks some of these some of these mitigation companies are are using handy man to do all these things\nAnd would you put your house at risk right and and the insurance companies are paying to have those professionals performed those services\nThat it's important to hire somebody who knows how the process works um you know insurance companies are going to pay you for what it takes put your house back as long as you've got the right professionals doing the work for you\nThat's right and the bigger company because the insurance companies are paying the same price you want the biggest company you can get to do it they have the the depth of resources the disorganization here has professionals running each division that guy that runs a reconstruction division is a builder with many years of experience and a huge reputation\nUm your water mitigation you've got the you've recruited a top guys in the marketplace in each vertical\nYup and you've and it's just essential to to have the the folks that really understand their place when you when we walk into people's homes we want them to know that the guy that's going to be doing the work on their house has done it many many times before knows where to look understands you insurance process and can get their house back to the place that was before the last\nYou guys have a gesture is on staff who understand the industry do indeed you don't have problems with the insurance companies because the scopes are written the way they need them to be written yeah um the other thing is commercial you have a huge commercial division and you facilitate both sides of the fence yeah\nAnd uh it's just in it you know when you're when you're dealing with commercial it is different so we have different people that focus on the on the commercial process the insurance process is different the clientele is different so you're going to get is just a different process to get the commercial work done\nBut uh the residential space uh you know having license guys and adjustments as a critical part of the of ah what is required to get the job done right\nOne one thing I Want to cover for we wrap and and that's sad toilet water okay category three yup clean or not it category three ... right\nYeah it's a there's a difference between if it comes out of your supply line or comes out of your toilet bowl toilet bowl\nIt is not clean water and that Florida coming up yup but ... you know what amazes me in a toilet in a bathroom on a small event it is absolutely insurance companies hunter ...\nWe're going to pay for that floor to be removed because that category three water out for your ... your entire house floods and we can clean it\nDon't get it though well I don't want my kids play on that floor [laughter] hey give me the baby I Want to put him on Mars or you can put his hand to mouth yeah All right Bob thanks for your time and thanks you guys are awesome or here's a phone number to eight one\nEight six or eight eight six Seventy seven fifty five to eight one eight six Seventy seven fifty five but that and your phone next time you have an event don't wake call these guys doesn't costs money to come out and take a look\nSo here it is to eight one eight six Seventy seven fifty five find them on line at Paul Davis restoration or Paul Davis emergency services thanks you guys will be right\nBack [noise]\n\nConstruction delays as you move in down on the east free way from Crosby Lynchburg over to Sheldon about a five minute delay we also have delays on the album\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of

Love the station got some great listeners and we certainly have some talented a trade that we've got on the air here so\nJason Jason has been around his daddy daddy\nGot him in his business so there there are multiple generations of a sea professionals here and you notice that the guys that know what they're doing don't have any ambitions to be electricians and pest control deeds\nSo if you're if you're looking for a procession all make sure that they're just doing one thing really really well that's hard enough\nSo welcome to show they drive me appreciate Simon ... All right I got some things I Want to cover now before we get into a replacement technology in ac equipment I Want to I Want to talk a little bit about some of the conversation we have about okay okay so we were talking about conditions that exist in the home that are creating more problems\nUm like for instance that claiming short cycling where you have condensation occurring throughout the house\nThat's right I'm oftentimes that could be the system is just not working properly needs the tuna meet some adjustments they could be that the system is oversaw us um that happens somewhat frequently it could be a duct work issue a duct work not designed properly not run or installed properly and that's causing a problem\nAll right so those are problems that need immediate attention deficit that will turn bad fast and it will get worse it won't get better\nRight not not not only for that aspect but you just shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable in your own home he\nWas bringing up another situation and said something about condensation around electrical outlets or something\nYeah a who he did um and and I think if you have that going on then you've got big problems and that's a definite immediate address it needs something needs to apple that right away\nUm for some reason then you've got way too much moisture in the home whether that some sort of leaks in the in the in the envelope or air conditioning issues or what something\nNow I Want to add something else that is if you have a home where the where you have ... and and the addict is found okay you have any conditions with regard to smell condensation any discomfort you need you absolutely call this guy yesterday okay\nThat's right where a lot of experience deal with ... homes and phone homes are great for an energy standpoint what their unique in the way that you have to deal with their a flow um fresh air being brought into the home 'cause it's like living in an ice chests and and it it is insulated unsealed uptight\nThere there's a lot of these homes that are built and I can tell you from just dealing in Clinton farmers are very close friend of mine he was my co hosts for a number of years\nUm he is one of the leading experts in that field or not to mention he has a tremendous builder was for sixteen years before you even got into energy audits and in a building science stuff but\nI can tell you right now to actually create those those phone homes with a closed at like assembly which is what is called it requires a team that work together constantly\nThey the the raider testing the house while it's under construction and try the AC guy working with the insulation company as a team it's not you don't ... this out these guys worked systematically because that thing has gotten very low tolerance is ... and if one of those things breaks down the whole house is going to fail\nThat's exactly right the builders I work with it that we do new construction with own homes we work with these builders for years and it's the same air conditioning guy the same plumber same electrician same frame or we're all on the same page and on the same team to create a a perfect environment\nAll right so and I want to have one more thing you guys do geothermal so you're on the the the leading edge of of air conditioning across the board that's right now let's just talk about the average person okay most common issues that most people have that I feel a lot of people make a really really bad decisions when it comes to AC replacement or repair\nUm because I see a lot of guys that shouldn't be in business and they're making money and driving trucks or somebody in somebody's stroking them checks okay\nSo how do you know how how does the consumer know that it's time to replace an ac system\nWell if you've been in your house for a while and and the ... and you've had a lot of problems with the system over the last few years maybe doesn't cool as good as it used to and you had to know some checkups done and everything seems to be seems to be doing all it can or\nIf you have a major component failure compressor go out big leak or something then that's the time it is to to think about replacing it I Would never suggest that somebody replacing the piece of equipment just because it's old if it's not given you any trouble than stay with it until it's time to do something else\nNo matter how old is you know truly I you know as a matter of fact I got a a cool story for you this is Jason with McCann services and ah [laughter]\nMy attorney calls me up he said service guys came over you and this is when you know we had a couple of years that we didn't have a a cooling season right or heating the rise it ... the the the AC company came over and they were supposed to be doing their their standard maintenance and they said oh you're systems are bad they need to be replaced\nAnd I said uh well\nOkay so you have two systems in the south and both of them are are failed us at ... or you uncomfortable he goes no\nI said and this was actually a just towards the end of summer still pretty hot yeah\nHe goes I I said do you feel a cold I mean he's he's partially blind you can't ... these these uh you got a vision problems\nSo he he goes no I feel I'm freezing my butt off\nI said well then you don't have a problem right no I I don't think you have a problem now so ah we got another ac company to go out there and and he was looking he was ... really stress because they were talking about thirty thousand dollar death and uh and and he at the time didn't want to spend thirty thousand dollars on you know\nSo uh we we found out there was nothing wrong with the systems\nThat so there's some ... some basic logic you need to survive when somebody comes and tells you that you have catastrophic failure and you're not sweating blood\nA Bel Air all those areas are they definitely service outside the beltway and outside the beltway okay so you're you're covering everything most of it All right you can\nFind them online at McCann services dot com or you can give 'em a call today at seven when three nine eight eight to six six five seven won three nine eight eight to six six five\nIs the phone number and uh you know I can tell you this right now when you get service from this company it will be a completely different experience than what you're used to and I'll tell you the thing I've learned in this industry all these years I've been building ground up designed building in remodeling\nYou you find that the companies that really know what they're doing ... desire to fix your equipment they do not desire to replace it okay because they are trained and comprehensive diagnostics it's a it's almost a natural reaction when you're competing in\nYou want to demonstrate your confidence it gives you a feeling of accomplishment where you don't know how to diagnose equipment then you're always going to be in the replacement ...\nThat's exactly right right and that happens a lot I turn it on it you won't come on they won't come wonder why ... I don't know don't forget one got to replace it is right instead of turning on the record that's right right or finding the wire the don't cheat or or replacing the motor that's a little bit more difficult than normal or lots of different things\n[laughter] [noise] All right so are we talking about the manufacturers you know there there's really not a a ton of difference because a lot of these components are are made by the same company now I Will tell you this ah my understanding is trained tried to make their own compressor at one time in a in an almost they almost destroyed them\nActually no that's not that's not true\nOkay 'cause I heard that that's not true\nG G well trains residential line is actually from General Electric they bought General Electric out in the early eighties and they made their own compressor and that compressor was really good that one of the best and industry okay um they had to change it when we went to for ten a cause that compressor didn't work with for today\n... oh okay okay so if I heard the story wrong yeah correct it was a really good to presser [laughter]\nOkay so the uh the the new company that came in ... in ... which is a monster yes smoking but they basically been very successful and in another country all of the rest of the world all of the rest of the world okay so now they're playing in the back there now they're in the United states that's correct\nBut they have changed the technology they're ... they're involving\nHanging out there I mean we've been on compressors and\nAnd uh and ducks a for ever since it's just an was developed\nRight and and and their approach started out as a what we call Douglas\nYeah sure many split up everybody's seen him around it's a little head usually they're white little air Hannah that's mounted up high on the wall and then there's other different applications for that but since they've taken some of the technology that made that stuff so successful and they've they've implemented it in conventional equipment that we use today\nOkay now let's talk about where the industry has going because these many what they called many splits okay seem like foreign technology or like a a novelty but the problem is a whole industry is going that way\nAnd and die can drove the boat that's right they do they invented\nThe technology has thirty thirty five years ago\nThat that's that's something that we need to really take into consideration right now is that the ... the the the future evolution of this industry is going to the technology that they are introducing\nNow and have invented that's right that's right\nAnd it\n... the main the main ... throwback you have to push back you have to many splits is um people are just in in Houston and in Texas in general but it used to just register is on the on the ceiling or on in the wall and not this thing hanging on it and and so people get pushback\nOr because they don't like the way it looks but in the end it's much more efficient equipped a piece of equipment because it doesn't have duct work\nAnytime you have duct work it doesn't matter how well let's see how well it's insulated there's always a lost their\n... efficiency ... well you've got that and you've got you don't have the zoning issues have with two stories systems I mean ... these this is the system is naturally zoned\nExactly so you know every every son or daughter every every uh man cave living room master bedroom everybody can have their own control and be happy\nIt's that that is one thing that I find profoundly exciting about that that technology and the ducks are not there you know you don't have houses that weren't properly maintain with fifty percent of the air being blown into the addict because the ducks are not properly sales or their cut\nThat's exactly right and this uses the best compressor technology that's available today which isn't in murder and what that means is it speeds up and slows down as the load speeds up and slows down so we need the little air conditioned in the morning 'cause it's cool cooler outside\nThen it runs at a slow speed and the afternoon when it's a hundred degrees outside it's running full bore and and giving you all all that you need so what you what you have there is less chance of over ... all of those such problems go away so\nI basically it solves all the inadequacies with design installation and maintenance\nWith the old system right now we've got the the Model T right versus the brand new Corvette\nThat's exactly right and then in the middle is ... you know if the full mini split every room having its own control is not your thing than you can do it with two or three zones and have duct work small short runs with duct work so there's not near as much loss instill more entered a lot more energy efficient than conventional equipped\nOkay now the reason that we talk about that as people need to understand we're codes are going and when these systems were originally designed when conventional air conditioning systems were originally designed they were designed with metal ducks\nThat's correct not flex ducks no metal ... that's right okay now at some point somebody's trying to save money and started it now how we're flex ducts used in context with metal ducks\nOriginally flex duck was used just as last run to the box it use it it it was a good sound attenuated or a\nExternally insulated mental duck tours has a slick mental service on the inside can be noisy um you can hear the air flowing through it sometimes and so that little bit of flex at the end took that no one is a way that was what it was originally for and then that flex got better and better and\nThe housing market wanted houses built cheaper and cheaper and\nHere we are today All right\nNow what's ironic about that is now the efficiency in operation and costs are big huge problems uh the codes are are moving back to go into the metal and getting ready to flex\nYes I I can see in the future energy code and then I Would say probably for sure in the next five years um they're gonna start limiting the amount of flux ducked you can have\nIn a in a in a home they are it's already that way and commercial you cannot run just straight full fledged duck from the unit to the grill in uh in commercial you have to use metal or duct board at least a hard rigid duck between ... and then you just see a fee to flex time\nAnd and this is where this parrot giant paradigm shift is going to take place because the builders don't want it cheaper and better that's right so what's going to happen is when you if I asked you to install all metal ducks in my house because I was concerned about allergies or whatever right versus flex what does that do the prices system\nThat well the price of the duct yeah the duct work that needs to be done will double or triple and call right and they'll do from a twenty five hundred dollar job to Seventy five hundred dollar job worked or more\nYeah and and and these these big big production companies are going to say uh have you know things and then ... going to fly in with their super duper zone system Douglas faster installed less

them and to eight one for seven seven thirty four hundred\nWhat I what I find it amazing about this is that when you go to the front page there's sponsor a veteran but right next to it they're suggest a veteran you don't see that in a lot of uh of these organizations where you have just as much opportunity to suggest somebody that you might know the need to help and I I commend you for that\nBut I Want to share a story with you that's a very personal um and this just goes to this war\nI'm with the way that these bombs were built uh we're we're really took a lot of these twenty twenty two year old kids twenty four year old kids and and\nAnd and took a lot of limbs off I mean in a lot of them survived those events and some of them are are quadriplegic and some of them are you know to have legs missing this is a story now this is this is my personal family okay um\nMy nephew died in his third tour in Iraq and this is a story from the Christian chronicle of one of the guys it was with him on that day it's called courage under fire and on the church member from Missouri's or twenty two year old army infantry men that relies on his faith in his family after losing both legs\nAre in ... in his second tour of duty in Iraq\nUm it said that uh by early may when they set out on a mission a south of Baghdad army ... ah Chris rotor had become accustomed to the barrage of attacks from

order to seven soldiers behind him to hold up from ten to Fifteen feet behind them redder watched as the twenty six year old Texan pulled back brush on the side of the road\nI E D yelled during the ... the D a in a in a improvised explosive device didn't even make it out of his mouth before the bomb had exploded and killed him\nAnd uh now more than three months later\nWrote her a a faithful church member and son of a preacher from a small town in Missouri golden valley misery golden valley was driven a was driving the lead Humvee in that six men vehicle Caribbean now what's important about that is this young man a lost both of his legs\nAnd faces all kinds of chase twenty two years old mhm he has an entire life that he's got to look forward to and what most people who don't have disabilities don't understand about the way that we build homes is most homes don't meet a two foot eight white\nAnd these wheelchairs won't fit through the correct you know and and very few there's only maybe one or two doors that traditionally have a three foot or two foot eight standard on smaller homes and and it and it makes it impossible for these folks to navigate these spaces\nAbsolutely and so that's kind of what we do is we will just go into their home where you will determine their\nTheir daily I'm routes so to speak around their home and we will modify them\nWill to take down walls if we have to um course it's really hard to widen hallways\nUm hallways are typically okay I'm at the door openings as you mentioned ... many ... from a bathrooms and clause it's especially have to our doors and and some to six to eight um doors around the house so you know a\nLot of them are fairly compressed because they're not designed for wheelchairs you were talking about the five foot radius where the wheelchairs have to go in and around the toilet area and they need to support\nAnd the ... ... exactly and so that's what we do as a as a design builder um we do this um and and it's\nIt's been such a tremendous experience uh since guns to hammer since the since they won\nThe support we've gotten I'm not just here in Houston a San Antonio which is their hometown so I went to high school um and then other cities around the entire country um have supported us with ... with just completed a project in Las Vegas [noise]\nWe're about ready to start another one in Mobile Alabama we just finished another one in in Pensacola, Florida just there was just a roof for a veteran I mean so we're not just doing these really super cool I'm Edie Edie modification sometimes a vet that's down um\n'cause it just disabled vet he just he may need something really simple like a roof you know and and that was a really easy job for us but\nYou know we were created a lot of momentum over the last couple of years um we traveled the country from coast to coast raising money I'm raising awareness um we did it in in the gunny which is our\nIs our restored jeep that we it's wrapped in

York times best selling author AJ Jay Gould about how we are all family like it or not the judge\nWhat's gonna happen many times and we see it happen every day is people spend several thousand dollars on an architect who will sell them set up a the plans and sell them a dream and that's all it ends up being because they can never it seems like many times um they can't afford the project that the architect designed whereas at it that\nThat's a that's a hundred percent I you know I I ... I\n... tell people this you know and I don't care if you have a twenty thousand dollar budget right or you have a ten million dollar budget right because people are when they're spending a you know a hundred thousand on a remodel a hundred and fifty they they pretty much feel they got all the money that they had\nThat they need they can do anything they want and the problem is architects and the commercial world are the builders correct and they are sensitive to cause they know what they can and what they can do they know where they get burned and when they don't get burned\nIn this world they don't have they're not accountable\nSo exactly you draw house you can't build or you draw remote project you can't build there's no repercussions\nAbsolutely and whereas what I always ask 'em and a ... a lot of are etched on customers are returned are repeat customers or the referral customers and I were very transparent were very up front and if we're going to go into a design build with somebody\nWe will ask for okay look so we we can design your project but let's be transparent what do you want to spend on this project because there's always multiple ways of doing this of doing this\nProject so if if they're transparent with us we can apps if they say for example if you're going to go out and buy a new house from a realtor that real just going to ask you what your budget is if you got a three hundred thousand dollar a budget that going to show you a three hundred thousand dollar house\nIf you've got a hundred thousand dollar budget for your for your remodel project lecture builder if if you're comfortable with him you have to trust him to some degree\nLet him know look I've got a hundred K. to spend on this job [noise]\nUm what can I get for that [noise]\n... we're we're going to go to a break I'm I'm gonna we're gonna I'm gonna keep you are\nIn the next segment 'cause we're going to talk about the design and build a and the economics associated with this this is really important that we get this out because people are basically engaging these services on custom homes and remodeling\nBackwards and there are a lot of them getting separated from the money and some of these some of these uh architectural plans are twenty thirty thousand bucks I mean there's nothing sniff at predicting we'll drive back [noise]\n\n[noise] and I was buying why every time\nWe're talking with Jay are with M.

I mean we're not talking like a hundred thousand dollar project is going to be within like four or five grand runner thousand projects that will be twenty five thousand thirty thousand dollars difference second and then you're just going to be more confused\nCorrect um this is why we stress I'm just first of all pick your contractor carefully because if you've done through diligence there\nAnd you've you've done your background than you are going to bring in somebody into your home that's trustworthy but you can uh that you can feel really really good about doing business with the other thing is is when it does go into a design\nBuild a ... when the when it goes into that face um beef up front with your builder let him know look we've got twenty thousand dollars to spend on this on this bathroom or whatever your budget is\nAnd let them know and let him because once that builder has a number to work with his bank and say okay I've got twenty grand a work with here let me see how great I can give how fantastic a project I can give them for twenty thousand dollars or whatever if you just have an architect draw set of plans\nThat you're twenty thousand dollar budget could easily be fifty thousand dollar remodel right um and then everybody's wasted their time and Jeff wasted your money\nSo let us let us give us the opportunity to design something we've had people give us thirty thousand dollar budget and we've had we've gotten that done for twenty [noise]\nJust because you give a count it again if you're dealing with the right guy\nUm just because you give somebody a budget doesn't necessarily mean that is going to be maxed out budget many times I've found ways of simplifying the project of giving people more value\nUm maybe not reinventing the wheel like the architect it on the plants I'm let's keep the fixtures where they are let's just bumped is well out here and still give them their exactly what they wanted but for less money um\nWell there's there's other aspects of a in an older homes okay absolutely if you if you are designed it starts moving pipes around and moving drains around and they've got old cast iron and dreams of having failed jet okay and you start messing around with them\nYou're incorporating tens of thousands of dollars worth of cost to accommodate a design that may seem logical but could the space planning could have been done totally different\nBut when you have people that don't tear things apart and don't understand the problems associated with that then they drop pretty pictures that at your expense\nThat are economically I are are not conducive to your budget\nAbsolutely um it's it's all about choices and um if if when you go into a remodeling project as I said I Can't stress this enough is just through your background on your on your contractor\nUm check reviews checked the be all of the air is on line and and just be prepared to when you let them in your home just be prepared to be up front straightforward\nAnd um [noise] and a transparent because a good contractor will be that way with you that's certainly how we are with people [noise] um [noise] as crazy as it sounds you know we get phone calls from people sometimes that want to know should I remote or should I Move\nSure I Know that's actually a good question yeah and that's something you should consider\nAnd I and you know I've I've talked myself out of more projects remodel projects because I've been totally honest with people and certain situations they are better off moving\nTheir their tear down situations in rural areas that should not be remodel because you're never going to get your your your house there's a lot in value advocate", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Home Cents Live", "city": "Houston", "day": "27"}
