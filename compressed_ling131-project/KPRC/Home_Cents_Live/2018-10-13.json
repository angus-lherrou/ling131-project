A. dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said it earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you could reach that financial freedom goal that you're after\nWhat are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags loads of these of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place that are now in another\nWell the first thing we always understand here is that with trading it's simply a transfer of money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad is people will get themselves stuck think about this time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you're we're coming up to the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right 'cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear our students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there's no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf and ... and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great just sent me a postcard\nAnd she did and she said she was trading because that's a whole another piece of ... people go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before after golf she goes\nBefore of course it I Love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kind of fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduced you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that inside of the half the class and we are\nPretty much at the end of the show but before we end what do you say we do know that give away\nYeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here\nAh right right now we've got

President Trump is promising when it comes to the fate of missing journalist Washington Post contributor to mark ... hasn't been seen since entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second\nUm you know and then the maintenance on the long run it's actually a little easier to maintain a wooden door um than it is a fiber glass door\nBut there are some applications you know where you know a fiber glass door you know if you're you know and a lot of moisture and you know I'm going to have some water issues and things like that and drainage or whatever that fiber glass door may be better for that application or where you're not having to deal with a you know rod and things like that over time\nDid you get a chance to look in Susan's Moore\nI did yes okay now here's a perfect example the their their intimate dinner and she got an existing doors pretty tattered um you know just hadn't been maintained a and she wanted to change out the glass and makes them on a vacation to the door and it was like a to a six eight or something like that right right\nSo uh is it better for her to replace a repair well\nA case you know she sent me some pictures and we kind of a took a look at it and you know when you're getting into the refinishing Carson she's wanting to replace glass and different things like that and she had the old single you know paint led a glass which ... all doors now have insulated glass\nUm but in her case you know when you look at the costs of refinishing replacing the glass it's almost you know more cost effective to get a new door start from scratch and then you know take care of maintain that door um you know through the years\nSo in her particular case you know and but you know she has a a little transom up in the frame and everything paint and you know everything is is a pretty good shape so all we're doing is just adore change out man those are very affordable um you know a lot of people think you know mahogany doors at this and lead a glass or whatever it is is really expensive\nI mean we've got deals starting at nine Ninety nine stand and installed for a standard size three oh six eight door change out mahogany door stand or you're you're a choice of color or various different glass options that includes installation as well on your existing door frame starting at nine Ninety nine I mean\nYou really going to cost or more to make the repairs ... yes yes\nAnd that's that's where the problem I\nHave a lot of consumers that will go at something like this is what I Want you to do and and that's exactly what she told me she goes I Want to take my existing door and I want these things to happen to it and\nKnow they're not even open to the idea of maybe investigating what the what a replacement costs would be versus the repair and in this particular case she's better off economically getting new door\nYes and and you know I Want to let people know as well that you know there's a lot of different refinishing companies out there that do that and there there's a right way and a wrong way to do it most of these companies that will come out\nYou know they may only charge you a couple of hundred dollars but they'll take the door off it's in your front yard they're stripping down they put a coat of you know staying on there and maybe one code of varnish on their um you know that one could have varnish is not going to last you do maybe another year another season you'll be called him back out there again so you're going to be constantly having to go through that cycle\nI'm the proper way if you are going to replenish the doors really take the door down needs to be in a controlled environment at the ... and he has to be stripped down um stained and then off for three to four coats varnish you know put on there to make that door look beautiful again and that's just not something that can really be done and somebody's front yard\nAnd an hour to um you know and have it you know left them several more years so you know don't get stuck in that trap of you know just having to have somebody come out there and and ... that door once a year\nOr really needs to be done it was the right way if you're ... you know it's just like you know blacks in your car and you know the clear coat on the car if you don't take care of your car you don't wash your car\nAnd what happens is that clear cut wears off paint starts flake and you've got rest\nThe doors the same thing you got to keep that you know that varnish on their keep him a protected if you don't it wears off you've got Raul would expose you got to shrink and expansion the door start cracking and coming apart when you get to that point it's just you know you're you're looking at a full replacement at that point\nOkay let let me ask you this uh if\nThey hadn't perfectly been as you got a brand new door okay uh and it would do or how often should they have somebody come out in in ... services or or do something to it to preserve and prolong the life of the dorm\nGood rule of thumb on our finished that we put on our doors we do for coats and we use a marine grades bar varnish um we offer a one year warranty on that finish which most companies don't offer any warranty on they're finished whatsoever they can't warranty at in Texas so\nUm the answer your question my rule of thumb is about one coat will ask you about one year so we put for coats on marriage should be in normal conditions about three to four years before you have to do any kind of maintenance on that door\nUm if you do it yourself you do allied sending political varnish on there if you put one coat on there you know you're pretty much gonna have to keep up with a yearly once a year if you take the extra time and put an extra coat on there and it may be two years before you need to do that\nAnd the maintenance is easy Mike it's really it's you know some light sending a bone brush her dinner\nOr find you know brush applying the polyurethane or varnish on there you're doing the exterior and the edges of the door um it doesn't take a whole lot of time but it's so important and you know keeping 'em the life of your door and keep it in looking great for years to come\nOr we're gonna run out do bring guys it's a free meal doors you can find them online at ... dot com that's primo doors dot com you can call them in a three

mortgage loan\nMany options considering you the loan them you\nClose to the store\nWas my\nWhen Jason begging Jason is are All right let let me ask you um stylistically what is not today\nWhat what um for the most part I mean we went you know where there's all this rustic heavy stuff and it seems like we're going through a a real contemporary things right now yeah\nWe are ah everything's going more clean 'em clean lines you know a lot of people are going away from the er the decorative a letter glass um and people are wanting more clean lines I mean Neal must have a lot of our doors have raise molding on there you know kind of the mold and that goes around the or the panels and laugh and\nStuff and everybody's want us to take that off but it wasn't just more clean lines\nEverything straight modern is definitely an even on the traditional homes um people are going more towards the modern trend um archery divided light doors you know our six lied for light you know just a divided like doors with clear glass or clear bubble glass um those are really really popular um uh\nAnd then of course these modern are indoors um you know just a real thin narrow profile a metal doors with the with the thin line to cross who got several different glass textures a there that are offered\nUm you know we have all different shapes and sizes we build those aren't doors to fit I'm so you're guaranteed fit in your injury home if you're a place in the door and you want to put a metal aren't door and there\nWere one of the few companies that actually build those units to fit we're not trying to retrofit a pre made our unit and to your opening you know our units are built to fit your opening exactly\nAnd that's that's actually really good point um no let's talk about your high and customs customs stuff I mean I'm not seeing you you've done some really green injuries for churches and commercial obligations as well\nYeah we do custom doors we can do pretty much anything if you can dream it draw it you know send me a picture you know we we can build that we offer a variety of different uh what species\nHum you know from you know mahogany several different variations of mahogany as well where there well you know a regular mahogany or they want you know African mahogany um there's a you know some genuine mahogany sip of mahogany things that are more deeper richer and color\nTrying to get back over to a bomb Panama City yeah\nBack in Florida now so we just which the teams got back from North Carolina and and uh they're back in Florida now I'm obviously the you know everybody's seen the news and the devastation to horrible on our thoughts and prayers are with those folks and we're just they're trying to help as many people as we can and um but there's a lot of work to do to rebuild a Florida for sure you you guys are\nOne of the largest organizations in Houston and across the country bottom Paul Davis is a is a very premium brand and franchise um a lot of the guys that you have on staff you guys have like over thirty trucks and he had a massive organization and you've got some of the most experienced people in the industry working for you and they said they have never seen devastation like this\nYeah one of my guys it's leading to the team on the ground has been doing this for a over a dozen years and and uh this is this is the worst storm that he's been in the middle of and I think it's just a you know if you if you've seen the news around Mexico beach in Panama City and just the you know the flattening of some of those buildings and whatnot it's a [noise]\nThere's just a lot of a lot of people without a lot of ... you know without their stuff at this point and and uh it's pretty heartbreaking\nI'm you know but ah we're there to help as many as we as we can and and I was just going to take a long time right and there's a lot of infrastructure be rebuilt and the and all a lot of buildings that are going to have to go back up and and uh you know so a lot of help is needed and and I know a lot of people are flooding the area to do just that\nOkay now what I Want to talk about ... and consumers are day to day lives are affected by services you provide\nA water heater pipe breaks a I mean just to overflowing toilets there's a whole cadre of events that occurred day to day that they need you to come in dry out the structure and and get it put back together and there's two types of companies that provide this service\nUm whether you have you know water damage or fire damage or you know whenever there's going to be companies out there that are going to come in and want to drive to structure out and get it ... ready for reconstruction and leave\nOkay and then there's companies like yours that provide a turn key complete service that you're going to drive the structure getting ready for reconstruction and build it back correct\nCorrect and I think at I think uh you know what you what I Would encourage people to think about is there is a professional services elements to restoration\nLike there is another in other industries and and it's not\nIt's not just about whether or not they can drier house out or even whether they've got the right frame or the right trim guy it's about Ken they work through the insurance process with you and provide that professional level service to you to make sure that your house is going to be restored to the way it was before the loss\nAnd I think that that's the important part of of the process and so\nWhen we sit down and talked to people we you know we always encourage them to start with let's let's you know talk about everything that was in your house for the last let's work through the you know the the details because they're very important I mean you put a lot people put a lot of time into decorating their houses and making them look the way that they want them to look\nIt's important that you know we don't lose track of that just because you know the ceiling may have fallen in because of a hot water heater and and now nobody's paying attention to the details that went into the paint on the ceiling or the tremor the ... or whatever the cases and so what we like to do is spend time with the with the owners to make sure that all those details are captured\nAre you know one of the front parts of our service Israeli around dealing in introducing you to the insurance company in the insurance process\nUm most people don't go through that process more than once and we go through that process everyday and we're familiar with it we have great relationships with the insurance companies and the reason we have those relationships is because we know they're process\nAnd we work with them on their process to make sure that you get funded appropriately to get your house back to the to the way it was before and that includes all the details\nAnd I think that's an important part of the part of the process\nThat that is what I Want to focus on because that is the great differentiate are and there's a lot of companies out there small ones medium sized ones are and and when you have a loss like this whether it's a devastating flood or it's a high wind storm you know or it's it's something that happens inside the house that might be minor\nThat still has to be put back together and the problem that you have with these companies that only provide drying services or mitigation services or is that they're one they tend to eat up a lot of the money and they don't have an interest or a vested interest in in getting back into your house and you've got policy limits on these things\nAnd the other the other dynamic uh because I get the brunt of people who called the insurance company the adjuster came out there at fifty percent or thirty percent of the value of the loss and now we've got to fight\nTo get them one identify the damage get it written up properly get submitted so that we can ... this is we're talking months we're talking just argue is months of time\nThat to get them made whole and that's the reason that that's what I see is the is the big hammer\nWith people fighting with you is because you're looking at the entire\nYou're looking at the entire picture I've got to get this thing dry I got to get it safe and then I've got to rebuild them and get him back in efficiently I've got to submit this information to the insurance company to get the money we need to make it happen so that the homeowner can just get this ... get this done in a compressed way that is the problem that I see\nNinety five percent of the time is that when you and I were talking I was wanting you to tell me that you have all these problems with these insurance companies underpaying or undervaluing stuff\nAnd you did not even you know all these companies pay like they're supposed to it's because you're creating the documentation and establishing the actual damage and documenting in a way that they receive it and accept it yes it is a difference\nYeah that's exactly it right there's there's and the details you can't you can't under state the the the importance of all the details in this process [noise] so if somebody comes into your house and does a bunch of Democrats unnecessary first of all\nThe details are now gone we can't even see them right and so how do I how do I know with the quality of your of your ... holding was and how do I how do I show the insurance company that you had spent a whole bunch of extra money on your crown molding it as a result we need to make sure that that gets paid for so we can replace it\nAnd it'll end point and that's an excellent point\nIn addition to that there's all the other things that are in your house your clothes right if it was if it was a closet underneath where your hot water heater went bad and all of a sudden you know your clothes either needs to be replaced\nOr or or or cleaned or it could be artwork it could be electronics it you know so it's more than just the building process itself [noise] it's all the things that are in your home that you want replaced cleans a fixed whatever the case is to get you back to the place that you were before the loss\nSomebody that can look at all the aspects of it and understand all the details and most importantly present that as a package that insurance company so that you get what you need in order to to put your house back together is the most important part of the process\nNow you guys also facilitate commercial applications is while you're not just residential\nCorrect um in fact we we do probably fifty percent of our businesses in the commercial space\nUm [noise] but at the same thing applies there right we're we're constantly finding\nYou know it details in in commercial buildings if it's a\nA a condominium building or a a or an apartment building or an office building the details are very different and often the details sort of sort of describe what that building is and what the personality of the group in that building wants to portray\nIf you don't understand what that is and you can't track all that you can present that well the insurance company to make sure you can put that back to the way it was they've lost something about their personality and the personality that building\nSo it's those details are really important to us that's why we you know we we have a set process that we follow to to make sure we capture all those we send out you know our estimators who are very familiar with the insurance process we you know we pride ourselves on your\nCustomer whoever it is that had the losses definitely our customer were in your court and making sure that you get what you need in order to put your house or your property back together but we also believe that there's value in having good relationships insurance company understanding that process that helps us make sure that we get what you need in order to put your property backed away it needed\nTo be so ... and and this is ... and the bottom line okay is that if you engage the company like this or you engage them then the likelihood of you needing an attorney or Republican gesture by the end of this thing would be very minute they're as small I Would have to be a really\nStrange argument to that would have to go to the mat for some anomaly and construction\nCorrect yeah I mean we've definitely been called in to properties where it hasn't gone well and now a public adjuster and attorneys are involved\nUm we haven't been in a situation where we have to do that because our licensed a adjuster and estimators or what not know the process um we've we've invested heavily in making sure we have the right talent upfront to be able to to be able to do that work and so that's an ... that has sort of\nGathering of working for you because you've been doing this for a number of years and when I when I open that door for when our our ... interview to talk about what we're going to be talking about today\nI open that Pandora's box hope hoping to get a reaction that your aggravated and you're mad that these insurance companies or you know taking it to the consumers and stuff and I I mean it absolutely did not have any reaction because\nYou're not having problems yeah because these things are properly documented up front they agree with the damage in the last and they're willing to pay policy limits on things where you prove damage but you're also ... ... the contents\nIs probably three o'clock in the morning and the news cameras are in their face\nAnd there's five guys out there with those little radio that are trying to get him to sign up for mitigation services you know they're like the ambulance chasers right yeah so that the problem is you've got to take a breath because you've sacrificed so much when you make decisions like that right yeah\nYeah it's a I think it's a you know it's a great opportunity to to do just that I mean a just a bit of a break to sort of get your head together and think about the the things that need to happen um to\nClarify you don't have one of those radio chasers working for you to and we do\nWe do not we have we listen to fires we ... we tried to go out the day after and talk to people um you know we you know I guess we could invest in somebody that were standing there at the time but our our approach would definitely be different or\nWe you know I ... everybody that we talked to the next day we just encourage them to sort of sit back and and I think the process through a little bit\nUm again like we talked about with with the water damage there is a process to go through right and and it's unfortunately it's not quick right there's with fire even even a small fire that didn't necessarily do a lot of charging damage in your house\nOr nobody likes the smoke smell this left that\nThey have pungent yeah really difficult to get and it's everything\nRight it's in your clothes it's in your electronics it's in your artwork it's in your dishes it's in you know it's just it's in your dry wall and your carpet and it's just everywhere and you just can't you know you can't escape that so [noise]\nUm the the important thing for us as just you know take a breath is not easy to take a breath but take a breath\nUm and uh just make sure that you understand the process that has to happen so we like to show up and and the next day and talk to people about uh you know what the process is\nUm if people want to use this that's great there's a few things that people need they've got a few you know immediate needs or some yeah sometimes it's close to where the next day quite frankly because uh you know they need to get a few things out of the house and get him clean so that they can survive the next two or three days but\nUm it's really important just to sort of make those make those logical steps but then you you move from okay I've now decided on somebody that I'm going to work with they have to be able to take care of the water damage has talked about the fact they're pouring thousands of gallons of water in your house um then they have to there's some demo that that needs to happen\nThere's always clothing artwork and electronics that have to happen and then um once once you work through all of that\nThen again you have to start assembling the details and the fire details are even more difficult to assemble and take more time and more thought than the water or details because in cases where\nYou you're you're building actually went up or you know and it literally and smoke and you've got charred pieces and whatnot it's a lot harder to assess exactly what was there so that you can make the right points insurance company and get the money that you need so [noise]\nUm you know I Know we we talk a lot about details I Can't talk enough about him because they matter and uh if you don't pay attention to those you're you're gonna miss out so that's that's the important part of the of the fire process\nYeah and I you know I I actually interviewed or a close friend of mine who's a now retired fire chief um and you know he talked us through the environment when a fire is actually going rhyme and we're talking a thousand degrees of heat\nPlastics all kinds of things that are melting or some of the environmental conditions are creating a ass or acids that work on medical or we're working on metals like break ties and stuff like that I mean it's just nails are and they say it's highly corrosive and it's a highly corrosive environment and\nAnd how hot it gets you know is is an important part of that right to you what you think about a water last you're walking in and you're looking from the floor up to determine how much how high the water got you walk into a fiery looking from the ceiling down to see how hot it got and how far down right to find that fire line\nAnd understanding all of that so you know what has to come out and what can stay\nUm what the you know we we do through we always do three things when we're we're trying to make sure that we get the smoke smell out right if you've got to clean everything that had any contact with the smoke has to be clean not just because it's corrosive but because it leaves the you know leaves the smoke older\nI'm there needs to be some level of scientific ... applied that varies depending on the on the side of the fire it it it could be ozone it could be other things that that that are available to us to make sure that happens and then sort of encapsulate in to make sure that any odor that might be left in any of the building materials never escape\nAnd so working through that process it's tedious\nIt takes time it's a frustrating process to watch but it's important that all the right steps are taken 'cause the ... the worst thing in the world after your houses all put back together after a fire is a year later you start smelling that's that faint smoke smell disaster that would\nAn absolute disaster and I'll tell you the other thing uh that I have a high ... a confidence level and your staff is the destructive analysis that takes place\nAfter the fire to determine what needs to be demo mode and what needs to be repaired their structural interpretations there's water damage and if you have a company that comes in and they're drawing service and they're they're they're just getting ready for reconstruction\nChances are they're going to miss a lot of things that need to be repaired and considered in that loss um where maybe an engineer might get involved um because that's not what they do they're not worried about\nReconstruction are worried about getting the charged up out and and making it smell OK so it looks like it's ready for reconstruction\nAnd the problem is is that you you know you you're gonna have to take some stuff to determine world the charge stuff is exactly right and and uh I think that's the ... you know we'll we'll talk about all these losses and restoration businesses it's hard to put pressure on the other but it was easy then yeah you could hire anybody they come in to figure it out but\nYou really don't know what how to come out until you get that process started\nAnd so um you know it takes patience and encourage everybody to be patience with the patient with the process but it's important to be patient is reporter to understand the details or the right person that understands that process and go walk you through it\nAll right so here's the phone number to eight one eight eight six Seventy seven fifty five to eight one eight six Seventy seven fifty five Paul Davis emergency services Paul Davis restoration that is the company's either trucks all over town\nYou've got to flee to thirty

about the anticipated arrival of an American pastor who's flying home from Germany after nearly two years of detention in Turkey the president saying close pastor\nTo find the weakness and the problems so that I can truly compare and not be biased about it and say okay I'm going to go look at this cat and you're going to look at these types of cabin is these are the things you come to my show room I'm going to show you what to look for these your quality differentiate or is this is what keeps the cabinet from falling apart takes all that damaging that long term where\nRight you want to you in in any choice you're going to make and cabinet you want to go be able to see it touch it feel it I'm for several years um I tried to sell cabinets and I did but I sold cabinets off of brochures indoor samples\nAnd that works to a point but ... once you get to the point where you have a show room and it opens up where people can come in I've sold more cabinets off of what I'm displaying in my show room because people see it and can visualize that in their own house versus looking at a brochure or something like that\nThe the other thing is we're able in the short run to show you the quality that we can offer show you the features you need to look for when you buy from us or anybody else there are certain basic features now days that you want to you want to know what they are and you want to be able to look for those in anybody's cabinet and whether you're getting a quality cabinet or not\nNow if you look at at a\nAt Greg's that cabinet trees price points okay and you look at the quality of the cabinets and the features built in which is a big deal I mean\nI I Know a lot of these companies are playing this game where they looked like they've got a good baseline cabinet because they know you're going to put in tray holders they know you're going to put in a trash pull out so when all those things go up and then the numbers blow up right\nSo you do pay for those features but it's it's like cars you know it's it's it's a compilation but if you look at the way the your cabinets are built okay and you look at and you understand how to compare them then you won't be blinded by all the big brand names\nBecause you're looking for feature compatibility you're looking for the way those those cabinets or building constructed and with the magnitude of of manufacturers out there now competing for that space these big brand names are falling short\nRight and we're we're set up and and our whole business operation is that we wanted to be the alternative to some of the big brand names you might not have heard of us um as far as our the manufacturer that we represent they have three different lines of cabinets it's um\nThey offer aspect which is the butter line Shiloh which is our plywood full overlay or or insect cabinet line and eclipse which is our for English European style cabinet\nThat the nice thing is when you come in a lot of the features you last me can we do this or or do we need to switch to this land a cabinet most of my cabinets don't have varying price ranges I can give us a full overlay\nAll plywood cabinet for the same price that I can give you a frame was full access cabinet or the ... river and they're they're the same price point and it's just a matter of features we don't have door styles that you're paying ... you know for each ... each door style does it cost his own amount\nUm will price the job out for you\nThe the one thing that we also like to do is when we're brushing your job we want to go not to the high end but we want to put all the features in it that you want and start their versus\nStarting at the bottom trying to get you to commit and if you want to add stuff and we oh well that's not in there that's not in there I Would rather start from the top and give you the what what you want or your dream kitchen and then work it down if it if it's not in your budget\n[noise] All right so go on

I mean there's just a there's a whole cadre of things that the uh the columns out front there were or neatly built\nOut a tremor falling apart and writing and uh you know so you got a couple of different scenarios that are occurring or one you know\nThe paint wasn't maintained which is going to ... ... it's going to exacerbate the problem but the other thing is what could have been done\nTo those materials that would allow them the last much longer even if the maintenance was poorly supported okay\nIt's pre treating those materials who do not want to be in an outdoor environment right so what happens with wood is once would hits over twenty Twenty one twenty two percent moisture content it begins to rot\nIntegrate so what does paint do paint protects would from being exposed to the outer elements it's vapor buried\nSo the manufacturers\nSay we want you to climate like this and we want you to paint it what you codes and you know\nThat's not what the industry does everybody in this industry tries to ... and not everybody but most of these companies try to cut corners you know so the thing is you got to you've got to combat that with knowledge you have to understand this stuff but I prefer\nOn those materials that are going to be exposed to the door elements unless it's iron would or something that's absolutely bullet proof that you have a pre drill to install um\nWe have to prep these woods with a surface treatment that seals them before we put in a static paint coat over it so that in the event in the future\nThat that that they're exposed or that paints breached for whatever reason you got a second layer of protection that's mitigating a witch giving you time it's given you extra time to make the repairs needed to protect that would because once it starts dry riding and once it starts de ...\n... you're you're going to have to replace it\nYou know and and I see so many houses that are that fall into those categories I mean they all look great the day there first painted but they just don't wear well and if you don't get on it quickly than you are faced with replacement which many of these people are and we're talking\nLarge cost to make those repairs tear that stuff apart fix it put it back right so\nThe the the different I'm Talking about from a a good builder to a great builder is that that the great builder is going to try to think outside the box on what he can do to stop that elimination from taking place provided\nThe maintenance is not perfect\nOkay so if you use a higher grade paint like duration on the outside of a house it's you know here's a here's the ironic thing about this people the cost difference between a Sharon Williams super paint and duration which is their most expensive paints got heavy metals in it and man let me tell you something", "show_name": "Home Cents Live", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "13"}
