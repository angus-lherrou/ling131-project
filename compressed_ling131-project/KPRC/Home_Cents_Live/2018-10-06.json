{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "I was living in Boston at the time and and I had somebody actually came up to me and say why do you go [laughter] I chuckle Everytime I think about it he said why do you why do you leave Boston and go to\nA Puerto Rico in the wintertime and I looked at him and said have you ever spent a winter here in Boston and he was like well yeah and I'm like that's why when it gets really pretty cold here in the wintertime and I'm running from it\nAnd that's one of the things that that that the markets allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection and we've joked about it\nA few times Larry where back when I used to do that I wanted to go back and forth as I was down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big a TNT air card hanging out of the side of my laptop\nThat it was almost the same size as my laptop and even my satellite radio down there like it only worked for like ... it only worked for like eight am like noon 'cause that's when the satellite was over ... it was it was hilarious but where we are\nFrom a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know twelve years ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started and this\nAnd it's kind of a fun it's been a fun evolution to see but for everybody who is just getting started right now it's like it's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new traders I'm like my grandfather and I'm like oh when I went to school I had to walk uphill both ways and the snow you know we had dial up Internet and now it's just in the palm of your hand\nBut we have so much access to our money that really going in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge can really go a long way we don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the ... of our hand identify the price and we want to pay set the order and then wait for priced really come down to you\nIt it ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic\nYou say you know in my grandfather taught me this when I was like five years old I remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the price I'm going to pay and and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away\nAnd that's really how you approach the markets you say you know what I Want to buy this these these shares a stock but I Want to buy this price and if I Am for this price that's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy it a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional one of the things that can help you operate like a professional though is confidence\nConfidence can come from education and confidence can come from buildings skill a great place to start that is it the half the class we've got a few tickets left before the show's over and we're going to give some away as long as Larry says okay I think it's okay\nAll right [noise] right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area that have take classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to really live the life you want to live life on your own terms have that financial freedom but a lot of that just boils down to having the income to create that freedom\nNow just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over included with your passes it's going to be the professional insiders kit now this kitten\nI could lessons from some of our top instructors

kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when you get a call now and reserved those seats the number is\nEight eight eight six six to eight seven to three that dated eight six six to eight seven to three if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but hit us up at Houston oh TA dot com and see if you can score some passes there were some of the other kinds of examples you can share with our audience out there as far as times where where people have come in and they've they've got the ball rolling they've taken that initial first step and how it's gotten him to that point a financial freedom splits\nConsistency Ryan most people come in and they make that commitment it's really pretty simple you know you have to be willing to commit ... beat a point in your life when you're really wanted to make a change if you're somebody who's just kind of going from one thing to the next to the next you really never going to achieve what you want to do it's all about stepping back\nAsking yourself a simple question how's that life working for you\nIf you're not happy right now than you have to get yourself out of your comfort zone\nStart thinking there are better ways to do things but more importantly learn from people who already doing what you want to do I've heard my whole life you know going up at school that copying someone was bad well that's completely false you want to copy somebody\nWho's doing what you want to do and who are successful so you need to be able to have mentors you need to be able to have coaches you need to be able to be somebody who really is willing to make a change\nBecause people don't change in fact on Stein once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome\nThis is how most people live their lives they'd rather just continue to be miserable not do anything different when there's a whole opportunity right in front of them to go out there and as you said giving up a couple of hours of your life where you can be watching TV or doing something else it's more important to invest in yourself to invest in some TV show out there\nYeah and I remember seeing a as you were saying copying somebody being that the way you learn it it really is I I remember being in a in a class um you know ten Fifteen Years ago and I remember the instructor actually saying\nYou know if you want to be wealthy do what wealthy people do if you if you see somebody who is in the situation that you want to be in and if you follow them around all day long and you do the exact same things that they do eventually you will be in that same spot\nA and he brought up the the the the inverse sight of that too and he said\nIf you follow somebody around who is making terrible kind of financial decision somebody who maybe is a homeless person who's kind of lost everything and you do exactly what they do you know this is the same thing if you're copying that process you're going to end up in that situation and the same thing in the financial markets and it's one of the reasons why we teach\nOur students how they could identify what the financial institutions during one of the professionals doing what are the best people in the world\nDoing inside of these financial markets how can you identify that\nSo you can go in and just simply do what they do so that you can get what they got now one of the ways that where we start this off one of the best ways to do this has come out to a half day class invest three hours of your time she can see exactly what it takes to do that before we can do that I've only got what ten tickets left here we're at the end of the show is what that means\nAnd so one of the things is Larry can we give away these final time passed and let's get some people educated hadn't changed their lives All right well right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area and they have to classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes\nTo really live life on your own terms to be able to generate the income that you need to be able to do the things that you want to do\nNow in a second you're

professional insiders kit\nNow this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency and much much more the professional inside of it makes it so you can get started right now the ... century twenty when you get a call now and

Fox News crowds of protesters or on Capitol Hill as the Senate prepares for a final vote on Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination what makes today different is that most demonstrators will be kept outside and the only way for\n'em a good percentage of the look of your home is in your force\nWell every consumer has got a budget okay I don't care if you're a lawyer doctor or you're a carpenter you know everybody's got a budget nobody wants to install the floor\nAnd have to replace it in two or three years right that's correct so the challenge that we guys all these products look the same they just don't wear the same and what are some of the common failures that you see with cheaper type floors\nUm where it looks great the first day and then you start using it or you start cleaning it what are some of the typical failures you'll find in engineering in laminate\nYeah so um especially in the engineered I mean some of the common problems is deal am a nation and elimination happens when the glue layer\nIt's between um that hold the actual real would flooring onto the plywood backing break down and then you actually have that top layer of flooring start to peel off\nUm that is one of the most common um failures in award for for the engineered\nAnd that happens when you have cheaper products that you know there's not the quality control they're not using high quality glues are high quality equipment to manufacture and so that that glue breaks down um that's something uh I think probably a a more common one than the dilemma nation is just the actual quality of the finish\nAnd so if you have poor quality finished that you know get scratched up really easy wears off\nOn those are obviously going to affect the overall look of the floors and you know turn what might have been a beautiful for the first step foot down and then a couple of years on it's looking really warning tired\nAnd these are these are products that are touted as Fifteen twenty thirty year\nYeah and some of that can be a little bit the clients\nBecause a lot of times what a manufacturer does to get their warranty and the way that those those finished warranties work a lot of times is\nThe guarantee is that you won't wear through all of the finish layers down to the raw would kind of within that time does not guarantee anything against scratching or ...\nAnd so what ends up happening with a lot of these companies that say oh we've got a fifty or Seventy five year finished warranty\nIs they just cake finish on and so sometimes you can't even hardly see the wood because they put on this Milky you know Fifteen twenty layers of this finish and you're essentially just covering up what is the beautiful wood floors with this ... layer of thick plastic almost\nUm and then with the goal that they can say well we've got a fifty year finished well\nDoesn't really mean anything and ultimately it's taking away from you know the look and feel of the floor at and they can accomplish something similar if they use higher quality finishes\nYou know and not do you know fifty thousand layers of it\nWell you've got one product you've got one product manufactured that uh is is is shines in that in that field\nYeah and being able to apply those finishes and use a [noise] um the right finishing equipment it takes\nBoth of them know how some investment in in high quality products but then also in in high quality machinery and the truth is is that not every foreign manufacture takes the time or or the expense to do that\nAnd here's the thing that a from a building perspective that you learn you know all these people want to go buy products or bite on the Internet and get it delivered and have somebody come in and provide labor if you don't have a ... if you don't if you're not buying it installed\nBecause when you talk about warranties you what you're talking what you're really talking about is the reputation as a company that installed it and the reputation of the company's intent to back their install\nBecause that's the only way that the manufacturers going back their warranty is that it was installed by a professional that's certified by them that they can say okay well maybe it is a factory defect\nYeah and I'll tell you that I'm with most foreign manufacturers large and small if you buy their products on line over the Internet to save money they will stay on their websites that the factory warranties are voided by purchasing just by purchasing it on line\nThose factory warranties ... are no longer valid\nYou got to think about all of the dynamics that go into play you've got acclimated to the the materials before you install on\nThe the the suit ability of the surface that you're installing them on is it is it a you know a suitable environment or do we have high moisture problems there's a there's a ton of things that professional installation is gonna is going to interpret as to whether that product can be installed and then how it actually is installed\nYeah and that's that's exactly why that exists is because\nUm these foreign companies these manufacturers they're taking on a lot of liability by putting all these products out in the marketplace flooring as a a relatively high dollar purchase and so if they're going to back these products they want to know that they're being sold\nAnd service by authorized retail locations that have the training the knowledge the experience and and come back that up and that's why\nThey will only warranty those products when they are purchase through that retail channel that's authorized distributor of their product\nAlright armory forge you can find them all into armory for his dot com this is the fourth generation would foreign company and they do all services except carpet um but I Will tell you this when it comes to products today if you're gonna if you're going to install would\nAvoid sin and finish\nDo not try to do that in in him and go look at their website look at the finish is on these floors and tell me that you know you want to try to accomplish this in the field okay ended the probability is is very small that it can actually be accomplished in if it\nCan let's assume that it can the environment you're going to create to do this is going to destroy everything around it so we don't have to do the sand and finish in the field anymore unless you're re servicing an existing for\nToday you want predictability want the sex appeal\nHe wants to perfection that you see in cars and now in chemistry the only way you're going

builder they do work with a lot of contractors now here's the thing painters and trim guys will make you or they will break you okay\nThat is the end result and I'll and I'll tell you alec works in some of the houses are working and I'm telling you he will tell you I'm Crazy anal about finishes in with all these houses with no texture on the walls it it is it is insane you got to have a great

six day do [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI Would think why every [noise]\nWe're going to be talking about custom home design and building we've got Jesse and with the ... and we've got air and then with three D. home designs\nThe guys that make up a a really special pair in terms of services that I think are challenging the way that our traditional processes of design build services work and you know [noise]\nYou listen to a lot of shows and you hear a lot of rhetoric or the question is you're are you really communicating\nAnd you know I don't know that we are you know when consumers they they want to they they've got an idea they have a vision for a house right may they may even have a lot or may not have a lot\nThe problem is how they go at these transactions and I don't care if it's a remarkable or new construction if you do not have a plan if you don't have specificity there's no basis for the numbers and there's no way to know whether you're even remotely close to a budget right which every single consumer regardless of their wealth\nAre concerned about how much is this going to cost me do you do you find that to be true\nOh exactly I mean [noise] the first thing they want to know is how much they're going to cost ... for me to say that what is it we're going to build one of the details behind everything in the kitchen and the walls and the finishes and the trim what are those things and most people they don't they can't really answer that up front so they went on which was how much it costs\nRight and they want to know how much it cost in and how you build that I mean think about it\nIt it's it's not possible to build it if you don't have the appliances specified\nHow are you going to build the cabinet how are you going to set up the circuits in the dedicated loads that are required to support those things I mean how do you rough in the electrical ... it just compounding growing animal right yet people still want to run out by set of plans in bit out three builder where did that start\nYou know I tell you the [noise] the most interesting thing recently I've had a customer\nHe got a hold of some plans of the house he saw that he really liked what he he founded the arc that was the architect sold him some plans likes to some robbers rubber stamp plans he calls me up hey gonna give me quote [laughter] I'm like well okay now you just have engineered to the plans for no details but you want to quote\n[laughter] so I guess you get a fast forward as soon now we're still having multiple meetings now just to plenty of what is it you really want in this house right so what we did we actually\nTook his duty plans and we can ... three D. in our system year made him look at it at him walk through the house in a virtual tour of what he thinks he wants based on those plants news wait a second that's not really what I wanted if I had not seen you guys put it into three D. put me in the house I would've been building the wrong house\nExactly on there were all kinds of problems with it I mean there's a eight foot door going into a five foot tall cause it I mean I don't know how that's going to necessarily work but [laughter] I mean when you see in three D. you realize oh yeah that doesn't work at all but I'm not too deeply and you're looking down on that looks great that cause it right there is extra storage it's not really usable space\nYou know and and and the problem is is it the consumers they the the wake up and they say oh we're inspired we're going to build a house you know they've got a world wind of income or something happened as a life changing event or they've just wanted to do this ever since I got married or or or together\nSo what do they do they don't understand the building industry ... there's no there's no building one oh one here's this here's the instrument Geneva here's where you get him here's how you establish this process you knew your instincts are to go find somebody to draw you uh plan\nRight in right so that the person didn't want to do is get a plan\nAnd I've had countless people call me while I got this plan so where did you get on the Internet oh and I bought an Internet plan and that's what you want to build yeah where's my price so that the Guinness we start to how many how many people have you had bring you plans\nThat when you roll them out and you looked at him you know it's and and there's some very talented designers and architects that they're dumb purse or press in ... these are these are are they draw beautiful house plans\nBut you know I don't care if you're a doctor a lawyer you're making half million dollars a year three million dollars a year everybody's got a part of a point when you roll up the plans they're thinking hey you know we put everything in this house going to cost nine hundred\nI roll it out I'm looking at one point four million dollar house\nAnd when you when you tell them that's the ballpark what reaction do you get\n... you know most of them like whoa wait a second we want to think that we heard this thing I can do it for a certain amount of priced way less than that [noise]\nYeah ... only find somebody that will tell you they can do it again the problem is is it you're going to run out of money about two thirds of the way through this project\nWith a lot of times the architect of the one that's going to tell you you can do it for that amount of ... [noise] that amount of money but he's not going to be the one that building it\nWell he they don't build things they have no reference in the residential world the costs no concept whatsoever [noise] we've\nHad some customers where they they can't just what the plan that they already had an architect to told him\nThe budget for this house is ex\nAnd I said well have they given you a spreadsheet of all the details of what this houses no just told me it's like two hundred square foot\nI'm you know you're you're ... anybody that's going to go and building a home I'm telling you right now if you want to control budget if you want it to be something you'd see in a magazine [noise] then you better have picked chosen the builder that you're going to work with\nAnd that builder would advocate design build and a lot of detail before you get into the actual construction of the home because you're going to have a plan\nIf you're going to control costs and if you let the structure get out of hand there is not an you you can pull all the finishes out of that house and it won't put a dent in that budget\nYou got to have that that that budget up front that you really know with all the details and are we still kind of joke around I gave a guy a budget\nFor based on the plans and I worked on the one to shop around for pricing he took my spreadsheet or seven pages long deleted numbers in my name off of it and told them build other builders he filled the sin\n[laughter] they argued and arguing that are not at all and all that links they said they didn't want it that's not how they want to do business he says all under those you guys put it all the details and I want to do it but we had to play it but that's just the example\nAll I mean seven pages of line items on down to the door knob how many changes how many pools and the cabinets what what amount of what's your budget per square foot for every step of the steps ... also the flooring what foreign tiles everything's in there\nIt's you know until you actually get into a project that involves hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars you can not a it's not going to get better later\nYou're going to feel uncomfortable from the beginning because you have no clue what you're getting you just know you're spending a whole lot of money and the further you get into it they realize that the checks just keep getting bigger so if you don't get control of that based on the beginning you are definitely going to hate the end you think about when you take\nOr get a construction alone for a new house from the bank\nThere's no going back and getting more money right it it has to get a loan at the loans that banks will spread that those the numbers out across the board and they pay the builder when certain mountains are complete and the sun you let's say you you have to double your bags spends on cab tree among those things weren't old aren't out beforehand\nWell there is no more money for cat industry so you're cutting the owner has to cut a check right there on the spot as a change or\nOn the spot you increase your budget your captain budget fifty thousand is write me a check today\nYeah the rank the bank says no you have a loan you've been approved and this is Arlene and get the property is for a certain amount we're not going back or not adding more to it\nRight and and I'll tell you something else all of these changes incorporate time your your prolonging that you just added a a month to an end to that project and time is money time he learnt\nWasted our month going back and re designing chemistry because of something you didn't like it you realize you caught because it wasn't in the plants or in the budget well what's that month of delays add that up on all the answers you're paying for your your construction alone and you're not living there you live somewhere else where we're building it\nAaron here's another one uh you know the house has drawn into basically a generic standard and then when you started designing the kitchen you wanted to put that little wind fridge and there's no room\nThere there's no room for it you got to make it a little bit wider and that he regretted or shall we spent five hundred thousand million two million three ... and you're being told\nYou can't do it now that is the definition of insane okay it's custom anything's possible if you go at it the way you're supposed to go at it designed for what it's going to be don't throw some generic walls up get a cool looking elevation and then try to put everything in the box\nAnd that and that's what you see across the board I talked a lot of people in Houston you end up in the ... some guys don't somehow that ask me questions like well\n... what was should I've done ahead of time is a well a more detailed plan\nA more detailed budget [laughter] you didn't talk about the ... you bought the plans again another guy bought the plans off the Internet had a local guy do some tweaks to make it fit the local code ... then got some three bits from builders and the stardust project so that was halfway through all these things are popping up now think\nThink about what people don't understand is um you know they're looking through these magazines with all these houses right and you're trying to get some inspiration and some ideas a lot of those kitchens that you're seeing with those beautiful elevated Kevin has earned twelve and fourteen foot twenty some of them are in twenty foot\nEnvironment they're nine and ten foot houses right\nSo uh you've got one you've got that is an issue the other thing is you see this cool hood\nAnd you've got these little or no pull outs on each side of it every time you add to pull out\nYou're adding what six eight sixteen inches\nYou add some more styles ... feet to to the link to that those cabinets what'd you you do not realize so you know you're looking at a set of plans and all they have is basically a line that little pencil line drawn a door that that is that means nothing\nYou know and as of air was talking about earlier when to break with this system all these um suppliers appliances flooring and different types of finishes\nPictures they have a library of those actual specific fixtures so if you picked one and we had that in the library you see that actual fixture right there is a real thing in your stove your your refrigerator that the one you chose more more than likely we had that actual physical image and we put it in in in the three D. design right there\nBecause you mix it and you may say oh no that's that's not the one I Want maybe I Need to see in a different finish maybe I Need to see you know a a different style in general just not fitting I mean it it makes a huge difference being able to see it\nThat the the this is a paradigm shift in the construction industry because most of the people want us to build it so they can look at it and see if they like it now you got you guys have teamed up to address the design issues\nYou're going to design it on the fly in the first meeting no deposit they're going to see it\nAnd then they're going to be they're going to know you understand what they want right that that is a massive and value to the consumer today\n... there's no other way that that that I Know that they can go get that\nYou're not going to have an initial meeting and then they like traditionally architect me so that you take saying what you want rights notes down a month later 'cause ... first draft plans ... thousands of dollars\nHeadliner now he's going to want to you know on a down payment oh we're going to spend an hour when you absorbing what your you know taking some notes and said okay if you're ready to hire me or just go ahead and got me a check for you know several thousand bucks and I'll get I'll start working on premiums and we'll meet in a month\n[noise] ... how is your\nProcess different it's instantaneous I mean we made sure we go over the stuff while just who's talking to you about budget kind of scope of work I'm Out there measuring by the time I'm done measuring I'm ready to start actually showing you what your house can be\nBefore the

between Texas Austin\nOr or San Antonio eh no Austin in Dallas and then they went and ... from Houston to Dallas but it'll stop at Texas A M the er which is not all the way to Dallas\nWell it's

the beginning of the flu season again this year they set an estimated eighty thousand Americans died of flu last winter that's the highest death toll in the last four decades now\nIf you want to get political about an Obama was not mentioned even though he was kind of the president the onset of the last flu season that's been lapsed into Trump's first year anyway eighty thousand people died from the flu they say\nDo you know anybody that died from the flu no I don't know anybody that died from the flu I'm guessing nobody here knows anybody that died from the flu now you would think if eighty thousand Americans just fell out and ride from the\nSome of us would no one\nYeah and I don't even know anybody that got really sick quite a few people died from the flu vaccine wealthy they don't want to talk about that quite a few people got sick from the ... and then they discovered\nThat the flu vaccine was off and it didn't cover you for like two thirds of the flus that are out there huh [laughter] so the shock was kind of useless\nIt only covered for one third of the flu that were available for you to get\nWell I did some looking into this because it concerned me a great deal that's a large number eighty thousand and then I found out what that is is an estimate\nThe number of people that died in Puerto Rico after the hurricane that Trump was responsible for you I Believe that up for three hundred thousand over night it was an estimate in recent years the actual flu related deaths have ranged from about twelve thousand to maybe the high end of you know fifty fifty five thousand\nMaybe it's just somebody trying to start trouble there\nAre probably somebody from the company that makes the food that's yeah that's it they start the story this troubling news and then
