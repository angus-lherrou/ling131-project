to get them to calm down I guess in order to get them to come down and we just have to lose an election well I don't think we're going to be doing that anytime soon if you're just do it again I gave a host of reasons why the Democrats shot themselves in the ... next month\nWhen the November midterms come around they're not going to do that well I predict debate or loses by double digits and I think most people know that at this point\nThese polls always lean a little on the left\nSo if cruises had by nine the real numbers probably more like Eighteen they never call me the recall you guys say never call any of us are another thing we were discussing earlier was the need for a stronger border four thousand people\nSlowly approaching our southern most border right now among Mexico there in where are they now Guatemala and there's four thousand of them good more that's a lot of people\nWell there's a reason why we're concerned about four thousand people approaching the border and if you don't understand this\nTake a good look at the Democratic Republic of Congo it's a place over in Africa you ever heard of it it's a pretty big continent overseas and the world Health Organization announced the Congo's latest outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus is not considered\nA global emergency but it's definitely an emergency in their country and who are they boarded by Rwanda and one other country\nAnd people that we know that this was going to spread like wildfire it's heading into those countries very soon it's going to be a real problem so here's a look at the outbreak a hundred and eighty five confirmed cases a hundred and seven deaths since it was declared on August first it's a pretty short time ago did you guys you remember we ... a ball that come to America during the Obama era\nWhy do you think it has it made its way here yeah during the Trump era a ... you probably know the answer to this one\nOkay it's probably because Trump is a mail order an Ebola patients and having them delivered to the United states like Obama did\nSo why is this region being compared to a war zone World Cup of different reasons first of all there's multiple rebel groups over there in the Congo they've killed hundreds of people in recent years\nThey've had a tax and Benny which actually\nIs the center of Ebola containment area but\nRight now you know a hundred people get slaughtered by rebel groups a hundred people get slaughtered by Ebola what's worse tomato tomato would you rather would you rather vomit blood to death or or have some eleven year old child soldiers stab you with uh uh with with a ship while while he while he looks down at your corps in you bleed out to death\nSo there is some resistance this is the first time and he pulled outbreak has occurred in this part of the Congo\nAnd health workers are trying to explain the importance of safe burials in preventative measures to the people that live in that area here's the problem with people that live in that area\nThey don't get it there they don't understand they're not listening they don't trust the health professionals there actually is um there actually is a vaccine for Ebola and while it's not a hundred percent effective it works pretty well\nBut these government health care workers are walking around going hey everybody you live in a third world how you know this is what what how Trump's people describe it it's what you know one whole I mean this is exactly what kind of country that is says this is happening there walking up and going hey we got a solution here for you just got to take this vaccine do you want it\nYeah I don't want it now they don't want to be safe they don't want to be helped I don't know it's crazy by the way you know the fun thing about this Ebola is actually the is actually the Mexican word of the day to day\nMedium egos are you having trouble assimilating into the New America well then maybe what you need is the Mexican American word of the day\nToday is Mexican American word of the day is what is the Mexican American Translation of the worst of all what what's this lady Fernando to use it in a sentence the ball I mean he's not good at playing poker buddy bought out really good the sleepy Fernando Mexican American word of the day now maybe you won't be so stupid that they\nLive\nFor the past couple of months all people could talk about was Brett Kavanaugh now that he's on the Supreme Court people seem to forget that they were outraged about that pretty quickly outraged people have a Fifteen minute memory they don't remember that there are upset about something\nYou tell them you tell them something that upsets them they get really angry and then a squirrel runs by invade or works case a blind squirrel and they're they're just distracted by\nWell false allegations of rape are pretty serious problem we don't have any real statistics about how many people are falsely accused of rape because\nThey were falsely accused we don't know what we don't know but he was a story I wanted to share with all this just happened in Pittsburgh recently remember when the ... I Believe all women think about that as I tell you about this story there's a group of high school girls in Pittsburgh\nThey didn't like one of their male classmates group of girls didn't like one guy\nSo they claim that he sexually assaulted them what one of them know all of them he sexually assaulted all of them that seems that seems pretty ambitious for a claim your but okay so they escorted him out of school in shackles they cuffed him up charged him with crime he spent the entire summer wearing an ankle monitor stuck indoors\nJust what the girls are now admitting they made it up ... ... ...\nThat male student is now suing the Pennsylvania School district the girls admitted on tape they made up the assault story one of them actually said I just don't like him I Would do anything to get him expelled the false allegations were wife derailing for the accused\nWho by the way it is referred to as tee off in the lawsuit 'cause he's a kid he's a child these people are under age we don't know what their real names are\nHoping first started on October third back in twenty Seventeen one of the girls told other students AT T F a T I that's the boy's name had sexually assaulted her in a pool\nSo uh this is Pittsburgh area an echo valley guidance counselor overheard the accusations you know it was a school\nAnd reported it to the states child abuse prevention agency which I guess it's called child why I don't know if do we have anything like that in Texas I guess we probably do I don't know if it has the same name though this is a requirement by watch something that they have to do so\nGIF swiftly charged with indecent assault and harassment and receive six months or probation is part of a ... months passed by six months of probation\nThin in March twenty Eighteen ... again falsely accused they do they do to get a second time\nAccording to the lawsuit happened more than one another girl inviting them over to a house party a few days later she told the school guidance counselor that he had broken into her home and sexually assaulted her this kept happening and happening to the kid what when is enough enough\nFinally they get a tape they get an audio recording of these girls admitting that they made the whole thing but the whole thing just kind of ruined his life just could've kept him out of college I guess it doesn't matter and it didn't matter if they kept Brett Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court they didn't care it didn't matter at all just as much as they didn't care Brett Kavanaugh did it they didn't care if it had really happened\nTo Christine Blasey Ford 'cause they don't care about Christine Blasey Ford and they never did I'm kind of junior even listen to the pursuit of happiness radio get caught up on the podcast\nGot to keep your see radio dot com check out all the old episodes following me on Twitter at producer Ken I'm also on Facebook and on and on the Instagram that kind of left junior thanks so much for listening folks have a great day and don't forget we have an event coming up friday November second to\nHit me up on line if you want to attend meeting of the mines here at the radio station one PM friday November second they really have a great day\nIn the new the new\nYear when\nAll your review of your\n\n\nHumble on Wall street ...

I. S. ten NBC News there in South Carolina\nCajun Navy known for their response here in Houston for Hurricane Harvey\nKnown for their response to\nHurricane Michael ... was\nThe third most intense Atlantic hurricane\nStrong is on record for maximum sustained wind speeds the Cajun Navy rush there but this little feel good story is what caught my attention you know we've got a lot to talk about with the local\nHouston government's failure to appropriately respond to Hurricane Harvey even a year later\n[noise] we've got a lot of talk about a large ... global charities exploiting these isn't as the fundraising not returning the money to the community but they exploited\nWe have to talk about this new desire for many Americans including\nConservatives here in Houston who think that when there was a tragedy like this the the the government should come in and socializing and provide welfare to bell people up who decided not to buy the insurance and handle their own business and I thought who better to talk about this when Brian trash or\nThe spokesman for the United Cajun Navy Brian are you here with us or\nI Am here thanks for having me on today no thank you so much for being on where you from where were you involved with this story out of South Carolina\n[noise] uh no not South Carolina we uh our group deployed to North Carolina and after a Florence and are they just about a week ago a kind of handed a baton off to the locals in a redirected the assets down to uh right outside of Panama City Florida\nOkay okay and were you involved with the group that came here and did so much good here in Houston just over a year and a month ago here for Harvey\n[noise] so at the time of harm me I was not involved with a with the United States Navy but yeah these these guys were definitely some of the first two are organized and um and enroll out there to uh the Houston area you know the uh just kinda\nTaking care of our own is just kind of the the south Louisiana ways you know um\nEverybody remembers Katrina uh the city of Houston in particular but really the whole state of Texas just\nJust bent over backwards to do everything they could to help help us out in a bad bad favor you know an essay cage and all these players that shows he no matter what they were gonna they felt like they felt like we are Harvey hit that bill came in the mail it to absolutely had to pay so they they settled up and wrote\nThem and I'm a huge from actually went to high school in the heart of McCain deanna will turn ... Louisiana and then I went\nTo ... many times people are good\nPeople that's a good community I went from Austin, Texas at Fifteen to ... it was a little bit jarring at first but then I found out that there was nothing slower than cruising from Sacred Heart through the sonic to the Dairy Queen drinking Marguerite us with your friends\nUm that's right well that's probably about ... that they were actually speaking English\nYeah yeah oh no no I'll tell you I met a guy or member Donny quibble do I pronounce equivalency likes him everyone laughed at me and then I learned you know you gotta learn to even the the radio station was actually still in ... in in French until noon there and built by the late eighties\nBut what what role of you to get involved with these well what I find so attractive about them is these are guys that are directly helping like any money any contribution to them they're taking that money and they're directly helping people in the community that was hurt I haven't seen them in Houston we've seen\nHundreds of millions of dollars raised hundreds of millions billions of dollars in aid given to both Houston in Texas and I see people\nThat receive no benefit from it ever see I see the the government using a bureaucracy to pick and choose who they want to help and I think the whole system is broken\nWhat are your thoughts on that like the red cross or the government classically socializing the response\n[noise] [noise] yeah so you know first of all the uh the Cajun Navy or the cage and maybe I'm In an okay gee maybe group surely they keep telling people at FEMA like these people can view which means that has always wanted to do but we'll never be able to do and that's immediate response search and rescue\nA logistics distribution of immediate needs like a water ice a ...\nI'm a medical supplies um things like that dream of just there's no way for mobile as fast as\nYou know and it's not all you know we love to to bash on the government but to be honest that the the the liability\nIs different you know like with a with a private group like the Cajun Navy they they can they can afford to ask for forgiveness rather than permission for government screw something up is going to be held to pay but as far as how I got involved you know back when Hurricane Harvey hit\nBut actually out in California and uh I had been doing a lot of relationship building work for the administration down in a Cuba and they ... they they asked me to come on the show one American news talk about Cuba\nBut Hurricane Harvey was dominating the news and they knew that I I'd gone through Katrina personally so they asked me to be okay to switch topics to talk about hurricane\nAnd I said sure so we were talking about it with a lives wheeler over there at all in and I'm a kind of you know she had asked a question like what can people do to help and I just emit particularly\nChat you know well don't give you money to the right cause because you know they they they don't want the money doesn't make its way to the victim said you need to look at you know organizations like the Cajun Navy was going out there and boots on the ground and saving lives as we speak I said in there\nYou know going out there in their own dime leaving their own family and jobs go out there and and help their fellow man and\nThat some of them have put up white pay pal links and whatnot to try to raise money for\nCash like that on every better spent\nTheir well um when I got back home in New Orleans um apparently somebody at the right cross I got pissed off at CNN interview and they they had a representative locally Louisiana reach out to me and you know kind of tell me that they want it to me with me and educate me a little bit more about you know can\nRead about you know hug each is made up and you bought everything they sold you hook line and sinker right\nNow yeah of course you know but uh but anyway they they actually had already done some outreach with the Cajun Navy and they introduced me to cook I mean ... who's the founder of the United States Navy and um he basically was kind of tell me their story and\nI said listen I said you know you guys really need to start trying to proactively partner with some of these government agencies that you're not a hindrance kill him but it's harder to him and it's actually work on my take on as a pro bono client I'm going to help people and then uh we we got 'em formed up as a five oh one C. three ah organization\nNonprofit and and just recently started raising money 'cause you got our our five oh one C. three designation and and I wonder how I wanted to raise money without it\nYou know no no most certainly didn't want to be one people want the tax break if you want to know that there is over sites but if if you want to give money to the Cajun Navy where do you do\nShow the best way to do it um there's a few different ways that the best way to do is go to Facebook looked for United Cajun Navy they have their page is actually donate button right there on the page we just teamed up with a a company called a shirt quest F. E. R. E. S. T. dot com\nAnd they are a platform for nonprofits could not only coordinate their volunteers but as well as raise money and we just we just want steak so with our Facebook page has linked to our strict quest a page and uh you could donate there as well so you're a few different ways and\nOkay I'm doing something right [noise]\nOh you pull and pull on point June we stop pretending that there is something wrong with everything\nPrince charming\nIs about as much of a rapist\nIs Brett Kavanaugh by that I mean not at all\n\nI'm just tired right it just gets All right just at some point as Americans we have to stop we have to stop pretending that it's okay\nBut it's normal to tear down every single thing\n\nAnd you know what it's also not okay to do it's not okay to decry bigotry\nWhen you respond with bigotry\nI was looking at a book I like to read books that I disagree with just like I like to be friends with people I don't have it'd be a logical agreements with because I think diverse tea leaves the vibrancy\nBut I was looking at a book by Robin the angel low entitled white fragility Chris are you ... do you see kind of fragile your choice to you like the music we figure that out yesterday on the show um fragile\nUm\nYeah it could be wrong but this isn't the ... the fragility when I'm not speaking the word choice because of my job right now\nUm the the academic I'm educator Robert ... who is taught diversity training and cultural competency workshops for major corporations all across America she wrote this book about how white people respond poorly\nTo cultural competency education I Would call re education\nShe says there why people were insist they were taught to treat everyone the same but there are colorblind they don't care if you're a pink purple poke about it they'll point to friends and family members of color a history of civil rights activism or more salient positions\nIt she rejects all of this\nShe thinks that it makes them complicit in the white supremacy and the patriarchy\n\nShe argues are largely segregated society has set up to inflate whites from racial discomfort so they don't and that's why they fall to pieces of the first applications stress she wrote this entire book\nSpeaking holistically about white people and entire book insulting white people what our whole job is to explain why why people shouldn't insult other people\nI don't do this Charles Adams were back in a minute with Massachusetts GOP Kennedy Geoff Diehl mix on to talk about him and I'm starting to talk about ...\n[noise]\n\nYou know et cetera both wind and scary [laughter] both picked that perfect Halloween costume while you're giving\nTo help me with all those activities on the\nRadio on I already I\nKeep your sees you aren't really are going\nThe gallery furniture made in America\nWe are seeing\n\nIf but when I meet\n... Fox News that's what President Trump seems to be suggesting this latest comments about possible punishment for Saudi Arabia and the suspected killing of a journalist to constantly in Turkey Fox's Jared ... live at the White House\nThe Boston patrolman union which is never endorsed a Republican for a U.S Senate before and so she's really caused a lot of problems for herself with that but then\nUh putting out that video where she tried to show that she actually had a heritage that included Native Americans in her background\nNot only insulted the Cherokee Nation as we saw that also kissing felt that the intelligence of everybody who shot at the results prove that she actually has left heritage now in ... the average North American citizen so it really did not work out a way she expected in for her to try to blame anybody by herself is disingenuous\nWell I see I clearly said that this move because it didn't\nHurt her\nChances for twenty twenty I think it hurt her in the short term but I think and also hard a lot of all the members of the left because it shows the absurdity of it all\nYou know the attacks on Senator Cruz and his wife in Philly yo the attack on Senator Cruz at the airport the Ole Miss professor saying that GOP candidate should expect other finger stuck in their food is not enough to simply around some\nI think it's just all getting so ridiculous on the left in the right simply wants to have conversations about solutions and people can disagree about solutions but at least their conversations and I don't we're not hearing that in Elizabeth Center warn is just talking about nonsense\nAnd for us to I don't care\nI don't care if she lied which clearly she did and see I Know right like you I mean are you following this this lawsuit against Harvard for discriminating against Asian Americans dunes pending in the federal court in Boston right now so\nYeah so what's happened is because too many Asians have higher test scores and I guess the the target population they want 'em based on a racial mix tape and actually\nDiscriminating against Asian so you know again which which crazy that highway keeps getting themselves caught with the situation of um you know racial decision to be on the campus and in wine as part of that\nPhoto warns clearly part of it and they they had some testimony yesterday where the ... the gatekeeper the dean of decision making of admissions\nAdmitted that the target letters were sent to students of Native American Hispanic and African American descent and an eleven hundred SAT and sent to Asian males or the Thirteen Haiti SAT which is\nTo anyone that has kids or the diagnosis knows it's insane difference\nAnd clearly problematic and it's this whole culture where we want to\nCall\nEvery one on the right irrespective of of gender irrespective of race irrespective of orientation you want to call everyone that sucks\nIt's our president not seeing a racist and everyone on the left despite bigoted behavior caught rotated is a saint um we've got a minute left if you'd like to join us for a second segment I Love to have you but if you got time constraints are more them understand represent\nThem I'm happy to stay over and yeah just to just to finish your point there the whole idea of um basically you know I'm a equal opportunity for everybody I I Believe in as a Republican but when you have quota systems you know it really ends up falling flat and you know this is a perfect example of why\nWe're going back in the second we're continuing our conversation would represent a deal who's running against Senator Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts thank you all so much else stay tuned in [noise]\nIn is our peak envoys list\nPrice dealer probably still be happier if your car shopping you probably heard these terms on\nBlack do they mean it's so confusing well and was confusing not any more until you buy true price into car it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including season accessories and basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because it shows you what other people are paying for the [noise]\nMore Jimmy Barris now on TV are see nine fifty Rio Texas [noise] talk\nThis unfortunately is not Jimmy ... this is Charles Adams the host of the night shift right here on nine ... eleven PM every night and I am joined by Massachusetts\nRepresentative Geoff Diehl running against currently the United states Senator Elizabeth Warren the Massachusetts center not from Massachusetts and last segment we've touched on both the DNA debacle\nAnd we touched on what's going on with\nHarvard University is a federal lawsuit pending alleging they discriminated against Asian American students and it doesn't factor pure that they did but what I wanted to have him remain on the line do another segment with me was to touch on on two things that I think are important to talk about we watched\nAnd those who are here illegally committing crimes or near as an officer probably notice uh\nRight now it seems like the ... if a police officer uses the force that they all go to them to defend themselves or sort of seems around them they may be the ones on trial not the criminal they were going after I'm so again it's a bigger problem than just that was that one but I'm trying to do my time to get her out of the Senate\nRight it's I Will tell you I think it's brave to fight that fight there in Massachusetts in the heart of liberalism in America\nI think it's it's impressive um it's my understanding of the people that want to support you that your website is field for Senate dot com which is the I eat a jail for Senate dot com um is it in ...\nWith an F. L. I. S. H. F. L. washed and all that time if anybody wants to contribute even ten dollars that's going to help us runs in TV ads and make sure that we can do with one and I'll tell you I couldn't be more important now Elizabeth Warren ...\nNegative or law enforcement rhetoric beyond gesture of belief that presumption of innocence there's no longer a value in our society she also wants to a fully make health care nationalize that you know have government run health care I appreciate\nIt so much I mean the Saudis tried Christmas drama forces out this has been Jeff deal the day at a useless but the one thank you so much for calling we're going to be back with the Jimmy ... show and just a sec [noise]\nOh listen to Jimmy at work [noise] just say Alexa placate the R C a die hard radio now more than Jimmy beret show\n[noise]\nThis is in fact the Jimmy Barrett show but unfortunately [noise] Charles Adams big angry I'm filling in for Jimmy ... day\nYou can find me a big I rely on Twitter at big angry law on Instagram if you follow me I Will follow you back but more importantly all have conversations with you and I agree to disagree\nCivil ally ... and I will often disagree because I think I'm right about everything and rarely do is everyone agreed with me about those things one thing that I have often disagreed with\nWith many of my fellow he's donations\nIs my position on the government's responsibility to make people whole after a tragedy\nI'm speaking specifically to Harvey a I think we've got a responsibility to buy the appropriate insurance coverage for a homeowner and that if we don't then we're ... we are fighting the risk so to speak\nI think when a bureaucratic solutions come into play that the bureaucracy often pick and choose who they want to benefit I've got friends that lost everything that I've received nothing\nUm you know people can object creed disagree if you ... you know just really feel free to call in someone three two one two five nine five zero and tell me what a moron I Am\nBut see I think this whole thing where the government feels like it has to provide already of the government is is feeding us the nonsense that it has to provide the solution and we should expect there the government to rod solution is just the growth and the blow of the Dole state\nThe threat of that blowed getting larger happen to day of course coming out of California 'cause where else would this come out of US Senator Kamala Harris has introduced legislation\nThat would provide families making less a hundred thousand a year a monthly stipend to five hundred dollars a six thousand\nAnd families making fifty thousand less than fifty thousand a year could possibly receive a stipend of two hundred and fifty a month now that doesn't seem like a tremendous amount of money of course it would probably benefit\n[noise] those people making\nThey reduced wage than than Americans that make more than work harder\nAs a police officer if I didn't work extra jobs I'd be eligible for the low end of that the less than fifty thousand but I used to working extra twenty or thirty hours a week to make more money also went to school while as a policeman finished ... got my first law degree\nBut that's not the endgame for the Democrats being game for the Democrats\nIs instead\nA universal basic income there was a goal to create the perception that we as citizens cannot survive in this\nModern world of artificial intelligence and robots without\nLiving on the Dole and then of course is absolutely absurd the universal basic income is absolutely absurd the\nFact that we should all those of us that work should pay even more in taxes to support those choose not to or those that choose to be under employed\nIs insane\nThere is no liberty without economic liberty I have three jobs will partner into law firms partnering consulting business\nAnd then I come here and do the radio every night now to the radio as a passion I Love it I Love I Love talking to you I'm excited when I get to a lot when I get to fill in for Jimmy or anyone else\n\nBut I just love doing it it does add more to my plate it means I've got to do more work but synergistic ally kind of by osmosis that also creates more for me I don't advertise my businesses at all on the radio I'm not interested in general any business but I'd be dishonest if I said it didn't generate business\nThen again I'm here at talk about legal topics because I'm a ... a genius\nAnd of course it and people think well and the lawyer maybe I should call the genius off the radio\n\nBut I Do all this and work eighty hours every week despite the fact\nThat I have already made a good bit of money because I enjoy the concept of working I enjoy the concept of getting ahead I grew up without any money I mean I mean when I grow up with a single mom who worked you know in in you know went to public school and work my way through college you know and all kinds of jobs but when I was\nA pizza delivery guy\nI didn't expect that I had to make Fifteen dollars an hour as the pizza delivery guy I often made more than that\nBecause I was charming to the people I Would deliver pizza too and they would tip me but I Would deliver pizza long enough to get me a job as a bouncer and a bar back at a bar where I quickly fanatical by way into being a bartender where the real money was and I did that until I became a police officer\nBut it was always pushing the ball forward but what I wasn't ever doing\nWas that was never looking for the government to provide me a solution and the last new position is that the government should always provide a solution and sometimes\nRight coast science that they do and in the wake of hurricanes they do when it is something that they think will appeal to their voter base but I I think that's tremendous uh ...\nI think that\nUnless you are disabled and the concept of disability has become so bloated ridiculous in America\nBut at some point we're gonna have to have handicapped spaces that are just for people in wheelchairs resolve the jerks\nThey're driving up and jumping out and walking you tune in stiletto heels or cowboy boots other monster truck ballpark them handicapped space take all those spots up which is why we have twenty anti can't space everywhere because we're just building in the assumption that people without shame are going to park on them when they don't need the parking\n\nBut unless you're truly disabled not make believe I've got depression and dyslexia think I'm kidding the combination of those two things would qualify you for Social Security disability of America and bats in saying\n\nBody wants the government to find a solution and even the people on the rights supported if they think those people are their constituents the reality is the government shouldn't be providing", "show_name": "Jimmy Barrett", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "18"}
